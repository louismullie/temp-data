## Question

Cilostazol and QT interval

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cilostazol prolongs the QT interval and how to interpret its arrhythmic risk profile in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about cilostazol's pharmacology and whether its mechanism plausibly affects repolarization. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and pivotal trials say about QT effects. Next, I will check authoritative drug–QT databases and class-effect signals from other PDE3 inhibitors. After that, I need to examine indirect effects via heart rate and rate-correction formulas. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk assessment and monitoring plan, including special populations and drug–drug interactions, before stating a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanism. Cilostazol is a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP in platelets and vascular smooth muscle, producing vasodilation and antiplatelet effects. In the heart, PDE3 inhibition yields positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, which could indirectly influence repolarization dynamics, but this is not the same as direct hERG blockade that classically prolongs QT [^11352Ez5] [^112DQmRC].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling before drawing conclusions. The FDA prescribing information highlights tachycardia, palpitations, and tachyarrhythmias as adverse effects and contraindicates use in heart failure due to arrhythmic risk, but it does not list QT prolongation as a labeled adverse reaction or warning, which argues against a recognized direct QT-prolonging effect in routine clinical use [^11194nro] [^113wjxKR] [^111bRgvt].

> I should double-check the pivotal safety database. In eight phase 3 trials totaling 2,702 patients, serious cardiovascular events and mortality were similar between cilostazol and placebo, with no signal for torsades de pointes or QT-related events, and postmarketing surveillance likewise did not identify a QT prolongation signal, which supports the absence of a clinically meaningful direct QT effect in typical PAD populations [^115ckeEc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about class effects. Anagrelide, another oral PDE3 inhibitor, carries explicit QT warnings and is categorized as QT-prolonging. Some labels advise avoiding concomitant PDE3 inhibitors, which could imply a class signal, but this is not definitive proof that cilostazol itself prolongs QT, and cross-class extrapolation must be cautious [^115Uqsfb] [^112uHU8e] [^114Nhbrb].

> Let me consider indirect effects next. Cilostazol increases heart rate by about 5–7 bpm in a dose-proportional manner, and because Bazett's QTc formula overcorrects at higher heart rates, a spurious QTc prolongation can appear even when the absolute QT is unchanged; this is a measurement artifact rather than true repolarization delay, so I need to ensure rate-correction methods are appropriate before attributing a QT effect to the drug [^11352Ez5] [^1128qVhh] [^116d6ycq].

> I will now examine arrhythmic risk in heart failure, since that is where concern is greatest. The AHA advises cilostazol is contraindicated in heart failure due to presumed risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias within a month of initiation, but this is mechanistically tied to positive inotropy/chronotropy and ventricular ectopy rather than primary QT prolongation, reinforcing that the dominant signal is tachyarrhythmia, not torsades de pointes [^111bRgvt] [^1146BrU4].

> But wait, what if there are special repolarization syndromes where cilostazol alters arrhythmogenesis differently. Experimental and clinical reports suggest cilostazol can suppress phase 2 reentry and ventricular fibrillation in Brugada and early repolarization syndromes by restoring epicardial dome potential and reducing transmural dispersion, which is mechanistically antiarrhythmic in those substrates, though this is off-label and not generalizable to typical drug-induced QT prolongation risk [^116VBzm2] [^113hCrb2] [^1167ngt2].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions that could confound interpretation. Strong CYP3A inhibitors like erythromycin can increase cilostazol exposure and also independently prolong QT with other agents, so concomitant QT-prolonging drugs and CYP3A inhibitors can compound risk. In such combinations, any QT prolongation is more likely secondary to the interacting drug rather than a direct effect of cilostazol itself [^116EAwbo] [^115bAqsj].

> I need to ensure the practical risk assessment is clear. In patients with heart failure, significant LV dysfunction, or baseline QTc > 500 ms, cilostazol should be avoided. In general practice, if QTc is a concern, obtain a baseline ECG, avoid co-administration with known QT-prolonging agents when alternatives exist, correct electrolytes, and interpret any modest QTc increases in light of the expected 5–7 bpm heart rate rise and the limitations of rate-correction formulas, recognizing that true drug-induced QT prolongation has not been established for cilostazol [^111bRgvt] [^11352Ez5] [^1128qVhh].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Cilostazol does not have a recognized direct effect on QT interval prolongation in standard clinical use. Its arrhythmic risk relates to positive chronotropy/inotropy and is most relevant in heart failure, while apparent QTc changes are often rate-correction artifacts rather than true repolarization delay, so routine QT monitoring is not mandated solely for cilostazol in otherwise low-risk patients [^11194nro] [^115ckeEc] [^11352Ez5].

Cilostazol does not directly prolong the QT interval [^notfound] and is not associated with torsades de pointes [^notfound]. However, it can cause **tachycardia and palpitations** [^113wjxKR] that may indirectly affect QTc measurements [^1128qVhh]. Clinicians should monitor for arrhythmias in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs [^114jAiSn], but routine QT monitoring is not required for cilostazol alone [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism and cardiovascular effects

Cilostazol is a selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, producing **vasodilation and antiplatelet effects** [^11352Ez5]. It also has mild positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, which can increase heart rate by approximately 5–7 bpm [^11352Ez5]. These effects are clinically significant in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, particularly those with arrhythmias or heart failure [^111bRgvt].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding QT interval prolongation

Clinical trials and postmarketing data show no consistent evidence that cilostazol **significantly prolongs the QT interval** or increases the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) [^115ckeEc]. The most commonly reported cardiovascular adverse effects are tachycardia, palpitations, and tachyarrhythmias, which are likely related to its positive chronotropic effects rather than direct QT prolongation [^113wjxKR].

---

## Experimental and clinical studies

Experimental studies have explored cilostazol's effects on cardiac electrophysiology, particularly in the context of Brugada syndrome and other arrhythmogenic conditions [^116VBzm2]. These studies suggest that cilostazol may have antiarrhythmic properties in specific clinical scenarios, such as Brugada syndrome, by modulating ion channel currents and reducing arrhythmogenic potential [^113hCrb2]. However, these findings do not indicate a significant risk of **QT prolongation** or TdP in the general population [^notfound].

---

## Regulatory and clinical guidelines

Regulatory authorities and clinical guidelines do not currently recommend routine **QT interval monitoring** for patients receiving cilostazol [^notfound]. The primary caution is its contraindication in patients with heart failure due to the potential for exacerbating arrhythmias, which is related to its positive chronotropic and inotropic effects rather than direct QT prolongation [^111bRgvt] [^11352Ez5].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine QT monitoring**: Not recommended for patients receiving cilostazol alone [^notfound].
- **Patient selection**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias, heart failure, or those receiving concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval [^111bRgvt].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid concomitant use with other QT-prolonging medications when possible, and monitor patients closely if such combinations are necessary [^115BeZV3].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Study type** | **Findings regarding QT interval** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical trials | No significant QT prolongation or TdP reported | Routine QT monitoring not required |
| Experimental studies | Potential antiarrhythmic effects in specific conditions (e.g. Brugada syndrome) | No evidence of QT prolongation in general population |
| Regulatory guidelines | No specific QT monitoring recommendations | Caution advised in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or heart failure |

---

Cilostazol does not significantly prolong the QT interval or increase the risk of **torsades de pointes** [^notfound]. Its cardiovascular effects are primarily related to increased heart rate and contractility, and **routine QT monitoring is not required** [^11352Ez5]. Clinicians should exercise caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or those receiving concomitant **QT-prolonging medications** [^114jAiSn].

ADEs leading to treatment discontinuation

Meta-analysis of 13 trials (online supplemental data) revealed cilostazol increased the risk of ADEs leading to treatment discontinuation (RR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.59, p = 0.0006). There was high heterogeneity across studies (I² = 81%). In three studies, the safety population comprising all participants who consumed the drug was used in place of the ITT population.

Subgroup analysis of the antiplatelet treatments demonstrated high heterogeneity among different regiments (I² = 82.9%; χ²₃ = 17.58, p = 0.0005). The greatest statistically significant increase in relative risk occurred in the CIL+ASA/CLO versus ASA/CLO subgroup (n = 1936; RR = 5.59, 95% CI 3.04 to 10.27), followed by the CIL versus No CIL subgroup (n = 1067; RR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.16). There was no significant increase in ADEs leading to drug discontinuation in the CIL versus ASA and CIL+ASA versus ASA subgroup (n = 5476 and 1639, p = 0.11 and 0.10, respectively).

METHODS

Participants and study designs

The analysis dataset included triplicate 12‐lead ECGs and time‐matched upadacitinib plasma concentrations from healthy adult subjects who participated in two phase I clinical studies. A summary of the number of subjects included in the analysis by study and dosing regimen is provided in the Supplemental Table. The details of the studies have been previously reported. 23, 24 Study 1 included two substudies. Substudy 1 was a SAD substudy, which was designed as a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study in which healthy adult participants received a single oral dose of upadacitinib immediate‐release capsules (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, or 48 mg) or placebo in the morning after a 10‐h fast. 23 Substudy 2 was an evaluation of the effect of food and ketoconazole on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Substudy 2 was an open‐label, randomized, two‐sequence, crossover evaluation in which a single oral dose of 3 mg upadacitinib was administered on three different occasions: in the morning after a 10‐h overnight fast; 30 min after starting a high‐fat breakfast; and in the morning on Day 4 of a 6‐day regimen of once‐daily ketoconazole. 24 For all fasting regimens in Study 1, subjects fasted for an additional 4 h after the dose was administered. Data from Substudy 2 from the period in which subjects received ketoconazole were not included in the analysis to avoid any potential confounding effect on QTcF by ketoconazole.

Study 2 was designed as a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study in which healthy adult participants received twice‐daily doses of upadacitinib immediate‐release capsules (3, 6, 12, and 24 mg) or placebo for 13 days and once in the morning of Day 14. 23 Upadacitinib was administered ∼30 min after a standard breakfast or an evening snack. Study 2 also included a substudy in subjects with RA. This substudy was not included in the analysis to ensure homogeneity of the subjects being evaluated (all healthy subjects) and to avoid potential interference from concomitant medications. Both studies were conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards and all subjects provided written informed consent.

### Cardiac safety in clinical trials of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors [^117GSwhc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Those safe and effective agents were originally developed for their cardiovascular effects and were incidentally found to enhance erections. Since the introduction of the first PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in 1998, there has been concern about the effects of these agents on the heart and their safety in patients with cardiovascular disease. The concerns focused on the effects on blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac electrophysiology, and cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials. Since there are currently three PDE5 inhibitors, attention has been given to class effects as well as unique individual safety and adverse events. Since these drugs are mild vasodilators, all three have blood pressure-lowering effects. These effects are usually mild and produce few symptoms. When combined with the nitric oxide donor nitroglycerine, however, blood pressure drops may be profound and life threatening. All three agents are contraindicated with nitrates. Cardiac electrophysiology effects, especially as manifested by changes in the QT interval, have been studied. None of the three agents are dangerously associated with QTc prolongation, although vardenafil has a warning for patients at risk for QTc prolongation. In evaluating cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials, no signal to danger can be convincingly cited. Indeed, with the vasodilator effects of these drugs, many studies point to the improved exercise tolerance and coronary dilation in patients taking PDE5 inhibitors. PDE5 inhibitors are effective in treating ED, and their safety profile is excellent. There do not appear to be significant cardiovascular safety issues in the man with satisfactory cardiac and performance status.

### QT interval prolongation and arrhythmia: an unbreakable connection? [^113LVwCo]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

QT interval prolongation is incontrovertibly linked to increased risk of arrhythmias but, paradoxically, QT interval prolongation can also be an effective antiarrhythmic strategy and is in fact the goal of class III antiarrhythmic drugs. This discussion examines the cellular effects of QT interval prolongation and proposes that calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a specific cellular proarrhythmic signal that is activated downstream to QT interval prolongation. Inhibition of CaMKII can prevent cellular arrhythmia surrogates and in vivo arrhythmias linked to excessive action potential prolongation, suggesting that QT interval prolongation alone does not fully account for proarrhythmia. This reasoning points to the conclusion that QT interval modulation and prolongation not only grades cellular Ca2+ entry for cardiac contraction but also has the potential to recruit Ca2+-activated signalling molecules. CaMKII is one of these molecules and CaMKII activity is at least partially responsible for the proarrhythmic consequences of excessive QT interval prolongation.

Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events

Ten trials reported a composite outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (cilostazol 4470, control 4478). Cilostazol decreased major adverse cardiovascular events (OR = 0.66 [95% CI, 0.57–0.76]; P < 0.00001), without heterogeneity (Figure II in the). Most benefit occurred in trials testing long-term cilostazol starting 6 months or more after stroke, where summary ORs are < 1 regardless of whether cilostazol was compared with placebo or aspirin or of concomitant antiplatelet drug use.

Death

Eighteen trials reported death from any cause (cilostazol 5123, control 5742). Overall, cilostazol decreased the odds of death (OR = 0.64 [95% CI, 0.49–0.83]; P = 0.0009), Figure III in the, without heterogeneity. Most benefit occurred in trials randomizing patients late after diagnosis while trials randomizing soon after stroke were more equivocal.

Cognition

Two trials provided meta-analyzable results (cilostazol 29, control 27; Figure IV in the), but data were too sparse to draw conclusions. One trial (LACI-1) that could not be meta-analyzed reported a mean difference (adjusted for baseline) in Trail Making Test A of −4.0 (−12.7 to 4.7; P = 0.37).

Radiological Markers of SVD

Only 3 trials reported SVD imaging markers although each reported a different measure (silent infarcts, new ischemic lesion, microbleeds). Overall 55/557 participants allocated cilostazol developed an imaging lesion compared with 48/581 allocated control (OR = 1.22 [95% CI, 0.81–1.84]; P = 0.34).

Adverse Symptoms

The types of symptoms reported by each study varied (Table II in the). In general, patients allocated cilostazol had more headache, dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia and diarrhea, but less constipation and nonstroke bleeding events (Table 2; Figure V in the). There was no heterogeneity for the above outcomes apart from systemic bleeding and palpitations (palpitations I² = 54%, χ² = 19.43, P = 0.02; systemic bleeding I² = 69%, χ² = 25.6, P = 0.001).

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

Objective

To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

Study Selection

We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which 6 were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

Data Synthesis

Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed in patients who are about to begin taking a QT-prolonging medication. Although inadequate clinical studies preclude prediction of absolute risk for individual patients, particularly high-risk situations can be defined based on clinical variables. We propose recommendations on proper monitoring of the QT interval in patients receiving QT-prolonging medications.

Conclusion

Although the use of QT-prolonging medications can predispose to torsades de pointes, there is a relative paucity of information that can help clinicians and patients make optimal informed decisions about how best to minimize the risk of this serious complication.

### Analysis of the cilostazol safety database [^115ckeEc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Cilostazol, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was approved in the United States in 1999 for the reduction of the symptoms of intermittent claudication. This article summarizes the safety data from 8 cilostazol phase 3 controlled clinical trials, involving 2,702 patients: 1,374 receiving cilostazol, 973 assigned to placebo, and 355 taking pentoxifylline. The trials ranged from 12 to 24 weeks in duration. There were a total of 475 patient-exposure years on cilostazol, 357 patient-exposure years on placebo, and 135 patient-exposure years on pentoxifylline. Headache, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal complaints were seen more often in cilostazol-treated than placebo-treated patients; pharyngitis and nausea were more common in pentoxifylline-treated than placebo-treated patients. Headache requiring discontinuation occurred in 1.3% of patients taking cilostazol 50 mg bid and 3.7% of those receiving cilostazol 100 mg bid, compared with 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Discontinuations due to diarrhea, palpitations, or myocardial infarction were similar in cilostazol-, placebo-, and pentoxifylline-treated patients. The rate of serious cardiovascular events was similar in all 3 treatment groups. Myocardial infarction occurred in 1.0% of cilostazol-treated, 0.8% of placebo-treated, and 1.1% of pentoxifylline-treated patients. The incidence of stroke was 0.5% in both cilostazol- and placebo-treated patients and 1.1% in pentoxifylline-treated patients. Total cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality was 6.5% for cilostazol 100 mg bid, 6.3% for cilostazol 50 mg bid, and 7.7% for placebo. There were 16 deaths occurring in 0.6%, 0.5%, and 0.6% of cilostazol-, placebo-, and pentoxifylline-treated patients, respectively. The evaluations showed no trend toward increased cardiovascular morbidity or mortality risk in patients receiving cilostazol. In addition, postmarketing surveillance in the United States, representing 70,430 patient-years of cilostazol exposure, has shown minimal accounts of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The safety profile of cilostazol in doses of 50 mg bid and 100 mg bid appears to offer an acceptable risk-benefit ratio in patients with intermittent claudication.

### Albiglutide does not prolong QTc interval in healthy subjects: a thorough ECG study [^115iwdWe]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Albiglutide did not prolong QT intervals in this study. The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate and a QT correction factor is required to normalize changes in QT interval attributable to heart rate changes. It is currently acknowledged that Bazett's method for heart rate correction (QTcB) of the QT interval is inappropriate and the reporting of this interval is therefore no longer required in QT assessment studies (Q&A #11 in). The use of QT correction methods, such as QTcB and QTcF formulas, may also introduce errors in estimating drug-induced QT prolongation, secondary to changes in heart rate. Corrections for heart rate using individual subject data and correction factors have been developed and per the ICH guidance are preferred when sufficient QT interval measurements are available for each subject over a range of heart rates. The QTcI applies regression analysis techniques to individual subject pre-therapy QT and RR interval data over a range of heart rates and then applies this correction to on-treatment QT values. Both QTcF and QTcI theoretically correct the QT interval to that which would be observed at a heart rate of 1 cycle per second (60 bpm). In this study, an evaluation of QTcF and QTcI demonstrated that QTcI more appropriately removed the heart rate dependence of the corrected QT interval. The threshold of regulatory concern for a prolonged QT/QTc interval is around 5 ms with an upper bound of the 95% CI that excludes 10 ms. Albiglutide, after a single 30-mg dose and at steady-state concentrations (repeat doses of 50 mg albiglutide), met these criteria.

### Prevalence of QT prolongation and its risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aauHF]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study population, insulin treatment was higher among patients with QTc prolongation. A similar observation was found by Kobayashi et al. The influence of insulin on the QTc interval can be in many ways. Patients on insulin treatment are likely to be older with a longer duration of diabetes and uncontrolled diabetes. These factors are known to be associated with the prolongation of QTc. In addition, insulin is likely to cause QTc prolongation by altering the sympathetic activity and serum potassium concentration. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia can also cause a prolongation of QTc intervals. Despite being involved in multiple mechanisms, the use of insulin did not significantly increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation. We found loop diuretics as independent predictors of QTc prolongation. These drugs were reported to be predictors of QTc prolongation previously. Usually, loop diuretics do not cause QTc interval prolongation, and their effect on QTc prolongation was independent of electrolyte changes. But since the patients treated with loop diuretics were likely to have hypertension and cardiovascular disease, more patients treated with loop diuretics likely had QTc prolongation. Potassium-sparring diuretics were linked to QTc interval shortening, and it was dependent on the serum electrolytes levels. Our study population had only a few patients using potassium-sparing diuretics, and we excluded patients with abnormal serum potassium levels. Therefore, the results need to be interpreted cautiously. Intake of antiplatelet medications was seen higher in patients with prolonged QTc intervals. Aspirin and clopidogrel were the antiplatelet medications used by our study patients. These drugs are usually prescribed to patients with diabetes who have additional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases or as a secondary prevention strategy in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Our study population has significantly more patients having cardiovascular disease and prolonged QTc. Therefore, people with QTc prolongation are more likely to have had antiplatelet medications. In addition, clopidogrel is associated with prolongation of QTc interval. Since fewer patients were on clopidogrel in our study, its influence on the overall outcome is likely to be negligible.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome — QTc thresholds and medication precautions: The risk of adverse events increases with QTc > 500 ms, especially with long QT syndrome type 2. QT-prolonging medications (www.crediblemeds.org) should not be used in patients with long QT syndrome unless there is no suitable alternative; careful QTc monitoring is recommended with consideration for discontinuation if QTc is markedly prolonged. Concurrent use of stimulant or nonstimulant attention deficit/hyperactivity medications was associated with an increased risk of syncope/cardiac arrest in 1 study but not in another retrospective study, and episodes of torsades de pointes can be precipitated by QT-prolonging medication or hypokalemia induced by diuretics or gastrointestinal illnesses.

### The pharmacology of cilostazol [^112DQmRC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Cilostazol (6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone; OPC-13013) is a 2-oxo-quinoline derivative with antithrombotic, vasodilator, antimitogenic and cardiotonic properties. The compound is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3A, the isoform of PDE 3 in the cardiovascular system (IC₅₀: 0.2 µM). In addition, there is inhibition of adenosine uptake, eventually resulting in changes in cAMP levels, dependent on the type of adenosine receptors (A1 or A2). Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation and has considerable antithrombotic effects in vivo. The compound relaxes vascular smooth muscle and inhibits mitogenesis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. In the heart, cilostazol causes positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Most, if not all, of these actions are cAMP-mediated, including the modification of cAMP-controlled gene expression. Cilostazol decreases levels of serum triglycerides and causes some increase in HDL-cholesterol levels. The compound has a number of additional effects which might contribute to its overall clinical efficacy. Cilostazol undergoes intensive and finally complete hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 systems. This might result in some drug interaction, i.e. with erythromycin and omeprazole. The half-life is approximately 10 h, resulting in about 2-fold accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.

### Cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of milrinone and cilostazol to suppress arrhythmogenesis associated with Brugada syndrome [^116VBzm2]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome is an inherited disease associated with vulnerability to ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death in young adults. Milrinone and cilostazol, oral phosphodiesterase (PDE) type III inhibitors, have been shown to increase L-type calcium channel current (ICa) and modestly increase heart rate by elevating the level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

Objective

To examine the effectiveness of these PDE inhibitors to suppress arrhythmogenesis in an experimental model of Brugada syndrome.

Methods

Action potential (AP) and electrocardiographic recordings were obtained from epicardial and endocardial sites of coronary-perfused canine right ventricular wedge preparations. The Ito agonist NS5806 (5 μM) and Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (2 μM) were used to pharmacologically mimic Brugada phenotype.

Results

The combination induced all-or-none repolarization at some epicardial sites but not others, leading to ST-segment elevation as well as an increase in both epicardial and transmural dispersion of repolarization. Under these conditions, phase 2 reentry developed as the epicardial AP dome propagated from sites where it was maintained to sites at which it was lost, generating closely coupled extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia. The addition of the PDE inhibitor milrinone (2.5 μM) or cilostazol (5–10 μM) to the coronary perfusate restored the epicardial AP dome, reduced dispersion, and abolished phase 2 reentry-induced extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia.

Conclusions

Our study identifies milrinone as a more potent alternative to cilostazol for reversing the repolarization defects responsible for the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestations of Brugada syndrome. Both drugs normalize ST-segment elevation and suppress arrhythmogenesis in experimental models of Brugada syndrome.

### Cardiovascular efficacy of sitagliptin in patients with diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular disease: a 12-month follow-up [^1159WgFV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the QT interval is an important risk factor for ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. In the present study, the QT interval was significantly shortened from baseline to 12 months (P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in the QT interval after correction for the change in HR (QTc interval) (P = 0.093). The basic research by Lee et al. showed that sitagliptin treatment could reverse calcium regulation in cardiomyocytes, which might contribute to its shortening effects on the QT interval in hypertensive animals. In other research, sitagliptin was not associated with prolongation of either the QT or QTc interval at clinically relevant concentrations in healthy individuals. Although the shortening of the QT interval in this study was mainly associated with the increased HR, the QTc interval still showed a trend toward shortening after sitagliptin therapy (P = 0.093). Thus, it is possible that sitagliptin therapy might lower the risks of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death due to QT interval change, but further studies are clearly necessary to clarify whether benefits truly exist, particularly in patients with diabetes and comorbid CVD.

### Failure of cilostazol in the prevention of ventricular fibrillation in a patient with Brugada syndrome [^113kLB87]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

The ECG appearance in Brugada syndrome is caused by failure of the dome of the action potential to develop. Increased activity of the I(to) current in epicardial cells generates a transmural gradient with repolarization dispersion between the epicardium and the endocardium in the right ventricular wall, thus favoring the development of VF by a phase 2 reentry mechanism. The efficacy of cilostazol for the management of these arrhythmias has been reported. This drug is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with positive chronotropic properties, thus blocking outward potassium currents I(to) in the myocardial tissue. We present a patient with Brugada syndrome with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), who suffered multiple ICD discharges due to VF during therapy with this drug.

### Cardiovascular profile of pharmacological agents used for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115GenEz]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

PCOS and QT dispersion

The QT interval is the time during the cardiac cycle when ventricles are depolarizing and repolarizing. Prolongation of the QT interval arises from a dysfunction in the potassium channel responsible for the repolarization phase, therefore prolonging the duration of depolarization of the myocyte. This increase leads to the development of arrhythmias and syncope and may lead to sudden cardiac death.

Studies have reported the length of the QT interval in PCOS patients, though with contradictory results. One study compared 25 patients with PCOS to 22 control participants based on their testosterone and estradiol levels, as well as insulin levels, and correlated those levels with QT length and QT dispersion. There was an increased QT in patients with PCOS associated with increased testosterone levels. Conversely, others have reported that in 119 PCOS patients with a median age of 32 years compared with 64 control group participants, there was a decrease in the QT interval despite the increased levels of testosterone in patients with PCOS. This controversy has not been resolved by further studies on the length of the QT interval in patients with PCOS; however, animal studies have correlated a decrease in the QT interval with increased levels of testosterone. It remains to be seen whether the therapeutic reduction of testosterone may therefore impact on the QT interval. In addition, spironolactone could potentially cause hyperkalemia which, in turn, could cause QT shortening.

### Anagrelide [^115Uqsfb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.1 Drugs that Prolong QT

Avoid use of anagrelide in patients taking medications that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, and pimozide) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2 PDE3 Inhibitors

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. Avoid use of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.3 Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Co-administration of single-dose or repeat-dose anagrelide and aspirin showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Results from an observational study in patients with essential thrombocythemia suggest the rate of major hemorrhagic events (MHEs) in patients treated with anagrelide is higher than in those subjects treated with another cytoreductive treatment. The majority of the major hemorrhagic events occurred in patients who were also receiving concomitant anti-aggregatory treatment (primarily, aspirin). Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high-risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — sotalol dosing and safety: initial dose is 40–80 mg every 12 h, and patients initiated or reinitiated on sotalol should be in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a minimum of 3 d; it is contraindicated if the QTc interval is > 450 ms. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated before dosing; if CrCl > 60 mL/min, dose twice daily; if CrCl 40–60 mL/min, every 24 h; if CrCl < 40 mL/min, it should not be used. The maintenance dose is 160 mg every 12 h; during initiation and titration the QT interval should be checked 2–4 h after each dose and if QT interval prolongs to ≥ 500 ms, the dose must be reduced or the drug discontinued. Adverse effects include QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, bradycardia, and bronchospasm; precautions list prolonged QT, renal dysfunction, hypokalemia, diuretic therapy, avoiding other QT‑prolonging drugs, sinus or AV nodal dysfunction, decompensated systolic HF, cardiogenic shock, reactive airway disease, and drugs with SA and/or AV–nodal blocking properties.

### Efficacy and safety of adjunctive cilostazol to clopidogrel-treated diabetic patients with symptomatic lower extremity artery disease in the prevention of ischemic vascular events [^1153HJvR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The reduction of ischemic events induced by the addition of cilostazol to clopidogrel could be attributed to several actions expressed by cilostazol in addition to its antiplatelet‐antithrombotic effects. These include anti‐inflammatory, vasodilator, and antimitogenic effects as well as the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle proliferation after endothelial injury. 13, 14, 15

More important, the risk of overall bleeding, including severe or life‐threatening bleeding, with the combination of cilostazol with clopidogrel was similar to that observed in the clopidogrel monotherapy group. This finding is in accordance with previously published results of several studies, showing that cilostazol administration as monotherapy or as dual or even triple antiplatelet therapy does not increase bleeding compared with corresponding therapies that do not include cilostazol. 33, 34, 36

A limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of enrolled patients; however, the study has adequate power to avoid type II statistical errors. Α consequence of this limitation is that the lower numbers in the secondary efficacy outcomes of coronary restenosis and lower extremity arterial revascularization observed in the adjunctive cilostazol group, compared with the clopidogrel monotherapy group, did not reach statistical significance. Previous studies have demonstrated that adjunctive cilostazol to aspirin, clopidogrel, or both significantly reduces the above end points. 13, 14, 15, 38, 39 Therefore, it remains to be established whether in patients with T2DM, being at high risk for thrombotic events, treatment with cilostazol and clopidogrel would reduce the above clinical end points. The DORIC trial did not include a placebo group, and the patients' treatment was not blind; consequently, the trial investigators were aware of the study drug allocation. These are also limitations of the present study. We should point out that most of clinical studies of cilostazol involved population from East Asia, and this is mentioned as a limitation of these studies, even though there are no reports for differences in the pharmacokinetics of cilostazol among races. 40 The DORIC trial involved White patients, and this provides information on the potential effects of this drug in a non‐Asian population. The known early cilostazol adverse effects, such as tachycardia, palpitations, or headache, 41 which lead to drug discontinuation, were lower in our study compared with those reported in previous studies. 42 This could be caused by the fact that cilostazol treatment in our patients was started at a daily dose of 2×50 mg for 15 days and then increased at 2×100 mg/d. This observation accords with recently published results. 37

### Cellular mechanism underlying hypothermia-induced ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation in the setting of early repolarization and the protective effect of quinidine, cilostazol, and milrinone [^1167ngt2]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothermia has been reported to induce ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) in patients with early repolarization (ER) pattern. This study examines the cellular mechanisms underlying VT/VF associated with hypothermia in an experimental model of ER syndrome and examines the effectiveness of quinidine, cilostazol, and milrinone to prevent hypothermia-induced arrhythmias.

Methods and Results

Transmembrane action potentials were simultaneously recorded from 2 epicardial and 1 endocardial site of coronary-perfused canine left ventricular wedge preparations, together with a pseudo-ECG. A combination of NS5806 (3–10 μmol/L) and verapamil (1 μmol/L) was used to pharmacologically model the genetic mutations responsible for ER syndrome. Acetylcholine (3 μmol/L) was used to simulate increased parasympathetic tone, which is known to promote ER. In controls, lowering the temperature of the coronary perfusate to induce mild hypothermia (32°C-34°C) resulted in increased J-wave area on the ECG and accentuated epicardial action potential notch but no arrhythmic activity. In the setting of ER, hypothermia caused further accentuation of the epicardial action potential notch, leading to loss of the action potential dome at some sites but not others, thus creating the substrate for development of phase 2 reentry and VT/VF. Addition of the transient outward current antagonist quinidine (5 μmol/L) or the phosphodiesterase III inhibitors cilostazol (10 μmol/L) or milrinone (5 μmol/L) diminished the ER manifestations and prevented the hypothermia-induced phase 2 reentry and VT/VF.

Conclusions

Hypothermia leads to VT/VF in the setting of ER by exaggerating repolarization abnormalities, leading to development of phase 2 reentry. Quinidine, cilostazol, and milrinone suppress the hypothermia-induced VT/VF by reversing the repolarization abnormalities.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^111HaTXc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The association of certain triazole antifungal agents with prolongation of the cardiac QT interval 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 underscores the need to test cardiac effects of new agents in this class. Depolarizing currents mediated by hCav1.2 L‐type Ca 2+ channels were the most sensitive to inhibition by isavuconazole in vitro. The IC₅₀ values for hCav1.2 (6.567 μM), as well as for hNav1.5 Na + channels (0.36 μM [tonic] and 14.87 μM (phasic)), hERG, hKv4.3/KChiP2.2 (35.24 μM), and hKVLQT/hminK (24.02 μM) K + channels were all markedly higher than the nonprotein‐bound C max observed in vivo at the therapeutic dose of 200 mg. Nevertheless, the dose‐related shortening of the QT interval observed clinically in this study is consistent with the possibility of some inhibition of L‐type Ca 2+ channel currents by isavuconazole.

The effect on the late Na + current was not directly evaluated; however, isavuconazole, at high in vitro concentrations (20 μM), inhibited radioligand binding to the Na + channel site 2 by 78% (unpublished observations). While an effect on the late Na + current cannot be excluded, the high concentrations needed to affect Na + channel site 2 as well as the absence of an effect on the PR interval argues against clinically discernible effects of this current on the human ECG.

Irrespective of the underlying mechanism, this effect of isavuconazole on the QT interval did not appear to be associated with untoward cardiac effects at the therapeutic dose because cardiac‐related TEAEs that were observed in healthy subjects in the phase I trial (palpitations and tachycardia) occurred in those who received the supratherapeutic dose but not the therapeutic dose of isavuconazole. Although palpitations and tachycardia were observed at the therapeutic dose in small proportions of patients in the SECURE trial (less than 5% for each), an assessment of cardiac‐related TEAEs and Torsades de Pointes ‐specific TEAEs from the SECURE trial also did not reveal signals indicative of an increased risk of cardiac events with isavuconazole treatment due to QT shortening.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111bRgvt]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cilostazol — Used primarily for intermittent claudication, cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor believed to heighten the risk of fatal arrhythmias in patients with HF; this increased risk is presumed to occur within 1 month of initiation. It produces a dose-related increase in heart rate of 5 to 7 bpm and increases ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia regardless of dose. Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with HF of any severity.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Risks of tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. Risks of exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (5.2)
Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction has been reported in patients with sigmoid shaped interventricular septum (5.1)
Risks of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis-monitor platelets and white blood cell counts (5.3)
Avoid use in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding (5.4)

5.1 Tachycardia

Cilostazol may induce tachycardia, palpitation, tachyarrhythmia or hypotension. The increase in heart rate associated with cilostazol is approximately 5 to 7 bpm. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may be at risk for exacerbations of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction.

5.2 Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction

Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction has been reported in patients with sigmoid shaped interventricular septum. Monitor patients for the development of a new systolic murmur or cardiac symptoms after starting cilostazol.

5.3 Hematologic Adverse Reactions

Cases of thrombocytopenia or leukopenia progressing to agranulocytosis when cilostazol was not immediately discontinued have been reported. Agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of cilostazol. Monitor platelets and white blood cell counts periodically.

5.4 Hemostatic Disorders or Active Pathologic Bleeding

Cilostazol inhibits platelet aggregation in a reversible manner. Cilostazol has not been studied in patients with hemostatic disorders or active pathologic bleeding. Avoid use of cilostazol tablets in these patients.

### Efficacy of cilostazol on platelet reactivity and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116XBvub]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, exhibits antiplatelet effects by increasing cAMP within platelets, and is available as a generic drug. Our results show a significant benefit of TAPT with cilostazol in improving platelet reactivity indices in patients undergoing PCI, with lower PRU, greater platelet inhibition and a significant reduction in the risk of HTPR regardless of comparison with either standard-dose or high-dose clopidogrel. In addition, these results were seen even in comparison with DAPT using high-dose clopidogrel. Given that generic clopidogrel is now available, many clinicians opt to prescribe high-dose clopidogrel to address HTPR in patients who cannot afford newer antiplatelet agents. The results of the present study show that TAPT with cilostazol is superior even to DAPT with high-dose clopidogrel. Despite these promising results, a number of limitations must be acknowledged. Although platelet reactivity is a risk factor/surrogate marker for adverse CV events, clinical studies have not yet demonstrated that a pharmacological treatment strategy based on platelet reactivity improves outcomes. In the ARCTIC trial of 2440 patients randomised to platelet-function monitoring and drug adjustment group versus conventional strategy of no monitoring and drug adjustment, there were no differences in composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularisation at 1 year between the two groups, calling into question the utility of adjusting therapies based on platelet function monitoring.

### Potential interactions between cilostazol and probucol: a two-part, single-dose, open-label study in healthy Korean male volunteers [^116Kc5UL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Combined therapy with cilostazol, an antiplatelet agent, and probucol, an antihyperlipidemic agent, has been reported to prevent restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. However, the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between the 2 agents has not been evaluated.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of cilostazol and probucol administered alone and together in healthy Korean male volunteers.

Methods

This open-label study in healthy adult (age 20–40 years) male volunteers consisted of 2 parts. Part A had a 1-sequence, 2-period crossover design in which each subject received cilostazol 100 mg (1 tablet) in period 1 and cilostazol 100 mg (1 tablet) plus probucol 500 mg (2 tablets) in period 2. Part B had a parallel-group design in which one group received probucol 250 mg (1 tablet) and the other received probucol 250 mg (1 tablet) and cilostazol 100 mg (1 tablet). Geometric mean ratios for C(max) and AUC were compared by ANOVA, and pharmacokinetic parameters were also compared by t tests. Tolerability was evaluated based on adverse events, ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory test results.

Results

Twelve healthy volunteers completed part A; their mean age was 24.1 years (range, 21–29 years), mean height 171.8 cm (range, 163–177 cm), and mean weight 65.2 kg (range, 56.3–77.6 kg). Of the 20 healthy volunteers enrolled in part B, 19 completed the study; their mean age was 25.1 years (range, 21–34 years), mean height 173.2 cm (range, 162–183 cm), and mean weight 65.5 kg (54.0–78.0 kg). The pharmacokinetic parameters of cilostazol and probucol did not differ significantly when the 2 agents were administrated alone or together. In part A, the geometric mean ratios for C(max) and AUC(0–60h) between coadministration and single administration of cilostazol were 0.8882 (90% CI, 0.7873–1.002) and 1.013 (90% CI, 0.8643–1.188), respectively, for cilostazol; 0.8758 (90% CI, 0.7584–1.011) and 0.9785 (90% CI, 0.7600–1.260) for the OPC-13015 metabolite; and 0.8730 (90% CI, 0.7486–1.018) and 1.004 (90% CI, 0.8847–1.140) for the OPC-13213 metabolite. In part B, the geometric mean ratios for C(max) and AUC(0–648)h between coadministration and single administration of probucol were 1.134 (90% CI, 0.8177–1.572) and 1.070 (90% CI, 0.7364–1.555), respectively. Twenty-five adverse events were reported by 9 subjects in part A; the most frequently reported were headache (10 events) and nausea (4 events). Twenty adverse events were reported by 10 subjects in part B; the most frequently reported were headache (4 events) and productive cough (3 events). No clinically significant changes were noted in vital signs, ECGs, or laboratory values.

Conclusion

In these healthy Korean male volunteers, coadministration of single doses of cilostazol and probucol had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of either drug. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00549978.

### Prevention of ventricular fibrillation by cilostazol, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, in a patient with Brugada syndrome [^113hCrb2]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

We report the case of 67-year-old man with Brugada syndrome, in whom daily episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred every early morning for 4 days. The episodes of VF were completely prevented by an oral administration of cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. This effect was confirmed by the on-and-off challenge test, in which discontinuation of the drug resulted in recurrence of VF and resumption of the drug again prevented VF. This effect may be related to the suppression of I(to) secondary to the increase in heart rate and/or to an increase in Ca2+ current (I(Ca)) due to an elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP concentration via inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity. This drug might have an anti-VF potential in patients with Brugada syndrome.

Antiplatelet drug interruption and resumption — For aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel, and prasugrel, which irreversibly inhibit platelet function, 7 to 10 days (ie, platelet life span) of interruption is needed to restore platelet function, whereas for ticagrelor, which reversibly inhibits platelet function, at least 2 to 3 days of interruption is needed. After surgery, maximal antiplatelet effect occurs within minutes after ASA, within 2 hours after ticagrelor, 4 to 5 days after resuming clopidogrel, and after 3 days after resuming prasugrel, with a clopidogrel loading dose producing effect between 2 and 6 hours. Less commonly used reversible inhibitors include cilostazol, dipyridamole, and pentoxifylline with half-lives of 2 to 10 hours, and vorapaxar has a prolonged, 3- to 15-day antiplatelet effect. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have reversible antiplatelet properties with half-lives from 2 to 6 hours and approximately 20 hours depending on the agent.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^115YzL48]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The effects of isavuconazole (active moiety of isavuconazonium sulfate) on cardiac ion channels in vitro and cardiac repolarization clinically were assessed in a phase I, randomized, double-blind study in healthy individuals who received isavuconazole (after 2-day loading dose), at therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses daily for 11 days, moxifloxacin (400mg q.d.), or placebo. A post-hoc analysis of the phase III SECURE trial assessed effects on cardiac safety. L-type Ca 2+ channels were most sensitive to inhibition by isavuconazole. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for ion channels were higher than maximum serum concentrations of nonprotein-bound isavuconazole in vivo. In the phase I study (n = 161), isavuconazole shortened the QT interval in a dose- and plasma concentration-related manner. There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events; palpitations and tachycardia were observed in placebo and supratherapeutic isavuconazole groups; no cardiac safety signals were detected in the SECURE study (n = 257). Isavuconazole was associated with a shortened cardiac QT interval.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^113suJBX]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Drugs that cause TdP: incidence interpretation and prescribing guidance indicate uncertainty in attribution and emphasize individualized risk–benefit decisions. The proportion of sudden arrhythmic deaths that are due to TdP is unclear because few individuals are being monitored at the time of death, and when TdP occurs in outpatient settings first responders are likely to observe ventricular fibrillation, making it impossible to determine whether ventricular fibrillation was preceded by QT prolongation and then TdP. Use of a QT-prolonging drug must be based on risk-benefit analysis in individual patients, and where efficacy of alternatives is equivalent, the non–QT-prolonging agent should be preferred; where benefit clearly outweighs risk, QT prolongation should not limit necessary therapy. The only class of drugs for which reasonable TdP incidence data are available is the antiarrhythmic agents.

### Association of timing for starting dual antiplatelet treatment with cilostazol and recurrent stroke: a CSPS.com trial post hoc analysis [^111T3Y2m]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients Starting Trial Medication Between 29 and 180 Days After Stroke Onset

The median duration of follow-up was 1.4 years overall (IQR 0.5–2.2 years), resulting in 1,352.2 patient-years of follow-up. Ischemic stroke occurred in 9 patients (annualized rate 1.9%) on dual therapy and 31 (4.4%) on monotherapy (adjusted HR 0.27 [95% CI 0.12–0.63]) (Table 2 and Figure 2C). The incidence of ischemic stroke between patients on dual therapy and those on monotherapy was also different in the combined 29–180 days plus 15–28 days groups (15–180 days group, adjusted HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.18–0.65]) (Figure 2D). Any secondary efficacy outcomes other than death occurred less commonly in the 29–180 days patients on dual therapy than on monotherapy. Proportionality of the hazards in the multivariable models was not balanced regarding any stroke (p = 0.044; p values for the other outcomes are described in the footnote of Table 2). Severe or life-threatening bleeding occurred in 5 (1.1%) and 7 (1.6%), respectively (crude HR 0.78 [95% CI 0.25–2.45]; Table 3). All 12 events were intracranial hemorrhages.

Figure 3 demonstrates that the adjusted HR and 95% CI for the risk of ischemic stroke in the dual therapy group compared to the monotherapy group tended to be lowest when the trial medication was started 17 days after stroke onset. A composite of headache, palpitations, and tachycardia was seen in 22 patients (9.1%) assigned to dual therapy in the 8–14 days group, 10 (4.4%) in the 15–28 days group, and 45 (9.7%) in the 29–180 days group (p = 0.047).

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^113W5xda]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

For the in vitro studies, descriptive statistics were performed using Excel software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

For the phase I study, a sample size of 160 subjects (40 per treatment arm, targeting 38 of whom completed in each arm) was estimated to provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the difference in QTcF between isavuconazole and placebo, baseline adjusted, was > 10 ms, assessed using the upper limit of a one‐sided 95% CI. These calculations assumed a maximum treatment effect of 2 ms and a standard deviation of the difference of 14 ms. Study populations included the safety analysis set (all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication), the ECG analysis set (subjects who completed a least one time‐matched ECG extraction on Days −1 and 13) and the PK analysis set (all subjects in the safety analysis set whose PK data were adequate for calculation of at least one PK parameter). For ECG analyses, triplicate extractions from each of Days −1 and 13 were averaged at each timepoint. To evaluate the effect of isavuconazole on the QTcF interval at each timepoint, the change from baseline to Day 13 was assessed using analysis of covariance with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline QTcF as a covariate. A conclusion of no significant prolongation of the QTcF interval was reached if the upper bound of the two‐sided 90% CI (equivalent to the 95% CI of a one‐sided CI) was < 10 ms at all timepoints. Assay sensitivity was assessed within the same model at the nominal time closest to the median t max for moxifloxacin on Day 13, and was confirmed if the lower bound of the two‐sided 90% CI for the difference in least square means between moxifloxacin and placebo treatments, baseline adjusted, exceeded 5 ms, as per regulatory guidance. 31 Summaries of the percentage of subjects with absolute QTcF interval < 360 ms, < 330 ms, < 300 ms, > 450 ms, > 480 ms, and > 500 ms, as well as increases/decreases from baseline in QTcF > 30 ms and > 60 ms, were conducted to evaluate outliers.

### Association of timing for starting dual antiplatelet treatment with cilostazol and recurrent stroke: a CSPS.com trial post hoc analysis [^117D5mm6]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary efficacy outcomes except for any death were less common or marginally less common during dual therapy than monotherapy in both the 15–28 days and 29–180 days groups. Bleeding events were similarly common between dual therapy and monotherapy in any of the 3 groups divided by timing. A low risk of bleeding is a strength of cilostazol that enables safe long-term DAPT including cilostazol. The composite of headache, palpitations, and tachycardia was similarly common between the 8–14 days and 29–180 days groups and somewhat less common in the 15–28 days group. At least these events should be prevented regardless of the timing. The optional choice of cilostazol 100 mg once per day (half a regular dose) as an initial dose for 15 days adopted inseemed to decrease such early side effects.

The limitations ofwere described elsewhere, including the smaller number of enrolled patients than planned, relatively low occurrence of the primary efficacy endpoint, uncertainty of the generalizability of the findings to non-Japanese populations, and relatively frequent discontinuation of trial medication due to headache and palpitations, known early side effects of cilostazol. Because this was a subanalysis that divided the overall participants into 3 groups, efficacy endpoints and, in particular, safety endpoints in each group were even fewer, which might cause statistical bias. In addition, there were differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients among the 3 groups divided by timing, because timing was not randomized. This made the interpretation of intergroup differences in efficacy outcomes complicated. Finally, the present findings might not be generalizable to women given that only three-tenths enrolled were women.

Long-term DAPT using cilostazol was more effective for secondary prevention of noncardioembolic stroke than monotherapy in high-risk patients who started the medication 15 days or later after stroke onset without increasing hemorrhage risk. The finding suggests the feasibility of a seamless DAPT strategy after stroke, switching from ASA+CLO in the acute to subacute stage to CLZ+ASA or CLZ+CLO at 15 days or later. Clinical studies to prove this strategy are needed.

### Ionic basis of pharmacological therapy in Brugada syndrome [^1145J5tS]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is considered the only effective therapy to terminate ventricular arrhythmias in symptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome. However, it does not prevent future arrhythmic episodes. Only antiarrhythmic drug therapy can prevent them. There have been several reports of a beneficial effect of oral quinidine in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Other possible beneficial oral agents could be I(to) blockers. Intravenous isoproterenol has been reported to be especially useful in abolishing arrhythmic storms in emergency situations. Also, isolated case reports on the usefulness of cilostazol, sotalol, and mexiletine have been described. The present article reviews the mechanisms by which these drugs may act and their possible role in the pharmacotherapy of this disease.

The model is as follows: ΔQTc = α + β*(plasma concentration) + γ*(subject effect), where Δ is the change from baseline (calculated as a time-match difference), α is the intercept, β is the slope of the plasma concentration, and γ is the subject random effects parameter. If the p value of the slope for plasma concentration (β in the above model) is less than 0.05, then a linear effect of ∆QTc would be declared.

ICH E14 Guideline principles

The threshold of regulatory concern for QT/QTc interval prolongation is considered to be around 5 ms. This is the basis for the choice of moxifloxacin as the positive control, as it is known to have an effect on QT/QTc of around the threshold value. A negative "thorough QT/QTc study" is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. This definition is chosen to provide a reasonable assurance that the mean effect on the QT/QTc interval is not greater than around 5 ms.

### Drug-induced proarrhythmia and use of QTc-prolonging agents: clues for clinicians [^115SpkAn]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Use of drugs with the potential for prolongation of the QTc interval and proarrhythmia is a growing challenge facing clinicians. Many pharmaceutical agents have been denied approval for human use, approved with restrictions and warnings regarding proarrhythmia, or withdrawn from the market based upon arrhythmic risk. Despite known risk factors for QTc prolongation and drug-induced arrhythmia, precise prediction of the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in an individual patient remains difficult. The mechanism of drug-induced TdP typically involves use of an agent that blocks the I(Kr) cardiac potassium current, often in combination with risk-amplifying factors such as high drug levels, reduced drug metabolism, polypharmacy, and patient-specific factors such as gender, age, and genetic polymorphism. For the clinician, an integrated approach involving appreciation of the risk factors for proarrhythmia combined with computer-based risk assessment is the best method for reducing the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia in clinical practice.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

QT interval — measurement caveats, prognostic value, and drug-induced thresholds: Measurement of the QT interval can be complicated by QRS prolongation and by the need to correct for heart rate, yet prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) has been associated with mortality in several population studies, and in congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) the length of the QT interval is a major predictor of risk of cardiac events including sudden cardiac death. When initiating QT-prolonging drugs such as sotalol or dofetilide, a QT interval of 500 ms or higher should prompt reduction or discontinuation of the offending drug(s).

### Cilostazol combined with P2Yreceptor inhibitors: a substitute antiplatelet regimen for aspirin-intolerant patients undergoing percutaneous coronary stent implantation [^112NLRxL]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cilostazol combined with P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor has been used as a substitute regimen for aspirin‐intolerant patients undergoing percutaneous coronary stent implantation on a small scale. Its exact impact on platelet functions and clinical benefits of aspirin‐intolerant patients is unknown.

Hypothesis

Cilostazol combined with P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors could be used as a substitute antiplatelet regimen for aspirin‐intolerant patients undergoing percutaneous coronary stent implantation.

Methods

In this multicenter prospective cohort trial, patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary stent implantation were assigned to the cilostazol group (cilostazol plus P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors), based on aspirin intolerance criteria, or the aspirin group (aspirin plus P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors). Platelet PAC‐1, CD62p, and vasodilator‐stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation (VASP‐P) were detected by flow cytometry. The primary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) including all‐cause death, acute myocardial infarction, emerging arrhythmia, nonfatal stroke, and heart failure. The secondary endpoints were the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding events.

Results

One hundred and fifty‐four aspirin‐intolerant percutaneous coronary stent implantation patients and 154 matched aspirin‐tolerant patients from a total of 2059 percutaneous coronary stent implantation patients were enrolled. The relative activation level of PAC‐1, CD62p, and platelet reaction index reflected by the VASP‐P test were similar in the two groups (p > .05). After 12 months of follow‐up, the incidence of all‐cause death was 1.9% in the cilostazol group and 1.3% in the aspirin group (risk ratio [RR], 1.500; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.254–8.852; p = 1.000); the incidence of acute myocardial infarction was 0.6% in the cilostazol group and 1.3% in the aspirin group (RR, 0.500; 95% CI, 0.046–5.457; p = 1.000). No significant difference was seen in other MACCE events, or in any types of BARC bleeding events.

Conclusions

Cilostazol combined with P2Y 12 inhibitors was not inferior to aspirin‐based standard therapy and could be used as a reasonable substitute antiplatelet regimen for aspirin‐intolerant patients undergoing percutaneous coronary stent implantation, but again with limitations, which required a larger sample and longer follow‐up to confirm its efficacy.

### The impact of QT-Prolonging medications and drug-drug interactions on QTc interval prolongation in hospitalized patients: a case-crossover study [^115BeZV3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Researchers have studied potential corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation from drug-drug interactions (DDIs), raising unresolved questions about their real-world impact. This retrospective case-crossover study investigated the effects of QT-prolonging drugs and DDIs on QTc prolongation in hospitalized patients aged 45years and above. The cohort comprised patients who had multiple hospitalizations and developed QTc prolongation (QTc > 500ms or an increase of > 60ms from baseline) at least 24hours after admission between 2011 and 2019. Conditional logistic regression compared drug exposure between hospitalizations with QTc prolongation (case window) and those without (reference window). Among 2,276 patients (mean age 71; 43.8% female), the use of QT-prolonging drugs significantly increased the risk of QTc prolongation (odds ratio: 2.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.95–3.02)). The risk was higher with drugs of "known risks" (OR: 3.78 (2.91–4.90)) and "conditional risk" (OR: 2.08 (1.65–2.62)). DDIs, particularly involving multiple "known risk" drugs (OR: 7.86 (4.96–12.45)), strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors (OR: 5.57 (2.75–11.30)), or the concurrent use of ≥ 4 QT-prolonging drugs with any risk (OR: 5.28 (3.96–7.03)) substantially increased the risk. Cautious prescribing for patients with multiple risk factors is important to minimize the likelihood of QTc prolongation. However, when considering enhanced monitoring or drug choices, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the overall risk of QT prolongation against the benefits of treatment to ensure optimal patient care.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^116iNL1Z]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The effects of isavuconazole (active moiety of isavuconazonium sulfate) on cardiac ion channels in vitro and cardiac repolarization clinically were assessed in a phase I, randomized, double‐blind study in healthy individuals who received isavuconazole (after 2‐day loading dose), at therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses daily for 11 days, moxifloxacin (400 mg q.d.), or placebo. A post‐hoc analysis of the phase III SECURE trial assessed effects on cardiac safety. L‐type Ca 2+ channels were most sensitive to inhibition by isavuconazole. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for ion channels were higher than maximum serum concentrations of nonprotein‐bound isavuconazole in vivo. In the phase I study (n = 161), isavuconazole shortened the QT interval in a dose‐ and plasma concentration‐related manner. There were no serious treatment‐emergent adverse events; palpitations and tachycardia were observed in placebo and supratherapeutic isavuconazole groups; no cardiac safety signals were detected in the SECURE study (n = 257). Isavuconazole was associated with a shortened cardiac QT interval.

Safety outcomes

TAPT was associated with a numerically increased risk of major (IRR = 1.24; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.92) (figure 4 A), minor (IRR = 1.37; 95% CI 0.88 to 2.14) (figure 4 B), or any bleeding (IRR = 1.26; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61) (figure 4 C) compared with DAPT, although these were not statistically significant. TAPT was also associated with a 59% increase in drug discontinuation due to adverse events (IRR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.32 to 1.91) (figure 4 D) when compared with DAPT. The most commonly listed causes for drug discontinuation were headache, skin rash and palpitations/tachycardia. There was no-to-modest (for drug discontinuation outcomes) heterogeneity in all of the above analyses and no evidence for significant publication bias.

### Cilostazol: treatment of intermittent claudication [^111UqXeo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology and clinical utility of cilostazol, an antiplatelet and vasodilator agent approved for the management of intermittent claudication.

Data Sources

Primary literature on cilostazol was identified from a comprehensive MEDLINE literature search (1980-February 2000). Selected meeting abstracts and manufacturer literature were also used as source material. Indexing terms included cilostazol, intermittent claudication, platelet inhibitors, and restenosis.

Study Selection

Human clinical, pharmacokinetic and randomized comparative trials performed in the US and Asia were reviewed. Selected in vitro, ex vivo, and animal studies were evaluated when human data were not available.

Data Synthesis

Intermittent claudication, defined as reproducible discomfort of a muscle group induced by exercise and relieved by rest, is the most common clinical manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Cilostazol, a specific inhibitor of cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase in platelets and vascular smooth-muscle cells, is a potent antiplatelet agent and vasodilator that reduces vascular proliferation and has lipid-lowering effects in vivo. Recent multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have led to approval of cilostazol by the Food and Drug Administration for relief of intermittent claudication in patients with stable PAD. Cilostazol doubled walking distances and improved quality of life compared with placebo in these studies. One trial found that cilostazol was more effective than pentoxifylline, the only alternative pharmacologic therapy for claudication. Although frequent (approximately 50%) minor adverse effects, including headache, diarrhea, and palpitations, may occur in clinical practice, cilostazol has not been associated with major adverse events or increased mortality. Small, nonblind studies suggest that cilostazol may prove useful in preventing thrombosis and restenosis following percutaneous coronary interventions, although these remain unlabeled uses.

Conclusions

The unique combination of antiplatelet, vasodilatory, and antiproliferative effects of cilostazol appear to make it an attractive agent for use in patients with PAD. Clinical trials demonstrating a significant improvement in walking distances with cilostazol therapy suggest that it will be an important tool in improving symptoms and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^1152L13i]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The model was fitted using individual concentration and baseline‐adjusted QTc (dQTc) pairs. Based on this relationship, predicted mean dQTcF values (90% CI) at the mean C max for the 200‐mg and 600‐mg doses were −11.19 (–13.01, −9.37) ms and −17.68 (−20.54, −14.82) ms, respectively. Goodness of fit was based on the dQTc model as described previously. 20, 21 The residual plots against dQTcF and time are presented in Supplementary Figure 1.

The safety analysis set comprised 160 subjects (placebo, n = 40; isavuconazole 200 mg, n = 41; isavuconazole 600 mg, n = 39; moxifloxacin, n = 40). Overall, more TEAEs were reported for the isavuconazole 600‐mg group compared with the placebo, isavuconazole 200 mg, and moxifloxacin groups (Supplementary Table 4). There were no serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, or deaths. Many of the more frequently reported TEAEs (e.g. headache, dizziness, and paresthesia) were observed in approximately equal proportions of the placebo group and the isavuconazole 200‐mg group. However, more subjects in the isavuconazole 600‐mg group than in the isavuconazole 200‐mg and placebo groups experienced headache, hot flush, nausea, dizziness, paresthesia, anxiety, dry mouth, disturbance in attention, dysgeusia, palpitations, and oral hypoesthesia. TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in seven subjects in the isavuconazole 600‐mg group. TEAEs in the system organ class "Cardiac disorders" were only reported in the placebo and isavuconazole 600‐mg groups, and included palpitations (placebo, n = 1 (2.5%); isavuconazole 600 mg, n = 4 (10.3%)) and tachycardia (isavuconazole 600 mg, n = 2 (5.1%)). Concurrent ECGs performed in five of those six patients were either normal (n = 3) or abnormal but not clinically significant (n = 2). A summary of ECG abnormalities is provided in Supplementary Table 5. One subject who experienced a Cardiac disorder TEAE in the isavuconazole 600‐mg group discontinued because of palpitations. No important differences were found for changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values, and no clinically relevant changes from baseline were found for any vital signs. At 3 h postdose, an increase of 2 beats per minute (bpm) in the heart rate relative to placebo was seen for the 200‐mg dose and an increase of the same magnitude was seen for moxifloxacin. At 3 h postdose, a 6 bpm increase in heart rate was seen for the 600‐mg dose. The change in ventricular heart rate is summarized in Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Figure 2. Compared with placebo, PR was shortened by 6 ms at the 200‐mg dose and by 12 ms at the 600‐mg dose of isavuconazole. A very small and nonsignificant shortening of QRS was seen. The statistical assessments for PR and QRS intervals are provided in Supplementary Table 7. Plots of PR and QRS over the dosing interval and a statistical analysis at the PK t max for the two doses of isavuconazole are provided in Supplementary Figure 3.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^115jkwTu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (all treatments except moxifloxacin were double‐blinded), as follows:
Oral isavuconazole 200 mg (in capsules containing isavuconazonium sulfate 186 mg, each equivalent to isavuconazole 100 mg; hereafter, only the isavuconazole equivalent is used) 3 times daily (t.i.d.) on Days 1 and 2, then 200 mg once daily (q.d.) on Days 3–13.
Oral isavuconazole (200 mg) t.i.d. on Days 1 and 2, then 600 mg q.d. on Days 3–13.
Oral placebo t.i.d. on Days 1 and 2, then oral placebo q.d. on Days 3–13.
Oral placebo t.i.d. on Days 1 and 2, then oral placebo q.d. on Days 3–12, followed by oral moxifloxacin 400 mg (an established hERG channel inhibitor commonly used as a positive control for QT prolongation 29) on Day 13.

The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of near steady‐state plasma concentrations of isavuconazole (assessed following Day 13 dose) on cardiac repolarization. Continuous 12‐lead ECGs were recorded for ∼24 h on Day −2 (to familiarize the subjects with the study procedure; not analyzed), Day −1 (baseline), and on Day 13 starting ∼1 h before the planned dose. The ECG parameters collected and analyzed included ventricular heart rate, QT interval, PR interval, QRS duration, RR interval, and QTcF (QT/RR 1/3).

Secondary objectives included evaluation of PK as well as safety and tolerability of isavuconazole in healthy adult subjects. Isavuconazole and moxifloxacin PK parameters (C max, t max, 24‐h area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC 24), trough plasma concentration (C trough; isavuconazole only)) were assessed. Blood samples for determining plasma isavuconazole concentrations were collected on Days 11 and 12 within 15 min prior to dosing, and on Day 13 at predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 20, and 24 h postdose. Blood samples for determination of plasma moxifloxacin concentrations were collected on Day 13 predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 20, and 24 h postdose.

After nearly 3 decades of regulatory activity concerning new drugs' potential for delayed cardiac repolarization an integrated risk assessment paradigm for small molecule drugs has been established. Regulatory guidance also suggests that for large, targeted proteins and monoclonal antibodies no quantitative clinical QTc assessment is necessary. The expansion of new drug modalities prompts the question: "Should these new modalities be treated like small molecule drugs or like monoclonal antibodies?"

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^115KZLbd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Although concerns about the potential cardiac risk associated with drug‐induced shortening of the QT interval have been expressed, 11 neither the actual risk nor the mechanism of QT shortening by isavuconazole are clear. Congenital short QT syndrome (SQTS) is associated with mutations in ion channels, including K +, Ca 2+, and Na + channels, 22 and like congenital LQTS, marked QT interval shortening is associated with arrhythmogenic potential and an elevated risk for sudden cardiac death. 22 However, some population‐based studies have found no evidence of increased cardiac risk in rare individuals with congenital short QTc interval. 23, 24, 25

The arrhythmogenic potential of a given drug may be related to its net effect on several ion channels. Unlike drug‐induced QT interval prolongation, it is not clear whether there is an increased cardiac risk associated with drug‐induced QT shortening. For example, some antiepileptic drugs have been found to shorten the QT interval, 26, 27, 28 but the associated cardiac risk is obscured both by the already elevated risk of sudden death in epileptic patients and by the potential for misdiagnosis of tachyarrhythmia as seizure activity. 11 Finally, there is no consensus for a threshold beyond which QT shortening confers cardiac risk. Therefore, the absence of cardiac safety signals in these studies may indicate that the extent of shortening was not sufficient to elevate cardiac risk to detectable levels.

Notwithstanding the lack of any obvious cardiac risk associated with isavuconazole in studies performed to date, it is important that appropriate precautions be taken. Isavuconazole is contraindicated for patients with familial SQTS 12 and due consideration should also be taken before prescribing isavuconazole with medication known to shorten the QT interval.

This analysis has some limitations. The phase I study enrolled only healthy subjects and risk factors for cardiac abnormalities were among the exclusion criteria in the phase III study. 15 Therefore, it is not clear that the lack of cardiac safety signals in the clinical studies can be generalized to a real‐world population of patients who would be candidates for treatment with isavuconazole.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that isavuconazole shortens the cardiac QT interval in a dose‐related manner, with no evidence of an associated cardiac risk. Nevertheless, the findings indicate a need to be aware of the potential for isavuconazole to shorten the QT interval, and to consider the potential effects in patients with congenital SQTS or the use of concomitant medications with a similar effect.

### Modulation of the QT interval duration in hypertension with antihypertensive treatment [^115ZQjnC]. Hypertension Research (2015). Low credibility.

The duration of the QT interval as measured by 12-lead electrocardiography is a measure of myocardial repolarization and is widely used to describe cardiac abnormalities, to determine the presence of cardiac toxicity and to evaluate drug safety. In hypertension, the QT interval is a predictor of the risk of both coronary events and cardiovascular death, after adjusting for the effects of additional risk factors. The mechanism of QT interval prolongation is multifactorial and includes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased left ventricular mass, with accompanying changes in left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization, as well as changes in the tone of the autonomic nervous system of some patients with hypertension and mechano-electrical feedback, although this mechanism is less likely. Antihypertensive drugs vary in their effect on QT interval duration. The mechanisms underlying their effect depend on changes in left ventricular mass and autonomic nervous system tone, as well as changes in the activity of cardiac ion channels. Although blood pressure reduction is the primary goal of antihypertensive drug therapy and although the choice of antihypertensive drug treatment regimens varies among different individuals, the data regarding the disparate effects of antihypertensive drugs on the duration of the QT interval warrant consideration when implementing long-term pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

### Drink, drugs, and the QT interval [^111TZfA8]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The effects of several prescription and illicitly-used drugs on electrocardiographic repolarization are well documented, most frequently manifested as prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The combination of multiple repolarization-modulating drugs taken in high dosage can occasionally lead to extreme abnormalities of the QTc interval and ST-segment on the surface ECG, which can lead to the erroneous diagnosis of underlying myocardial ischemia and inappropriate treatment. We report on one such case in which the acute management of a syncopal patient was detrimentally influenced by misinterpretation of a very unusual ECG.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — dofetilide dosing, monitoring, and contraindications are specified by renal function and QT response: 500 mcg every 12 h if CrCl > 60 mL/min, 250 mcg every 12 h if CrCl 40–60 mL/min, and 125 mcg every 12 h if CrCl 20 to < 40 mL/min; it is not recommended if CrCl < 20 mL/min. Initiation requires a minimum of 3 d in a facility with continuous ECG monitoring and cardiac resuscitation, and it is contraindicated if the baseline QTc interval or QTc > 440 ms or 500 ms in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities. After the first dose, repeat ECG 2–3 h; if QTc increases by > 15% or is > 500 ms (550 ms with ventricular conduction abnormalities), down‑titrate by 50%, recheck 2–3 h after each subsequent dose, and discontinue if after the second dose QTc is > 500 ms (550 ms with conduction abnormalities). Adverse effects include QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; avoid other QT‑prolonging drugs and note that concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, dolutegravir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, megestrol, trimethoprim, prochlorperazine, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or verapamil is contraindicated.

### Time for a fully integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment to streamline QT prolongation liability determinations: a pharma industry perspective [^111UgNXr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining an appropriate and efficient assessment of drug‐induced corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (a surrogate marker of torsades de pointes arrhythmia) remains a concern of drug developers and regulators worldwide. In use for over 15 years, the nonclinical International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S7B and clinical ICH E14 guidances describe three core assays (S7B: in vitro hERG current & in vivo QTc studies; E14: thorough QT study) that are used to assess the potential of drugs to cause delayed ventricular repolarization. Incorporating these assays during nonclinical or human testing of novel compounds has led to a low prevalence of QTc‐prolonging drugs in clinical trials and no new drugs having been removed from the marketplace due to unexpected QTc prolongation. Despite this success, nonclinical evaluations of delayed repolarization still minimally influence ICH E14‐based strategies for assessing clinical QTc prolongation and defining proarrhythmic risk. In particular, the value of ICH S7B‐based "double‐negative" nonclinical findings (low risk for hERG block and in vivo QTc prolongation at relevant clinical exposures) is underappreciated. These nonclinical data have additional value in assessing the risk of clinical QTc prolongation when clinical evaluations are limited by heart rate changes, low drug exposures, or high‐dose safety considerations. The time has come to meaningfully merge nonclinical and clinical data to enable a more comprehensive, but flexible, clinical risk assessment strategy for QTc monitoring discussed in updated ICH E14 Questions and Answers. Implementing a fully integrated nonclinical/clinical risk assessment for compounds with double‐negative nonclinical findings in the context of a low prevalence of clinical QTc prolongation would relieve the burden of unnecessary clinical QTc studies and streamline drug development.

### Efficacy of cilostazol on platelet reactivity and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1151GSvm]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

We conducted a MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL search using the MeSH terms 'cilostazol' and 'randomised clinical trial' We limited our search to trials involving human subjects through May 2014. The search terms were broad with no language restrictions imposed. We checked the reference lists of review articles and prior meta-analyses to assess for additional eligible studies. Corresponding authors of studies were contacted for further information if relevant data were not reported. Trials in abstract format without a manuscript published were also included in the analysis.

To be included for analysis, eligible trials had to fulfil the following criteria: (1) randomised clinical trials of TAPT (aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol) in comparison to DAPT (aspirin and clopidogrel); (2) enrolment of patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting or bare metal stents and (3) follow-up of at least 2 weeks for trials reporting platelet reactivity outcomes and at least 1 month for trials reporting cardiovascular outcomes.

Selection and quality assessment

Three authors (AS, BT and SB) independently reviewed trial eligibility and quality. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, specifically evaluating sequence generation of allocation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, staff and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Trials with high or unclear risk of bias for the first three criteria were considered as high bias risk trials and the rest as low bias risk trials.

### Meta-analysis of results from eight randomized, placebo-controlled trials on the effect of cilostazol on patients with intermittent claudication [^1149vtdA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

We examined the effect of cilostazol, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on pain-free and maximal walking distance and quality of life measures. The present study examined adverse effects in 2,702 patients with stable, moderate to severe claudication enrolled in 8 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Treatment duration ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. Cilostazol therapy increased maximal and pain-free walking distances by 50% and 67%, respectively. In subgroup analysis, cilostazol increased pain-free and maximal walking distance similarly in men and women, in older (≥ 65 years) and younger patients, and in patients with and without diabetes. Quality-of-life assessments revealed enhanced scores for physical well-being. Cilostazol-treated patients reported a higher incidence of headache, bowel complaints, and palpitations than patients given placebos. Cilostazol decreased triglycerides by 15.8% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12.8%, but there were no deleterious effects on any hematologic or serum markers. We conclude that cilostazol significantly increases walking distance and quality-of-life measures in patients with claudication without major adverse effects.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^111KQdnC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Demographics of all subjects in the safety analysis set of the phase I clinical study

The ECG analysis set comprised 148 subjects (placebo, n = 39; isavuconazole 200 mg, n = 37; isavuconazole 600 mg, n = 32; moxifloxacin, n = 40). The 24‐h time‐matched, baseline‐adjusted drug–placebo difference in the Fridericia‐corrected QT interval (ddQTcF) values for moxifloxacin and both doses of isavuconazole are shown in Figure 2. At 2 h postdose, the median t max (time to mean maximal plasma concentration (mean C max)) for moxifloxacin, the mean time‐matched difference (90% confidence interval (CI)) between moxifloxacin and placebo, baseline adjusted, was 11.03 (7.14 to 14.92) ms, and the lower limit of the 90% CI exceeded 5 ms, confirming assay sensitivity. The upper limit of the 90% CI for the time‐matched difference between isavuconazole and placebo, baseline adjusted, did not exceed 10 ms at any time in either dose group, indicating that isavuconazole did not prolong the QTcF (Supplementary Table 2). None of the subjects in either isavuconazole dose group had a QTcF > 450 ms based on the mean of the replicates at each timepoint and no subject had a > 30 ms increase in QTcF (Table 2). In contrast, two subjects in the 200‐mg dose group and five subjects in the 600‐mg dose group had QTcF < 360 ms for at least one timepoint. A decrease from baseline in QTcF of > 30 ms for at least one timepoint was observed in 13 subjects in the 600‐mg isavuconazole dose group and seven subjects in the 200‐mg isavuconazole dose group.

### Cilostazol [^11352Ez5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cilostazol and several of its metabolites inhibit phosphodiesterase III activity and suppress cAMP degradation with a resultant increase in cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation, respectively.

Cilostazol reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by a variety of stimuli, including thrombin, ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, epinephrine, and shear stress.

Cardiovascular effects:

Cilostazol affects both vascular beds and cardiovascular function. It produces heterogeneous dilation of vascular beds, with greater dilation in femoral beds than in vertebral, carotid or superior mesenteric arteries. Renal arteries were not responsive to the effects of cilostazol.

In dogs or cynomolgus monkeys, cilostazol increased heart rate, myocardial contractile force, and coronary blood flow as well as ventricular automaticity, as would be expected for a PDE III inhibitor. Left ventricular contractility was increased at doses required to inhibit platelet aggregation. A-V conduction was accelerated. In humans, heart rate increased in a dose-proportional manner by a mean of 5.1 and 7.4 beats per minute in patients treated with 50 and 100 mg twice daily, respectively.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115YAh41]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Medications that could prolong the QT interval and induce torsades de pointes (TdP) are organized by risk categories and defined as follows: "Known risk of TdP" drugs "prolong the QT interval and are clearly associated with a known risk of TdP, even when taken as recommended"; "Possible risk of TdP" drugs "can cause QT prolongation but currently lack evidence for a risk of TdP when taken as recommended"; "Conditional risk of TdP" drugs are "associated with TdP but only under certain circumstances of their use (eg, excessive dose, in patients such as those with hypokalemia, or when taken with interacting drugs) or by creating conditions that facilitate or induce TdP"; and "Drugs to avoid in congenital long QT" "pose a special risk of TdP for patients with congenital long-QT syndrome and include those in the above 3 categories plus additional drugs that do not prolong the QT interval per se but have a special risk because of their adrenaline-like actions". The table notes that "The CredibleMeds online lists are revised regularly and should be consulted before clinical decisions are made on the safe use of any of these medicines", that "†Removed from the market", and that "HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; QT, QT interval; and TdP, torsades de pointes".

### How to successfully generate an alternative approach to a thorough QT study: GLPG1972 as an example [^117LjwbK]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The rationale for requiring a one‐ or two‐fold HCRE margin is driven by the presence or absence of a pharmacological‐positive control (i.e. a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin), which is the standard to confirm that the assay is sensitive enough to detect a relatively small QTcF signal. This dose of moxifloxacin results in an increase of the QTcF interval of ~ 10 ms. Although not mentioned in the guidelines, the assessment of food effect as a potential alternative for moxifloxacin to confirm assay sensitivity is mentioned in literature. The effect of food on the duration of the QTc interval is also well‐described. The proposed mechanism is that in response to a meal, proinsulin is released and cleaved into insulin and a C‐terminal peptide (C‐peptide) in a 1:1 ratio. C‐peptide is known to inhibit the L‐type calcium channels, which are one class of ion channels that are involved in the depolarization and repolarization of the ventricular myocytes. Inhibition of the L‐type calcium channels results in a shortening of the QTc interval. This is confirmed by the observation that the shortening of the QTc interval is on the J‐T peak‐segment of the QTc interval. This segment corresponds with the contribution of the calcium channels in the depolarization and repolarization of the cardiac myocytes. Because of this inhibition, the QTc interval decreases with ~ 8 ms.

Although this effect is based on inhibition of a different ion channel and is in the opposite direction, when detected in the study, this confirms that the assay is able and sensitive enough to detect a relatively small signal, thereby confirming assay sensitivity.

In general, the effect of food on drug exposure is assessed in the FIH study. When these data are planned to support an early C‐QTcF assessment, the subjects in the relevant study cohorts are ideally dosed in fasted state under well‐controlled dosing and food conditions. For drugs that show no QT effect in nonclinical development (hERG assay and in vivo telemetry study), one could consider using the assessment of the effect of food following lunch in the combined placebo subjects, as this normally shows a decrease in QTcF of 5–10 ms. For drugs (or their metabolites) that are expected to influence QTcF, the timing of lunch is very important because it may interfere with the drug‐induced effect on QTcF (see below). Therefore, time to C max (T max), duration of the drug effect, and hysteresis should be considered.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^116zdLTn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Numerically fewer patients in the isavuconazole arm compared with the voriconazole arm had TEAEs related to Torsades de Pointes. (Table 3). Syncope and loss of consciousness were reported in a higher proportion of isavuconazole‐ than voriconazole‐treated patients. Among the seven patients in the isavuconazole group who experienced syncope, four were considered mild and unrelated to study drug, one was mild and considered possibly related to study drug (patient was receiving rituximab and diphenhydramine), one was considered moderate and possibly related to study drug (patient was on last dose of chemotherapy), and one was considered severe and possibly related to study drug (patient received concurrent morphine). Among the three patients in the isavuconazole group who experienced loss of consciousness, one was considered moderate and possibly related to study drug (patient received midazolam and morphine prior to event) and two were considered severe and unrelated to study drug. QT prolongation and cardiac arrest were reported in a lower proportion of isavuconazole than voriconazole‐treated patients. A total of five patients in both the isavuconazole and voriconazole treatment groups (3.8% and 3.5%, respectively) had a shift from normal to significantly abnormal ECG assessments between baseline and end of treatment. Another 3/99 patients in the isavuconazole group (3.0%) and 5/88 patients in the voriconazole group (5.7%) had abnormal ECG findings at baseline that became clinically significantly abnormal at the end of treatment.

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate (ery-ped) [^115bAqsj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Sildenafil (Viagra): Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.)

There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine.

Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS .)

In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate.

Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.

There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Colchicine: Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Erythromycin is considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. A significant increase in colchicine plasma concentration is anticipated when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin. If co-administration of colchicine and erythromycin is necessary, the starting dose of colchicine may need to be reduced, and the maximum colchicine dose should be lowered. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity (see WARNINGS).

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Erythromycin interferes with the fluorometric determination of urinary catecholamines.

Circulation (2009). Medium credibility.

QT correction for rate — preferred methods and reporting thresholds: It is recommended that linear regression functions rather than the Bazett's formula be used for QT-rate correction and that the method used for rate correction be identified in ECG analysis reports, and rate correction of the QT interval should not be attempted when RR interval variability is large or when identification of the end of the T wave is unreliable; Bazett's formula leaves a strong positive residual correlation (r = 0.32) and Fridericia's formula leaves a negative correlation (r = −0.26 to −0.32) with heart rate, and the adjusted QT values may be substantially in error, particularly when the heart rate is high; FDA guidelines for industry recommend that 3 severity levels for rate-corrected QT be reported when considering possible QT-prolonging effects of drugs: longer than 350 ms, longer than 480 ms, and longer than 500 ms.

### CredibleMeds.org: what does it offer? [^115bCi1Q]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, when numerous non-cardiac drugs were first recognized to have the potential to prolong the QT interval and cause torsades de pointes (TdP), clinicians, drug regulators, drug developers, and clinical investigators have become aware of the complexities of assessing evidence and determining TdP causality for the many drugs being marketed or under development. To facilitate better understanding, the Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics, known as AZCERT, has developed the CredibleMeds.org website which includes QTdrugs, a listing of over 220 drugs placed in four risk categories based on their association with QT prolongation and TdP. Since the site was launched in 1999, it has become the single and most reliable source of information of its kind for patients, healthcare providers, and research scientists. Over 96,000 registered users rely on the QTdrugs database as their primary resource to inform their medication use, their prescribing or their clinical research into the impact of QT-prolonging drugs and drug-induced arrhythmias. The QTdrugs lists are increasingly used as the basis for clinical decision support systems in healthcare and for metrics of prescribing quality by healthcare insurers. A free smartphone app and an application program interface enable rapid and mobile access to the lists. Also, the CredibleMeds website offers numerous educational resources for patients, educators and healthcare providers that foster the safe use of medications.

### Time for a fully integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment to streamline QT prolongation liability determinations: a pharma industry perspective [^113ZJ4rr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

We also acknowledge that our opinions on the value of the S7B assays expressed in this paper are based largely on our professional experiences, as well as the available scientific literature, which is likely influenced by publication bias. Publication bias is a known factor given that "the majority of safety pharmacology cardiovascular assessments (of priority drugs) are not published in the scientific literature, although some reports become available when a new medicine is approved". 57 For our analysis on the predictive value of the S7B core assays (see section "Linking ICH S7B and ICH E14: Acknowledging the Predictive Value of the Core Assays" and Supplementary Material), we systematically reviewed and included all publicly available evaluations where multiple compounds defined as positive or negative relative to QTc prolongation or TdP liability were examined and where the data were in a form where sensitivity and specificity could be determined. These publications included those where reference agents and standard methods were used, 47, 48, 58 were performed or sponsored by established pharmaceutical companies with large data sets collected over many years, 5, 20, 42 and studies submitted across the pharmaceutical industry or published experience were examined. 6, 43, 44, 45

### Assessing proarrhythmic potential of drugs when optimal studies are infeasible [^112hPNmp]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Assessing the potential for a new drug to cause life-threatening arrhythmias is now an integral component of premarketing safety assessment. International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guideline (ICH) E14 recommends the "Thorough QT Study" (TQT) to assess clinical QT risk. Such a study calls for careful evaluation of drug effects on the electrocardiographic QT interval at multiples of therapeutic exposure and with a positive control to confirm assay sensitivity. Yet for some drugs and diseases, elements of the TQT Study may be impractical or unethical. In these instances, alternative approaches to QT risk assessment must be considered. This article presents points to consider for evaluation of QT risk when alternative approaches are needed.

### Use of whole exome sequencing for the identification of ito-based arrhythmia mechanism and therapy [^113D5vaN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Quinidine

Quinidine is a recommended therapy for Brugada syndrome, and while the patient did not fulfill the Brugada diagnostic criteria, he was empirically started on quinidine. He apparently did well clinically, albeit for a short duration, on therapeutic doses of quinidine and had a serum trough concentration of 1.9 µg/mL on 648 mg every 12 hours. However, the patient was unable to tolerate this dosage due to gastrointestinal intolerance. Due to patient preference, the dose was reduced after the initial hospitalization, and adherence to quinidine therapy has been intermittent. The patient has continued on a low dose (324 mg every 8 hours), which is subtherapeutic. Because quinidine is known to block I to, in addition to multiple other cardiac ion channels, it is possible that the combination of quinidine with dalfampridine is beneficial even at a subtherapeutic concentration.

Cilostazol

The high-output implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implanted in this patient (external and internal defibrillation has been required in the past) does not have atrial pacing capability. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of intermittent claudication. An off-target effect of cilostazol is increased heart rate, and this increase in heart rate has been reported to be potentially and variably beneficial in patients with Brugada or early repolarization syndromes.–Once a putative increase in I to was linked to this patient's arrhythmia syndrome, acceleration of the heart rate was identified as an additional therapeutic strategy. I to has a relatively slow recovery from inactivation; therefore, acceleration of the heart rate can be used to reduce the current amplitude. Notably, in this patient, the increase in heart rate appears to be sustained with long-term cilostazol therapy. However, patient adherence has been intermittent with cilostazol therapy.

### Combination therapy of cilostazol and bepridil suppresses recurrent ventricular fibrillation related to J-wave syndromes [^114LmssZ]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) associated with inferolateral early repolarization patterns are termed "J-wave syndromes". In such patients, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is first-line therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death. However, frequent ICD shocks due to recurrent VF remain serious problems.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to ascertain if combination therapy of cilostazol and bepridil could suppress recurrent VF.

Methods

We enrolled 7 patients with J-wave syndromes who experienced ICD shocks due to recurrent VF after ICD implantation. At first, cilostazol was instituted. In all subjects, palpitations due to sinus tachycardia caused by cilostazol were symptomatic. Addition of bepridil attenuated cilostazol-induced palpitations and maintained the suppressive effect of cilostazol against VF (87 ± 12 bpm to 66 ± 7 bpm, P < .01).

Results

Six patients remained free of VF. Three patients underwent replacement of the ICD generator 4–5 years after ICD placement. Cilostazol was discontinued 2 days before replacement because of its antiplatelet effects. In all 3 patients, temporary discontinuation of cilostazol led to the reappearance of J waves, culminating in VF and an appropriate ICD shock in 1 patient. J waves disappeared with reinstitution of cilostazol.

Conclusion

These data suggest that combination therapy of cilostazol and bepridil may be effective and safe in suppressing VF recurrence in some cases of J-wave syndromes.

### Assessing the probability of drug-induced QTc-interval prolongation during clinical drug development [^117TkaKJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Early in the course of clinical development of new non-antiarrhythmic drugs, it is important to assess the propensity of these drugs to prolong the QT/QTc-interval. The current regulatory guidelines suggest using the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) groups over the sampling interval, thereby neglecting any potential exposure-effect relationship and nonlinearity in the underlying physiological fluctuation in QT values. Thus far, most of the attempted models for characterizing drug-induced QTc-interval prolongation have disregarded the possibility of model parameterization in terms of drug-specific and system-specific properties. Using a database consisting of three compounds with known dromotropic activity, we built a bayesian hierarchical pharmacodynamic (PD) model to describe QT interval, encompassing an individual correction factor for heart rate, an oscillatory component describing the circadian variation, and a truncated maximum-effect model to account for drug effect. The explicit description of the exposure-effect relationship, incorporating various sources of variability, offers advantages over the standard regulatory approach.

### Diabetes and restenosis [^111cevcf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological prevention

Beyond general glycemic control, DAPT and lipid-lowering therapy form the pillars of treatment after the placement of a stent in diabetic patients. Some studies have indicated that the addition of cilostazol to these agents (sometimes referred to as 'triple antiplatelet therapy') may decrease the risk of ISR. Cilostazol is a vasodilator that suppresses cAMP degradation, a substance whose anti-mitogenic properties have been found to maintain VSMC quiescence in damaged vessels. Reassuringly, a reduction in both late lumen loss and 9-month TLR was observed in cilostazol-treated diabetic patients receiving DES in a recent prospective study. For diabetic patients that cannot receive DES, administration of colchicine has proven to be very effective in reducing the rate of ISR in BMS.

The use of antioxidants in ISR has been evaluated for over a decade, taking into account that restenosis is partly mediated by oxidative stress to the vascular endothelium — particularly in presence of hyperglycemia. Substances that reduce free radicals like probucol have shown promise in vitro, but are marred by side-effects, including prolongation of QT-interval.

While the results of related clinical trials come in, perhaps the most straightforward path to prevention is adequate management of DM itself.

Cilostazol compared with aspirin — secondary stroke prevention: Trials reported 35 fewer recurrent strokes and three fewer nonfatal major extracranial hemorrhages per 1,000 patients treated for 2 years, while the trials failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect on mortality and myocardial infarction (MI). Reported adverse effects included headache (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.8), gastrointestinal intolerance (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.5), palpitations (RR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–1.9), tachycardia (RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.6–6.0), and dizziness (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.8). A meta-analysis versus placebo showed reduced total vascular events (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7–1.0) driven by fewer cerebrovascular events (RR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.9). As a result of the low quality, the authors judged there to be insufficient evidence to determine superiority of cilostazol over aspirin, although these trials added strength to the recommendation for cilostazol over no antiplatelet therapy.

### Anagrelide hydrochloride [^114Nhbrb]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary.

Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

5.2 Bleeding Risk

Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

QT Prolonging Medication Use

We compiled a comprehensive list of QT prolonging medications using the CredibleMeds website, a reliable online clinical resource with up‐to‐date information about medications that can cause QT prolongation and/or TdP. 7 Based upon published literature, medication package inserts, data from the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System, and other sources, CredibleMeds classifies QT prolonging medications as having a known, possible, or conditional TdP risk (Table 1 and Table S3). 7 In each study year, we used prescription claims data to longitudinally track the daily use of outpatient medications with a known, possible, or conditional TdP risk for each individual in the hemodialysis and non‐ESKD populations.

Table 1
CredibleMeds Definitions for Medications With Known, Possible, and Conditional TdP Risk

To quantify the extent of prescription QT prolonging medication use in each population from 2012 to 2016, we determined the annual rate of exposure to ≥ 1 QT prolonging medication, overall and by CredibleMeds class (known, possible, or conditional TdP risk). We also conducted a supplemental extent of use analysis excluding QT prolonging thiazide/thiazide‐like diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide, metolazone; Table S3) since these agents have limited efficacy in ESKD, 17 but are frequently used by individuals without ESKD. 18

Sudden cardiac death (often precipitated by ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes) is a leading cause of death in patients with CKD. Prolongation of the QT interval (a marker of delayed ventricular repolarization) is a significant risk factor for arrhythmia in patients with CKD, whether they are on dialysis or not. QT prolongation in CKD is multifactorial and may result from electrolyte imbalances, myocardial remodelling, autonomic dysfunction, and exposure to QT-prolonging drugs. Patients on haemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to QT prolongation, due to rapid intradialytic electrolyte and fluid shifts. Many drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antipsychotics) are frequently prescribed to patients with CKD, even though there are few data on their safety in this population. The results of several well-designed pharmaco-epidemiological analyses (all based on data from the United States Renal Data System) have shown associations between QT-prolonging drugs and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death among patients on dialysis. These findings are concerning, given the widespread use of such drug. The objective of this narrative review is to critically evaluate the pathophysiological relevance, prevalence, and cardiovascular consequences of QT-prolonging drug use in the CKD setting.

### How to successfully generate an alternative approach to a thorough QT study: GLPG1972 as an example [^113WjraE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO A TQT STUDY

For the GLPG1972 request, in addition to the C‐QTc modeling, supportive clinical analyses were conducted using the phase I and II study data to identify potential QTc outliers and AEs indicative of proarrhythmic effects. In addition, Holter monitoring data from two phase I studies were examined for rhythm or conduction alerts. The supportive clinical data were presented in specific sections of the application document (Figure 1).

For the categorical QTc outlier analysis, the number (percentage) of participants and timepoints with increases in absolute QTcF interval values > 450 ms and ≤ 480 ms, > 480 ms and ≤ 500 ms, and > 500 ms, and changes from predose baseline of > 30, ≤ 60, and > 60 ms were determined (Table S4, Table S5). No treatment‐emergent QTcF values of > 500 ms or increases of QTcF of > 60 ms from baseline were observed in the phase I and II studies. In the phase I studies, QTcF increases from baseline of > 30 ms were observed at similar rates in the GLPG1972 treatment groups and in the placebo groups. No trend was observed over time nor with increasing dose.

For the analysis of AEs possibly indicating QT prolongation in the phase I and II studies, Preferred Terms from the Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) of "Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation" (MedDRA version 22.0) were used to search for AEs. In these studies, three participants experienced an AE from the SMQ of "Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation" (syncope (n = 2) and ventricular arrhythmia (n = 1)), but the data point to etiologies other than prolongation of the QT interval. Review of the Holter monitoring data did not reveal any treatment‐emergent abnormalities.

Collectively, these supportive analyses were not suggestive of clinically significant QTc prolongation with GLPG1972.

On August 27, 2020, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) released the Draft Guideline "E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential — Questions and Answers". 1 The Draft ICH Guideline, which contains revised Questions and Answers (Q&As) to the E14 clinical guideline and new Q&As to the S7B nonclinical guideline, was subsequently opened for public comment in regulatory regions around the world. 2 To raise public awareness of the ICH E14/S7B Draft Guideline (also referred to as the new/draft Q&As in this paper), the ICH E14/S7B working group presented a 2‐day webinar on October 15–16, 2020. 3 The webinar covered the background, motivation for, and overview of the new E14/S7B Q&As, followed by presentations on each of the main Q&A topics and example cases that highlighted the potential impact of applying the principles in the new Q&As on reducing clinical trials and assisting regulatory evaluation. 3 In addition, there was an hour of live response to questions submitted by the audience from a panel of ICH E14/S7B working group members that included representatives from every regulatory region and industry group. With 2,355 registered attendees from 69 countries, there was substantial interest in the topic. The presentations and complete recordings are available for download on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. 3

### Levoketoconazole (Recorlev) [^114MXFgL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 QT Prolongation

RECORLEV is associated with dose-related QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation may lead to life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. During Studies 1 and 2, which excluded patients with baseline QTcF interval greater than 470 msec, 4 (2.4%) patients experienced QTcF > 500 msec, and 23 (14.7%) patients experienced change-from-baseline QTcF > 60 msec. Resolution typically occurred following a dosage interruption and in some cases correction of electrolyte abnormalities.

RECORLEV may also elevate plasma concentrations of certain drugs known to prolong QT intervals. Prolongation of the QT interval from certain drugs can result in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

RECORLEV is contraindicated in patients taking other drugs known to cause QT interval prolongation associated with ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QTcF interval of greater than 470 msec at baseline, history of torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or long QT syndrome (including first-degree family history) [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

Use RECORLEV with caution in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, such as congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities, with more frequent ECG monitoring considered.

Obtain a baseline QT interval measurement and regularly monitor ECG for an effect on the QT interval during RECORLEV treatment. Correct hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia prior to RECORLEV initiation and monitor periodically during treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Temporarily discontinue RECORLEV if the QTcF interval exceeds 500 msec. After the QTcF interval returns to less than 500 msec and contributing factors are corrected, re-institution of RECORLEV at a lower dose may be considered. If QT interval prolongation recurs after restarting RECORLEV, permanently discontinue RECORLEV [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### QT interval and drug therapy [^111dBbWc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is an important component of the electrocardiogram, which when prolonged can predict the risk of developing the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. There is growing understanding of the genetics associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increasing number of drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Consequently, assessment of the effect of drugs on the QT interval has become a significant aspect of drug development, regulatory assessment and clinical care. Here, we review the QT interval and the risks associated with drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

### The impact of drug-induced QT interval prolongation on drug discovery and development [^112NJENC]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, a number of non-cardiovascular drugs have had their label revised or have been withdrawn from the market because of unexpected post-marketing reports of sudden cardiac death associated with a prolongation of the QT interval, and an increased propensity to develop a ventricular tachyarrhythmia called Torsades de Pointes. Although a direct link between QT interval prolongation and arrhythmogenesis is still unclear, QT prolongation is now the subject of increased regulatory review and is considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of New Chemical Entities. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are striving to improve the drug discovery and development process to identify, as early as possible, the risk of novel agents, or their metabolites, of causing QT interval prolongation and to make appropriate go/no-go decisions or modify their development programme accordingly.

### Efficacy of cilostazol on platelet reactivity and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from a meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1164dPZG]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

However, because cilostazol inhibits both platelet activation and smooth muscle proliferation, it has the potential to target two dreaded complications of PCI — stent thrombosis and restenosis. TAPT may reduce MACE by two or more cellular mechanisms. Our study shows significant reduction in both stent thrombosis and restenosis using TAPT with cilostazol, even in patients treated with DES. This is a potential advantage for this agent, as no antiplatelet agent, including prasugrel or ticagrelor, has been shown to have any antirestenosis property.

Therefore, a strategy of using TAPT with cilostazol has several advantages: (1) it improves the surrogate outcome of platelet reactivity relative to DAPT, including high-dose clopidogrel; (2) the antismooth muscle proliferative properties of cilostazol may make it an excellent agent to prevent restenosis resulting in reduced TVR even in patients treated with a DES; (3) the improvement in platelet reactivity indices translate into significant reduction in stent thrombosis and (4) the medication is available generically and is therefore less expensive than newer antiplatelet therapy. Thus, when used following PCI, TAPT with cilostazol has the potential to be a cost-effective therapy to improve clinical outcomes by reducing thrombotic events and restenosis. The results of this study therefore call for a randomised trial comparing a strategy of TAPT with DAPT using newer antiplatelet agents.

Our results differ from the studies of Jang et al and Sakurai et al in that these studies did not evaluate platelet reactivity outcomes and had far fewer trials than the current analysis. In our analysis, TAPT was associated with significant increase in drug discontinuation. The most commonly listed causes for drug discontinuation were headache, skin rash and palpitations/tachycardia. Sakurai et al similarly found a significant increase in rash and gastrointestinal side effects with TAPT.

### Cardiac repolarization and the safety of new drugs defined by electrocardiography [^115YaWk9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

A compelling assessment of both short- and long-term cardiac safety is increasingly emphasized before regulatory marketing approval. In that context, cardiac adverse effects that were otherwise unexpected become manifest when large numbers of subjects are treated after market approval, many of whom take multiple medications, have co-morbidities, and are subject to other conditions that were not represented in the original clinical trial population. Since 2005, dedicated, robust, and well-controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) trials are required, usually conducted in Phase II, to define the cardiac risk of a new therapy before large-scale Phase III trials are conducted or marketing is approved.

### Anagrelide hydrochloride (Agrylin) [^112uHU8e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.1	Drugs that Prolong QT

Avoid use of AGRYLIN in patients taking medications that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, and pimozide) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2 	PDE3 Inhibitors

AGRYLIN is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. Avoid use of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.3 	Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Co-administration of single-dose or repeat-dose AGRYLIN and aspirin showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Results from an observational study in patients with essential thrombocythemia suggest the rate of major hemorrhagic events (MHEs) in patients treated with AGRYLIN is higher than in those subjects treated with another cytoreductive treatment. The majority of the major hemorrhagic events occurred in patients who were also receiving concomitant anti-aggregatory treatment (primarily, aspirin). Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of AGRYLIN with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high-risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

Do not use anagrelide in patients taking medications that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to, chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide and pimozide) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2 PDE3 Inhibitors

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. The effects of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

### The cardiovascular safety of incretin-based therapies: a review of the evidence [^117TyWz5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

QT interval

The electrocardiographic QT interval is a measure of cardiac repolarisation. An increased QT interval is a risk factor for torsades de pointes arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Hence, any drug that prolongs the QT interval may increase the risk of adverse CV events reviewed in.

The DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin, saxagliptin and vildagliptin are not associated with QT interval prolongation at clinically relevant concentrations in healthy individuals.

The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on QT c interval, that is, corrected for heart rate, have been studied in healthy volunteers. In this population, liraglutide administration (0.6, 1.2. and 1.8 mg OD) produced no significant QT c prolongation. A significant positive correlation between plasma exenatide concentration and QT c interval was reported in one study following single-dose administration of 10 μg exenatide in 62 healthy individuals [regression analysis slope (95% confidence interval; CI), 0.02 (0.01, 0.03), p < 0.001; change in QT c F (Fridericia correction) interval (90% prediction interval) estimated as 4.95 (2.64, 7.25) ms at geometric mean C max of exenatide]. However, a further QT interval study in which exenatide was administered by intravenous infusion to achieve supratherapeutic plasma concentrations (up to ~630 pg/mL) was reassuring, indicating no QT c prolongation in a population of 74 healthy adults. To date, the effects of lixisenatide on cardiac repolarisation have not been published.

### QT interval shortening with isavuconazole: in vitro and in vivo effects on cardiac repolarization [^115jcY51]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Given the known effects of some triazole antifungal agents on the QT interval, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 the potential effects of isavuconazole on cardiac repolarization were assessed. In vitro studies were performed to assess the effects of isavuconazole on a panel of cardiac ion channels. A phase I clinical study was performed to assess effects of repeated administration of isavuconazole at therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. Finally, data from the phase III SECURE study were reassessed specifically to evaluate cardiac safety signals.

### Cilostazol for secondary stroke prevention: history, evidence, limitations, and possibilities [^116GZCZo]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Cilostazol is a PDE3 (phosphodiesterase III) inhibitor with a long track record of safety that is Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved for the treatment of claudication in patients with peripheral arterial disease. In addition, cilostazol has been approved for secondary stroke prevention in several Asian countries based on trials that have demonstrated a reduction in stroke recurrence among patients with noncardioembolic stroke. The onset of benefit appears after 60 to 90 days of treatment, which is consistent with cilostazol's pleiotropic effects on platelet aggregation, vascular remodeling, blood flow, and plasma lipids. Cilostazol appears safe and does not increase the risk of major bleeding when given alone or in combination with aspirin or clopidogrel. Adverse effects such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and palpitations, however, contributed to a 6% increase in drug discontinuation among patients randomized to cilostazol in a large secondary stroke prevention trial (CSPS.com [Cilostazol Stroke Prevention Study for Antiplatelet Combination]). Due to limitations of prior trials, such as open-label design, premature trial termination, large loss to follow-up, lack of functional or cognitive outcome data, and exclusive enrollment in Asia, the existing trials have not led to a change in clinical practice or guidelines in Western countries. These limitations could be addressed by a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in a broader population. If positive, it would increase the evidence in support of long-term treatment with cilostazol for secondary prevention in the millions of patients worldwide who have experienced a noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.

### Erythromycin (erythromycin ethylsuccinate) [^116EAwbo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine.

Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate.

Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.

There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Colchicine:

Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Erythromycin is considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. A significant increase in colchicine plasma concentration is anticipated when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin. If co-administration of colchicine and erythromycin is necessary, the starting dose of colchicine may need to be reduced, and the maximum colchicine dose should be lowered. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity (see WARNINGS).

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions:

Erythromycin interferes with the fluorometric determination of urinary catecholamines.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111ArFX8]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Cilostazol — mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy/safety: Cilostazol is a 2-oxoquinolone derivative with vasodilatory and antiplatelet properties and is contraindicated in patients with heart failure; headache occurs in up to one-fourth of patients within the first 2 weeks of starting treatment. Coadministration of food increases the rate and extent of absorption; it is highly albumin bound, metabolized by cytochrome P450, has a half-life of 11 h, and the half-life is prolonged in severe renal impairment. Meta-analyses indicate that cilostazol (50 mg bid or 100 mg once daily) increases maximal and pain-free walking distance in intermittent claudication, prevents thrombotic events in peripheral arterial disease, and prevents restenosis and target vessel revascularization after stenting. In CSPS-2, cilostazol (100 mg bid) versus aspirin (81 mg/d) in 2,757 Japanese patients with recent stroke, using a noninferiority design and mean follow-up of 29 months, showed an on-treatment annual recurrent stroke rate of 2.8% vs 3.7% (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98) and a lower annual bleeding rate with cilostazol (0.77 and 1.78%, respectively; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30–0.71); adverse effects including headache, diarrhea, palpitation, dizziness, and tachycardia were more frequent and discontinuation was almost twofold higher with cilostazol (20% vs 12%).
