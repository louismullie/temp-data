## Question

Which organisms are associated with gram-positive rod bacteremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which organisms are associated with gram-positive rod bacteremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and scope of gram-positive rods and enumerate the specific taxa actually supported by the references. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors in hosts and devices. Next, I will distinguish frequent contaminants from true pathogens and note time-to-positivity clues. After that, I should review identification pitfalls and the role of 16S or multiplex assays. Finally, I will consider practical management implications for blood culture collection and stewardship, and synthesize a concise, clinically framed list with caveats and self-corrections where the evidence is weak or contradictory [^113GNsjv].

> Let me first confirm the organisms that the documents actually support as gram-positive rods causing bloodstream infection, and I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond the evidence. Supported taxa include Actinomyces spp. with A. odontolyticus reported in immunosuppressed hosts, Gordonia spp. as slow-growing aerobic actinomycetes linked to catheter-related bacteremia, Lactobacillus spp. with L. rhamnosus and L. casei in immunocompromised or postsurgical patients, Bacillus spp. with frequent contamination but true bacteremia in select hosts, Corynebacterium spp. especially C. striatum and C. jeikeium increasingly recognized as true bacteremic pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes as a classic invasive pathogen, Weissella confusa as a Lactobacillus-like vancomycin-resistant rod associated with endocarditis, Clostridium butyricum as a probiotic-associated bloodstream pathogen, Paenibacillus spp. as sources of pseudobacteremia outbreaks, Atopobium rimae confirmed by 16S sequencing in septicemia, Actinobaculum spp. as urinary-source anaerobic rods causing bacteremia, and Carnobacterium divergens as a rare food-associated pathogen in the severely ill, while Propionibacterium (Cutibacterium) spp. are commonly contaminants but occasionally pathogenic in select settings [^112WFqsu] [^114wyZ7H] [^113eqgpV] [^112rNsa5] [^112F3itx] [^11484MET] [^114XmnEG] [^113mjyDP] [^111qNdtF] [^115wMBFu] [^113Fh2nz] [^1114XZvi] [^115yHBuu].

> Hold on, I should verify categorization to keep clinical reasoning tidy because management and likelihood of contamination differ by biology and ecology. Non–spore-forming aerobic or facultative rods include Actinomyces, Gordonia, Lactobacillus, Weissella, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Atopobium, and Actinobaculum, whereas spore-formers include Bacillus and Paenibacillus, with Clostridium as an anaerobic spore-former that can also cause bacteremia, particularly from intra-abdominal sources, and is sometimes detected rapidly in anaerobic bottles and early in incubation [^112rNsa5] [^114q7DXs]. Let me consider the environmental and probiotic-associated group as well: Lactobacillus and Clostridium butyricum link to probiotic exposures, Gordonia is environmental with biofilm propensity on devices, and Carnobacterium is food-associated, which can inform pretest probability and source investigations [^113eqgpV] [^113mjyDP] [^114wyZ7H] [^1114XZvi].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and host risk factors, and I need to ensure I'm aligning statements with the cited data. Immunocompromised patients, those with intravascular devices, and hosts with severe comorbidities are repeatedly overrepresented: Gordonia bacteremia clusters around endovascular devices in immunocompromised hosts, Lactobacillus bacteremia concentrates in patients with severe underlying disease and prior hospital/surgical exposure, Clostridium butyricum bacteremia is reported in hospitalized, often transplanted or otherwise immunosuppressed patients receiving probiotic preparations, and severe clostridial bacteremia disproportionately affects elderly, critically ill patients with intra-abdominal sources [^114wyZ7H] [^113eqgpV] [^113mjyDP] [^114q7DXs]. I should also confirm that Listeria risk groups match the classic T-cell–impaired hosts such as elderly, pregnant, or immunosuppressed patients, which the case literature reiterates [^11484MET].

> Wait, let me verify the contaminant versus pathogen signal since misclassification can drive over- or undertreatment. Bacillus spp. are often blood culture contaminants but should not be dismissed in immunocompromised hosts or device-associated contexts where true bacteremia and severe disease are documented, including outbreaks linked to contaminated solutions and central lines, while Corynebacterium spp. are typically labeled contaminants but C. striatum and C. jeikeium show increasing rates of true bloodstream infection and invasive disease, and a broader review lists Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Propionibacterium among the most frequent contaminants requiring careful clinical adjudication [^112rNsa5] [^112F3itx] [^115yHBuu]. I should double-check time-to-positivity as a clue to true bacteremia: pediatric data suggest shorter time to positivity correlates with true infection, which can be pragmatically useful during early decision-making, though this must be integrated with organism identity and clinical context [^115i3y3R].

> Let me consider which organisms are "usually true" when isolated from blood, recognizing there are important exceptions. Listeria monocytogenes is generally a true pathogen in blood and CSF and rarely a contaminant, often associated with invasive syndromes in the immunosuppressed, pregnant, and elderly, thus warranting prompt targeted therapy and CNS evaluation when indicated [^11484MET]. Gordonia spp. identified from blood, especially in the setting of intravascular devices and delayed culture positivity, should be taken seriously, ideally with species-level identification via 16S and device management considerations given biofilm associations [^114wyZ7H]. Hold on, Actinomyces isolated from blood is traditionally viewed as significant, but a modern review cautions that not all Actinomyces-positive blood cultures are clinically meaningful, so correlation with sterile-site cultures or a compatible source remains essential [^112WFqsu] [^113TcRbg]. I should also confirm that Actinobaculum bacteremia often has a urinary source in older patients and can be underrecognized, and that Weissella confusa, a vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus-like organism, has been implicated in endocarditis where full identification and susceptibility testing are critical [^113Fh2nz] [^114XmnEG].

> I will now examine identification pitfalls and how to mitigate them, since misidentification can lead to inappropriate therapy. Gordonia is slow to grow in blood cultures and has historically been misidentified by routine phenotypic systems; 16S rRNA gene sequencing has improved diagnostic accuracy, impacting management and antibiotic selection in case series [^114wyZ7H]. But wait, what if the phenotypic database lacks the culprit species, as with Atopobium rimae in the cited case? In such settings, 16S sequencing confirmed the organism at 99% similarity and established clinical significance across separate blood draws, aligning with septic shock at presentation [^115wMBFu]. Let me also check the utility of molecular panels: multiplex assays like REBA Sepsis-ID and direct 16S PCR/pyrosequencing can expedite genus/species identification from positive blood cultures, although performance varies and not all GPRs are resolved to species, reinforcing the need for reflex sequencing when results are incongruent with the clinical picture [^114zYUaQ] [^114UiKnn].

> Hold on, I should verify pseudobacteremia scenarios to avoid anchoring on false positives. A neonatal ICU cluster of Paenibacillus macerans was traced to contaminated blood culture bottle stoppers, a classic pseudobacteremia outbreak, while Bacillus pseudobacteremia has been linked to contaminated gloves and extrinsic factors, underscoring the need for rigorous collection practices and environmental surveillance during clusters of unusual GPRs [^111qNdtF] [^112rNsa5]. I need to ensure that when unusual GPRs are detected, we confirm multiple sets, correlate with symptoms, and scrutinize collection and laboratory processes before committing to prolonged therapy [^115yHBuu].

> Let me think about probiotic-associated gram-positive rod bacteremia because this can be clinically overlooked. Lactobacillus bacteremia includes cases where the bloodstream isolate was genetically identical to the administered probiotic L. rhamnosus GG, and severe underlying illness is the main mortality driver with susceptibility-guided therapy associated with improved outcomes, while a separate report described sepsis temporally associated with probiotic administration around cardiac surgery, highlighting selection of high-risk patients for probiotics with caution [^113eqgpV] [^114bT9a3]. I should confirm that Clostridium butyricum bacteremia was also linked to use of a C. butyricum–containing probiotic (MIYA-BM) in immunocompromised inpatients with central venous access, supporting de-escalation of probiotics during critical illness or immunosuppression and thorough source evaluation when these organisms appear in blood [^113mjyDP].

> Next, I should review device-associated gram-positive rods so I don't miss the source. Gordonia has a strong predilection for endovascular devices and biofilms with delayed culture positivity, Corynebacterium spp. frequently arise in catheter-related bloodstream infections yet may be dismissed as contaminants if not considered in the clinical context, and Bacillus spp. can seed catheters and cause nosocomial bacteremia, occasionally in outbreaks linked to contaminated infusates, necessitating source control and device management when clinically indicated [^114wyZ7H] [^112F3itx] [^112rNsa5].

> I should confirm practical blood culture and stewardship steps to minimize contamination and guide appropriate therapy. Before antibiotics, obtain blood cultures and ensure rigorous skin antisepsis using alcohol, tincture of iodine, or alcoholic chlorhexidine with adequate drying, clean catheter hubs meticulously if drawing through lines, and use a trained phlebotomy team when available to reduce contamination rates and diagnostic ambiguity, particularly with skin commensal GPRs [^111QXDrx] [^1167MjVe] [^1151ECc5] [^11648BjF]. While empiric antibiotic choices depend on syndrome and host factors, culture and susceptibility results should drive definitive therapy; do not continue agents without activity against the identified organism, and be mindful that some GPRs like Weissella are intrinsically vancomycin resistant, so laboratory guidance is critical to avoid mismatched coverage [^117XT7Ln] [^114XmnEG].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered adding Nocardia spp. as "mentioned in treatment guidelines" for bacteremia, but I should double-check the provenance of that claim. The ESCMID and IDSA guidance referenced in the packet pertain to antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, not Nocardia, so they do not support inclusion of Nocardia in this GPR bacteremia summary, and although the doxycycline label lists Nocardia among susceptible organisms, that is not evidence of bloodstream pathogenicity in these documents, and Nocardia classically presents as a branching, variably acid-fast pathogen with pulmonary or CNS disease rather than routine bacteremia; therefore, I should not elevate Nocardia as a supported cause of GPR bacteremia in this synthesis based on the provided citations [^114VGGbt] [^112T6Th6] [^116GEueZ].

> I should also confirm one more nuance about Actinomyces before concluding, because earlier I implied all Actinomyces bacteremias are clinically significant, which might be an overstatement. A focused review indicates that isolation of Actinomyces from blood is not invariably clinically significant, which means clinical correlation, additional source cultures, and imaging remain essential before committing to prolonged therapy for presumed actinomycosis based solely on a single positive blood culture, and this aligns with the broader principle of differentiating contaminants from pathogens in GPRs [^113TcRbg] [^115yHBuu].

> In summary, I need to ensure the final clinical take-home is balanced and source-aware: among gram-positive rods in blood cultures, consistent pathogens include Listeria monocytogenes, device-associated Gordonia spp., select Corynebacterium spp. such as C. striatum and C. jeikeium, Lactobacillus spp. in high-risk or probiotic-exposed hosts, anaerobic Clostridium spp. including probiotic-associated C. butyricum, Actinobaculum spp. often from urinary sources, Weissella confusa in endocarditis contexts, Actinomyces spp. with clinical correlation, and occasional Atopobium rimae and Carnobacterium divergens, while Bacillus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. often represent contamination unless host and source factors suggest otherwise; careful attention to time to positivity, multiple blood culture sets, molecular identification, and strict collection technique can substantially improve diagnostic clarity and stewardship in these scenarios [^11484MET] [^114wyZ7H] [^112F3itx] [^113eqgpV] [^113mjyDP] [^113Fh2nz] [^114XmnEG] [^115wMBFu] [^1114XZvi] [^112rNsa5] [^115i3y3R] [^115yHBuu] [^114zYUaQ] [^111QXDrx] [^1167MjVe] [^1151ECc5] [^11648BjF].

### Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia [^112WFqsu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We describe two immunosuppressed female patients with fever and Actinomyces odontolyticus bacteremia, a combination documented once previously in an immunocompetent male patient. The patients were treated with doxycycline and clindamycin; these drugs, along with beta-lactams, are effective treatments for A. odontolyticus infections.

### Characteristics and treatment of Gordonia spp. bacteremia, France [^114wyZ7H]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Gordonia is a slow-growing, Gram-positive aerobic bacillus of the order Mycobacteriales. More than 40 species of this ubiquitous environmental bacterium have been described, few of which seem to infect humans. Some localized postoperative or traumatic infections have been described. Among immunocompromised patients, systemic bloodstream infections, although relatively uncommon, can be caused by contaminated biofilm adherent on endovascular devices. However, cases of secondary infection are more uncommon.

Gordonia bacteremia is not well understood because of its rarity; in addition, blood cultures may not be positive until more than four days after infection. The use of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing has improved Gordonia identification rates over results from other, often insufficient, standard laboratory tests, which sometimes led to misidentification. Because no standardized recommendations for treatment exist, reported cases have been managed heterogeneously; a single treatment regimen — a four-to-six-week course of an aminoglycoside combined with a carbapenem or fluoroquinolone — developed based on a five-case series study and a literature review, has been proposed.

Because some cases of severe infections have been described, to clarify risk factors and management options, we initiated this investigation describing patient characteristics to examine treatment outcomes from cases of Gordonia bacteremia. Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Medicine, Odontology, and Pharmacy Faculties and Hospitals of the University Hospital of Strasbourg (project no. CE-2022–112).

### Lactobacillus bacteremia, clinical significance, and patient outcome, with special focus on probiotic L. rhamnosus GG [^113eqgpV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Lactobacillus bacteremia is a rare entity, and its clinical significance is poorly defined. We have reviewed the risk factors and outcomes for 89 case patients with Lactobacillus bacteremia. Species characterization was done in 53% of the cases, revealing 25 L. rhamnosus strains and 22 other Lactobacillus species. In 11 cases, the strain was identical to the probiotic L. rhamnosus GG. In 82% of the cases, the patients had severe or fatal comorbidities. Predisposing factors to bacteremia included immunosuppression, prior prolonged hospitalization, and prior surgical interventions.

No significant differences were observed in these predisposing factors or clinical features between patients with cases associated with various Lactobacillus species, other than higher C-reactive protein values in patients with L. rhamnosus bacteremia. Mortality was 26% at 1 month and 48% at 1 year. In multivariate analysis, severe underlying diseases were a significant predictor for mortality (odds ratio [OR], 15.8), whereas treatment with antimicrobials effective in vitro was associated with lower mortality (OR, 0.22). We conclude that lactobacilli in blood cultures are of clinical significance and that their susceptibility should guide decisions about antimicrobial treatment.

### Nonhemolytic, nonmotile gram-positive rods indicative of Bacillus anthracis [^112rNsa5]. Emerging infectious diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Bacillus represents a genus of ubiquitous gram-positive bacteria. The species are used in many medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and industrial processes, including those for making antibiotics and insecticides. Even the anthrax toxin is being evaluated as a choice for tumor cell surface targeting in chemoresistant neoplasms.

Although most species are harmless, two are medically significant: Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus. B. anthracis causes anthrax in its cutaneous, pulmonary (inhalational), and intestinal forms. B. cereus causes two distinct food poisoning syndromes, a rapid-onset emetic syndrome characterized by nausea and vomiting, and a slower onset diarrheal syndrome.

Bacillus species are often isolated on blood culture and usually represent blood culture contamination. For example, Bacillus species pseudobacteremia has been traced to contaminated gloves used in the collection of blood from patients. In immunocompromised hosts, a blood culture growing Bacillus species should be evaluated carefully. Rarely, these species cause important clinical diseases such as bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, empyema, ophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, soft tissue infection, and intravascular catheter-acquired sepsis.

Pseudotumour of the lung has been reported as the cause of infection with B. sphaericus. Endocarditis has been reported to be caused by B. subtilis. An outbreak of Bacillus species in a cancer hospital in Brazil was reported to be strongly associated with the use of calcium gluconate solution and central venous lines. The outbreak was controlled by strict infection control measures.

### Clinical characteristics of Corynebacterium bacteremia caused by different species, Japan, 2014–2020 [^112F3itx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Corynebacterium bacteria are club-shaped, gram-positive rods that are ubiquitous in the environment. Because Corynebacterium species other than C. diphtheriae colonize skin and mucous membranes in humans, they are typically considered clinically nonsignificant contaminants in cultures. Recently, the frequency of detecting C. striatum and C. jeikeium as causative agents of severe bloodstream infections, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has increased. These two species have been identified most frequently in cultures of clinical specimens, mainly blood, pus, urine, and pleural effusion.

Studies that have identified Corynebacterium infections or bacteremia to the species level are limited, and most are case reports. The largest study investigating Corynebacterium bacteremia at the time of writing examined 98 cases; however, the species were not identified. The largest study identifying Corynebacterium species included 30 cases of true bacteremia in 339 patients with positive blood cultures. In our study, we aimed to determine the differences in characteristics and clinical presentations for patients with bacteremia caused by C. striatum, C. jeikeium, or other species of Corynebacterium.

### Progressive rash as the first sign of meningitis and bacteremia [^11484MET]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular, gram-positive bacillus commonly transmitted through foods, including unpasteurized milk products, deli meats, and soft cheeses. The majority of immunocompetent individuals can avoid serious infection. However, those with impaired T-cell immunity, such as the elderly, pregnant women, neonates, and patients on immunosuppressive medications, are at risk for invasive Listeria infections, including sepsis and meningitis.

In the initial placebo-controlled trials of anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, an increased risk of listeriosis was not identified. However, since its more widespread use, there have been limited reports of listeriosis occurring in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents, including anti-TNF agents — especially when used in conjunction with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Listeriosis typically presents with altered mental status and is rarely identified through cutaneous manifestations of the infection. Here, we present a case of a 55-year-old man on infliximab and methotrexate who presented with a maroon-colored rash on his trunk and upper extremities before experiencing altered mental status in the setting of Listeria meningitis and bacteremia.

### Fatal case of endocarditis due to Weissella confusa [^114XmnEG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

This is the first reported case of endocarditis due to the Lactobacillus-like vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacillus Weissella confusa. Full identification and susceptibility testing of Lactobacillus-like organisms recovered in blood culture should be performed for patients with clinical presentations that suggest endocarditis.

### European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (endorsed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) [^114VGGbt]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections, particularly in the context of managing P. aeruginosa infections, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend considering monotherapy. This should be chosen among the drugs active in vitro on an individual basis and according to the source of infection, for the treatment of non-severe or low-risk carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa infections, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship.

### Mortality following blood culture in premature infants: Increased with Gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia, but not Gram-positive bacteremia [^115UriAF]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

To describe survival following nosocomial bloodstream infections and quantify excess mortality associated with positive blood culture, a multicenter cohort study was conducted on premature infants.

First blood culture results were negative for 4,648 out of 5,497 (78%) of the neonates, with 390 out of the 4,648 (8%) dying prior to discharge. Mortality prior to discharge was 19% in the 161 infants with Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, 8% in the 854 neonates with coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS), 6% in the 169 infants infected with other Gram-positive bacteria (GP-o), and 26% in the 115 neonates with candidemia. The excess 7-day mortality was 0% for Gram-positive organisms and 83% for GNR bacteremia and candidemia. Using negative blood culture as a referent, GNR bacteremia [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.61] and candidemia (HR = 2.27) were associated with increased mortality; CONS (HR = 1.08) and GP-o (HR = 0.97) were not.

In conclusion, nosocomial GNR bacteremia and candidemia were associated with increased mortality, whereas Gram-positive bacteremia was not.

### Antimicrobial resistance as a risk factor for recurrent bacteremia after Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp. community-onset bacteremia [^1112NuVS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health issue, associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Although the effects of AMR on clinical and economic outcomes have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the effects of AMR on infection recurrence, a significant event that results in substantial illness, death, and healthcare costs. Recurrence is of particular concern among bacteremia patients, who are often fragile and have underlying conditions because bacteremia is associated with high rates of death and AMR. AMR in bacteremia is associated with greater infection severity, higher risk for treatment failure, and longer hospital stays, all of which may affect the risk for recurrence.

Few studies have investigated AMR as a potential risk factor for recurrent bacteremia, and all have been limited to the recurrence of infection attributable to the same bacterium that caused the initial infection. Conversely, the few studies not targeting a specific bacterial species or patient population (e.g. those with underlying conditions) and studying risk factors associated with recurrence within 1 year did not consider AMR as a potential risk factor. However, when studying the link between AMR and recurrence, it is important to consider the prolonged microbial imbalance that broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure (i.e. standard bacteremia treatment) can induce on the host microbiome. This imbalance includes ensuing effects on host susceptibility to colonization and infection and effects on selection and duration of carriage.

### Clinical performance of the novel GenMark Dx ePlex blood culture ID Gram-positive panel [^112EdwPu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

The BCID-GP Panel is unique in its inclusion of the group. This Gram-positive spore-forming rod is ubiquitous in the environment, and while it is best known for its association with foodborne infections, it can cause a variety of non-gastrointestinal diseases, some of which are quite severe. Bacteremia can lead to sepsis and associated high mortality. Bloodstream infections are often nosocomial and the result of infected central venous catheters, as this organism can produce significant biofilms. Injection drug users are another population at risk for bacteremia and endocarditis.

Studies of immunocompromised hosts, especially those patients with hematological malignancies, have shown complicated outcomes, including metastatic neurological events such as meningoencephalitis and cerebral abscesses. Given its propensity for severe infections in hospitalized patients and its antimicrobial resistance profile due to broad beta-lactamase production, more rapid identification of this organism may have a significant impact on the time to appropriate therapy.

### Bacteremia associated with toothbrushing and dental extraction [^114mYjmQ]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations for the prevention of infective endocarditis are based, in part, on studies of bacteremia from dental procedures, but toothbrushing may pose a greater threat. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence, duration, nature, and magnitude of endocarditis-related bacteremia from single-tooth extraction and toothbrushing and to determine the impact of amoxicillin prophylaxis on single-tooth extraction.

- **Methods and results**: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 290 subjects were randomized to (1) toothbrushing, (2) single-tooth extraction with amoxicillin prophylaxis, or (3) single-tooth extraction with an identical placebo. Blood was drawn for bacterial culturing and identification at six time points before, during, and after these interventions. The focus of our analysis was on bacterial species reported to cause infective endocarditis. We identified 98 bacterial species, 32 of which are reported to cause endocarditis. Cumulative incidence of endocarditis-related bacteria from all six blood draws was 23%, 33%, and 60% for the toothbrushing, extraction-amoxicillin, and extraction-placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.0001). Significant differences were identified among the three groups at draws 2, 3, 4, and 5 (all P < 0.05). Amoxicillin resulted in a significant decrease in positive cultures (P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Although amoxicillin has a significant impact on bacteremia resulting from single-tooth extraction, given the greater frequency of oral hygiene, toothbrushing may be a greater threat for individuals at risk for infective endocarditis.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^112T6Th6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically Enterobacterales infections such as those produced by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2024 guidelines recommend meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, or ertapenem as preferred options for treating infections outside of the urinary tract.

- **Carbapenems in critically ill patients**: Administer meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin as the preferred carbapenem for critically ill patients and/or patients experiencing hypoalbuminemia.

- **Transition to oral antibiotics**: Consider transitioning to oral TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin once an appropriate clinical response is achieved, provided susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Impact on clinical outcome of follow-up blood cultures and risk factors for persistent bacteraemia in patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^116CaWLn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). High credibility.

The clinical usefulness of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) in gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSIs) represents a debated issue. The objective was to assess the impact on the clinical outcome of FUBCs in patients with GN-BSI and to predict risk factors for persistent bacteraemia.

- **Data sources**: PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library Database were independently searched until June 24, 2022.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective observational studies, including patients affected by GN-BSIs. Primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality rate, and persistent bloodstream infections were defined as FUBC-positive for the same pathogen isolated from index blood cultures (BCs).

- **Participants**: Hospitalized patients with documented GN-BSIs.

- **Intervention**: Performance of FUBCs (defined as subsequent BCs collected at least 24 hours after index BCs).

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Quality of included studies was independently assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Meta-analysis was performed by pooling odds ratios (OR) retrieved from studies providing adjustment for confounders using a random-effects model with the inverse variance method. Risk factors for persistent bloodstream infections were also assessed.

Results showed that a total of 3747 articles were screened, and 11 observational studies (6 assessing impact on outcome, N = 4631, and 5 investigating risk factors for persistent GN-BSI, N = 2566) were conducted.

### The clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults [^113GNsjv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. These infections should be reassessed periodically due to increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and the acquisition of infections in health care settings other than hospitals.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive blood cultures at three academic medical centers.

- **Results**: Two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. Of the 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% were contamination, and 8% had unknown clinical significance. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. Among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). Most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in hospitals or other health care settings. Crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. Increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or other underlying conditions were noted as additional factors impacting prognosis.

### Bacteremias in liver transplant recipients: shift toward gram-negative bacteria as predominant pathogens [^1118DwbU]. Liver Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

During the 1990s, gram-positive bacteria emerged as major pathogens after liver transplantation. We sought to determine whether the pathogens associated with bacteremias in liver transplant recipients have changed. Patients included 233 liver transplant recipients transplanted between 1989 and 2003. The proportion of all infections due to bacteremias increased significantly over time (P < 0.0001). Of other major infections, a trend toward a decrease in fungal infections (P = 0.089) and a significant decrease in cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (P = 0.0004) were documented. Whereas the proportion of bacteremias due to gram-negatives increased from 25% in the period of 1989–1993 to 51.8% in 1998–03, that of gram-positive bacteria decreased from 75% in the period of 1989–93 to 48.2% in the period of 1998–2003. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent pathogens in bacteremic patients. The incidence of bacteremias due to MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has remained unchanged (P < 0.20); however, that due to enteric gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae, has increased (P = 0.02). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in the quartile were not clonally related. In conclusion, bacteremias as a proportion of all infections in liver transplant recipients have increased significantly over time, due in part to a decline in infections due to other major pathogens, e.g. fungi, primarily Candida species, and CMV. Gram-negative bacteria have emerged as predominant pathogens in bacteremic liver transplant recipients.

### Campylobacter jejuni bacteremia in the term infant: A rare cause of neonatal hematochezia [^116nCXPB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

We learned the following important lessons. First, C. jejuni can cause a Gram-negative spiral bacteremia as neonatal early-onset sepsis which is defined by the onset of symptoms before 7 days of age. Second, taking a family and dietary history is key to diagnosis. Third, recommendations concerning kitchen food handling practices should be provided routinely to pregnant women.

Early-onset sepsis in term infants is decreasing, and Gram-negative spiral organisms are rare pathogens. Campylobacter fetus is better known as a cause of neonatal bacteremia than C. jejuni, and in C. fetus infections, the outcome for the fetus is frequently death. Several studies show that Campylobacter bacteremia is more common in previously healthy young children or older immunocompromised patients. The outcome after C. jejuni bacteremia is usually favorable. The estimated mortality rate in children is very low; however, relapsing Campylobacter bacteremia has been reported in cases of humoral immunodeficiency, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Some previous studies report C. jejuni that is resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides; however, they may be sensitive to aminoglycosides and carbapenems. Thus, early initiation of carbapenem antibiotics is recommended. In this patient, symptoms were mild with hematochezia, and the prognosis was good after treatment with azithromycin.

Family and dietary history taking was important for diagnosis. C. jejuni is one of the most common pathogens that cause enterocolitis in developed countries. By contrast, bacteremia is less common.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia - Systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^116x1utH]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years) with Gram-negative bacteremia during their hospital stay. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence.

Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs. men, non-urinary vs. urinary source, presence vs. absence of hypotension on initial presentation, immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). A fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All three trials had a low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-day treatments [90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91]. Relapse [1.00, 0.50–1.97]; length of hospital stay (P = 0.78); readmission [0.96].

### Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative rods causing bacteremia in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: Intercontinental prospective study of the infectious diseases working party of the European Bone Marrow Transplantation Group [^111H2DCY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

This intercontinental study aimed to study gram-negative rod (GNR) resistance in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

- **Methods**: GNR bacteremias occurring during 6 months post-HSCT (February 2014-May 2015) were prospectively collected and analyzed for rates and risk factors for resistance to fluoroquinolones, noncarbapenem anti-Pseudomonas β-lactams (noncarbapenems), carbapenems, and multidrug resistance.

- **Results**: Sixty-five HSCT centers from 25 countries in Europe, Australia, and Asia reported data on 655 GNR episodes and 704 pathogens in 591 patients (Enterobacteriaceae, 73%; nonfermentative rods, 24%; and 3% others). Half of the GNRs were fluoroquinolone and noncarbapenem resistant; 18.5% were carbapenem resistant; and 35.2% were multidrug resistant. The total resistance rates were higher in allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) compared to autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) patients (P < .001) but similar in community-acquired infections. Noncarbapenem resistance and multidrug resistance were higher in auto-HSCT patients in centers providing fluoroquinolone prophylaxis compared to those not providing it (P < .01). Resistance rates were higher in southeast versus northwest Europe and similar in children and adults, except for higher fluoroquinolone- and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor resistance rates in allo-HSCT adults. Non-Klebsiella Enterobacteriaceae were rarely carbapenem resistant. Multivariable analysis revealed resistance risk factors in allo-HSCT patients: fluoroquinolone resistance was associated with adulthood, prolonged neutropenia, and breakthrough on fluoroquinolones; noncarbapenem resistance was linked to hospital-acquired infections.

### Bacteremia caused by a Helicobacter pullorum-like organism [^111P58ZG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of bacteremia caused by a Helicobacter pullorum-like organism in a 35-year-old man with pyrexia of unknown origin. Culture of blood samples obtained at admission yielded a motile, spiral-shaped gram-negative rod, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified this organism as Helicobacter pullorum-like, showing 23 base differences compared with the recently described "Helicobacter canadensis", a recently proposed group that had previously been classified within H. pullorum. We believe that this is the first report of bacteremia caused by this organism.

### Endocarditis of the native aortic valve caused by Lactobacillus jensenii [^116QRsvg]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli are Gram-positive anaerobic rods or coccobacilli, commonly found as commensals in human mucosa. Rarely, they can cause serious infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), and the most frequently implicated species causing serious infections are L. casei and L. rhamnosus. IE caused by Lactobacillus jensenii is very rare, with only six reported cases so far to the best of our knowledge. We present a case of native aortic valve endocarditis caused by L. jensenii, complicated by root abscess and complete heart block, and requiring emergent surgical intervention.

### PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay for screening and identification of pathogens in sepsis [^114zYUaQ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). High credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of the pathogens involved in bloodstream infections is crucial for the prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, as this can decrease morbidity and mortality rates. A PCR-reverse blot hybridization assay for sepsis, the reverse blot hybridization assay (REBA) Sepsis-ID test, was developed; it uses pan-probes to distinguish Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

In addition, the assay was designed to identify bacteria and fungi using six genus-specific and 13 species-specific probes and uses additional probes for antibiotic resistance genes, such as the mecA gene of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the vanA and vanB genes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The REBA Sepsis-ID test successfully identified clinical isolates and blood culture samples as containing Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, or fungi, and the results matched those obtained with conventional microbiological methods.

- **Test performance**: For the REBA Sepsis-ID test, of the 115 blood culture samples tested, 47 (40.8%) and 49 (42.6%) samples were identified to the species and genus levels, respectively. The remaining 19 samples (16.5%), which included five Gram-positive rods, were identified as Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, or fungi.

- **Antibiotic resistance identification**: The antibiotic resistances of the MRSA and VRE strains were identified using both conventional microbiological methods and the REBA Sepsis-ID test.

In conclusion, the REBA Sepsis-ID test developed for this study is a fast and reliable test for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi in bloodstream infections.

### Gram-positive rod surveillance for early anthrax detection [^11742Wyc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A major public health preparedness challenge is increasing the sensitivity and timeliness of recognizing individual, potentially sentinel cases of category A bioterrorism agent disease. Each category A agent has unique clinical and diagnostic features; no one system can meet the challenge for all agents. For anthrax, we attempted to shorten the time from the occurrence of the earliest specific diagnostic finding — gram-positive rods (GPR) identified by Gram stain of blood or CSF culture — to the notification of the public health system. In doing so, we established an around-the-clock GPR laboratory reporting system with less than one full-time staff position. This system has enhanced rapid communication between CDPH and laboratories and provided baseline information on GPR sepsis epidemiology.

The first system objective was earlier detection of anthrax septicemia and meningitis. Additional anthrax cases have not occurred to test this system, and most Bacillus isolates are attributable to culture contamination. However, through auditing, we determined that 62% of Bacillus isolates identified within 24 hours of inoculation were reported by telephone. Improvement is needed, but through auditing, the system tracks the timeliness and completeness of reporting and speciation of all Bacillus organisms, including potentially the next Bacillus anthracis isolate.

Overcoming laboratory personnel's reticence to report results that are likely spurious culture contaminants has been a challenge in implementing the system. This reticence is reflected by the low reporting rate for Corynebacterium species (i.e. "diphtheroids").

### Gentamicin [^117XT7Ln]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Specimens for bacterial culture should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to gentamicin. Gentamicin may be considered as initial therapy in suspected or confirmed gram-negative infections, and therapy may be instituted before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. The decision to continue therapy with this drug should be based on the results of susceptibility tests, the severity of the infection, and the important additional concepts contained in the BOXED WARNINGS above. If the causative organisms are resistant to gentamicin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted.

In serious infections when the causative organisms are unknown, gentamicin may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin-type or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. If anaerobic organisms are suspected as etiologic agents, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with gentamicin. Following the identification of the organism and its susceptibility, appropriate antibiotic therapy should then be continued.

Gentamicin has been used effectively in combination with carbenicillin for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been found effective when used in conjunction with a penicillin-type drug for the treatment of endocarditis caused by group D streptococci. Gentamicin injection has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections.

### Weissella confusa (basonym: Lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: A case report [^112sKM2K]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus leichmannii. The literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by Weissella confusa (basonym: Lactobacillus confusus), but the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. We describe a case of W. confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. This procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. He subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition.

He later developed an Enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. Three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia.

At the present admission, he had fever (T(max), 39.5 degrees C) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. Blood cultures grew K. pneumoniae and W. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). Imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. A culture of the patient's Hickman catheter tip was negative. The patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. His condition improved, and

This case reviews the clinical course of an elderly woman on chronic total parenteral nutrition who developed sepsis secondary to a rare, newly described gram-negative rod known as Phytobacter ursingii. The patient noticed a leak in her Hickman catheter when infusing her nutrition. Twenty-four hours following a new catheter was replaced, the patient developed fevers, chills, and weakness. She presented to the hospital with hypotension and tachycardia, meeting shock criteria. Blood cultures grew P. ursingii, and the diagnosis of septic shock was confirmed. Susceptibilities informed antibiotic coverage, and she ultimately improved within the next 48 hours.

### Between community and hospital: Healthcare-associated gram-negative bacteremia among hospitalized patients [^114aE7GF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

Healthcare-associated, community-acquired bacteremia is a subcategory of community-acquired bacteremia distinguished by recent exposure of the patient to the healthcare system before hospital admission. Our objective was to apply this category to a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with gram-negative bacteremia to determine differences in the epidemiological characteristics, treatment, and outcome of community-acquired bacteremia; healthcare-associated, community-acquired bacteremia; and hospital-acquired bacteremia.

- **Design**: A 6-month prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: A 1,250-bed tertiary care hospital.

- **Patients**: Adults hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia.

- **Results**: Among 250 patients, 160 (64.0%) had bacteremia within 48 hours after admission; 132 (82.5%) of these were considered to have healthcare-associated, community-acquired bacteremia, according to previously published criteria. For patients with healthcare-associated, community-acquired bacteremia, compared with patients with community-acquired bacteremia, malignancies (59 [44.7%] of 132 patients vs 3 [10.7%] of 28 patients; p = 0.001), open wounds at admission (42 [31.8%] vs 3 [10.7%]; p = 0.02), and intravascular catheter-related infections (26 [19.7%] vs 0; p = 0.009) were more frequent. Escherichia coli as a causative agent was less frequent (16 [57.1%] vs 33 [25.0%]; p = 0.001). There was no difference between these two groups in inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment (36 [27.3%] vs 6 [21.4%]; p = 0.5) and hospital mortality (18 [13.6%] vs 2 [7.1%]; p = 0.5).

### Direct screening of blood by PCR and pyrosequencing for a 16S rRNA gene target from emergency department and intensive care unit patients being evaluated for bloodstream infection [^114UiKnn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the results of PCR/pyrosequencing to those of culture for detecting bacteria directly from blood. DNA was extracted from 1,130 blood samples from 913 patients suspected of bacteremia (enrollment criteria were physician-ordered blood culture and complete blood count [CBC]), and 102 controls (healthy blood donors). Real-time PCR assays for beta-globin and Universal 16S rRNA gene targets were performed on all 1,232 extracts.

Specimens identified by Universal 16S rRNA gene PCR/pyrosequencing as containing staphylococci, streptococci, or enteric Gram-negative rods had target-specific PCR/pyrosequencing performed. Amplifiable beta-globin (melting temperature [Tm], 87.2°C ± 0.2°C) occurred in 99.1% (1,120/1,130) of patient extracts and 100% (102/102) of controls. Concordance between PCR/pyrosequencing and culture was 96.9% (1,085/1,120) for Universal 16S rRNA gene targets, with positivity rates of 9.4% (105/1,120) and 11.3% (126/1,120), respectively.

Bacteria cultured included staphylococci (59/126, 46.8%), Gram-negative rods (34/126, 27%), streptococci (32/126, 25.4%), and a Gram-positive rod (1/126, 0.8%). All controls screened negative by PCR/pyrosequencing. Clinical performance characteristics (95% confidence interval [CI]) for Universal 16S rRNA gene PCR/pyrosequencing included sensitivity of 77.8% (69.5 to 84.7), specificity of 99.3% (98.6 to 99.7), positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.3% (86.8 to 97.3), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.2% (96.0 to 98.2).

Bacteria were accurately identified in 77.8% (98/126) of culture-confirmed sepsis samples.

### Pasteurella infections in South Korea and systematic review and meta-analysis of Pasteurella bacteremia [^117WbwF5]. Emerging infectious diseases (2024). Low credibility.

We included a total of 283 cases in the study, with 70 from hospital patients with complete data and 213 cases from the main reference laboratory with basic information. We observed an increase in the number of infections caused by Pasteurella spp. from 2018 (n = 46) to 2022 (n = 72); this increase was significant based on the national population data extracted from the Korean Statistical Information Service (p = 0.012). The median number of cases per year was 55.

The predominant species were P. multocida (68.9%, 195/283) and P. canis (25.4%, 72/283), both contributing to the increase in infections. The median age of patients with positive culture results was 52.0 years. The number of Pasteurella isolation samples was higher in women (66.4%, 188/283) than in men (33.6%, 95/283). Most cases were observed in patients in the 50‒59-year age group. The ratio of female to male patients was the highest (3.4:1) for patients aged 20‒29 years.

Most patients had a history of companion animal exposure (88.6%, 62/70); half had a history of dog exposure, and 38.7% (24/62) had cat exposure. The rate of polymicrobial infection was 25.7% (18/70). The detected isolates included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Actinomyces spp. (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 1), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Dermabacter hominis (n = 1). The rate of hospitalization was 54.3% (38/70). We noted no significant differences in characteristics between inpatients and outpatients.

### Clostridium butyricum bacteremia associated with probiotic use, Japan [^113mjyDP]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

We detected 5 blood culture–positive Clostridium butyricum bacteremia cases (0.08%) from a total of 6,576 persons who had blood cultures positive for any bacteria, resulting in 7,484 total clinical strains, including bacteria other than C. butyricum. Bacteremia developed in all 5 patients during hospitalization; 3 patients were women and 2 were men.

- **Patient status**: Four patients were immunocompromised: 2 had undergone transplantation, 1 was undergoing chemotherapy for esophageal and gastric cancers, and 1 was receiving multiple immunosuppressive treatments for dermatomyositis. Two of the 5 patients also had end-stage kidney disease and were on dialysis.

- **Clinical procedures**: The Charlson Comorbidity Index scores ranged from 1 to 6 points for each patient. Three patients underwent catheterization with either a central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter.

- **Probiotic use**: Four patients were taking prescribed MIYA-BM at the time of bacteremia diagnosis, and 1 patient (no. 2) had been prescribed a different probiotic containing C. butyricum 1 month before the diagnosis of bacteremia. All 4 patients taking MIYA-BM had been prescribed it more than 1 week prior to hospitalization, and MIYA-BM was discontinued following the diagnosis of bacteremia in all these patients. Despite a detailed review of the medical records, we were unable to identify the specific reason for prescribing probiotics in 2 patients.

All 5 patients had fever and abdominal symptoms, such as diarrhea and pain. One patient (no. 3) with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia died within 90 days.

Bacteremia is associated with high mortality, especially when the site of infection is unknown. While conventional imaging usually focuses on specific body parts, FDG-PET/CT visualizes hypermetabolic foci throughout the body.

- **Purpose**: To investigate the ability of FDG-PET/CT to detect the site of infection and its clinical impact in bacteremia of unknown origin with catalase-negative Gram-positive cocci (excluding pneumococci and enterococci) or Staphylococcus aureus (BUOCSA).

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified 157 patients with 165 episodes of BUOCSA, who subsequently underwent FDG-PET/CT. Data were collected from medical records. Decisions regarding important sites of infection in patients with bacteremia were based on the entire patient course and served as reference diagnosis for comparison with FDG-PET/CT findings. FDG-PET/CT was considered to have high clinical impact if it correctly revealed site(s) of infection in areas not assessed by other imaging modalities, if other imaging modalities were negative or equivocal in these areas, or if it established a new clinically relevant diagnosis or led to a change in antimicrobial treatment.

- **Results**: FDG-PET/CT detected sites of infection in 56.4% of cases and had high clinical impact in 47.3%. It was the first imaging modality to identify sites of infection in 41.1% of bacteremia cases, led to a change of antimicrobial therapy in 14.7%, and established a new diagnosis unrelated to bacteremia in 9.8%. Detection rate and clinical impact were not significantly influenced by the duration of antimicrobial treatment prior to imaging.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Pp29V]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections represent a formidable clinical challenge and are associated with major morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 2.9 million deaths per year. These infections can result from various causes, including primary bacteremia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and infections secondary to other foci such as the urinary tract, respiratory tract, or intra-abdominal sites. Blood culture is the reference standard for the detection of these microorganisms in blood. The etiological agents are diverse, including Gram-positive bacilli (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and fungi (e.g. Candida species).

The treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections has long involved the use of antibiotics, with longer-term antibiotic regimens still the standard of care. The aim has been to ensure complete eradication of the bacteria from the bloodstream and deep-seated foci of infection, and to prevent relapse or recurrence of the infection. However, in recent years, concerns have been mounting regarding the consequences of extended antibiotic exposure.

Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat. Prolonged use of antibiotics in the treatment of bloodstream infections significantly contributes to the selection and spread of resistant organisms. Extended antibiotic courses increase the likelihood of the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, which can lead to treatment failures and the need for more toxic and expensive alternative therapies.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia - Systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^111VHV6F]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

In this individual patient data meta-analysis of three RCTs involving a total of 1,182 patients, we observed no significant difference in 90- or 30-day mortality between 7 and 14 days of antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia. Other patient-related outcomes, such as bacteremia relapse, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, and local or distant complications, also showed no significant difference. Furthermore, the emergence of resistance and adverse events did not differ significantly between short and long therapy arms, although the number of events was low and follow-up duration limited to 90 days.

Analyzing this extensive database for subgroup analysis, we found no significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics in the following subgroups: women vs. men; non-urinary vs. urinary source of bacteremia; presence vs. absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised vs. non-immunocompromised patients; and age above vs. below 65.

Shorter antibiotic therapy for Gram-negative bacteremia has demonstrated similar outcomes to longer durations in several observational studies, primarily comparing 5–10 days to longer regimens. Mortality, relapse/recurrence, clinical success, and superinfection rates were similar between longer and shorter therapy in most studies, although some indicated higher rates of superinfection or resistance emergence with longer therapy. In contrast, others reported higher rates of antibiotic re-initiation and C. difficile with shorter regimens.

### Blood volume required for detection of low levels and ultralow levels of organisms responsible for neonatal bacteremia by use of Bactec Peds Plus/F, Plus Aerobic/F medium, and the BD Bactec FX system: an in vitro study [^111mqyw7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

We used an in vitro technique to investigate blood volumes required to detect bacteremia and fungemia with low concentrations of an organism. At 1 to 10 CFU/ml, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, and Candida parapsilosis isolates were detected in volumes as low as 0.5 ml. Detection of Streptococcus agalactiae and detection of bacteremia at < 1 CFU/ml were unreliable.

### The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric bloodstream infections and alteration in antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in Gram-positive bacteria, 2020–2022 [^112RxRdV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The etiology of bloodstream infections (BSIs) varies by region, age group, and the epidemiological status of the pathogens in the community and hospital settings. In a seven-year prospective study conducted in a Children's hospital in England, Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for more episodes of BSIs (66.2%) compared to Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts, which accounted for 31.3% and 2.2%, respectively. In contrast, a South African children's hospital reported a relatively two-fold higher crude frequency of Gram-negative bacteria in pediatric BSIs (60%) as compared to Gram positives (33%) and fungal infections (7%). However, when considering the source of infection, Gram-positive pathogens were more prevalent in community-acquired BSIs, whereas in hospital-acquired sepsis, Gram-negative and fungal pathogens predominated.

Consistent with the observed frequency of Gram-positive BSIs in this study and Gram-negative bacteria in our facility, a retrospective study in an Iranian pediatric hospital from 2015 to 2019 found that BSIs with Gram-negative bacteria were relatively higher than those with Gram-positive bacteria, at 54% and 46%, respectively. Their findings highlighted coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus as leading causes of BSIs. Nevertheless, in aggregate, Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent than Gram-positive bacteria. The involvement of CNS and S. aureus as common causes of Gram-positive BSIs was also reported by other studies.

### Lactobacillus rhamnosus administration causes sepsis in a cardiosurgical patient — is the time right to revise probiotic safety guidelines [^114bT9a3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old female patient developed sepsis resulting from preoperative administration of probiotics following an aortic valve replacement. Blood cultures revealed the causative agent to be the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which has recently been implicated as an emerging aetiology of infection in those taking probiotics. In the past few years, probiotic use in hospitals has increased greatly. However, there is growing global evidence that the use of probiotics in patients with organ failure, immunocompromised status, and dysfunctional gut barrier mechanisms can cause infections. This and other reports show the importance of establishing generally recognized safety guidelines.

### Human case of Atopobium rimae bacteremia [^115wMBFu]. Emerging infectious diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The 16S rDNA maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree shows the relationships of a blood isolate with Atopobium species. GenBank accession numbers are indicated in brackets. The 16S rDNA sequence of Actinomyces bovis was used as an outgroup. Bootstrap values greater than 90% are indicated at the nodes. The scale bar indicates 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position.

In this case, phenotypic identification of the gram-positive bacillus isolated from two blood cultures failed because the definite bacterial species, A. rimae, was not included in the API database used for phenotypic identification. Final identification was achieved within two days by comparing the almost complete 16S rDNA sequence with homologous sequences deposited in GenBank, yielding a 99% sequence similarity. This similarity is regarded as a criterion for accurate identification of bacterial organisms at the species level.

In this patient, two A. rimae isolates were recovered from two different blood-culture bottles drawn 48 hours apart, suggesting that A. rimae was not just a bypassing organism but indeed responsible for septicemia. In these specimens, S. gordonii was also isolated. Both species have been described as part of the oral flora, indicating that these flora were likely the source of mixed septicemia in the patient. A. rimae was isolated as the patient was presenting with clinical features of septic shock, suggesting that A. rimae may have contributed to the shock. Antimicrobial drug treatment based on in vitro A. rimae susceptibility profile, along with reanimation measures, allowed for the patient's recovery.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically concerning the management of P. aeruginosa infections, carbapenem-resistant, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of combination therapy with the new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, such as ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam, or cefiderocol for the treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa.

### Gram-positive rod surveillance for early anthrax detection [^114q7DXs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Among the 498 blood isolates with an available incubation period, 171 (34%) isolates grew in 24 hours versus 54% of reported isolates (p < 0.001) and/or presumed contaminants (65% Corynebacterium spp.). Nearly all (98%) unreported isolates were from clinical laboratories that had reported other isolates but failed to report all isolates. Corynebacterium isolates (all nondiphtheria species, i.e. "diphtheroids") were less likely to be reported than other genera (30% vs. 70%; p < 0.001).

Clostridium isolates grew significantly more quickly in blood culture than other genera (median incubation 15.3 hours) and more frequently in inoculated anaerobic culture bottles (68%) than in aerobic culture bottles (13%). The annualized incidence of clostridial bacteremia was 2.3/100,000 persons, excluding six postmortem cultures likely due to agonal bacteremia. The 67 patients were elderly (median age 76 years) and frequently critically ill, with 22 deaths. Many (56%) had an intra-abdominal source identified. Underlying immune-compromise (49%) and malignancy (60%) were common; 24% had neither condition.

### Association between time to Gram stain positivity and true bacteremia in pediatric emergency department patients [^115i3y3R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Febrile children with positive blood cultures require prompt intervention due to the risk of true bacteremia. However, approximately half of the pediatric positive blood cultures are contaminants. To aid decision-making, we investigated the relationship between time to Gram stain positivity and the likelihood of true bacteremia among children with positive blood cultures in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study using data from 2018 to 2024. Participants included all children with positive blood cultures from a tertiary pediatric ED. True bacteremia was defined using a standardized two-step approach, involving identification of the bacteria responsible and assessing clinical outcomes by two independent examiners. We investigated the correlation between time to Gram stain positivity and the likelihood of true bacteremia by comparing median time to positivity for both groups and reporting the probability of bacteremia based on timing.

- **Results**: Of the 487,222 children presenting to the ED, 746 had positive blood cultures out of 38,541 blood cultures performed, of which 368 were classified as true bacteremia. Median time to Gram stain positivity was significantly shorter for true bacteremia (14 h) compared to contaminants (19 h) (difference: 5 h; 95% CI: 4–6 h). The probability of bacteremia varied from 94% for cultures positive in less than 10 h to 19% for cultures positive after 48 h. Nearly 90% of true bacteremia cases tested positive within 24 h.

### Clinical characteristics of Corynebacterium bacteremia caused by different species, Japan, 2014–2020 [^111rj5wZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Although the most common sources for Corynebacterium bacteremia were unknown or related to CRBSI, other sources accounted for 30% (18 out of 60 cases), including lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Previous studies have reported that C. striatum can cause pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and intra-abdominal infections. Case studies have also reported C. jeikeium as being responsible for infective endocarditis, pacemaker infections, and prosthetic joint infections. Corynebacterium spp. are often reported as coryneform and not fully identified unless they are from sterile specimens because they colonize the skin and are ubiquitous in the environment. We emphasize the value of actively identifying coryneforms in specimens, even if they are not sterile (e.g. sputum or urine), especially in suspected cases of Corynebacterium bacteremia.

The first limitation of our study is that it was a retrospective single-center study. However, we believe that our results can be generalized to other tertiary institutions because the common species of Corynebacterium and the susceptibility results obtained in our study do not differ considerably from others; moreover, our hospital is a referral center providing tertiary care in the region. Second, because of the difficulty of separating true bacteremia from contamination when Corynebacterium spp. are detected in blood culture, it is possible that we may have missed patients with true bacteremia. For example, we may have missed a patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis when Corynebacterium spp. were detected in only one set.

### Carnobacterium divergens bacteremia in woman [^1114XZvi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Carnobacterium spp. are ubiquitous lactic acid bacteria isolated from cold and temperate environments. They are present in food including fish, meat, and dairy products. Only C. divergens and C. maltaromaticum (formerly C. piscicola) are found in dairy products. Carnobacteria are well known for their ability to produce bacteriocins that inhibit Listeria monocytogenes. Because Carnobacterium and Listeria bacteria are psychrotrophic and share the same ecological niche, many studies have highlighted the potential use of carnobacteria as a biopreservative. These bacteria were previously believed to be nonpathogenic for humans. We report a case of C. divergens bacteremia in a woman.

In January 2013, a 57-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, severe undernutrition, and chronic alcoholism was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Avicenne Hospital, Bobigny, France, for diabetic ketoacidosis with an altered level of consciousness. Physical examination revealed a low body temperature (30.1°C) and epigastric tenderness. At admission, a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen showed pneumoperitoneum with low-abundance ascites. Antimicrobial therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin was empirically started. Exploratory laparotomy findings were within normal limits.

### Early invasive Listeria monocytogenes infection after orthotopic liver transplantation: Case report and review of the literature [^1165AJBp]. Liver Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Infection with Listeria monocytogenes is rare, with a reported annual incidence of 4.4 cases per million individuals. It is caused by a gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium (Listeria monocytogenes) that can be found in soil, vegetation, water, sewage, and silage, as well as in the feces of humans and animals. This bacterium is a facultative intracellular pathogen with the ability to survive and multiply in phagocytic host cells, even in adverse environmental circumstances.

Listeriosis has rarely been reported after orthotopic liver transplantation. Transplant physicians are often unfamiliar with the clinical presentation of this rare but virulent infection, which accounts for 20%-30% mortality in affected individuals. We present a case of invasive Listeria infection causing bacteremia and peritonitis in the early postoperative period after cadaveric liver transplantation in a previously asymptomatic patient.

### Epidemiology, resistance profiles, and outcomes of bloodstream infections in community-onset sepsis in the United States [^117RKtGE]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

To describe the frequency of positive blood cultures, patterns of pathogens' characteristics, and their resistance profile in patients with blood cultures drawn due to a presumed diagnosis of community-onset sepsis, this study also examines the association between blood culture-positive pathogens and hospital mortality.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Two hundred one U.S. hospitals from 2016 to 2020 using the Premier Healthcare Database.

- **Subjects**: Adult patients presenting with community-onset sepsis who had blood cultures collected within 2 days of hospital admission. We defined sepsis using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Adult Sepsis Event Surveillance criteria.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: We identified 147,061 patients with community-onset sepsis. The number of blood culture-positive sepsis episodes was 21,167 (14%), and the number of nonblood culture-positive sepsis episodes was 20,326 (14%). Among patients with blood culture-positive sepsis, Gram-negative rods were isolated in 55% of patients, and Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 47%. Of those, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 11%, ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales/extended-spectrum β-lactamase was 7%, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales was 1.3%. The crude in-hospital mortality was 17% for culture-negative sepsis, 13% for nonblood culture-positive sepsis, and 17% for blood culture-positive sepsis. In multilevel logistic regression models, compared with culture-negative sepsis, blood culture-positive sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.89).

### Antimicrobial therapy of gram-negative bacteremia at two university-affiliated medical centers [^113uAEqH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To describe antimicrobial prescribing practices and patient outcomes associated with the treatment of aerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia at two university-affiliated medical centers, a retrospective review of medical records was conducted. All adult patients with gram-negative bacteremia (N = 326) from Stanford and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Hospitals were evaluated from September 1, 1996, through August 31, 1997.

Most patient characteristics were similar between institutions. However, patients at Stanford were more likely to have a diagnosis of bone marrow transplantation, liver failure, or poor nutritional status. In contrast, more patients at UCSF had solid organ transplants, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or hypotension. The bacteriology was similar at both sites, with Escherichia coli being the predominant pathogen (139 [43%] of 326). The majority of episodes were community-acquired (67% [218/326]).

- **Treatment variations**: Patients at Stanford were more likely to have been treated empirically with aminoglycosides (28% vs. 7%, P < 0.001) and noncephalosporin beta-lactams (31% vs. 11%, P < 0.001). In contrast, patients at UCSF were more likely to have received cephalosporins (62% vs. 29%, P < 0.001) and fluoroquinolones (21% vs. 11%, P = 0.02). These patterns continued for definitive therapy.

- **Mortality and risk factors**: Overall mortality was 60 (19%) of 326. Several risk factors were associated with 14-day mortality, including the severity of illness, neutropenia, diabetes mellitus, use of vasopressors, and empiric use of a noncephalosporin beta-lactam.

These findings highlight significant differences in prescribing practices and outcomes between the two institutions.

### Contaminants in blood cultures: Importance, implications, interpretation and prevention [^115yHBuu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the development of new microbiologic technologies, blood cultures (BCs) remain the first-line tool for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections. Their diagnostic value may be affected when microorganisms of questionable evidence are isolated, for example, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus spp., viridans group streptococci, Corynebacterium spp. Propionibacterium spp., and Micrococcus spp. Making a correct diagnosis of pathogenicity versus contamination is challenging.

- **Aims**: The aim is to review ways of dealing with the problem of BC contaminants (BCCs) and to provide practical suggestions to decrease BCC rates.

- **Sources**: PubMed electronic databases and existing reviews were searched up to December 2017 to retrieve relevant publications related to the topic.

- **Contents**: This review describes the burden of BCC and analyzes the main issues and controversies in interpreting the occurrence of potential BC contaminants. It focuses on the best-described approaches to decide whether BCC is present and discusses the different strategies of prevention in adults.

- **Implications**: Each institution should have an efficient policy to prevent BCC, emphasizing the importance of following guidelines for prescribing and collecting BCs. Training healthcare workers should focus on the detrimental influence on patient care and highlight the work and costs due to contaminants. The accurate differentiation of a contaminant from a true pathogen relies on a multidisciplinary approach and the clinical judgment of experienced practitioners.

### Bloodstream infections: a trial of the impact of different methods of reporting positive blood culture results [^112vVDnx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The impact of how positive blood culture results are reported on the evolution of bloodstream infections (BSIs) has not been assessed.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with BSIs into three groups: group A (physicians received a conventional report), group B (physicians received a conventional report and a written alert on the chart with clinical advice), and group C (physicians received the above plus oral clinical advice). The adequacy of therapy before and after receipt of the different types of information was assessed.

- **Results**: Overall, 297 episodes (109 in group A, 99 in group B, and 89 in group C) were studied. Patients who received inadequate treatment before receiving microbiological information had a longer mean (± SD) hospital stay (27.2 ± 32.4 vs. 19.4 ± 15.8 days; p = 0.017), a higher mean risk of *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (8.3% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.013), a higher mean overall mortality rate (30.8% vs. 19.4%; p = 0.025), and a higher mean risk of infection-related mortality (23.3% vs. 13.6%; p = 0.031). After receipt of microbiological reports, recommendations for changes in therapy were issued for patients in groups B (52.3%) and C (53.1%). For groups A, B, and C, the proportions of days on which adequate treatment was received were 66.3%, 92.1%, and 91.2% (p < 0.001); the mean numbers of defined daily doses of appropriate antibiotic therapy were 16.4, 22.2, and 20.7 (P = 0.003); the mean durations of hospital stay were 19.8, 23.6, and 24.1 days (P = 0.761); and the mortality rates during the late period were 12.9%, 15.6%, and incomplete data.

### Paenibacillus macerans pseudobacteremia resulting from contaminated blood culture bottles in a neonatal intensive care unit [^111qNdtF]. American Journal of Infection Control (2001). Low credibility.

Paenibacillus species are gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming aerobes that are abundant in nature and closely related to Bacillus. Between June 24 and June 30, 1999, eight neonates in our neonatal intensive care unit had positive blood cultures for Paenibacillus macerans. This cluster of positive blood cultures with an unusual pathogen suggested a pseudoepidemic. Investigation revealed that the most likely etiology of the pseudobacteremia was environmental contamination of the rubber stoppers in blood culture bottles. This was confirmed by environmental sampling and simulated inoculation studies. This pseudobacteremia outbreak highlights the importance of adhering to well-established methods for blood culture collection and ongoing infection control surveillance.

### Bacteraemia caused by Lactobacillus casei in a patient after cardiac surgery. A case report [^114wpJPW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The discussion and conclusions highlight that cases of Lactobacillus bacteraemia are sporadic. Although lactic acid bacilli cause only 0.1% of the cases, the mortality rate can reach as high as 30%. An analysis of 129 instances of lactobacillemia revealed that the most frequently isolated species were L. rhamnosus and L. casei. Similar data was presented by the National Public Health Institute in Finland, which indicated that more than half (54%) of bacteraemia cases caused by Lactobacillus spp. were attributed to L. rhamnosus, with 19% linked to L. fermentum and 15% to L. casei.

Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, primarily with vancomycin, heart valve defects, organ transplants, prolonged venous access, surgeries of the respiratory and digestive tracts, as well as excessive consumption of milk, dairy products, and probiotics, may increase the risk of lactic acid bacilli infection. These infections often occur in immunocompromised patients treated with corticosteroids or when a disease reduces natural immune mechanisms. Moreover, increased vascular permeability and microangiopathy, as seen in diabetes mellitus, may predispose individuals to increased susceptibility to Lactobacilli infection. The prophylactic use of probiotics, including Lactobacillus, has not been proven effective in preventing lung infections in adults requiring critical care and mechanical ventilation.

In the present case, a correlation was observed between two factors: a severe course of the disease, manifesting as multi-organ failure, and excessive consumption of commercially available food products containing strains of L. casei.

### Rapid versus standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide treatment of bloodstream infection [^116Xox6W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are defined as the presence of viable bacteria or fungi in the blood associated with infection. Blood culture serves as the reference standard for detecting these microorganisms. BSIs can be categorized as primary infections, which are not secondary to an infection at another body site, and secondary infections, where organisms are seeded from a site-specific infection, such as pneumonia. In primary BSIs, organisms can enter the bloodstream through broken skin or mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, or by directly introducing contaminated material.

Positive blood cultures do not always indicate BSI; they may represent contamination or the transient presence of bacteria in the blood that do not cause clinical illness.

Incidence estimates for BSIs vary from 166 to 204 episodes per 100,000 person-years in North America and Europe. BSI is common in sub-Saharan Africa, with a reported incidence of 574 episodes per 100,000 person-years, with a higher risk observed in the immunocompromised population.

BSIs are often associated with sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can occur even in the absence of detectable bloodstream infection. Given the complex nature of this condition and its diagnosis, precise estimates for the global burden of disease from sepsis remain challenging to determine.
