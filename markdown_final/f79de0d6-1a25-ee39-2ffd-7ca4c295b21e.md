## Question

High phosphate EKG changes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hyperphosphatemia causes characteristic EKG changes and, if so, what those changes are and how to interpret them clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct electrophysiologic effects of phosphate on the myocardium. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources describe a reproducible EKG pattern attributable to phosphate itself. Next, I will examine indirect mechanisms, especially hypocalcemia driven by hyperphosphatemia, that could alter the EKG. After that, I should review clinical contexts where hyperphosphatemia and EKG abnormalities co-occur, such as tumor lysis syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, to see if the EKG changes are actually due to potassium or calcium rather than phosphate. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and outline management implications, including when to monitor and treat.

> Let me first confirm the core question: does hyperphosphatemia itself produce a recognizable EKG signature, or are observed EKG changes in hyperphosphatemic patients explained by other electrolyte disturbances. I need to check whether any guideline or review attributes specific EKG findings to phosphate excess, and I should be cautious not to conflate effects of potassium and calcium with those of phosphate.

> I will now examine direct myocardial effects of phosphate. Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility. Extracellular phosphate does not directly govern cardiac action potential thresholds in the same way potassium and calcium do, and contemporary reviews of electrolyte-related EKG changes focus on potassium, calcium, and magnesium rather than phosphate, which argues against a direct, reproducible phosphate EKG pattern [^115FMoek] [^113nEQwQ]. Hold on, I should verify whether any high-credibility source lists phosphate-specific EKG changes; I do not find authoritative descriptions of a phosphate-specific EKG pattern, which supports the conclusion that there is no established phosphate EKG signature [^115FMoek].

> Next, I should review indirect mechanisms. Hyperphosphatemia frequently lowers ionized calcium via complexation and inhibition of calcitriol synthesis, and hypocalcemia is well known to prolong the QT interval and predispose to torsades, so a prolonged QTc on EKG in a hyperphosphatemic patient may reflect secondary hypocalcemia rather than a direct phosphate effect on the myocardium [^1152WALU] [^113nEQwQ]. Let me consider whether any clinical series in hypoparathyroidism, where hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia coexist, show QTc changes; indeed, patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism can exhibit mild QTc prolongation, reinforcing that the EKG signal is mediated by calcium rather than phosphate per se [^1157oHf3].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is tumor lysis syndrome or rhabdomyolysis, where hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia travel together. I should double-check whether the life-threatening EKG changes in TLS are attributed to potassium rather than phosphate. Multiple high-credibility oncology and critical care sources emphasize that hyperkalemia drives conduction disturbances and arrhythmias in TLS, while hyperphosphatemia contributes to hypocalcemia and crystal-related injury; the EKG changes are primarily those of hyperkalemia, not a distinct phosphate pattern [^115v3dHs] [^114WKcHn] [^115jUaZ6]. Similarly, in rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is the electrolyte that mandates urgent EKG monitoring and calcium therapy, whereas hyperphosphatemia is managed more conservatively, underscoring that the arrhythmic risk is potassium-mediated rather than phosphate-mediated [^1152WALU] [^112TJxzN].

> I should confirm whether any regulatory or safety documents imply a phosphate-specific EKG pattern. FDA labeling for potassium phosphates warns of hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia with risks of hypotension and organ damage, and it advises ECG monitoring in overdose scenarios, but it does not describe a characteristic phosphate EKG morphology; rather, it highlights arrhythmias from hyperkalemia when potassium salts are used and the hemodynamic and calcification risks from phosphate-calcium interactions, again pointing away from a unique phosphate EKG signature [^112QKu9z] [^114TNw8E] [^112MEp7m]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the absence of a labeled EKG pattern is not absolute proof, but it aligns with the mechanistic and clinical data that fail to identify a reproducible phosphate EKG pattern.

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing a niche exception. There is no established, reproducible EKG pattern attributable to hyperphosphatemia itself. Observed EKG abnormalities in hyperphosphatemic patients are best explained by concurrent electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypocalcemia for QT effects and hyperkalemia for conduction and arrhythmic changes, rather than a direct myocardial effect of phosphate excess [^115FMoek] [^113nEQwQ]. Clinically, if hyperphosphatemia is present, I should actively look for hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia and interpret any EKG changes in that context, rather than attributing them to phosphate per se [^115v3dHs] [^1152WALU].

> Practically, I need to ensure I manage the real threats. In TLS or rhabdomyolysis, prioritize continuous EKG monitoring and aggressive treatment of hyperkalemia when indicated, and correct symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia cautiously to mitigate QT risk while avoiding calcium-phosphate precipitation in injured tissues; these steps address the electrolytes actually driving the EKG changes and arrhythmic risk [^115v3dHs] [^114WKcHn] [^1152WALU]. I should confirm that guidelines advise EKG assessment for hyperkalemia thresholds and clinical instability, which they do, reinforcing that the monitoring target is potassium and clinical status rather than phosphate itself [^111J6iXf] [^1124Vteu].

> In conclusion, I should double-check that my bottom line is precise: hyperphosphatemia does not cause a characteristic EKG pattern. EKG abnormalities in hyperphosphatemic patients reflect concurrent hypocalcemia and/or hyperkalemia, so management should focus on correcting those electrolytes and monitoring the EKG for potassium- and calcium-related effects rather than searching for a nonexistent phosphate-specific EKG signature [^115FMoek] [^113nEQwQ] [^115v3dHs] [^1152WALU].

High phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) **does not cause direct, characteristic ECG changes** [^115FMoek]. Instead, it can precipitate **hypocalcemia** by binding calcium, which leads to **prolonged QT intervals** and increases the risk of torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmias [^1157oHf3]. Hyperphosphatemia also contributes to **ectopic calcification** and vascular injury, which may indirectly promote arrhythmias over time [^1151P8wy]. Clinically, ECG monitoring is indicated when hyperphosphatemia coexists with hypocalcemia or in high-risk settings (e.g. tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis) [^114WKcHn] [^1152WALU], but the ECG changes reflect hypocalcemia rather than a direct phosphate effect [^113nEQwQ].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking hyperphosphatemia to ECG changes

Hyperphosphatemia **does not directly alter cardiac electrophysiology**; its ECG effects are mediated indirectly through interactions with calcium and vascular calcification [^notfound].

---

### Indirect effects via hypocalcemia

- **Calcium-phosphate binding**: Elevated phosphate binds ionized calcium, reducing Ca2+ availability and causing hypocalcemia [^1152WALU].
- **Hypocalcemia and ECG**: Hypocalcemia prolongs ventricular repolarization, causing QT prolongation and increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmias [^1157oHf3].
- **Clinical evidence**: Hypocalcemia from hyperphosphatemia is well documented in tumor lysis syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, where QT prolongation and arrhythmias occur [^115v3dHs] [^1152WALU].

---

### Vascular calcification and cardiac injury

Hyperphosphatemia drives vascular and valvular calcification, which can impair coronary flow, increase stiffness, and promote ischemia and arrhythmias; however, these effects are **chronic and not acutely reflected on ECG** [^1151P8wy].

---

## Specific ECG changes associated with hyperphosphatemia

There are **no ECG changes unique to hyperphosphatemia**; observed abnormalities are due to hypocalcemia or coexisting electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

| **Ecg abnormality** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Prolonged QT interval | Hypocalcemia from phosphate-calcium binding | - Tumor lysis syndrome <br/> - Rhabdomyolysis <br/> - CKD |
| Ventricular arrhythmias (torsades, VT/VF) | Prolonged QT and electrical instability | - Severe hypocalcemia <br/> - Hyperphosphatemia |
| Nonspecific ST-T changes | - Ischemia <br/> - Electrolyte shifts | - Chronic hyperphosphatemia <br/> - Vascular calcification |

---

## Clinical evidence and case reports

- **Tumor lysis syndrome**: Hyperphosphatemia with hypocalcemia causes QT prolongation and arrhythmias; ECG monitoring is standard in TLS [^115v3dHs] [^114WKcHn].
- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia coexist, with arrhythmias driven by calcium effects rather than phosphate itself [^1152WALU].
- **CKD and dialysis**: Chronic hyperphosphatemia is linked to vascular calcification and arrhythmias, but ECG changes are nonspecific and reflect chronic cardiac injury rather than acute phosphate toxicity [^1151P8wy].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **ECG monitoring**: Indicated when hyperphosphatemia coexists with hypocalcemia or in high-risk settings (TLS, rhabdomyolysis, severe CKD) [^114WKcHn] [^1152WALU].
- **Correct hypocalcemia**: Intravenous calcium is used for symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia, especially with QT prolongation or arrhythmias [^112phrys].
- **Treat hyperphosphatemia**: Phosphate binders, dietary restriction, and dialysis (in refractory cases) reduce phosphate and mitigate hypocalcemia and calcification risks [^112PJoq8] [^113PeMxX].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current knowledge

There is a **lack of direct evidence** that hyperphosphatemia alone causes ECG changes; most data are indirect and confounded by hypocalcemia or other electrolytes. The long-term cardiovascular effects of hyperphosphatemia are well described, but acute ECG correlations remain limited [^1151P8wy].

---

High phosphate **does not cause direct ECG changes**; ECG abnormalities in hyperphosphatemia are due to hypocalcemia and chronic cardiovascular injury, not a direct phosphate effect [^notfound]. Management should focus on correcting calcium, reducing phosphate, and monitoring ECG in high-risk scenarios [^112phrys] [^112PJoq8] [^114WKcHn].

Management of hyperkalemia — triage and EKG-based severity classification states that aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of elevation and the presence or absence of electrocardiogram (EKG) findings; outpatients with acute hyperkalemia who have a potassium concentration of > 6.0 mmol/L or any new EKG changes should be referred to a facility with cardiac monitoring, usually an emergency department; a KDIGO Controversies Conference suggests classifying acute hyperkalemia as Mild: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L without EKG changes, Moderate: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L with EKG changes or 6.0–6.4 mmol/L without EKG changes, and Severe: 6.0–6.4 mmol/L with EKG changes or > 6.5 mmol/L regardless of EKG findings; the asterisk denotes "or upper limit of normal range", and they acknowledge it is not known whether EKG changes are sensitive in predicting potentially lethal arrhythmia.

Discussion

In rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte abnormalities occur as a result of cellular component release associated with induced AKI. Electrolyte abnormalities that occur due to rhabdomyolysis are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

AKI in rhabdomyolysis is often associated with excessive potassium levels and correlates with the volume of muscle destruction. Baseline levels of potassium and all pertinent electrolytes should be evaluated when the possibility of rhabdomyolysis development is present. Hyperkalemia that occurs in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI occurs early in the course of the disease process and should be monitored closely. Potassium levels should be serially evaluated. Patients with high potassium levels (> 6 mmol/L) should have cardiac monitoring. ECG should be obtained and assessed for manifestations of severe hyperkalemia (QRS widening, small p waves, and severe arrhythmias). Hypocalcemia aggravates the electrical effects of hyperkalemia and should be aggressively treated with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in this scenario. Elevated potassium levels should be treated with insulin and glucose infusions. Consider administration of a β-2 adrenergic agent such as albuterol via aerosol inhalation. Lastly, consider potassium removal via cation exchange resin or dialysis as indicated.

Similar to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia occurs as a result of phosphate release from damaged muscle cells. High levels of phosphate may be problematic because phosphate binds to calcium and this complex deposits in the soft tissues. Additionally, by inhibiting 1α-hydroxylase, hyperphosphatemia inhibits calcitriol formation and thus limits formation of the active form of vitamin D. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia should be done with caution since treatment involves administration of a calcium chelator which can increase precipitation of calcium phosphate in injured muscle. Early hyperphosphatemia typically decreases as phosphate is excreted in the urine.

Hypocalcemia occurs early in rhabdomyolysis due to calcium entry into damaged cells and calcium phosphate deposition in necrotic muscle. Early hypocalcemia treatment in rhabdomyolysis should be avoided unless patients are symptomatic or severe hyperkalemia is present. Correction of hypocalcemia with calcium chloride or gluconate should be avoided since calcium deposition may occur in injured muscle. During the recovery phase, serum calcium levels return to normal and may rebound, causing hypercalcemia due to release of calcium from injured muscle and mild secondary hyperparathyroidism secondary to AKI.

Hypermagnesemia seen with rhabdomyolysis is infrequent but when it occurs is typically in association with AKI and should be treated accordingly with hemodialysis.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Hyperphosphatemia

Administration of excessive doses of intravenous potassium phosphates as a single dose ranging from approximately 50 to 270 mmol phosphorus and/or at rapid infusion rates (over 1 to 3 hours) has resulted in death, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia (including QT prolongation), hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, seizures, and tetany.

Hyperphosphatemia is particularly a risk in patients with renal failure.

Hyperphosphatemia leads in turn to hypocalcemia, which may be severe, and to ectopic calcification, particularly in patients with initial hypercalcemia. Tissue calcification may cause hypotension and organ damage and result in acute renal failure.

Hyperkalemia

Excessive administration of phosphates given as potassium salts may also cause hyperkalemia. Manifestations of hyperkalemia include:

Disturbances in cardiac conduction and arrhythmias, including bradycardia, heart block, asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and death.
Hypotension.
Muscle weakness including paresthesia, muscular and respiratory paralysis.

Management

In the event of overdosage, discontinue infusions containing potassium phosphates immediately and institute general supportive measures, including ECG monitoring, laboratory monitoring, and correction of serum electrolyte concentrations, especially potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.

### Retrospective review of the frequency of ECG changes in hyperkalemia [^115FYLdt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Experimentally elevated potassium causes a clear pattern of electrocardiographic changes, but, clinically, the reliability of this pattern is unclear. Case reports suggest patients with renal insufficiency may have no electrocardiographic changes despite markedly elevated serum potassium. In a prospective series, 46% of patients with hyperkalemia were noted to have electrocardiographic changes, but no clear criteria were presented.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Charts were reviewed for patients who were admitted to a community-based hospital with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Inclusion criteria were potassium ≥ 6 with a concurrent electrocardiogram. Data were abstracted regarding comorbid diagnoses, medications, and treatment. Potassium concentrations were documented along with other electrolytes, pH, creatinine, and biomarkers of cardiac injury. Coincident, baseline, and follow-up electrocardiograms were examined for quantitative and qualitative changes in the QRS and T waves as well as the official cardiology readings.

Results

Ninety patients met criteria; two thirds were older than 65, and 48% presented with renal failure. Common medications included beta blockers, insulin, and aspirin; 80% had potassium < 7.2. The electrocardiogram was insensitive for diagnosing hyperkalemia. Quantitative assessments of T-wave amplitude corroborated subjective assessments of T-wave peaking; however, no diagnostic threshold could be established. The probability of electrocardiographic changes increased with increasing potassium. The correlation between readers was moderate.

Conclusions

Given the poor sensitivity and specificity of electrocardiogram changes, there is no support for their use in guiding treatment of stable patients. Without identifiable electrocardiographic markers of the risk for complications, management of hyperkalemia should be guided by the clinical scenario and serial potassium measurements.

5.1	Serious Cardiac Adverse Reactions with Bolus or Rapid Intravenous Administration

Intravenous administration of potassium phosphates to correct hypophosphatemia in single-doses of phosphorus 50 mmol and greater and/or at rapid infusion rates (over 1 to 3 hours) has resulted in death, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia (including QT prolongation), hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and seizures [see Overdosage (10)].

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

5.2	Hyperkalemia

Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with renal impairment and are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium. Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and dosage adjustment is required for patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium.

When administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for infusion rates higher than 10 mEq/hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: electrolyte abnormalities [^115FMoek]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Because myocyte depolarization and repolarization depend on intra- and extracellular shifts in ion gradients, abnormal serum electrolyte levels can have profound effects on cardiac conduction and the electrocardiogram (EKG). Changes in extracellular potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels can change myocyte membrane potential gradients and alter the cardiac action potential. These changes can result in incidental findings on the 12-lead EKG or precipitate potentially life-threatening dysrhythmias. We will review the major electrocardiographic findings associated with abnormalities of the major cationic contributors to cardiac conduction-potassium, calcium and magnesium.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Potassium additives and bioavailability: are we missing something in hyperkalemia management? [^117HsT2J]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are common metabolic disturbances in chronic kidney disease. Management may include instructions on a low-potassium or low-phosphorus diet, respectively. Low-phosphorus diet teaching includes information on phosphorus additives in addition to naturally occurring phosphorus food sources. Phosphorus additives are known to be more bioavailable compared with naturally occurring phosphorus. The concentration of phosphorus can also be much higher in processed foods compared with whole foods. Similar considerations may also be needed for dietary potassium teaching. The use of potassium additives in processed foods is growing, and when additives are used, the potassium concentration far exceeds naturally occurring potassium. Evidence also suggests, much like phosphate, potassium additives are more bioavailable than potassium found in whole foods. Clinicians and patients need to be aware of these changes in the food source to ensure potassium diet teaching is effective and safe.

### Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with acute pancreatitis [^1151qVGa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Electrocardiographic abnormalities may be associated with acute pancreatitis (AP).

Goals

To describe the electrocardiographic disturbances present in patients with AP and to assess differences in electrolyte and pancreatic enzyme levels among patients with and without these abnormalities.

Study

Fifty-one consecutive patients with AP and without preexisting heart disease underwent a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) and a serum electrolyte profile. EKG abnormalities were summarized in terms of frequencies, means, and standard deviations. Electrolyte and enzyme levels were summarized as medians. Differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

Twenty-eight patients (55%) had an abnormal EKG. Nonspecific changes of repolarization (20%), sinus tachycardia (12%), and left anterior hemiblock (10%) were the most frequent disturbances. Patients with sinus tachycardia had lower levels of phosphorus (2.3 vs. 3.4 mEq/L, P < 0.004) and calcium (8.4 vs. 9.1 mg/dL, P < 0.02). A tendency to higher levels of potassium and lower levels of phosphorus was found in patients with sinus tachycardia and nonspecific changes of repolarization, respectively. No differences were found in amylase, pancreatic amylase, or lipase among patients with normal and abnormal EKG.

Conclusions

More than 50% of the patients with AP had EKG abnormalities, and these changes could be related to electrolyte alterations.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^112TJxzN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical evidence supporting the use of loop diuretics in this setting is sparse and composed primarily of case reports. As such, it cannot be interpreted with any confidence. Although loop diuretics have been shown to reduce metabolic demand and oxygen consumption by the proximal tubular cells, they have also been shown to worsen renal afferent arteriole vasoconstriction, acidify urine, and promote aggregation of the Tamm-Horsfall protein within the tubular lumen. Taken together, the pathophysiologic consequences of loop diuretics may potentiate precipitation of myoglobin and worsen the distal tubular obstruction. Additionally, hypokalemia due to loop diuretic use has been reported to result in hypokalemic myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

What electrolyte abnormalities should be expected and what are the optimal methods for management?

Recommendation

Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are electrolyte abnormalities most commonly encountered when treating rhabdomyolysis. Correcting biochemical equilibrium and electrolytes during rhabdomyolysis should proceed meticulously to avoid complications from treatment. Hyperkalemia is the electrolyte abnormality that requires timely correction to reduce risk of cardiac arrhythmia.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

KDIGO 2017 CKD‑MBD update — serum phosphate targets — In patients with CKD G3a–G5D, we suggest lowering elevated phosphate levels toward the normal range (2C). The 2009 recommendations suggested maintaining serum phosphate in the normal range for CKD G3a–G5 (2C) and lowering elevated phosphate levels toward the normal range for CKD G5D (2C). The rationale notes an absence of data supporting benefit of maintaining normal phosphate in CKD G3a–G4 and states that treatment should aim at overt hyperphosphatemia.

### Relation of the Brugada phenocopy to hyperkalemia (from the international registry on Brugada phenocopy) [^111Qsyr2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Brugada phenocopies (BrPs) are clinical entities that differ in etiology from true congenital Brugada syndrome but have identical electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. Hyperkalemia is known to be one of the causes of BrP. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics and evolution of hyperkalemia-induced BrP. Data from 27 cases of hyperkalemia-induced BrP were collected from the International Registry at www.brugadaphenocopy.com. Data were extracted from publications. Of the 27 patients included in the analysis, 18 (67%) were male; mean age was 53 ± 15 years (range 31 to 89). Mean serum potassium concentration was 7.45 ± 0.89mmol/L. Type-1 Brugada ECG pattern was observed in 21 cases (78%), whereas 6 cases (22%) showed a type-2 Brugada ECG pattern. The Brugada ECG pattern resolved once the hyperkalemia was corrected, with no arrhythmic events. Estimated time to resolution was 7 ± 3 hours. In 4 cases (16%), a concurrent metabolic abnormality was detected: 3 (11%) presented with acidosis, 2 (7%) with hyponatremia, 1 (4%) with hypocalcaemia, 1 (4%) with hyperphosphatemia, and 1 (4%) with hyperglycemia. In 7 cases (26%), provocative testing using sodium channel blockers was performed, and all failed to reproduce a BrS ECG pattern (BrP class A). Additionally, no sudden cardiac death or malignant ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Hyperkalemia was found a common cause of BrP in our International Registry. The Brugada ECG pattern appears to occur at high serum potassium concentrations (> 6.5mmol/L). The ECG normalizes within hours of correcting the electrolyte imbalance. Importantly, hyperkalemia-induced BrP has not been associated with sudden cardiac death or ventricular arrhythmia.

### Electrocardiography is unreliable to detect potential lethal hyperkalemia in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease [^114eNVqR]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis patients with hypercalcemia are less likely to manifest the usual electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalemia than in those with normal renal function. This study was conducted to determine whether electrocardiography (ECG) is a reliable indicator to detect severe life-threatening hyperkalemia in non-dialysis CKD patients. The study was conducted at three referral university hospitals between July 2017 and June 2018. Severe hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 8.0 mEq/L. Serum potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, and creatinine concentrations were measured and simultaneous 12-lead ECG was obtained. Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving renal replacement therapy were excluded. Also excluded were patients with the usual ECG abnormalities to hyperkalemia. Of the 438 patients screened, 10 (2.3%) aged 2–14 years with severe hyperkalemia and normal ECG findings were identified. Median serum potassium level was 8.6 mEq/L (range 8.2–9.0). All had regular sinus rhythm. P, QRS, ST segment, T morphology, PR and QT interval, and QRS duration were all normal. Hyperkalemia was associated with CKD, metabolic acidosis, and hypercalcemia in all cases. Therapy with intravenous 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, glucose, insulin, calcium, and salbutamol corrected the hyperkalemia in 7 patients. The remaining three patients evinced arrhythmias requiring hemodialysis. Although rare, non-dialysis CKD patients with hypercalcemia may not manifest the usual electrographic abnormalities associated with hyperkalemia. Thus, a normal ECG finding in non-dialysis CKD patients should be interpreted with caution.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Elevated phosphate levels in CKD-a direct threat for the heart [^1151P8wy]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevations in systemic phosphate levels, also called hyperphosphatemia, occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and during the normal aging process and are associated with various pathologies, such as cardiovascular injury. Experimental studies suggest that at high serum concentrations, phosphate can induce osteogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells and contribute to vascular calcification. However, the precise underlying mechanism leading to cardiovascular injury is not well understood. Here we discuss how elevations in extracellular phosphate levels could potentially affect cells and intracellular reactions and functions in general. We then zoom in on the heart to discuss whether hyperphosphatemia can have direct pathologic actions beyond inducing vascular calcification. Furthermore, we discuss myocardial calcification as a pathologic event that has not been described and studied in greater detail, but that seems to occur in the context of hyperphosphatemia-induced pathologic cardiac remodeling, as observed in dialysis patients.

### Impact of serum phosphate changes on in-hospital mortality [^112P3PjJ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Phosphate is an essential element for calcium-phosphate-parathyroid homeostasis, which plays an essential role in many cellular metabolisms. Serum phosphate levels have been identified as strong predictors on clinical outcomes, including hospital mortality. While hypophosphatemia is shown to be independently associated with increased mortality among critically ill patients, malnourished individuals, and patients with sepsis, hyperphosphatemia is associated with poor clinical outcomes including mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD), hemodialysis, acute coronary syndrome, and general patient population.

While previous studies have focused on the impact of serum phosphate disorders (hypophosphatemia and hyperphosphatemia), knowledge about the significance of changes in serum phosphate level and all-cause mortality remains scarce. Among patients on maintenance hemodialysis, a recent study demonstrated that high variability of serum phosphate was independently correlated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, while stable serum phosphate levels and low serum phosphate variability were associated with reduced patient mortality. However, the impacts of serum phosphate changes in hospitalized patients remain unclear.

Therefore, we conducted this cohort study to assess the association between alteration of serum phosphate levels and in-hospital mortality in all hospitalized patients.

### Association of time-updated plasma calcium and phosphate with graft and patient outcomes after kidney transplantation [^117A8Ad5]. American Journal of Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous studies suggested that hypercalcemia might lead to nephrocalcinosis, which impairs renal function in several ways, including tubular obstruction and back‐leak, vasoconstriction, and hypoxia. Interestingly, we did not find a significant association of hypercalcemia with DCGF, in line with Moore and colleagues. At the same time, chronic hypercalcemia may promote vascular calcification, which may enhance cardiovascular risk. Interestingly, successful kidney transplantation seems to slow the progression of coronary calcification in some, but not all patients. Hypercalcemia has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in CKD and dialysis patients, but data in kidney transplant recipients have been scarce. Our study showed a consistent association between hypercalcemia and an increased all‐cause mortality risk. Hypocalcemia, on the other hand, might induce electrocardiographic changes, such as prolongation of the QTc interval, and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in ESRD patients. We did not observe a significant relationship between hypocalcemia and clinical outcomes in this study.

Several previous studies have demonstrated the associations of plasma phosphate with an increased risk of (death‐censored) graft failure and all‐cause mortality. Mechanistically, hyperphosphatemia, particularly when combined with higher calcium levels, may promote calcium‐phosphate crystal deposition in the tubular epithelium, contributing to the risk of graft failure, and in the vascular wall leading to vascular calcification. We found that plasma phosphate levels above the upper limit of normal are associated with an increased risk of all‐cause mortality. In a previous study we found that posttransplant hypophosphatemia, based on the lowest intraindividual plasma phosphate level, was associated with a lower DCGF risk. Surprisingly, in the current analyses, using all available phosphate data in a time‐updated analysis with a median follow‐up of 16 years and upon adjustment for time‐updated eGFR, hypophosphatemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of DCGF, compared to normophosphatemia. Although this result could not be confirmed in sensitivity analyses and therefore should be interpreted with caution, it could be speculated that hypophosphatemia triggered phosphate supplementation, in turn promoting nephrocalcinosis.

### Prevention and treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease [^114dbP6F]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia has consistently been shown to be associated with dismal outcome in a wide variety of populations, particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Compelling evidence from basic and animal studies elucidated a range of mechanisms by which phosphate may exert its pathological effects and motivated interventions to treat hyperphosphatemia. These interventions consisted of dietary modifications and phosphate binders. However, the beneficial effects of these treatment methods on hard clinical outcomes have not been convincingly demonstrated in prospective clinical trials. In addition, exposure to high amounts of dietary phosphate may exert untoward actions even in the absence of overt hyperphosphatemia. Based on this concept, it has been proposed that the same interventions used in CKD patients with normal phosphate concentrations be used in the presence of hyperphosphatemia to prevent rise of phosphate concentration and as an early intervention for cardiovascular risk. This review describes conceptual models of phosphate toxicity, summarizes the evidence base for treatment and prevention of hyperphosphatemia, and identifies important knowledge gaps in the field.

### Electrolytes disturbances in cancer patients [^114p2cgT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and hypermagnesemia are electrolytes disturbances that can arise in cancer patients in relation to unique causes that are related to the cancer itself or its treatment and can lead to delay or interruption of cancer therapy. This article summarizes these main causes, the proposed pathophysiology and the recommended management for these disturbances.

Recent Findings

There have been many cancer drugs approved in the field of oncology over the past several years and a subset of these drugs have been associated with electrolytes disturbances. This includes, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitor related hyperkalemia, fibroblast growth factor 23 inhibitor associated hyperphosphatemia and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor associated hypomagnesemia and hypocalcaemia.

Summary

This article provides an updated review of certain electrolytes disturbance in cancer patients and allows clinicians to have a greater awareness and knowledge of these electrolyte abnormalities in efforts to early recognition and timely management.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

Safety

Safety findings are reported for all subjects who completed at least 48 weeks of treatment, but no more than 84 weeks. All 14 subjects experienced at least one adverse event (AE) (Table 3). Ten (71%) subjects experienced an AE judged by the investigator to be related to burosumab, with the most common (ie, occurring in two or more subjects) being injection site urticaria (three subjects), abdominal pain (two subjects), asthenia (two subjects), injection site pain (two subjects), and injection site reaction (two subjects). Eleven subjects had 18 bone‐biopsy procedure‐related AEs that were all considered mild or moderate in severity by the investigator: 14 for pain, two for itch, and one each for headache and bandage irritation. Eleven subjects experienced mild to moderate procedure‐related pain; the majority of these events lasted less than a week. Two subjects experienced procedure‐related pain, considered mild, for an atypical duration of 102 and 93 days, respectively. There were no substantial complications from the bone biopsy procedure, such as excessive bleeding, infection, or severe pain.

Table 3
Safety Summary

Two subjects experienced serious AEs, a grade 3 paresthesia and grade 3 migraine headache; neither AE was considered related to burosumab, and both AEs resolved. Two additional grade 3 AEs occurred and were not considered related to burosumab: arthralgia in the same subject that experienced the serious AE migraine and a uterine hemorrhage in another subject. Of the prespecified AEs to monitor, five (36%) subjects had injection site reactions, eight (57%) subjects had hypersensitivity, and two (14%) subjects had restless leg syndrome. There were no deaths, no treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs) leading to discontinuation from the study or drug, and no incidents of hyperphosphatemia (defined as a serum phosphorus level > 4.5 mg/dL). No subject experienced an increase in renal ultrasound scores between baseline and week 48. No noteworthy increases were observed in serum calcium or urine calcium excretion (Supplemental Fig. S2), or serum parathyroid hormone (Supplemental Fig. S3). Burosumab treatment did not result in clinically significant changes in any ECHO parameters, including left ventricular mass index and cardiac function, or ECG parameters, including QT interval and heart rate.

### Impact of serum phosphate changes on in-hospital mortality [^1132YcZX]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the serum phosphate alteration ≥ 0.7 mg/dL during hospitalization is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. The magnitude of association progressively increases with the degree of serum phosphate changes. Our study also confirms consistent associations regardless of AKI, CKD, and ESRD status. Future studies are required to evaluate if early identification of high mortality risk patients by including the degree of serum phosphate changes in risk prediction models allows clinicians to closely monitor these patients, initiate effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to minimize serum phosphate fluctuation, and ultimately reduce mortality among hospitalized patients.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^114m1xe5]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia (defined in adults as serum phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L [4.5 mg/dL]) often occurs in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypophosphatasia, or vitamin D intoxication. Rare genetic disorders of hyperphosphatemia include familial tumoral calcinosis (associated with reduced intact FGF23 levels) and hypoparathyroidism (associated with reduced PTH production). Higher phosphate levels, even if within the normal range, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the normal population and can result in overt hyperphosphatemia, particularly in patients with CKD.

Key messages

- Critically ill patients have a high prevalence of hypophosphatemia because of the presence of multiple causal factors.

- Hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, including cardiac and respiratory failure, and is associated with higher mortality.

- Although multiple studies confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate administration, it is unknown which treatment strategy is superior.

- Nevertheless, correction of hypophosphatemia has not been shown to improve outcome.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

Tumor lysis syndrome

TLS is a life-threatening condition secondary to the release of tumor cells content into the bloodstream, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and its metabolites, intracellular ions (potassium, phosphorus), as well as evocative proteins like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and certain cytokines. The degradation of the purine bases of DNA (adenine, guanine) leads to the increase of plasmatic uric acid and the formation of uric acid crystals. Released phosphorus precipitates with calcium, which induces both hypocalcemia and the formation of calcium phosphate crystals. Thus, TLS-associated laboratory abnormalities include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperkalemia, which collectively define the biological TLS according to Cairo and Bishop (see supplementary Table 1). The combination of biological TLS with acute kidney injury (AKI), seizures (related to hypocalcemia), ventricular arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death (related to hyperkalemia) defines the clinical TLS.

TLS arises in patients with chemosensitive malignancy and high tumor burden. It is therefore common in hyperleukocytic leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma. Although TLS mainly affects patients undergoing chemotherapy, spontaneous TLS might also occur. It is estimated that up to 40% of TLS happen spontaneously in high-risk patients. Paradoxically, as a marker of high tumor burden, spontaneous TLS is an indication for urgent chemotherapy and close monitoring.

AKI severely affects the prognosis of TLS, and is associated with a 66% mortality rate at 6 months, compared to 21% in the absence of renal failure. Thus, hyperhydration (3L/m²/day or 70 mL/kg) is the treatment's cornerstone. Alkalinization is no longer recommended because it is associated with the risk of precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals. After stopping any phosphorus and potassium supplementation, the hydro-electrolyte rebalancing is aimed at correcting hyperkalemia by using polystyrene sulfonate alone in the absence of electrocardiographic (ECG) signs, and by combining insulin-glucose in hyperkalemia with ECG signs to avoid alkalinization. The efficacy of phosphate binders on hyperphosphatemia is disputed in this context, and hypocalcemia should not be supplemented (except in cases of convulsions, or hyperkalemia with ventricular arrhythmia) due to the precipitation of calcium with phosphorus. Electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia) require initial monitoring in the ICU, including ECG monitoring.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — management when symptoms progress or become severe: If symptoms progress and serum calcium remains < 7 mg/dL, magnesium levels should be measured and supplemented as needed; if severe symptomatic hypocalcemia develops despite oral calcium and calcitriol, a 12-lead EKG should be performed, corrected QT interval measured, and intravenous calcium administered. For rapid correction, an i.v. bolus (1–2 g of calcium gluconate [93 mg elemental calcium in one vial of calcium gluconate] in 50 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 20 min) can be used; calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is preferred for peripheral i.v. repletion, whereas calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is prone to phlebitis and local tissue necrosis unless delivered through a central line or appropriately diluted.

Rationale

The strength of this guideline recommendation has been upgraded from a 2D to a 2C based on two randomised controlled trials published after the original document in 2009.

The first by Spasovski et al. examined the effects of 2 different dialysate calcium concentrations in patients with adynamic bone disease; a lower dialysate calcium (1.25 mmol) was found to improve bone and mineral parameters compared with the higher concentration of 1.75 mmol. The second by Ok et al. demonstrated that lowering dialysate calcium levels slowed the progression of coronary arterial calcification and improved biopsy-proven bone turnover (low bone turnover decreased from 85.0 to 41.8%) in their studied cohort of patients on HD. Neither study had a comparator group using a 1.5 mmol/l calcium concentration leaving open the possibility that lower levels of dialysate calcium (> 1.25 mmol/l but < 1.75 mmol/l) would be equally beneficial.

It is worth noting here the observations of a retrospective cohort study by Brunelli et al. published in 2015 that raised some safety concerns with the default use of lower dialysate calcium concentrations (< 1.25 mmol/l) which associated with heart failure events and hypotension, underpinning the original 2009 KDIGO Guidelines which pointed out that a low dialysate calcium concentration may predispose to cardiac arrhythmias and intradialytic hypotension. Similarly, with higher dialysate calcium concentrations of 1.75 mmol/l there is an increased risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular or infection-related hospitalisation in incident HD patients making their routine use in clinical practice equally unwise.

RA recommendation

In patients with CKD G5D, we suggest using a dialysate calcium concentration between 1.25 and 1.5 mmol/l but, as stated in the original KDIGO document, flexibility should be maintained with dialysate calcium concentrations to meet specific, individual patient requirements.

2009 KDIGO guideline

4.1.4: In patients with CKD stages 3–5 (2D) and 5D (2B), we suggest using phosphate-binding agents in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. It is reasonable that the choice of phosphate binder takes into account CKD stage, the presence of other components of CKD–MBD, concomitant therapies, and side-effect profile (not graded).

2017 KDIGO update

4.1.5: In patients with CKD G3a–G5D, decisions about phosphate-lowering treatment should be based on progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate (Not Graded).

### Hypoparathyroidism and the kidney [^1141rbcB]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are the pathognomonic biochemical features of hypoparathyroidism, and result directly from lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) action on the kidney. In the absence of PTH action, the renal mechanisms transporting calcium and phosphate reabsorption deregulate, resulting in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Circulating calcium negatively regulates PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular disturbances ranging from epilepsy and tetany to mild paresthesia. Circulating phosphate concentration does not directly regulate PTH secretion. Hyperphosphatemia is subclinical, but chronically promotes ectopic mineralization disease. Vitamin D-thiazide treatment leads to ectopic mineralization and renal damage. PTH treatment has the potential for fewer side effects.

A patient with extremely high calcium level of 23.9mg/dL (5.97mmol/L) was admitted to our department unconscious with pathological ECG recording, demonstrating shortening of QT interval. The patient was treated by fluid resuscitation, bisphosphonates, salmon calcitonin and steroids. Haemodialysis with low calcium bath had been promptly provided with improvement of consciousness and calcium level. ECG changes disappeared. Subsequent investigations revealed hyperparathyroidism and a large parathyroid adenoma was then surgically removed. Extreme and rapid calcium elevation (parathyroid crisis) is rarely seen in primary hyperparathyroidism and usually is distinctive for malignancy. In the context of acute kidney injury and refractory hypercalcaemia with life-threatening complications (coma, ECG changes with impending danger of arrhythmia), haemodialysis may effectively decrease calcium levels. It should be pointed out that dialysis is an efficient method of treatment of refractory hypercalcaemia, parathyroid crisis, but it is rarely used due to its invasive nature.

### New developments in the management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease [^11622aDv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphatemia is a characteristic complication of significant chronic kidney disease. Elevated serum phosphorous is associated with reduced survival. Hyperphosphatemia has long been recognized as predisposing to uremic bone disease and disorders of parathyroid function. Furthermore, elevated serum phosphate has been implicated particularly in the development of cardiovascular structural and functional abnormalities. Given the limitations of restricting phosphate in the diet and the inadequate removal by conventional dialysis regimes, nephrologists rely on the use of additional medications to control serum levels (currently oral phosphate binders). This review focuses on new agents and therapeutic approaches dealing with hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease, that are not currently licensed and available in routine clinical practise. This article attempts to review therapies under development and considers additional effects that the next generation of agents may bring over and above those already within the therapeutic armamentarium.

### New approaches to the treatment of calcium and phosphorus abnormalities in patients on hemodialysis [^114j7abh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Disturbances in calcium and phosphorus are common in patients who are on chronic hemodialysis. Current therapy consists mainly of administration of calcium-containing phosphate binders and calcitriol. However, the use of these therapies has been limited by both iatrogenic hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Indeed, hyperphosphatemia and elevations in the calcium × phosphorus product have recently been linked to increased mortality and a high burden of cardiac calcifications on electron-beam computed tomography. Novel therapeutic agents such as sevelamer and vitamin D analogs have thus been developed with the goal of decreasing oral calcium loading and hypercalcemia. We provide an algorithm for the management of calcium and phosphorus abnormalities, based on newer recommendations for tighter calcium and phosphorus control with a lower target for the calcium × phosphorus product.

Discussion

In patients with cardiovascular and/or renal disease, hyperkalemia is frequent, life‐threatening, and usually asymptomatic. 3, 5 The emergence of safe and effective medications that lower potassium underscores the importance of detection of hyperkalemia. 11, 12, 14, 23 The ability to remotely, unobtrusively, frequently, and noninvasively assess potassium through a single‐channel signal‐processed ECG would permit currently available wireless ECG patches, implanted monitors, and cardiac devices to infer measurements of potassium; would address a critical need; and would affect a large population. In this study of patients undergoing hemodialysis, the signal‐processed ECG was able to calculate potassium values with a mean error of 0.36 ± 0.34 mmol/L using a personalized strategy that required a seeding blood test, providing a clinically meaningful value via individualized medicine. Importantly, even without personalization and in the absence of any blood draws, clinically useful estimates of potassium were obtained, providing potassium values with a mean error of 0.5 ± 0.42 mmol/L, and could be useful for alerts and trending. These findings, using a single lead of high‐resolution ECG data, suggest that this approach may be suitable for remotely monitoring potassium in dialysis patients. This population is at high risk for hyperkalemia and sudden death, often in the 12 hours before a dialysis session, suggesting a hyperkalemic mechanism. 1

### Hyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis: should you treat? [^117QSbyY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hyperkalemia is a common and life-threatening problem presenting to the emergency department. Rapid correction of the electrolyte abnormality is essential but doing so can be detrimental in circumstances under which delaying treatment for confirmation is required. Our case exemplifies one of those scenarios: pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis.

Case

An elderly woman with long-standing but untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a left hip fracture. She was found to have a potassium level of 8.4 mEq/L without symptoms of hyperkalemia, renal disease, or EKG findings. Her white blood cell count was 444 K/uL. Despite a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, correction was deferred pending confirmation by venous whole blood, which revealed a normal potassium level.

Discussion

Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of severe leukocytosis. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize this phenomenon and avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon and the methods for correct analysis are presented here.

PHOSPHATE IN DISEASE

Phosphate deficiency as well as Pi overload can be causes of severe disease manifestations. In contrast, the occurrence and role of dietary Pi overload in the general population is rather controversially discussed.

General population

A series of epidemiological studies associated high dietary Pi intake or high-normal Pi plasma levels (within the normal Pi range) with a higher risk for incipient heart disease, vascular calcification, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, progression of kidney disease and bone disease. Major problems with some of these studies are that most data originate from studies conducted in US populations. Moreover, there are uncertainties in accurately assessing dietary Pi intake and Pi bioavailability and the possibility of confounding factors associated with the intake of highly processed food items. On the other hand, a few studies tested the effect of high Pi on endocrine or cardiovascular endpoints under controlled experimental conditions in healthy participants and animals. In these studies, high phosphate intake caused a higher sympathetic nerve outflow, higher systolic blood pressure or bone loss. Moreover, animal studies suggest that high Pi intake can cause left ventricular hypertrophy as well as kidney damage. Clearly, the health risk associated with high dietary phosphate intake must be assessed further. The European Food Safety Authority stated in their 2019 report that the acceptable daily intake is 40 mg/kg body weight/day, or 2.8 g for a 70-kg adult. Notably, this value was set based on a single publication in rats and can be considered as purely hypothetical.

### Manifestations of left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmia in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism: a preliminary study [^115W44Er]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism (HP) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) are rare diseases due to parathyroid hormone (PTH) insufficiency or resistance leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and related symptoms. The conventional treatment for HP and PHP includes calcium supplementation combined with vitamin D analogs. To avoid hypercalciuria-related renal damage and maintain optimal levels of calcium phosphate synthesis, the serum calcium levels were regulated slightly below normal or within the low-normal range in HP patients. Hyperphosphatemia often persists among HP and PHP patients receiving conventional therapy.

High serum phosphorus directly triggers vascular injury, increases the mineral deposition in vascular smooth muscle cells in studies in vitro, and increases vascular calcification in individuals with or without chronic kidney disease, which indicates a high risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Serum calcium plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling of the myocardium, and the influx of extracellular calcium largely initiates and determines the degree of myocardial contraction. Chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia have been reported as risk factors for CVDs among different populations. Cardiac abnormalities, such as acute heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia with abnormal cardiac structure, have been reported in patients diagnosed with HP and PHP combined with chronic and severe hypocalcemia due to irregular treatment. However, few studies have reported cardiovascular morbidities in patients with chronic HP and PHP and relatively stable levels of serum calcium. Meanwhile, the long-term influence of chronic HP or PHP on cardiac morphology, function and conduction is still unclear, especially among patients receiving regular treatment.

Thus, the objective of the current pilot study was to directly investigate the effect of long-standing HP and PHP on cardiac morphology and function, and cardiac conductive system in patients compling with treatment of calcium and vitamin D analogs.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^116mjnME]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently no evidence-based guideline exists for the approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

Methods

We performed a narrative review of the medical literature to identify the incidence, symptoms, and treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients. Specifically, we searched for answers to the questions whether correction of hypophosphatemia is associated with improved outcome, and whether a certain treatment strategy is superior.

Results

Incidence: hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered in the intensive care unit; and critically ill patients are at increased risk for developing hypophosphatemia due to the presence of multiple causal factors.

Symptoms

hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, including cardiac and respiratory failure.

Treatment

hypophosphatemia is generally corrected when it is symptomatic or severe. However, although multiple studies confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate administration, it remains uncertain when and how to correct hypophosphatemia.

Outcome

in some studies, hypophosphatemia was associated with higher mortality; a paucity of randomized controlled evidence exists for whether correction of hypophosphatemia improves the outcome in critically ill patients.

Conclusions

Additional studies addressing the current approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients are required. Studies should focus on the association between hypophosphatemia and morbidity and/or mortality, as well as the effect of correction of this electrolyte disorder.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Manifestations of left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmia in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism: a preliminary study [^1157oHf3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this exploratory study, cardiac morphology, function and conduction were evaluated for the first time in patients with HP (mainly non-surgical HP) and PHP undergoing conventional treatment. The study demonstrated that except for mild QTc prolongation as well as a small percentage of mild arrhythmias, there was no significant difference in left ventricular morphology, systolic dysfunction, or severe cardiac events such as syncope and heart failure in patients with HP and PHP compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

Previous studies suggested that both hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia had adverse effects on cardiovascular system. In a recent review of 47 patients, the most common cardiac abnormalities induced by hypocalcemia were heart failure (78%), QTc interval prolongation (38%), and sinus tachycardia (21%). QTc prolongation has been associated with Torsade de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. In this study, although patients with HP and PHP received regular treatment and maintained low-normal to normal levels of serum calcium, a high proportion of patients (57.1% involving HP and 40% of PHP subjects) showed QTc interval prolongation. Fortunately, arrhythmias were mild in most of our patients, and these patients had no clinical symptoms. Compared with those with severe hypocalcemia from a systemic review and meta-analysis, the QTc prolongation in our patients was apparently less severe (449.9 ± 33.9 ms in HP and 440.6 ± 16.2 ms in PHP vs. 510 ms (median) reported in the literature), and the average level of serum calcium in our patients was higher (2.05 ± 0.16 mmol/L in HP and 2.25 ± 0.19 mmol/L in PHP vs. 1.36 mmol/L (median) in published values).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^113PWwz9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

CKD-MBD — initial approach to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) in CKD stages 3–5 not on dialysis states that "the optimal PTH level is not known", and for patients with intact PTH (iPTH) "higher than the upper reference limit of the assay" the guideline says "we suggest" evaluation for "hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and vitamin D deficiency" (2C). "It is reasonable to correct these abnormalities" using "decreasing dietary phosphate intake" plus "phosphate binders, calcium supplements, and/or native vitamin D (not graded)", and "the suggested course of action is discretionary for US practitioners".

### Electrocardiography is unreliable in detecting potentially lethal hyperkalaemia in haemodialysis patients [^1111maU9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is speculated, but unconfirmed, that the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalaemia are less frequent and less pronounced in persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) than in those with normal renal function. We studied 74 consecutively selected stable haemodialysis patients to determine the prevalence of electrocardiographic changes of hyperkalaemia in stable persons with ESRD receiving haemodialysis.

Methods

Pre-dialysis serum potassium concentration and other electrolytes were measured and simultaneous 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained.

Results

The 74 study subjects (45 men, 29 women) comprised 63 blacks (85%), four Hispanics (6%), four whites (6%), and three Asians (4%) of mean ± standard deviation age 55.5 ± 14.7 years. Mean pre-dialysis potassium concentration was 4.9 ± 0.71 mEq/l (range 3.3–6.7). No study subject evinced arrhythmia or any of the typical electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalaemia. There was no significant difference in T wave amplitude (F statistic = 2.1; P = 0.11) or T wave to R wave ratio (F statistic = 2; P = 0.12) between quartiles of serum potassium concentration. Also, T wave amplitude was equivalent in patients with serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mEq/l (7.1 ± 4.1 mm) or ≤ 5.5 mEq/l (5.2 ± 3.5 mm) (P = 0.13). Linear regression analysis showed that the total serum calcium concentration had an inverse relation with T wave amplitude (P = 0.03) after adjustment for other factors (a high total serum calcium concentration was associated with a low T wave amplitude).

Conclusion

Haemodialysis patients with hyperkalaemia may not exhibit the usual electrocardiographic sequella of hyperkalaemia, possibly due in part to fluctuations in serum calcium concentration. Thus, the absence of electrocardiographic changes in hyperkalaemic haemodialysis patients should be interpreted with caution.

### Consequences of hyperphosphatemia and elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product in dialysis patients [^115yQQJ1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Control of serum phosphorus levels is a central goal in the management of patients with chronic renal failure. Inadequate control of serum phosphorus leads to elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product. This plays a pivotal role in vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, calciphylaxis, and death. Elevated phosphorus and elevated levels of the calcium-phosphorus product are both significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality, at phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus product levels that were considered safe until recently. A lowering of levels such that phosphorus is maintained between 2.2 and 5.5 mg/dl, calcium-phosphorus product is below 55 mg²/dl², and serum calcium is at 9.2–9.6 mg/dl, respectively, might well be the goal of therapeutic management strategies.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^115Dj4Kk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — crush injury medication dosing for suspected hyperkalemia states that calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes should be given while ensuring IV patency and not exceeding 1 mL per minute; pediatric dosing is 10% 20 mg/kg, max 1 g, IV/IO over 5 minutes. As an alternative, calcium gluconate 3 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring may be used; pediatric dosing is 10% 50 mg/kg (0.5 mL/kg), max 2 gram, IV over 5 minutes. If not already administered for significant crush injuries with EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia, administer sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes. If EKG is suggestive of hyperkalemia, consider albuterol 5 mg via small volume nebulizer, which can be repeated if no response is seen.

### Importance of hyperphosphataemia in the cardio-renal axis [^114qWjUD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperphosphataemia occurs in nearly all patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the past, the need to manage hyperphosphataemia focused primarily on its role as a contributor to secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy. There is now widespread recognition that disturbances in phosphorus metabolism and/or the therapeutic measures used to manage it are important risk factors for cardiovascular calcification. This serious complication of chronic kidney disease may contribute to the very high mortality rate from cardiovascular causes in patients undergoing long-term dialysis. New strategies for controlling serum phosphorus levels and for better management of mineral metabolism in general are required to address these issues in patients with ESRD.
