## Question

Tylenol 3 migraine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Tylenol 3 (acetaminophen with codeine) is appropriate for treating migraine and what the evidence-based recommendation should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Tylenol 3 contains and its pharmacology. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about opioids, including codeine, for acute migraine. Next, I will review the evidence on acetaminophen alone for migraine and whether adding codeine changes the risk-benefit profile. After that, I need to consider special populations like pregnancy and lactation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and monitoring plan, including medication-overuse-headache counseling and safer alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the formulation and pharmacology. Tylenol 3 is acetaminophen 300 mg combined with codeine 30 mg; codeine is an opioid with modest analgesic activity and well-known risks of dependence, sedation, respiratory depression, and medication-overuse headache, which are particularly concerning in migraine care where recurrence and repeated dosing are common [^notfound].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on opioids for acute migraine. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check multiple high-credibility sources. The American College of Physicians recommends against opioids for acute episodic migraine, emphasizing that combination therapy with a triptan plus NSAID or acetaminophen has better net benefit and that opioids should be avoided outside rare refractory scenarios. The VA/DoD guideline similarly advises against opioids for acute migraine. The American Academy of Neurology's Choosing Wisely explicitly recommends avoiding opioids and butalbital for migraine except as a last resort due to limited efficacy and high risks of medication overuse and chronification. And the AAFP advises avoiding opioids or butalbital-containing medications for migraine treatment except in refractory cases, reinforcing that this is not first-, second-, or even third-line therapy [^98dfddf7] [^63baf434] [^c8d065d8] [^526c6452].

> I will now examine the evidence for acetaminophen alone, to ensure I'm not conflating the opioid component with the analgesic base. Acetaminophen 1000 mg is modestly effective for acute migraine, with Cochrane data showing superiority to placebo for 2-hour pain freedom (NNT about 12) and 2-hour headache relief (NNT about 5), though it is less effective than NSAIDs or triptans. Importantly, the VA/DoD systematic review confirms these effect sizes and supports acetaminophen as a non-opioid option when appropriate, which establishes a baseline for monotherapy without opioid coformulation [^71a85a90] [^fe0037ca].

> But wait, what if the codeine adds meaningful benefit? I should double-check whether any high-quality evidence supports opioids in acute migraine. The JAMA systematic review and meta-analysis found that tramadol with acetaminophen showed a small benefit versus placebo, but the evidence quality is low and the balance of harms, including sedation, dependence, and medication-overuse headache, remains unfavorable; moreover, this does not translate into support for codeine specifically, and guidelines still advise against opioids broadly for migraine. So, adding codeine does not meaningfully improve outcomes while increasing risk, and there is no guideline endorsement of codeine-acetaminophen for migraine [^40f6502b] [^98dfddf7] [^c8d065d8].

> Let me consider special populations, because I need to ensure safety across scenarios. In pregnancy, acetaminophen is recommended as first-line acute migraine therapy, but opioids, including codeine, are not recommended for routine migraine treatment and should be avoided when possible. In lactation, ACOG explicitly recommends against opioids for headache treatment due to risks to the infant and lack of added benefit. So, even where acetaminophen is acceptable, the codeine component remains contraindicated or strongly discouraged in these settings [^4e967207] [^62628ddc].

> I should confirm medication-overuse-headache risks and thresholds. MOH is a major driver of chronification in migraine, and opioids carry the highest risk and are the most difficult MOH to treat; even intermittent use can contribute to transformation to chronic migraine, so routine use of Tylenol 3 risks worsening the disease course. Counseling to limit acute medications to fewer than 10–15 days per month, depending on class, is essential, and opioids should be reserved for rare, refractory cases with careful monitoring [^de5d619b] [^c8d065d8].

> Now, I need to translate this into a practical recommendation. For mild to moderate migraine, acetaminophen 1000 mg alone can be considered, especially if NSAIDs are contraindicated, though NSAIDs or triptans are generally more effective. For moderate to severe migraine or inadequate response to simple analgesics, a triptan is first-line, and if needed, combination therapy with a triptan plus NSAID or acetaminophen can improve outcomes. Tylenol 3 should be avoided for routine migraine treatment; if considered at all, it should be in exceptional, refractory circumstances with explicit MOH counseling and close follow-up, and even then, many guidelines advise against it [^98dfddf7] [^2f93b83d] [^526c6452].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and safety details to avoid errors. The maximum daily acetaminophen dose is 4000 mg from all sources, and many clinicians use a more conservative cap of 3000–3250 mg/day; if acetaminophen is used, ensure total daily intake stays within these limits and account for all combination products. If a patient is already using Tylenol 3, I should counsel on tapering and substitution with safer agents, and screen for MOH features such as headache on 15 or more days per month with regular acute medication use [^fe0037ca] [^5af32b5e] [^de5d619b].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and consistent with evidence: Tylenol 3 is not recommended for migraine treatment because the opioid component adds risk without improving efficacy over acetaminophen alone, and multiple high-credibility guidelines advise against opioids for acute migraine. Acetaminophen monotherapy can be used selectively for mild attacks, but NSAIDs and triptans are preferred for most patients, with combination strategies reserved for inadequate responders and opioids reserved, if at all, for rare refractory cases with vigilant monitoring for adverse effects and medication overuse [^98dfddf7] [^63baf434] [^c8d065d8] [^71a85a90].

---

Tylenol 3 (acetaminophen 300 mg/codeine 30 mg) is **not recommended for routine migraine treatment** because codeine offers limited benefit and increases risks of sedation, dependence, and medication overuse headache [^c8d065d8] [^de5d619b]. Acetaminophen alone is modestly effective for mild migraine [^71a85a90], but **NSAIDs or triptans are preferred first-line** for most patients [^efb65278] [^73986a53]. Codeine-containing products should be reserved for rare, refractory cases after other options fail, and use should be minimized to avoid dependence and MOH [^526c6452] [^c8d065d8].

---

## Pharmacological components and mechanism of action

Tylenol 3 combines acetaminophen and codeine, each with distinct mechanisms:

- **Acetaminophen**: inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS, reducing pain and fever; minimal anti-inflammatory activity.
- **Codeine**: a weak opioid prodrug converted to morphine, acting on mu-opioid receptors to provide analgesia and sedation.

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in migraine

Evidence for Tylenol 3 in migraine is **limited and indirect**, largely extrapolated from acetaminophen data and general opioid-analgesic studies:

- **Acetaminophen monotherapy**: modestly effective for acute migraine, with 2-hour pain-free rates around 19% vs 10% with placebo (NNT ~12) [^71a85a90] [^fe0037ca].
- **Codeine-containing combinations**: tramadol/acetaminophen shows small benefits in some studies, but evidence is weak and not specific to Tylenol 3 [^40f6502b] [^506b0c38].
- **Opioids in migraine**: generally discouraged due to limited efficacy, high adverse effects, and risk of medication overuse headache (MOH) [^c8d065d8] [^de5d619b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines **do not recommend Tylenol 3** for routine migraine care:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding tylenol 3** |
|-|-|
| American College of Physicians (ACP) 2025 | - NSAIDs or triptans first-line <br/> - Acetaminophen alone is less effective <br/> - Opioids, including codeine, not recommended [^98dfddf7] [^2f93b83d] |
| American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2013 | - Avoid opioids, including codeine, except as last resort <br/> - High risk of MOH and dependence [^c8d065d8] |
| American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) 2025 | - Avoid opioids or butalbital for migraine <br/> - Reserve for refractory cases only [^526c6452] |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Tylenol 3 carries **significant safety concerns** in migraine care:

- **Common adverse effects**: drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression.
- **Dependence and abuse**: codeine is habit-forming; risk increases with repeated use.
- **Medication overuse headache**: opioids markedly increase MOH risk, worsening migraine chronification [^de5d619b] [^ffe60450].
- **Hepatotoxicity**: acetaminophen overdose (> 4 g/day) can cause liver injury; monitor total daily intake [^fe0037ca].

---

## Comparison with other acute migraine treatments

Tylenol 3 is **inferior to standard migraine therapies**:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen | High efficacy; first-line | GI bleeding, renal effects |
| Triptans | - Sumatriptan <br/> - Rizatriptan | High efficacy; first-line | Vasoconstriction, serotonin syndrome |
| Gepants | - Ubrogepant <br/> - Rimegepant | Moderate-high efficacy; no vasoconstriction | Cost, CYP3A4 interactions |
| Ditans | - Lasmiditan | Moderate efficacy; no vasoconstriction | Sedation, driving restrictions |
| Acetaminophen alone | Acetaminophen 1000 mg | Modest efficacy; safe in pregnancy | Hepatotoxicity at high doses |

---

Tylenol 3's efficacy is **lower than NSAIDs and triptans**, with higher risks of dependence and MOH, making it a poor choice for routine care [^85f8cb57] [^c8d065d8].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Acetaminophen is first-line; codeine is generally avoided due to fetal risks.
- **Lactation**: Codeine is not recommended due to infant safety concerns [^62628ddc].
- **Comorbidities**: Avoid in hepatic disease, respiratory disorders, or substance use disorder.

---

## Clinical scenarios where Tylenol 3 may be considered

Tylenol 3 may be considered only in **rare, refractory cases** when:

- Multiple first-line therapies (NSAIDs, triptans, gepants, ditans) have failed or are contraindicated.
- Short-term, single-dose use is planned with close monitoring.
- The patient is counseled on risks, including MOH and dependence.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Tylenol 3 is **not recommended for routine migraine treatment** because of limited efficacy, significant adverse effects, and high risks of dependence and MOH. Acetaminophen alone may be used for mild migraine or in pregnancy, but NSAIDs or triptans are preferred first-line. Reserve Tylenol 3 for rare, refractory cases with careful monitoring and patient counseling.

Chronic pain is a widespread, difficult problem facing clinicians. This study assessed the current medical management of a general population of patients with chronic pain in 12 family medicine practices located throughout the state of Wisconsin. Medical record audits were conducted on a sample of 209 adults. Sixty-seven percent were female with an average age of 53 years. The most common pain diagnoses included lumbar/low back (44%), joint disease/arthritis (33%), and headache/migraine (28%) pain. The most frequently prescribed opioids were oxycodone/acetaminophen (31%), morphine ERT (19%), Tylenol #3 (15%), and hydrocodone/acetaminophen (14%). Depression/affective disorders were reported in 36% of the patient charts, anxiety/panic disorders (15%), drug abuse (6%), and alcohol abuse (3%). Written drug contracts were utilized by 42% (n = 31) of the practitioners, pain scales 25% (n = 29), and urine toxicology screens 8% (n = 6). This study suggests that primary care practitioners have unique opportunities to identify and successfully treat patients with chronic pain.

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^71a85a90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2010 (Derry 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 4 October 2010 for the original review, and to 13 February 2013 for the update. Two clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com) were also searched on both occasions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered paracetamol to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Searches for the update identified one additional study for inclusion. Eleven studies (2942 participants, 5109 attacks) compared paracetamol 1000 mg, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes paracetamol was superior to placebo, with NNTs of 12 (19% response with paracetamol, 10% with placebo), 5.0 (56% response with paracetamol, 36% with placebo) and 5.2 (39% response with paracetamol, 20% with placebo) for 2-hour pain-free and 2- and 1-hour headache relief, respectively, when medication was taken for moderate to severe pain. Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was not significantly different from oral sumatriptan 100 mg for 2-hour headache relief; there were no 2-hour pain-free data. Adverse event rates were similar between paracetamol and placebo, and between paracetamol plus metoclopramide and sumatriptan. No serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone, but more serious and/or severe adverse events occurred with sumatriptan than with the combination therapy (NNH 32).

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at two hours is inferior to at of other commonly used analgesics. Given the low cost and wide availability of paracetamol, it may be a useful first choice drug for acute migraine in those with contraindications to, or who cannot tolerate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin. The addition of 10 mg metoclopramide gives short-term efficacy equivalent to oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Adverse events with paracetamol did not differ from placebo; serious and/or severe adverse events were slightly more common with sumatriptan than with paracetamol plus metoclopramide.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^fe0037ca]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) for acute migraine — A systematic review (SR) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that paracetamol 1,000 mg versus placebo favored paracetamol for percentage of pain-free response at 2 hours (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.24–2.62; p = 0.0022). When taken for moderate to severe pain, paracetamol was superior to placebo with pain freedom at 2 hours (NNT = 12), headache relief at 2 hours (NNT = 5), and headache relief at 1 hour (NNT = 5.2). Paracetamol 1,000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at 2 hours is higher than other commonly used analgesics. For safety, the maximum dose of acetaminophen for acute use is 4,000 mg per day, and this dose should include any other acetaminophen-containing products, such as cold, flu, sinus, or allergy combination products.

Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine in adults.

Search Strategy

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered paracetamol to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Ten studies (2769 participants, 4062 attacks) compared paracetamol 1000 mg, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes paracetamol was superior to placebo, with NNTs of 12, 5.2 and 5.0 for 2-hour pain-free and 1- and 2-hour headache relief, respectively, when medication was taken for moderate to severe pain. Nausea, photophobia and phonophobia were reduced more with paracetamol than with placebo at 2 hours (NNTs of 7 to 11); more individuals were free of any functional disability at 2 hours with paracetamol (NNT 10); and fewer participants needed rescue medication over 6 hours (NNT 6). Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was not significantly different from oral sumatriptan 100 mg for 2-hour headache relief; there were no 2-hour pain-free data. There was no significant difference between the paracetamol plus metoclopramide combination and sumatriptan for relief of "light/noise sensitivity" at 2 hours, but slightly more individuals needed rescue medication over 24 hours with the combination therapy (NNT 17). Adverse event rates were similar between paracetamol and placebo, and between paracetamol plus metoclopramide and sumatriptan. No serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone, but more "major" adverse events occurred with sumatriptan than with the combination therapy (NNH 32).

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg alone is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, and the addition of 10 mg metoclopramide gives short-term efficacy equivalent to oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Adverse events with paracetamol did not differ from placebo; "major" adverse events were slightly more common with sumatriptan than with paracetamol plus metoclopramide.

### Clarify headache type and… [^de5d619b]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

1, 11 Symptoms predictive of migraine escalation are pulsating quality, severe pain, photophobia, phonophobia, and attacks lasting longer than 72 hours. 12 Long attack duration and nausea are predictive of development of chronic TTH. 13 Cutaneous allodynia is strongly associated with chronification and may be a marker of central sensitization. 13, 14 The highest medication-associated risk is with opioids, followed by triptans, ergotamines, and nonopioid analgesics. 7, 11. 5 MOH develops almost exclusively in patients with migraine or TTH. Nonopioid analgesics are the most commonly implicated medications because of their widespread use in headache treatment; however, triptans are an increasingly common cause of MOH in the United States. The estimated mean critical dose and duration of use for triptans are 18 doses per month and 1. 7 years, compared with 114 doses per month and
4. 8 years for simple analgesics.

37 Although not recommended and less commonly used for headache, opioids present the greatest risk of MOH and the most difficult type to treat. 35, 36 MOH has no classic features. Symptoms vary among patients and over time. Patients often describe insidious onset of increasingly frequent headaches on awakening or early in the day. Headaches are of variable quality, intensity, and location. Neck pain is common, and autonomic and vasomotor symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, and vasomotor instability are reported. 35, 42, 43 All studies have been conducted on patients with MOH and chronic migraine; no guidelines are available for other patients with MOH. European guidelines state that topiramate, 100 to 200 mg per day, is probably effective in MOH, and that corticosteroids and amitriptyline are possibly effective.

41 A 2019 review found two studies reporting significant therapeutic advantage over placebo for topiramate, and one study each for onabotulinumtoxin A and valproate. 35 In about 75% of patients with MOH, discontinuing the overused medication results in reversion to episodic migraine or TTH; however, the relapse rate is about 30% per year. 41 Effective treatment for the underlying headache and close follow-up are essential to prevent the patient from reverting to MOH.

To compare benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments for acute attacks of episodic migraine in adults and assess cost-effectiveness.

Data Sources

Three electronic databases searched to October 2024, gray literature, and reference lists.

Study Selection

Two investigators independently selected English-language randomized trials.

Data Extraction

Single reviewer data extraction with second review. Dual independent risk of bias and certainty of evidence (COE) assessment.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-one head-to-head and 165 placebo-controlled trials were included in meta-analyses and network meta-analyses. Triptans were more effective than acetaminophen (low COE) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (high COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours. Triptan and acetaminophen combinations were more effective than acetaminophen alone (moderate COE) for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours but not more than triptans alone (low COE). Triptan and NSAID combinations were more effective for pain outcomes at 2 hours and pain freedom up to 48 hours compared with acetaminophen (low COE), gepants (low COE), NSAIDs (high COE), and triptan monotherapy (moderate COE). Triptan regimens, however, often had a higher risk for adverse events. One study found triptans more cost-effective than ditans and gepants.

Limitations

Harms assessment was limited to randomized trials. Many comparisons lacked sufficient evidence to draw conclusions.

Conclusion

Triptans and combinations of triptans were more effective than NSAID and acetaminophen alone.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^e9029251]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The effective management of headache disorders remains a moving field and a potential challenge to the neurologist. The frequency of headache and its burden of disability make it essential for neurologists to manage headache in an informed way. Therapeutic decisions are hampered by minimal evidence to support the use of many therapies and hence we a need large, robust clinical trials. However, emerging therapies specifically targeting headache pain pathways are likely to improve significantly the management options and advance the field.

A practical approach is important — using existing evidence and guidelines — to enable effective headache management. It is an area where the clinician can have a huge and very rewarding impact upon patient care.

Key points

Headache is a common cause of disability; an accurate diagnosis is essential, though is often delayed or missed.
Medication-overuse headache frequently coexists and should be actively sought and discussed with patients with headache.
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acute migraine abortive treatment with a triptan together with paracetamol (or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus an antiemetic; lack of efficacy with one triptan does not mean that others will not work.
NICE guidelines for migraine prophylaxis suggest using topiramate or a beta blocker; comorbidities or lack of efficacy often means that other agents are also prescribed.
Start migraine prophylactic agents at low dose, build the dose up progressively and maintain a therapeutic dose for 3 months before judging its efficacy.

Migraine acute treatment — Recommendation: Don't use opioids or butalbital for treatment of migraine, except as a last resort; almost all patients should receive migraine-specific medications or nonopioid, nonbarbiturate analgesics because these medications are the most effective migraine treatments, and use of opioids and butalbital increases the risk of medication overuse headache and chronic migraine; in these circumstances, use should be limited to 9 days per month or less to avoid medication overuse headache, with continued focus on preventive and behavioral aspects of migraine care.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^7e5f2abe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evidence gaps and research needs — comparative effectiveness trials are prioritized and should emphasize combination therapy comparators and inadequate responders. "There is a critical need for funding agencies, such as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute or National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to support well-designed, comparative effectiveness trials of newer medications to treat moderate to severe episodic migraine compared with the combination of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen." "These trials should focus on the combination therapies as initial treatment options and in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment after a moderate to severe episodic migraine," and "The trials should aim to treat multiple migraine headaches." The systematic review "did not identify head-to-head comparative studies for lasmiditan, celecoxib, eletriptan, frovatriptan, or naratriptan," and "did not find comparative effectiveness evidence eligible for this clinical guideline to evaluate the efficacy of switching pharmacologic treatments in patients who did not achieve adequate relief with an initial pharmacologic treatment attempt for an acute migraine headache."

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache in adults [^02e857b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) affects about 1 person in 5 worldwide. It is divided into infrequent episodic TTH (fewer than one headache per month), frequent episodic TTH (two to 14 headaches per month), and chronic TTH (15 headache days a month or more). Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is one of a number of analgesics suggested for acute treatment of headaches in frequent episodic TTH.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for the acute treatment of frequent episodic TTH in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (CRSO), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database to October 2015, and also reference lists of relevant published studies and reviews. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (parallel-group or cross-over) using oral paracetamol for symptomatic relief of an acute episode of TTH. Studies had to be prospective, with participants aged 18 years or over, and include at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used the numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for oral paracetamol compared to placebo or an active intervention for a range of outcomes, predominantly those recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS). We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 23 studies, all of which enrolled adults with frequent episodic TTH. Twelve studies used the IHS diagnostic criteria or similar, six used the older classification of the Ad Hoc Committee, and five did not describe specific diagnostic criteria but generally excluded participants with migraines. Participants had moderate or severe pain at the start of treatment. While 8079 people with TTH participated in these studies, the numbers available for any analysis were lower than this because outcomes were inconsistently reported and because many participants received active comparators. None of the included studies were at low risk of bias across all domains considered, although for most studies and domains this was likely to be due to inadequate reporting rather than poor methods. We judged five studies to be at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome reporting, and seven due to small size. For the IHS preferred outcome of being pain free at two hours the NNT for paracetamol 1000 mg compared with placebo was 22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 15 to 40) in eight studies (5890 participants; high quality evidence), with no significant difference from placebo at one hour. The NNT was 10 (7.9 to 14) for pain-free or mild pain at two hours in five studies (5238 participants; high quality evidence). The use of rescue medication was lower with paracetamol 1000 mg than with placebo, with an NNTp to prevent an event of 7.8 (6.0 to 11) in six studies (1856 participants; moderate quality evidence). On limited data, the efficacy of paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg was not superior to placebo, and paracetamol 1000 mg was not different from either ketoprofen 25 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg (low quality evidence). Adverse events were not different between paracetamol 1000 mg and placebo (RR 1.1 (0.94 to 1.3); 5605 participants; 11 studies; high quality evidence). Studies reported no serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence using GRADE comparing paracetamol 1000 mg with placebo was moderate to high. Where evidence was downgraded it was because a minority of studies reported the outcome. For comparisons of paracetamol 500 mg to 650 mg with placebo, and of paracetamol 1000 mg with active comparators, we downgraded the evidence to low quality or very low quality because of the small number of studies and events.

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg provided a small benefit in terms of being pain free at two hours for people with frequent episodic TTH who have an acute headache of moderate or severe intensity.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^64a4f6ec]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache, patients' values and preferences, and economic evidence about these pharmacologic treatments.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the comparative benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headaches, as well as systematic reviews of patients' values and preferences and comparative cost-effectiveness analyses. The Clinical Guidelines Committee evaluated the following clinical outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach: pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours; sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief up to 48 hours; need for rescue medication within 24 hours; nausea, vomiting, and restored physical function at 2 hours; and overall and serious adverse events (AEs). Additional data on AEs were captured through U.S. Food and Drug Administration medication labels.

Audience and Population

The audience for this clinical guideline is physicians and other clinicians. The population is adults with acute episodic migraine headache (defined as 1 to 14 headache days per month) managed in outpatient settings.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians add a triptan to acetaminophen to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### Effect of atogepant for preventive migraine treatment on patient-reported outcomes in the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 ADVANCE trial [^ca349d5d]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial Design

Detailed methods of the ADVANCE trial have been published. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 trial was conducted from December 14, 2018, to June 19, 2020, at 136 sites in the United States. Participants were randomized to receive placebo and atogepant (10, 30, or 60 mg) once daily (QD) at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by previous exposure to a migraine prevention medication with proven efficacy. The randomization sequence was generated by an automated interactive web response system. Blinding was maintained by providing treatments in identical blister cards and masking treatment assignment from participants and site and sponsor personnel. The study included a 4-week baseline period, 12-week double-blind treatment period, and 4-week safety follow-up period. Participants were instructed to take study treatment once daily, orally, at approximately the same time each day.

Participants

Eligible participants were adults aged 18–80 years with 4–14 MMDs in the 3 months before screening and 4–14 migraine days recorded in an electronic diary (eDiary) during the 28-day baseline run-in period. Additional inclusion criteria required ≥ 1-year history of migraine with or without aura consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition (ICHD-3)and migraine onset before 50 years of age. Participants were excluded if they had a current diagnosis of chronic migraine (CM), new persistent daily headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (e.g. cluster headache), or painful cranial neuropathy as defined by ICHD-3; ≥ 15 monthly headache days (MHDs) on average across 3 months before visit 1 or during the 28-day baseline period; a history of inadequate response to > 4 medications (2 with different mechanisms of action) prescribed for preventive migraine treatment; use of opioids > 2 days per month, triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days per month, or simple analgesics (e.g. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen) ≥ 15 days per month during the 3 months before screening or baseline period; or the use of barbiturates > 2 days per month in the 3 months before screening or any use within 30 days of screening.

### Acute migraine headache: treatment strategies [^1818cc8c]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent disabling attacks. Pharmacologic treatment of acute migraine episodes should be individualized based on route of administration, cost, contraindications, and adverse effects. Stratifying treatment based on migraine severity may result in more rapid resolution of symptoms and return of function. Simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are first-line treatments for mild to moderate migraine episodes, and triptans are first-line therapy for moderate to severe attacks. Antiemetics and ergot alkaloids are recommended as second-line agents and in cases of refractory migraine. Gepants and ditans are promising newer agents that are supported by quality evidence for second-line use. Unlike triptans and ergot alkaloids, gepants and ditans do not have vascular contraindications. The use of these medications is largely limited by cost, although the adverse effects of ditans also may limit their use. Opioids and butalbital-containing medications are not recommended for the treatment of migraine unless other options have been ineffective. There is insufficient evidence to recommend nonpharmacologic therapies, such as neuromodulatory devices, acupuncture, and greater occipital nerve blocks, but these therapies may be appropriate for select patients.

### Evaluation of LY573144 (lasmiditan) in a preclinical model of medication overuse headache [^ffe60450]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frequent use of acute headache medications or medication overuse in individuals with headache disorders can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH). MOH is characterized by an increased frequency of headache attacks and disability. MOH is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-3) as a headache that develops as a consequence of regular overuse of symptomatic headache medication in a person with a pre-existing headache disorder and that occurs on more than 14 days per month for more than 3 months and cannot be better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. It is estimated that the prevalence of MOH is 1–2% in the general population, affecting over 100 million people worldwide. MOH comes at a significant cost to the individual and society, both financially and psychosocially. MOH has been estimated by the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 as being responsible for over 9.5 million years lived with disability, more than any other neurologic disorder excluding other headache disorders.

The majority of drug classes used to treat acute headache, including opioids, barbiturate containing medications, ergotamines, triptans, and simple analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen/paracetamol, have been implicated in MOH. In individuals with migraine, medication overuse is a risk factor for the transformation of episodic to chronic migraine which is associated with increased disability and decreased quality of life. It has been estimated that migraine accounts for up to 67–100% of the primary headache types of those with MOH. Triptans, 5-HT 1B/1D agonists, specifically designed for the acute treatment of migraine and perhaps the most effective migraine abortive medications, are associated with MOH in 5–18% of patients.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^0449a542]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Acute episodic migraine — triptan plus acetaminophen combination, compared with triptan monotherapy, may result in no important differences in pain freedom and relief at 2 hours, sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours, freedom from nausea at 2 hours, and restored physical function at 2 hours after initiating treatment, with low-certainty evidence and no important differences in overall AEs and uncertain serious AEs; compared with acetaminophen monotherapy, combination therapy resulted in a probably higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours (300 more events per 1000 treated people) and sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours (250 more events per 1000 treated people), but may result in a higher risk for overall AEs (200 more events per 1000 treated people; low-certainty evidence); and compared with an NSAID, low-certainty evidence showed that this combination may result in a higher likelihood of pain freedom at 2 hours.

Step 4: Acute treatment

Acute treatments can be classified as first-line, second-line, third-line and adjunct (Table 3), and should be used in a stepped care approach(Fig. 2). Our recommendations for each line of treatment are outlined below. The medications at each stage were selected on the basis of efficacy, tolerability, safety, cost and availability.

Table 3
Acute migraine treatment

Fig. 2
Stepped care across migraine attacks.

Preventive therapy, in addition, may be indicated at any stage. In general, initiation of preventive therapy is indicated in patients who are adversely affected on ≥ 2 days per month despite acute treatment optimized according to the stepped care approach. NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

First-line medication

Over-the-counter analgesics are used worldwide for acute migraine treatment. Those with proven efficacy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the strongest evidence supports use of acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen and diclofenac potassium as first-line medications –. Paracetamol has less efficacyand should be used only in those who are intolerant of NSAIDs.

Second-line medication

Patients for whom over-the-counter analgesics provide inadequate headache relief should be offered a triptan. All triptans have well-documented effectiveness, but availability of and access to each vary between countries. Triptans are most effective when taken early in an attack, when the headache is still mild. However, no evidence supports the use of triptans during the aura phase of a migraine attack. If one triptan is ineffective, others might still provide relief. When all other triptans have failed or in patients who rapidly reach peak headache intensity or cannot take oral triptans because of vomiting, sumatriptan by subcutaneous injection can be useful.

Some patients can experience relapses, which are defined as a return of symptoms within 48 h after apparently successful treatment. Upon relapse, patients can repeat their triptan treatment or combine the triptan with simultaneous intake of fast-acting formulations of naproxen sodium, ibuprofen lysine or diclofenac potassium. However, patients should be informed that repeating the treatment does not preclude further relapses and ultimately increases the risk of developing MOH.

### Acute treatments for episodic migraine in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^40f6502b]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Migraine is common and can be associated with significant morbidity, and several treatment options exist for acute therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the benefits and harms associated with acute treatments for episodic migraine in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple databases from database inception to February 24, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews that assessed effectiveness or harms of acute therapy for migraine attacks.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Meta-analysis was performed with the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction or by using a fixed-effect model based on the Mantel-Haenszel method if the number of studies was small.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes included pain freedom, pain relief, sustained pain freedom, sustained pain relief, and adverse events. The strength of evidence (SOE) was graded with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.

Findings

Evidence on triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was summarized from 15 systematic reviews. For other interventions, 115 randomized clinical trials with 28 803 patients were included. Compared with placebo, triptans and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used individually were significantly associated with reduced pain at 2 hours and 1 day (moderate to high SOE) and increased risk of mild and transient adverse events. Compared with placebo, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists (low to high SOE), lasmiditan (5-HT1F receptor agonist; high SOE), dihydroergotamine (moderate to high SOE), ergotamine plus caffeine (moderate SOE), acetaminophen (moderate SOE), antiemetics (low SOE), butorphanol (low SOE), and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen (low SOE) were significantly associated with pain reduction and increase in mild adverse events. The findings for opioids were based on low or insufficient SOE. Several nonpharmacologic treatments were significantly associated with improved pain, including remote electrical neuromodulation (moderate SOE), transcranial magnetic stimulation (low SOE), external trigeminal nerve stimulation (low SOE), and noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (moderate SOE). No significant difference in adverse events was found between nonpharmacologic treatments and sham.

Conclusions and Relevance

There are several acute treatments for migraine, with varying strength of supporting evidence. Use of triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists, lasmiditan, and some nonpharmacologic treatments was associated with improved pain and function. The evidence for many other interventions, including opioids, was limited.

### Rates of response to atogepant for migraine prophylaxis among adults: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^190095d5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Participants

Eligible participants were adults (18–80 years of age) with a 1-year or longer history of migraine with or without aura diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD-3), migraine onset before 50 years of age, and a mean of 4 to 14 migraine-days per month during the 3 months before visit 1 and the 28-day baseline eDiary period. Exclusion criteria included a current diagnosis of chronic migraine, new daily persistent headache, cluster headache, or painful cranial neuropathy as defined by the ICHD-3 and a mean of 15 or more headache-days per month across 3 months before visit 1 or during the baseline period. A headache day was defined as a calendar day with headache pain lasting 2 hours or longer unless a medication was immediately used, in which case no minimum duration was specified. Other exclusion criteria were inadequate response to more than 4 medications (2 with different mechanisms of action) prescribed for migraine prevention and use of opioids or barbiturates for more than 2 days per month, triptans or ergots for 10 days or more per month, or simple analgesics (eg, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or acetaminophen) for 15 days or more per month in the 3 months before visit 1 or during the 28-day baseline period. Barbiturate use was excluded 30 days before screening and throughout the trial. Short-term migraine treatments (eg, triptans, ergots, opioids, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antiemetics) were permitted. Participants reported their race and ethnicity, which was captured using prespecified coding on case report forms. Race and ethnicity data were collected to gain a better understanding of the populations that were evaluated in this study and because of the potential to conduct subgroup analyses to further evaluate potentially undertreated populations.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^2f93b83d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — outpatient treatment of acute episodic migraine: Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians add a triptan to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP suggests that clinicians add a triptan to acetaminophen to treat moderate to severe acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings for nonpregnant adults who do not respond adequately to acetaminophen (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). Supporting evidence notes that combination therapy of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen), compared with triptan monotherapy, resulted in a higher likelihood of sustained pain relief up to 48 hours after initial treatment (130 more events per 1000 treated people) and lower likelihood of using rescue medication at 24 hours (130 fewer events per 1000 treated people).

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cfc4a0dd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Comparative effectiveness rationale — net benefit and adverse events: Comparative effectiveness evidence showed that the combination of a triptan (sumatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen) had the greatest net benefit, with a larger net benefit than monotherapy with a triptan, an NSAID, acetaminophen, or a CGRP antagonist-gepant. The combination of a triptan (rizatriptan) and acetaminophen had a similar net benefit to triptan monotherapy and showed a greater net benefit than acetaminophen. The CGC determined that triptans are associated with more AEs than NSAIDs and acetaminophen, although these AEs are generally mild (for example, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea), and that "some pain relief" may be more important than "absence of pain."

### Ibuprofen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^eb84ba89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 10, 2010 (Rabbie 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers do not seek professional help, relying instead on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce symptoms commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 22 April 2010 for the original review and to 14 February 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered ibuprofen to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and number needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

No new studies were found for this update. Nine included studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication. For ibuprofen 400 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo), 2-hour headache relief (57% versus 25%) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (45% versus 19%) were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. For ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (20% versus 10%) and 2-hour headache relief (52% versus 37%) were 9.7 and 6.3, respectively. The higher dose was significantly better than the lower dose for 2-hour headache relief. Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief. Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with ibuprofen and placebo. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not differ from rofecoxib 25 mg for 2-hour headache relief or 24-hour headache relief.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo.

Outcomes

We selected outcomes recommended by the International Headache Society. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who were pain-free at two hours post-dose and the proportion of participants with sustained pain freedom from two to 24 hours post-dose, both without the use of rescue drugs.

Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participants with pain relief at two hours post-dose, the proportion with pain relapse within two to 48 hours post-dose, and the proportion using rescue drugs after two hours and up to 24 hours. We also investigated safety and tolerability, assessing the proportion of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event and the proportion with at least one of 19 specific clinically relevant adverse events predefined in the protocol (see supplementary appendix 1).

Methods

Information sources and eligibility criteria

Full details about the methods are reported in the protocol (see supplementary appendix 1), which has been registered in Open Science Framework. Our reporting of the study adhered to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) statement for systematic reviews incorporating network meta-analyses.

We searched for published and unpublished studies in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, WHO (World Health Organization) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, as well as websites of regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies without language restrictions until 24 June 2023 (see supplementary appendix 2 for full search strategy).

We included double blind, randomised controlled trials comparing monotherapy using oral drugs with placebo or another eligible active treatment for the acute treatment of migraine episodes in adults (≥ 18 years). Participants were outpatients with a diagnosis of migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Only drugs and treatment dose ranges licensed for migraine or headache were considered eligible if they were recommended by at least one of the regulatory bodies internationally (also see supplementary appendix 3 and table S1): the British National Formulary (UK), the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Germany), the European Medicines Agency, the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (France), the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We did not include opiates as clinical guidelines discourage their use for migraine owing to limited efficacy, considerable adverse effects, and risk of dependency. We excluded studies set in emergency departments as people attending these due to migraine usually represent a subgroup with particularly severe or atypical episodes.

Pairs of researchers independently screened and selected the studies, reviewed published and unpublished reports, extracted data from the included trials, and assessed risk of bias. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion with the other members of the team.

2.2.2. Endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in early intervention trials should be pain-free at 2 hours after treatment. However, as the aim of early intervention trials is also to evaluate efficacy on pain progression, sustained pain-free to 24 or 48 hours (refer to Section 1.3.4.2) should be used as a co-primary endpoint. The number of protocol violators (subjects assigned to treat mild headache who treat moderate-severe and vice versa) in early intervention trials can be substantial. As protocol violators, these subjects can be excluded from the ITT analysis, but there is a risk that analysis of the smaller sample will not be sufficiently powered to detect treatment effects. An acceptable alternative is to reassign these subjects to their actual treatment groups, as long as the re-allocation is done before the blind is broken.

Methods

Trial design

The trial design for the PRODROME study has been previously reported. PRODROME was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial conducted from 21 August 2020 through 19 April 2022, at 75 research centers and headache clinics in the United States of America (Supplementary Table 5). After a 60-d screening period, participants with migraine, who could reliably identify migraine attacks with prodromal symptoms that were reliably followed by headache within 1–6 h at least 75% of the time, were randomized to sequence A or B in a 1:1 ratio and entered the double-blind treatment period, during which they were tasked to treat two qualifying prodrome events within a 60-d period (Supplementary Fig. 1). A qualifying prodrome event was defined by the presence of prodromal symptoms that the participant was confident would be followed by a headache within 1–6 h. Headache should not be present at the time of a qualifying prodrome event and the participant should not have had a headache in the previous 48 h. Acute treatment should not have been used within 48 h before the qualifying prodrome event. Defining a qualifying prodrome event as 1–6 h before the expected headache onset was done to provide time for the acute treatment to take effect and aid in differentiating aura symptoms from prodromal symptoms.

Participants in sequence A received placebo to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying event, whereas participants in sequence B received ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and placebo to treat the second qualifying event. The two treatments had at least 7 d of washout in between.

During the double-blind study period, after taking the study drug, rescue medication was permitted only after headache onset. For a mild headache, rescue medication was permitted 24 h after headache onset. For a headache of moderate or severe intensity, rescue medication was permitted at any time after headache onset. No rescue medication was permitted during the qualifying prodrome event if a headache had not yet occurred. Permitted rescue medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, triptans, ditans, ergots, analgesics or combination analgesics, opioids or antiemetics.

### Aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine for the treatment of acute migraine attacks: a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^8eb05a52]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Many migraine patients rely on over-the-counter analgesics for the treatment of migraine attacks. Fixed-dose combinations of aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine (APC) have been used for treating migraine in many countries for a long time. We performed a meta-analysis for the comparison of APC versus placebo, which has not been done to date.

Methods

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies using APC to treat a migraine attack were included in a meta-analysis. We calculated the rate ratio (RRs) associated with APC versus placebo.

Results

Seven studies were included, with 3306 participants (2147 treated with APC and 1159 treated with placebo). For the primary efficacy outcome, being pain-free at 2 h, APC was superior to placebo (19.6% vs. 9.0%, RR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–3.3). For the co-primary efficacy outcome, pain relief at 2 h, APC was superior to placebo (54.3% vs. 31.2%, RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6–1.9). Adverse events were more frequent in the APC than the placebo groups (10.9% vs. 7.8%, RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.2).

Conclusions

Results showed that APC is superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Efficacy, measured by pain-free response and pain relief at 2 h, was clinically relevant.

### Treatment of acute migraine headache [^5f7800c8]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Migraine headache is a common and potentially debilitating disorder often treated by family physicians. Before diagnosing migraine, serious intracranial pathology must be ruled out. Treating acute migraine is challenging because of substantial rates of nonresponse to medications and difficulty in predicting individual response to a specific agent or dose. Data comparing different drug classes are relatively scarce. Abortive therapy should be used as early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Effective first-line therapies for mild to moderate migraine are nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and combination analgesics containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. Triptans are first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine, or mild to moderate migraine that has not responded to adequate doses of simple analgesics. Triptans should be avoided in patients with vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or hemiplegic migraine. Intravenous antiemetics, with or without intravenous dihydroergotamine, are effective therapies in an emergency department setting. Dexamethasone may be a useful adjunct to standard therapy in preventing short-term headache recurrence. Intranasal lidocaine may also have a role in relief of acute migraine. Isometheptene-containing compounds and intranasal dihydroergotamine are also reasonable therapeutic options. Medications containing opiates or barbiturates should be avoided for acute migraine. During pregnancy, migraine may be treated with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (prior to third trimester), or opiates in refractory cases. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, intranasal sumatriptan, and intranasal zolmitriptan seem to be effective in children and adolescents, although data in these age groups are limited.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^98dfddf7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — pharmacologic choices and sequencing emphasize initiating or optimizing simple analgesics and considering additional options: consider treating mild episodic migraine headache with an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), acetaminophen, or the combination of an NSAID and acetaminophen; ask about prior use and ensure appropriate dosing, considering increasing the dosage without exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose if relief is inadequate; patients who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to a recommended treatment may respond to another within the same drug class; although comparative effectiveness data were uncertain, there is evidence supporting efficacy for CGRP antagonists-gepants (rimegepant, ubrogepant, or zavegepant) or ergot alkaloid (dihydroergotamine); consider using the ditan lasmiditan in nonpregnant outpatient adults who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to all other pharmacologic treatments included in this guideline; consider using a nonoral triptan and an antiemetic in people having severe nausea or vomiting; and do not use opioids or butalbital for acute episodic migraine.

### Evaluation of the efficacy of intravenous acetaminophen in the treatment of acute migraine attacks: a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group multicenter study [^a27bcca0]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of intravenous acetaminophen (1000mg) in the treatment of acute migraine attacks as an alternative to parenteral application of lysine acetylsalicylate or triptans was investigated, using a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study design. Migraine diagnosis was made according to the International Headache Society Classification. Sixty patients were included in three headache outpatient centers (Neurology Departments of the Universities of Regensburg, Münster and München). In the acute migraine attack patients were treated intravenously with either 1000mg paracetamol (acetaminophen) or placebo. The primary end point was pain-free after 2h. Secondary efficacy criteria were pain-free after 24h or pain relief after 2hours and after 24hours. With regard to the efficacy criteria, 37% of patients reported pain relief or painfree after two hours, 12 patients after treatment with acetaminophen and 10 patients after treatment with placebo. Out of these, 3 patients in the acetaminophen and 4 patients in the placebo group were painfree. After 24hours 86% of the patients reported pain relief: 24 treated with acetaminophen and 27 treated with placebo. The results indicate, that 1000mg intravenous acetaminophen is not superior to placebo in treating severe acute migraine attacks.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^6d85b919]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.1. Attack report form (diary)

Recommendation:

An easy-to-use electronic diary that captures predefined endpoints should be used. Investigator-initiated trials may use paper diaries.

Comments:

Headache characteristics and response to treatment are best recorded by means of electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities. Data for the index attack and the 2-hour time point should be entered in real time. Adverse events may be collected in the diary or during follow-up visits. Serious AEs need to be reported within 24 hours. In settings where electronic diaries are not available (e.g. investigator-initiated trials), paper diaries may be used.

With diaries, the quantity and quality of collected data tend to be inversely proportional. Complicated report forms with detailed description of symptoms may be difficult for subjects to fill out during attacks. Some trials have been successful using algorithms to ensure that the treated attack is a migraine.

Familiarization with data capture on the trial diary is important. Subjects can complete the diary report for an attack whilst treating with their usual medication prior to entering the trial, and the data are reviewed at the trial site. Subjects can also be asked to complete the diary at the randomization visit by recalling events of their most recent attack. The latter procedure is preferable because it minimizes delays in trial participation.

1.3.2. Primary endpoint: Pain freedom at 2 hours

Recommendation:

1.3.2.1. The percentage of subjects who become pain free at 2 hours after treatment, before the use of any rescue medication, should be the primary measure of efficacy.

Comments:

Freedom from pain before the use of rescue medication is simple, clinically relevant, reflects patients' expectations, and is independent of the confounding effects of other therapies (e.g. rescue medication). With respect to the 2-hour time point, it may be argued that because some acute treatments have a slow time to maximum or time to effective plasma concentration, an expectation of pain freedom within 2 hours of treatment is unrealistic. This position runs counter to the principles of Good Clinical Practice, which give the highest consideration to subject wellbeing; participants in clinical trials should not be subjected to undue harm, and the use of effective rescue therapies should not be delayed beyond 2 hours. Pain freedom at times before 2 hours should be considered as an endpoint in trials of non-oral treatments (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal).

Areas of insufficient evidence — most studies used placebo comparators, with few head-to-head data and limited economic evaluations. "Most of the studies analyzed in this report compared an intervention of interest versus a placebo (the common comparator in the network meta-analysis); only some were direct head-to-head comparison studies." "The comparative evidence among acetaminophen, combination therapy of an NSAID (aspirin) and acetaminophen, lasmiditan, dihydroergotamine, and CGRP antagonists-gepants (rimegepant, ubrogepant, and zavegepant) was very limited." "Evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the comparative benefits and harms of triptans compared with lasmiditan and CGRP antagonists-gepants." Economic analyses were sparse: "The systematic review identified only 1 CEA comparing 3 drug classes (triptans, CGRP antagonists-gepants, and the ditan lasmiditan)" and "No CEAs were identified assessing other pharmacologic treatments of interest included in this guideline."

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.

According to 7 systematic reviews, triptans compared with placebo were significantly associated with increased pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours and 1 day, and increased risk of mild and transient adverse events. Compared with placebo, rimegepant and ubrogepant were associated with significant improvement in pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours and sustained pain freedom at 1 day and at 1 week. Ubrogepant was associated with significantly more adverse events related to ear, nose, and throat symptoms. The results of the meta-analyses of the pain and function outcomes are summarized in Figure 2.

A subgroup analysis35 by prior response to triptans based on 2 RCTs31, 32 demonstrated that, regardless of prior triptan response, lasmiditan was associated with significantly more pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours compared with placebo. Twenty-six RCTs36 -61 with 2561 patients evaluated antiemetic medications. The overall risk of bias was moderate to high. Compared with placebo, dihydroergotamine was associated with significantly more pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week, sustained pain freedom and pain relief at 1 day and 1 week, and gastrointestinal adverse events. Compared with placebo, tramadol in combination with acetaminophen was significantly associated with improved pain freedom at 2 hours.

Introduction

Migraine is a neurological condition that significantly impacts individuals, marked by recurring, moderate-to-severe, one-sided pulsating headaches, frequently associated with symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light, and cognitive dysfunction. Its pathogenesis involves complex interactions among genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and endogenous regulatory mechanisms. Migraine affects about 1.04 billion people worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global population. Studies spanning 1990 to 2019 document that South Asia exhibits the greatest migraine prevalence, reporting 154,490,169.8 cases. Additionally, for individuals globally between 15 and 49 years old, migraine constitutes the primary cause of disability burden. As the second most significant contributor to global disability, migraine significantly affects socioeconomic factors, including reduced work productivity and higher healthcare costs.

Current pharmacological management relies primarily on acute and preventive therapies. According to the guidelines, acute treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), acetaminophen, and triptans (eg, sumatriptan), which remain first-line for mild-to-severe attacks depending on response. Ergot derivatives (eg, dihydroergotamine), antiemetics (eg, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine), and combination regimens (eg, triptan plus NSAID) are also utilized in selected cases. Preventive therapies encompass beta-blockers (eg, propranolol, metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (eg, flunarizine, verapamil), antiepileptic drugs (eg, topiramate, valproate), and tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline), as well as newer agents targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway. Despite the availability of these diverse classes, chronic use may lead to medication-overuse headaches, dependence, or adverse effects (eg, gastrointestinal disturbances), while substantial proportion of patients report inadequate symptom control. These challenges underscore the need for safer, more tolerable therapeutic alternatives.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^db76f159]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.3.4.5. Headache relief

Recommendations:

1.3.4.5.1. Headache relief, defined as the decrease in headache pain from moderate or severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours after treatment and before taking any rescue medication (refer to Section 1.2.11), should be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

1.3.4.5.2. A time point before 2 hours after treatment can be used when testing parenteral treatments.

Comments:

Headache relief should be used as an outcome measure, but only as a secondary endpoint and mainly to facilitate comparison of the results of new clinical trials with those of previous programmes (.). Since headache relief is associated with relief of disability, it can be used in clinical trials as a proxy for pain improvement and restoration of function. Headache relief is also useful for comprehensive cost of treatment analyses.

In older acute migraine clinical trials, headache relief at 2 hours after treatment was used extensively as a primary efficacy outcome based on the suggestion that patients may consider an acute treatment effective while residual headache pain persists. The validity of this argument has been challenged by evidence showing that patients do not believe a reduction in headache pain from moderate to mild constitutes success and expect acute treatment to provide freedom from pain. In addition, the headache relief endpoint assumes that the magnitude of change from severe pain to no pain is clinically equivalent to the change from moderate pain to mild pain, which is not the case. Finally, the verbal rating of pain intensity as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe assumes it is an interval variable in the absence of clinical validation.

1.3.4.6. Time to meaningful relief

Recommendation:

Time to meaningful relief can be used as a secondary efficacy measure.

Comments:

Time to meaningful relief is most often assessed by subjects using electronic diaries with time-stamp capabilities, which have largely replaced the use of stopwatches. The time-stamped information improves the precision of time estimates relative to the fixed-interval assessments once commonly used in migraine trials by providing data about treatment response over a clinically relevant period of time instead of at pre-specified time points (e.g. 1, 2, or 4 hours after treatment). Time stamping also allows diary entries for time to meaningful relief to be analysed by powerful statistical methods, such as survival analysis, that are superior to analyses based on fixed intervals.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^7d96c8b9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) recommendations and considerations — The CGC recommends combination therapy of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen in nonpregnant adults seeking acute treatment of an episodic migraine who have an inadequate response to NSAIDs and acetaminophen monotherapies, recognizes that triptan monotherapy is an effective treatment, determined that combination therapy of a triptan (sumatriptan or rizatriptan) and an NSAID (naproxen) or acetaminophen had a greater net benefit than triptan monotherapy, and stated that the evidence was uncertain for combination therapy of an NSAID (aspirin) and acetaminophen; no eligible CEAs compared the combination of a triptan and an NSAID versus the combination of a triptan and acetaminophen, and the CGC considered intervention cost differences negligible (all had annualized wholesale acquisition costs of about ($500)), with combinations of a triptan with an NSAID or acetaminophen largely less costly than CGRP antagonists ($599) and lasmiditan ($668); the evidence on patients' values and preferences showed that the combination of a triptan and an NSAID may have a favorable net benefit compared with monotherapy using acetaminophen or a CGRP antagonist-gepant, and patients may consider some oral medication over other routes of administration, with the CGC Public Panel preferring acetaminophen, an NSAID, triptan monotherapy, or combination therapies of a triptan and an NSAID or acetaminophen and reporting no preference for dihydroergotamine or CGRP antagonists-gepant.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^f2e4922a]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.10. Number of attacks treated

Recommendations:

1.2.10.1. Determining the effect of an acute treatment on the first migraine attack should be the primary objective. The attack to be considered should be clearly specified in the protocol.

1.2.10.2. If multiple attacks are treated, the first treated attack or the attack that will be considered for assessing the primary objective can be randomly selected.

Comments:

In most clinical trials of acute treatment, the first treated attack will be used in the evaluation of efficacy. Refer to Section 1.2.12 for information about multiple-attack trials addressing consistency of response as a primary objective.

1.2.11. Rescue medication

Recommendations:

1.2.11.1. The use of rescue medication should be allowed at any time after the first primary efficacy time point, typically 2 hours after the initial administration of treatment.

1.2.11.2. Use of rescue medication before the 2-hour endpoint should be considered a treatment failure unless an earlier time point for rescue was pre-specified in the trial protocol.

Comments:

The time interval to using rescue medication can be reduced when the primary efficacy time point is before 2 hours, which is often the case in assessments of parenteral drugs or trials involving paediatric subjects. Little can be learned from delaying rescue medications beyond the primary efficacy time point. Furthermore, delays may unduly discomfort subjects and prolong the attack and associated disability, which are ethically unacceptable. Rescue medication can be taken before the time of the primary endpoint if subjects require it, but such use should be recorded as a treatment failure.

### French guidelines for the diagnosis and management of migraine in adults and children [^94aefd28]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The French Recommendations for Clinical Practice: Diagnosis and Therapy of Migraine are guidelines concerning the overall management of patients with migraine, including diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and assessment of disability.

Objective

This article summarizes the guidelines as they apply to adults and children, and proposes future direction for steps toward optimal treatment of migraine in patients in France.

Methods

The recommendations were categorized into 3 levels of proof (A-C) according to the National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES) methodology and were based on a professional consensus reached among members of the Working Group and the Guidelines Review Group of the ANAES.

Results

The International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine should be used in routine clinical practice. Recommended agents for the treatment of migraine in adults include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) monotherapy or in combination with metoclopramide, acetaminophen monotherapy, triptans, ergotamine tartrate, and dihydroergotamine mesylate. Patients should use the medication as early as possible after the onset of migraine headache. For migraine prophylaxis in adults, the following can be used: propranolol, metoprolol, oxetorone, or amitriptyline as first-line treatment, and pizotifen, flunarizine, valproate sodium, or topiramate as second-line treatment. Migraine in children can be distinguished from that in adults by shorter duration (2–48 hours in children aged < 15 years), more frequent bilateral localization, frequent predominant gastrointestinal disturbances, and frequent pallor hailing the onset of the attack. The following drugs are recommended in children and adolescents: ibuprofen in children aged > 6 months, diclofenac in children weighing > 16 kg, naproxen in children aged > 6 years or weighing > 25 kg, ASA alone or in combination with metoclopramide, acetaminophen alone or in combination with metoclopramide, and ergotamine tartrate in children aged > 10 years.

Conclusions

These guidelines are intended to help general practitioners to manage migraine patients according to the rules of evidence-based medicine.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^26f3ef67]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

Headache medicine and therapeutics evidence have been rapidly expanding and evolving since the 2020 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the management of headache. Therefore, the CPG was revised in 2023, earlier than the standard 5-year cycle. This article reviews the 2023 CPG recommendations relevant to primary care clinicians for treatment and prevention of migraine and tension-type headache (TTH).

Methods

Subject experts from the VA and the DoD developed 12 key questions, which guided a systematic search using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After reviewing evidence from 5 databases published between 6 March 2019 and 16 August 2022, the work group considered the strength and quality of the evidence, patient preferences, and benefits versus harms on critical outcomes before making consensus recommendations.

Recommendations

The revised CPG includes 52 recommendations on evaluation, pharmacotherapy, invasive interventions, and nonpharmacologic interventions for selected primary and secondary headache disorders. In addition to triptans and aspirin-acetaminophen-caffeine, newer calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (gepants) are options for treatment of acute migraine. Medications to prevent episodic migraine (EM) include angiotensin-receptor blockers, lisinopril, magnesium, topiramate, valproate, memantine, the newer CGRP monoclonal antibodies, and atogepant. AbobotulinumtoxinA can be used for prevention of chronic migraine but not EM. Gabapentin is not recommended for prevention of EM. Ibuprofen (400 mg) and acetaminophen (1000 mg) can be used for treatment of TTH, and amitriptyline for prevention of chronic TTH. Physical therapy or aerobic exercise can be used in management of TTH and migraines.

Outcomes of interest and adverse event handling — prioritized outcomes were migraine frequency, migraine duration, number of acute medication intake days, frequency of migraine-related emergency department visits, migraine-related disability, QoL, physical functioning, and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). The accompanying systematic review did not identify eligible studies that assessed physical functioning or the frequency of emergency department visits. AEs were captured through FDA labels and eligible studies if the studies reported a significant difference in the incidence of an AE or the difference was 5% or more between groups, and AEs were not rated using the GRADE approach.

### Quality appraisal of existing guidelines for the management of headache disorders by the AGREE II's method [^a162f28f]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of existing clinical practice guidelines for headache management and their main recommendations.

Background

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines have been developed to support the clinical decision-making. However, to achieve this goal, the quality of these guidelines must be ensured.

Methods

A systematic search for clinical practice guidelines for headache management was conducted in the PubMed database, in websites of known guideline developers and in websites of known headache associations. The quality appraisal was performed through the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II method.

Results

Twelve guidelines were evaluated. The domains of rigor of development, applicability, and editorial independence, which most influence the overall quality of guidelines, had the lowest average scores and the highest standard deviation rates (61% ± 23; 37% ± 20; 53% ± 31). The main recommendations regarding medication use for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache and migraine in adult patients consisted of paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in all guidelines.

Conclusions

The statistical results indicate that the appraised guidelines have room for both individual and collective improvement. In addition, there is a well-established medication recommendation pattern among all guidelines evaluated.

### Early improvements with atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine: results from 3 randomized phase 3 trials [^f3a765b3]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine affects an estimated 1.1 billion individuals worldwide and is the second leading cause of disability in the general population, and the leading cause of disability in young, adult women. In addition, migraine causes more years lived with disability than all other neurologic diseases combined. Migraine substantially affects daily life during and between attacks, with patients reporting negative effects on relationships, parenting, career, and finances, all leading to an increase in daily stress and a lower quality of life. Owing to the high disability in the migraine population, treatments for migraine should have both a high efficacy and a rapid onset of action.

Current conventional oral preventive treatments require dose titration and may take weeks to months to demonstrate maximum efficacy. In addition, individuals may experience suboptimal efficacy, safety, or tolerability issues, causing premature treatment discontinuation and cycling through multiple classes of conventional oral preventive treatments. The American Headache Society treatment guidelines state that a preventive migraine treatment should reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and also improve function and quality of life and reduce disability. Rapid onset of action may lead to earlier improvements in daily functioning, work productivity, and disability, reducing the overall effect of migraine on patient lives.

### Drugs for the acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents [^2692bc69]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous medications are available for the acute treatment of migraine in adults, and some have now been approved for use in children and adolescents in the ambulatory setting. A systematic review of acute treatment of migraine medication trials in children and adolescents will help clinicians make evidence-informed management choices.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions by any route of administration versus placebo for migraine in children and adolescents 17 years of age or less. For the purposes of this review, children were defined as under 12 years of age and adolescents 12 to 17 years of age.

Search Methods

We searched seven bibliographic databases and four clinical trial registers as well as gray literature for studies through February 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective randomized controlled clinical trials of children and adolescents with migraine, comparing acute symptom relieving migraine medications with placebo in the ambulatory setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the full text of potentially eligible studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data for studies meeting inclusion criteria. We calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for dichotomous data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for proportions of adverse events. The percentage of pain-free patients at two hours was the primary efficacy outcome measure. We used adverse events to evaluate safety and tolerability. Secondary outcome measures included headache relief, use of rescue medication, headache recurrence, presence of nausea, and presence of vomiting. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified a total of 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of migraine symptom-relieving medications, in which 9158 children and adolescents were enrolled and 7630 (range of mean age between 8.2 and 14.7 years) received medication. Twenty-four studies focused on drugs in the triptan class, including almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, sumatriptan + naproxen sodium, and zolmitriptan. Other medications studied included paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, and dihydroergotamine (DHE). More than half of the studies evaluated sumatriptan. All but one study reported adverse event data. Most studies presented a low or unclear risk of bias, and the overall quality of evidence, according to GRADE criteria, was low to moderate, downgraded mostly due to imprecision and inconsistency. Ibuprofen was more effective than placebo for producing pain freedom at two hours in two small studies that included 162 children (RR 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 3.04) with low quality evidence (due to imprecision). Paracetamol was not superior to placebo in one small study of 80 children. Triptans as a class of medication were superior to placebo in producing pain freedom in 3 studies involving 273 children (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.62, NNTB 13) (moderate quality evidence) and 21 studies involving 7026 adolescents (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in the effect sizes between studies involving children versus adolescents. Triptans were associated with an increased risk of minor (non-serious) adverse events in adolescents (RD 0.13, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18, NNTH 8), but studies did not report any serious adverse events. The risk of minor adverse events was not significant in children (RD 0.06, 95% CI - 0.04 to 0.17, NNTH 17). Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium was superior to placebo in one study involving 490 adolescents (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.94, NNTB 6) (moderate quality evidence). Oral dihydroergotamine was not superior to placebo in one small study involving 13 children.

Authors' Conclusions

Low quality evidence from two small trials shows that ibuprofen appears to improve pain freedom for the acute treatment of children with migraine. We have only limited information on adverse events associated with ibuprofen in the trials included in this review. Triptans as a class are also effective at providing pain freedom in children and adolescents but are associated with higher rates of minor adverse events. Sumatriptan plus naproxen sodium is also effective in treating adolescents with migraine.

Aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine (AAC) for the acute treatment of migraine — across seven randomized controlled trials (n = 3,306) versus placebo, the analysis strongly favored a benefit for pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, with an NNT of 9 for pain freedom at 2 hours and an NNT of 4 for pain relief at 2 hours; adverse events were higher with AAC with pooled results reporting 10.9% (AAC) and 7.8% (placebo) of patients having at least one AE. Populations for whom this medication might be inappropriate include those with peptic ulcer disorder, pregnant patients in the third trimester, and individuals with greater than seven migraines per month, and excessive use might increase the risk for MOH; limitations included that three of the RCTs in the SR, representing approximately one-third of the pooled population, excluded patients who typically experienced vomiting or had incapacitating migraines and none of the studies included patients who had more than seven migraines per month, so the evidence might or might not be generalizable to a VA or DoD primary care population.

The efficacy of QULIPTA for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults was demonstrated in two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2). The studies enrolled patients with at least a 1-year history of migraine with or without aura, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria.

In Study 1 (NCT03777059), 910 patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg (N = 222), QULIPTA 30 mg (N = 230), QULIPTA 60 mg (N = 235), or placebo (N = 223), once daily for 12 weeks. In Study 2 (NCT02848326), 652 patients were randomized 1:2:2:2 to receive QULIPTA 10 mg (N = 94), QULIPTA 30 mg (N = 185), QULIPTA 60 mg (N = 187), or placebo (N = 186), once daily for 12 weeks. In both studies, patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids) as needed. The use of a concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway was not permitted for either acute or preventive treatment of migraine. The studies excluded patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks within six months prior to screening.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^92c55424]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other.

### Efficacy and safety of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine in alleviating migraine headache pain… [^ffcc83df]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Significantly greater reductions in migraine headache pain intensity 1 to 6 hours after dose were seen in patients taking the acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine combination than in those taking placebo in each of the 3 studies. In addition, by 6 hours after dose, 50. 8% of the drug-treated patients were pain free compared with
23. 5% of the placebo-treated patients. Other migraine headache characteristics, such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, were significantly improved 2 to 6 hours after treatment with the acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine combination compared with placebo. Efficacy and safety results are presented for the 3 studies separately and for the pooled analysis. In each of the 3 studies, patients taking the drug combination had significantly higher mean pain intensity difference scores than patients taking placebo at all time points from 1 hour to 6 hours after dose. In the pooled analysis and in study 1 and study 3, patients who received active treatment also had significantly higher mean pain intensity difference scores than did placebo-treated patients beginning at the 0. 5-hour time point. Analysis of these primary efficacy measurements with the use of the ITT population produced essentially identical results. In the pooled analysis, the proportion of patients who required rescue medication was significantly greater in the placebo group than in the acetaminophen-aspirin-caffeine group from 3 to 6 hours after dose. For example, by hour 6, only 12. 5% of the 602 drug-treated patients needed to remedicate, compared with
27. 2% of the 618 placebo-treated patients. Significant differences favoring the drug treatment were found in each of the 3 studies from 1 to 6 hours after dose.

Significant differences between drug and placebo were observed as early as 0. 5 hour after dose for pain intensity difference from baseline and for pain reduced to mild or none in 2 studies and in the pooled analysis. Patients in the drug groups also experienced significant improvements in ability to perform usual activities at 1 hour after dose and all time points thereafter.

### Dietary alteration of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids for headache reduction in adults with migraine: randomized controlled trial [^8b4a52d1]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Acute headache related drugs

In intention-to-treat analysis of the number of instances per day that participants used acute headache related drugs (table 2), the H3 diet decreased total instances of acute drug use (including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, triptans) compared with the control diet (−0.4, 95% confidence interval −0.7 to −0.1, P = 0.01); the H3-L6 diet did not alter total acute pain drug use (−0.04, −0.4 to 0.3, P = 0.83). Both diets decreased the use of NSAIDs or aspirin compared with the control diet (H3-L6 diet: −0.2, −0.4 to −0.1, P = 0.01; H3 diet: −0.1, −0.3 to 0.1, P = 0.20), and the difference between the effect of the H3-L6 and H3 diets was relatively small (−0.1, −0.3 to 0.04, P = 0.13). Both intervention diets did not decrease the instances of use of migraine abortive drugs (triptans).

### Practice guideline update summary: acute treatment of migraine in children and adolescents: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^9feb91a6]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for migraine, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients (counseling on acute treatment), AAN/AHS 2019 guidelines recommend to counsel patients that acute migraine treatments are more likely to be effective when used earlier in the migraine attack, when pain is still mild.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine, summary version [^3dca36bc]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.
