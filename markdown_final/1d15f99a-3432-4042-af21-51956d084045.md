## Question

What are the clinical indications for neostigmine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical indications for neostigmine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indication and core mechanism of action. Then, I should verify diagnostic applications, particularly the neostigmine test for myasthenia gravis. Next, I will consider off-label gastrointestinal uses such as acute colonic pseudo-obstruction and drug-induced ileus. After that, I need to examine emerging or investigational indications like postdural puncture headache and neuraxial analgesic adjunct use, as well as effects on postoperative cognition. I will then review dosing, timing, monitoring requirements, contraindications, adverse effects, and special populations, and finally compare neostigmine with sugammadex to contextualize clinical decisions before summarizing the indications coherently.

> Let me first confirm the primary, FDA-labeled indication: neostigmine methylsulfate is indicated to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery, which it achieves by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, and competitively displacing the blocker; this remains its most robust and universally accepted clinical use [^114JsCJH] [^111wqgKh] [^112syMNv] [^114oM8kJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about broader approvals; for diagnostic use, I should verify the evidence for the neostigmine test in suspected myasthenia gravis, where intramuscular neostigmine 0.5 mg has been reported with sensitivity around 83% and specificity near 97%, offering a safer alternative to edrophonium in some settings, though this is not an FDA-labeled diagnostic indication and practice varies geographically [^113dgqdH].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal applications; the ASCRS guideline recommends pharmacologic therapy with neostigmine for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction that fails conservative measures, and case literature supports its utility even in complex scenarios like pregnancy once mechanical obstruction is excluded, with typical intravenous doses of about 2.0–2.5 mg and the need for vigilant cardiac monitoring given bradyarrhythmia risk [^117UEiSj] [^117A9fit] [^112qcjKh].

> Wait, let me verify drug-induced ileus data; while evidence consists largely of case reports, neostigmine has facilitated gut decontamination and whole-bowel irrigation in poisonings complicated by ileus by restoring motility when other strategies failed, underscoring an off-label but sometimes practical role in toxicology settings [^112qcjKh].

> I will now examine emerging or investigational indications; randomized data suggest that neostigmine combined with atropine can improve pain scores in postdural puncture headache, but muscarinic adverse effects can occur, epidural administration produces modest postoperative analgesia at the cost of dose-related sedation, and small trials in older adults suggest reduced early postoperative cognitive decline after standard reversal dosing, although overall certainty remains limited and requires confirmation [^1159co9y] [^117WVQxk] [^114RuuhP].

> Let me think about dosing, timing, and monitoring; for NMBA reversal, neostigmine is given intravenously at 0.03–0.07 mg/kg, injected slowly over at least 1 minute, with the lower end used when there has been more spontaneous recovery and the higher end when recovery is shallow or the NMBA has a longer half-life, and it must be paired with an antimuscarinic such as glycopyrrolate or atropine to blunt bradycardia and secretions, while quantitative or at minimum peripheral nerve stimulator monitoring should guide timing and assess adequacy of recovery, with a recommended maximum total dose of 0.07 mg/kg or 5 mg, whichever is less [^113U1PHH] [^111wqgKh] [^112syMNv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, the example of "short-acting NMBAs (e.g., rocuronium)" could be misleading because rocuronium is generally considered an intermediate-acting agent; let me verify labeling language, which indeed recommends 0.03 mg/kg when reversing agents with shorter half-lives and cites rocuronium as an example, so I will adhere to the label guidance while acknowledging the pharmacologic convention that rocuronium is intermediate-acting [^113U1PHH].

> I should confirm pediatric and special-population considerations; labeling indicates pediatric dosing follows adult guidance with similar weight-based dosing, and in renal or hepatic impairment formal dose adjustment is not mandated on the FDA label but closer monitoring is advised due to altered NMBA kinetics and potential mismatch with neostigmine duration, whereas some drug compendia propose graduated dose reductions in severe renal dysfunction or dialysis, so, hold on, I should reconcile this by prioritizing label recommendations and individualized titration with TOF monitoring while recognizing compendia may suggest reductions in advanced renal failure [^111wqgKh] [^113ub48j] [^116PaweA] [^1119VoJy] [^113JxHjg] [^112GEWfh] [^111Nq8pu].

> Next, I should review contraindications and adverse effects; neostigmine is contraindicated in hypersensitivity and in peritonitis or mechanical obstruction of the intestinal or urinary tract, and common adverse reactions include bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting, with broader muscarinic and nicotinic toxicities reported in postmarketing, which underscores why coadministration of an antimuscarinic and vigilant cardiopulmonary monitoring are standard, and I need to ensure clinicians remain alert to cholinergic crisis versus myasthenic crisis when treating neuromuscular weakness [^112HGpth] [^113UFLT3] [^115CPwC9] [^115jiwd6] [^112UyThJ].

> Hold on, I should verify safety nuances that influence bedside practice; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can paradoxically worsen upper airway dilator function and induce weakness if administered after full recovery, so timing guided by objective neuromuscular monitoring is critical, and although epidural neostigmine can aid analgesia, sedation and shivering occur at higher doses, which may limit its routine use [^111FPFmk] [^113zgfEp] [^117WVQxk].

> Let me consider comparative context with sugammadex so decision-making is balanced; multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show sugammadex provides faster, more predictable reversal with fewer global and respiratory adverse events compared with neostigmine, including at deep block where neostigmine is generally ineffective, but anaphylaxis has been reported with sugammadex whereas comparative anaphylaxis data for neostigmine are sparse, so selection should reflect depth of block, patient risk profile, monitoring capabilities, cost, and institutional protocols [^113mSp1i] [^112wryHY] [^112VQkVW] [^113FRzby] [^1117ZMVD] [^114zWxgZ].

> I need to ensure GI off-label dosing safety is explicit; when using neostigmine for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, dosing is typically 2–2.5 mg IV given slowly with continuous cardiac monitoring and immediate availability of atropine due to risk of severe bradycardia, and use is inappropriate if mechanical obstruction is present, which aligns with guideline recommendations to reserve it for cases refractory to conservative therapy [^117UEiSj] [^112qcjKh] [^112HGpth].

> Finally, I will synthesize the indications coherently; the primary and approved indication is reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade after surgery, a well-established diagnostic application is the neostigmine test for myasthenia gravis in select settings, evidence-based off-label therapeutic uses include acute colonic pseudo-obstruction after failed conservative measures and drug-induced ileus in toxicology scenarios, and emerging or investigational uses include treatment of postdural puncture headache with atropine coadministration, epidural adjunct analgesia with sedation trade-offs, and potential reduction of early postoperative cognitive decline in older adults, with all uses requiring careful dosing, antimuscarinic coadministration, and objective monitoring to mitigate muscarinic adverse effects and paradoxical weakness [^114JsCJH] [^113dgqdH] [^117UEiSj] [^112qcjKh] [^1159co9y] [^117WVQxk] [^114RuuhP] [^112syMNv] [^113U1PHH].

---

Neostigmine is primarily used for **reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade** after surgery [^114JsCJH], with dosing guided by train-of-four monitoring [^111wqgKh] and co-administration of an anticholinergic to mitigate bradycardia [^112syMNv]. It is also used for **acute colonic pseudo-obstruction** when conservative measures fail [^117UEiSj], and as a **diagnostic aid in myasthenia gravis** [^113dgqdH]. Common adverse effects include bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting [^113UFLT3]; it is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity, peritonitis, or mechanical obstruction [^112HGpth].

## Clinical indications

### Reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade

- **Primary indication**: Reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) [^114JsCJH] such as rocuronium, vecuronium, and pancuronium after surgical procedures [^113mSp1i].

- **Mechanism**: Inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, competing with NMBAs and restoring muscle function [^114oM8kJ].

- **Dosing**: 0.03–0.07 mg/kg IV [^112syMNv], individualized based on neuromuscular monitoring [^113U1PHH]; maximum total dose 0.07 mg/kg or 5 mg, whichever is less [^111wqgKh].

- **Anticholinergic co-administration**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate [^112DV1qV] should be given prior to or with neostigmine to reduce bradycardia risk [^112syMNv].

---

### Treatment of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)

Neostigmine is recommended for **acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)** [^117A9fit] when conservative management fails [^117UEiSj]. It **enhances gastrointestinal motility** by increasing acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors [^114oM8kJ].

---

### Diagnostic aid in myasthenia gravis

The **neostigmine test** [^113dgqdH] supports the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis by transiently improving muscle strength in suspected cases. A **short-lived improvement** after administration supports this diagnosis [^113dgqdH].

---

## Off-label uses

Off-label, neostigmine is occasionally used for **postoperative urinary retention** to stimulate bladder contraction. It is also used to enhance intestinal motility in **drug-induced ileus** secondary to overdose [^112qcjKh].

---

## Contraindications

Neostigmine is contraindicated in patients with **known hypersensitivity** [^112HGpth] to neostigmine methylsulfate. It is also contraindicated in patients with **peritonitis or mechanical obstruction** of the intestinal or urinary tract [^112HGpth].

## References

### Neostigmine [^111wqgKh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

When the first twitch response to the TOF stimulus is substantially greater than 10% of baseline or when a second twitch is present, the 0.07 mg/kg dose is recommended. This dosage is suitable for NMBAs with longer half-lives, such as vecuronium and pancuronium, or when the first twitch response is relatively weak, i.e. not substantially greater than 10% of baseline, or when there is a need for more rapid recovery.

TOF monitoring should continue to be used to evaluate the extent of recovery of neuromuscular function and the possible need for an additional dose of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. However, TOF monitoring alone should not be relied upon to determine the adequacy of reversal of neuromuscular blockade as it relates to a patient's ability to adequately ventilate and maintain a patent airway following tracheal extubation. Patients should continue to be monitored for adequacy of reversal from NMBAs for a period of time that would assure full recovery based on the patient's medical condition and the pharmacokinetics of neostigmine and the NMBA used. The recommended maximum total dose is 0.07 mg/kg or up to a total of 5 mg, whichever is less.

- **Dosage in pediatric patients, including neonates**: Adult guidelines should be followed when neostigmine methylsulfate injection is administered to pediatric patients. Pediatric patients require neostigmine methylsulfate injection doses similar to those for adult patients.

- **Anticholinergic (atropine or glycopyrrolate) administration**: An anticholinergic agent, e.g. atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate, should be administered.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^113dgqdH]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Provocative tests**: Provocative tests with quinine or curare are of historical importance only and are not used in clinical practice. The neostigmine test (NT) and edrophonium (Tensilon) test are rarely performed in the United Kingdom but are still used in other countries. Although there are several variations of the edrophonium test, the first published protocol was a 2 mg initial dose intravenously, followed, if no adverse reaction (usually cholinergic side effects) occurred within 45 seconds, by the administration of an additional 8 mg. One cohort study of the Tensilon test reported a sensitivity of 92% for ocular myasthenia and 88% for generalized myasthenia. Specificity was 97% for both types of myasthenia. No statistically significant differences have been found in the edrophonium test results between MuSK antibody-positive and MuSK antibody-negative patients. However, like RNS studies and SFEMG, edrophonium responsiveness is not necessarily diagnostic of MG.

NT is claimed to have a better safety profile when testing patients with MG compared to edrophonium, as the latter can cause serious bradyarrhythmias and syncope as well as respiratory failure, although the incidence of these complications is very low. One study involving 47 patients showed the sensitivity of NT to be 83% and specificity to be 97%. An improvement in clinical symptoms in response to NT (0.5 mg neostigmine administered intramuscularly) could be used as supporting evidence for the diagnosis of MG. However, this improvement can be better detected using SFEMG compared to clinical examinations only.

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection is a cholinesterase inhibitor indicated for the reversal of the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery.

- **Indications and usage**: Neostigmine methylsulfate injection, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is indicated for the reversal of the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) after surgery.

---

### Neostigmine [^112HGpth]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection is contraindicated in patients with:

- **Known hypersensitivity**: This includes reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, erythema multiforme, generalized rash, facial swelling, peripheral edema, pyrexia, flushing, hypotension, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and anaphylaxis.

- **Peritonitis or mechanical obstruction**: Conditions like these affect the intestinal or urinary tract.

### Neostigmine [^113UFLT3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The most common adverse reactions during treatment include bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting.

	-
- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions to neostigmine methylsulfate are most often attributable to exaggerated pharmacological effects, particularly at muscarinic receptor sites. The use of an anticholinergic agent, such as atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate, may prevent or mitigate these reactions. Quantitative adverse event data are available from trials of neostigmine methylsulfate in which 200 adult patients were exposed to the product. The following table lists the adverse reactions that occurred with an overall frequency of 1% or greater.

- **Post-marketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during parenteral use of neostigmine methylsulfate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### The effect of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine in combination with neostigmine on cardiovascular system for reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial [^112DV1qV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

- **Randomization and blinding**: Using a computer-generated randomization table, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the glycopyrrolate group (group G) or the atropine group (group A). Group assignments were secured in a sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelope, which was then handed to a nurse who was not involved in the study. Test drugs were prepared in identical 10 mL syringes by the same nurse. The anesthesiologists involved in anesthesia management and postoperative follow-up were blinded to the group assignments.

- **Anesthetic and surgical management**: Once in the operating room, all subjects underwent standard monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG), NBP, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), and bispectral index (BIS). After inducing general anesthesia with alfentanil (0.03–0.08 mg/kg), etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg), tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initiated. The appropriate depth of anesthesia (BIS value 40–60) was maintained by micropump infusion of propofol (2–4 mg/kg/h), remifentanil (0.05–0.15 µg/kg/min), and 0.5–2 vol% sevoflurane/oxygen/air mix inhalation. Intraoperative blood pressure was kept within 20% of baseline, and HR was maintained at 45–90 beats per minute (bpm). One-third of the induction dose of cisatracurium was added intraoperatively as needed. There were no additional muscle relaxants administered for at least 30 minutes before the procedure ended. At the end of the surgical procedure, the administration of sevoflurane inhalation, propofol, and remifentanil pumping was discontinued.

### Efficacy and safety of sugammadex compared to neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112wryHY]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). High credibility.

Sugammadex has been introduced for reversal of rocuronium (or vecuronium)-induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Although its efficacy has been established, data are conflicting on whether it is safer than neostigmine, which is traditionally used for reversing NMB.

- **Design**: A meta-analysis of data concerning the effectiveness and safety of sugammadex compared to neostigmine for reversing NMB in adults was performed using the PRISMA methodology.

- **Setting**: University medical hospital.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to identify English-language randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers independently selected the trials, extracted data on reversal times, incomplete reversals of NMB, and adverse events (AEs), and assessed the trials' methodological quality and evidence level. Only AEs related to the study drug, as assessed by a blinded safety assessor, were considered for meta-analysis.

- **Patients**: A total of 1,384 patients from 13 articles were included in this meta-analysis.

- **Main results**: Compared to neostigmine, sugammadex was faster in reversing NMB (p < 0.0001) and more likely to be associated with higher train-of-four ratio values at extubation (mean difference, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.22; p < 0.0001) and a lower risk of postoperative residual curarization after extubation (odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01–0.43; p = 0.0068). Additionally, sugammadex was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of global AEs (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34–0.66; p < 0.0001) and respiratory AEs compared to neostigmine.

### Neostigmine [^112syMNv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be administered by trained healthcare providers familiar with the use, actions, characteristics, and complications of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) and neuromuscular block reversal agents. Doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be individualized, and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to determine the time of initiation of neostigmine methylsulfate injection and should be used to determine the need for additional doses.

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection is for intravenous use only and should be injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute. The neostigmine methylsulfate injection dosage is weight-based [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection administration and until complete recovery of normal ventilation, the patient should be well ventilated and a patent airway maintained. Satisfactory recovery should be judged by the adequacy of skeletal muscle tone and respiratory measurements, in addition to the response to peripheral nerve stimulation.

An anticholinergic agent, e.g. atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate, should be administered prior to or concomitantly with neostigmine methylsulfate injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults [^113mSp1i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, have traditionally been used for the reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. However, these drugs have significant limitations, such as indirect mechanisms of reversal, limited and unpredictable efficacy, and undesirable autonomic responses. Sugammadex is a selective relaxant-binding agent specifically developed for the rapid reversal of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium. Its potential clinical benefits include fast and predictable reversal of any degree of block, increased patient safety, reduced incidence of residual block on recovery, and more efficient use of healthcare resources.

- **Objectives**: The main objective of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases on 2 May 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), Embase (WebSPIRS Ovid SP), and the clinical trials registries www.controlled-trials.com, clinicaltrials.gov, and www.centerwatch.com. We re-ran the search on 10 May 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) irrespective of publication status, date of publication, blinding status, outcomes published, or language. We included adults classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I to IV, who received non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents for an elective in-patient or day-case surgery.

### Mestinon [^116cX2dG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Mestinon inhibits the destruction of acetylcholine by cholinesterase, thereby allowing freer transmission of nerve impulses across the neuromuscular junction. Pyridostigmine, an analog of neostigmine (Prostigmin), differs in clinically significant respects. For example, pyridostigmine is characterized by a longer duration of action and fewer gastrointestinal side effects.

### Use of neostigmine for the management of drug induced ileus in severe poisonings [^112qcjKh]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Effective whole bowel irrigation may be difficult in the presence of drug-induced ileus. Neostigmine, which inhibits the enzymatic degradation of acetylcholine, has been suggested to improve drug-induced ileus. This paper presents two poisoning cases in which neostigmine was used to facilitate gut decontamination complicated by ileus.

- **Case reports**: A 47-year-old woman, after an overdose with sodium valproate, venlafaxine, and ibuprofen, developed ileus that prevented whole bowel irrigation. Neostigmine, 2.5 mg intravenously followed by 1.25 mg three hours later, led to improved bowel transit and successful whole bowel irrigation. A 25-year-old man developed ileus after an overdose with venlafaxine, dothiepin, and ethanol. Neostigmine administration led to improved intestinal motility and successful whole bowel irrigation.

- **Discussion**: The study demonstrates facilitated gut decontamination temporally associated with the administration of neostigmine in two patients judged to have drug-induced ileus following overdose. No significant adverse events related to neostigmine were observed.

### Use of neostigmine to relieve a suspected colonic pseudoobstruction in pregnancy [^117A9fit]. Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Neostigmine is a treatment option for colonic pseudoobstruction. However, experience in using neostigmine for this indication in pregnant women is limited. We present a case of a woman with an estimated fetal gestational age of 34 weeks who presented with what was believed to be a pseudoobstruction. When conservative management failed, neostigmine was administered with no adverse side effects. Ultimately, the patient was found to have a mechanical obstruction, and we discuss the challenges in making this diagnosis in pregnancy. Neostigmine may be a viable alternative to colonoscopy in pregnant women for whom mechanical obstruction is properly excluded.

### Neostigmine [^114oM8kJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Neostigmine methylsulfate is a competitive cholinesterase inhibitor. By reducing the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine methylsulfate induces an increase in acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, which competes for the same binding site as nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and reverses the neuromuscular blockade.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Neostigmine methylsulfate-induced increases in acetylcholine levels result in the potentiation of both muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic activity. The resulting elevation of acetylcholine competes with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Neostigmine methylsulfate does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and therefore, it does not significantly affect cholinergic function in the central nervous system.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:

	- **Distribution**: Following intravenous injection, the observed neostigmine methylsulfate volume of distribution is reported between 0.12 and 1.4 L/kg. Protein binding of neostigmine methylsulfate to human serum albumin ranges from 15 to 25%.

	- **Metabolism**: Neostigmine methylsulfate is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver.

	- **Elimination**: Following intravenous injection, the reported elimination half-life of neostigmine methylsulfate is between 24 and 113 minutes. Total body clearance is reported between 1.14 and 16.7 mL/min/kg. In patients with renal impairment, the elimination half-life of neostigmine methylsulfate is prolonged compared to normal subjects.

### Neostigmine [^113U1PHH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage in adults**: Peripheral nerve stimulation devices capable of delivering a train-of-four (TOF) stimulus are essential to effectively using neostigmine methylsulfate injection. There must be a twitch response to the first stimulus in the TOF of at least 10% of its baseline level (i.e. the response prior to NMBA administration) prior to the administration of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. Before administration, visually inspect neostigmine methylsulfate injection for particulate matter and discoloration. Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be injected slowly by intravenous route over a period of at least 1 minute. A 0.03 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg dose of neostigmine methylsulfate injection will generally achieve a TOF twitch ratio of 90% (TOF0.9) within 10 to 20 minutes of administration. Dose selection should be based on the extent of spontaneous recovery that has occurred at the time of administration, the half-life of the NMBA being reversed, and whether there is a need to rapidly reverse the NMBA.

	- The 0.03 mg/kg dose is recommended for the reversal of NMBAs with shorter half-lives, e.g. rocuronium.

- **Renal impairment**: The elimination half-life of neostigmine methylsulfate is prolonged in anephric patients compared to normal subjects. Although no adjustments to neostigmine methylsulfate injection dosing appear to be necessary in patients with impaired renal function, they should be closely monitored to ensure the effects of the neuromuscular blocking agent, particularly one cleared by the kidneys, do not persist beyond those of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. In this regard, the interval for re-dosing the neuromuscular blocking agent during the surgical procedure may be useful in determining whether, and to what extent, post-operative monitoring needs to be extended.

- **Hepatic impairment**: The pharmacokinetics of neostigmine methylsulfate in patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied. Neostigmine methylsulfate is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in the liver. No adjustments to the dosing of neostigmine methylsulfate injection appear to be warranted in patients with hepatic insufficiency; however, patients should be carefully monitored if hepatically cleared neuromuscular blocking agents were used during their surgical procedure. Their duration of action may be prolonged by hepatic insufficiency, whereas neostigmine methylsulfate injection, which undergoes renal elimination, will not likely be affected. This could result in the effects of the neuromuscular blocking agent outlasting those of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. This same situation may arise if the neuromuscular blocking agent has active metabolites.

### Postoperative risk of transfusion after reversal of residual neuromuscular block with sugammadex versus neostigmine: A retrospective cohort study [^112QGqL2]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). High credibility.

Sugammadex and neostigmine are routinely used to reverse residual neuromuscular blocks at the end of surgery. Sugammadex has been linked with prolongation of laboratory coagulation markers, but the clinical relevance on postoperative blood loss and transfusions remains unclear.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, single-center, cohort study, we analyzed medical records of adult patients having noncardiac surgery who were given sugammadex or neostigmine from May 2016 to December 2020. Our primary outcome was the incidence of any postoperative transfusion of red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and/or platelets. Secondary outcomes were the duration of hospitalization, the need for resurgery, and postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission. After propensity score weighting, the odds ratio (OR) for postoperative transfusion was assessed in both groups (sugammadex versus neostigmine) using a generalized estimation equation to count within-subject correlation weighted by the inverse propensity score.

- **Results**: Out of 39,325 eligible surgeries, 33,903 surgeries in 29,062 patients were included in the analysis, with 4,581 patients receiving sugammadex and 29,322 patients receiving neostigmine. The raw incidence of postoperative transfusion was 7.40% in the sugammadex group and 7.45% in the neostigmine group. After weighting by propensity score, the incidence of postoperative transfusion was 8.01% in the sugammadex group and 7.38% in the neostigmine group (OR, 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.97–1.26; p = 0.118]). There was no difference in duration of hospitalization and need for resurgery or postoperative ICU admission.

### Epidural neostigmine produces analgesia but also sedation in women after cesarean delivery [^117WVQxk]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Intrathecal neostigmine produces analgesia but also nausea, limiting its utility. In contrast, epidural administration of neostigmine has been suggested to produce postoperative analgesia without causing nausea in nonpregnant patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the dose range for efficacy and side effects of epidural neostigmine in women undergoing cesarean delivery and receiving combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.

- **Methods**: After institutional approval and informed consent, 80 patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were given combined spinal-epidural anesthesia with 8 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine plus 10 microg fentanyl. Patients were randomized to receive either saline or 75, 150, or 300 microg neostigmine (n = 20 per group) in 10 mL saline after cord clamping. Pain, morphine consumption, and side effects were monitored for 24 hours.

- **Results**: Global pain assessment for the first 24 hours was reduced from 5.4 ± 0.2 in the saline group to 3.0–3.5 ± 0.3 in the neostigmine groups, dose independently. Correspondingly, global satisfaction with neostigmine was also improved (P < 0.05). Nausea and morphine consumption were similar among groups. Intraoperative shivering and sedation were increased in the 300-microg neostigmine group only (P < 0.05), and postoperative sedation was increased by neostigmine in a dose-independent fashion (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Epidural neostigmine produced modest analgesia in women after cesarean delivery. In contrast with previous reports which focused primarily on nausea, these data suggest that epidural neostigmine can also produce mild sedation.

### Reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block with sugammadex is faster than reversal of cisatracurium-induced block with neostigmine [^114N7Ld3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The reversal of the residual effect of rocuronium or cisatracurium by neostigmine may be slow and associated with side effects. This randomized, safety-assessor-blinded study compared the efficacy of sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent for the reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, with that of neostigmine for the reversal of cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular block. The safety of both sugammadex and neostigmine was evaluated.

- **Methods**: Adult surgical patients (ASA class I-III) were randomized to receive sugammadex 2.0 mg kg(-1) for the reversal of block induced by rocuronium 0.6 mg kg(-1) or neostigmine 50 microg kg(-1) for the reversal of block induced by cisatracurium 0.15 mg kg(-1). Anesthesia was induced and maintained using intravenous propofol and remifentanil, fentanyl, or sufentanil. Neuromuscular function was monitored using acceleromyography (TOF-Watch SX). Sugammadex or neostigmine was administered at the reappearance of T(2). The primary efficacy variable was the time for recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to 0.9.

- **Results**: Eighty-four patients were randomized, 73 of whom received sugammadex (n = 34) or neostigmine (n = 39). The time from the start of administration of the reversal agent to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 was 4.7 times faster with sugammadex than with neostigmine (geometric mean = 1.9 vs. 9.0 min, P < 0.0001). The reversal of block was sustained in all patients. There were no serious adverse effects from either reversal agent and no significant changes in any measure of safety, except for similar elevations in urinary N-acetyl glucosaminidase in both groups.

### Reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia: Sugammadex versus neostigmine [^115CKu1n]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical signs of recovery were assessed in this study. Except for nine patients in the sugammadex group and ten patients in the neostigmine group, the majority of patients were considered cooperative before being transferred to the recovery room. This allowed for the performance of the 5-second head-lift and general muscle weakness tests. In the group of patients assessed before discharge from the recovery room (41 in the sugammadex group and 34 in the neostigmine group), all but two patients in the sugammadex group and one in the neostigmine group were awake and oriented. All patients were deemed cooperative, and all patients, except for one in the neostigmine group, were able to perform the 5-second head-lift test.

Out of the 41 sugammadex patients and 34 neostigmine patients assessed, four patients exhibited signs of mild general muscle weakness based on the general muscle weakness scale before discharge from the recovery room. In the sugammadex group, one patient scored an 8, and in the neostigmine group, three patients scored 7, 8, and 8 respectively. Despite showing signs of mild muscle weakness, all affected patients successfully performed the 5-second head-lift test before discharge from the recovery room.

### Respiratory muscle activity after spontaneous, neostigmine- or sugammadex-enhanced recovery of neuromuscular blockade: a double blind prospective randomized controlled trial [^114XLLy2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). High credibility.

Use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), their reversal agents, and respiratory outcome after surgery is still the subject of research and debate. The use of neostigmine has been associated with postoperative respiratory complications in some studies, possibly due to paradoxical neostigmine-induced muscle weakness. Other studies could not confirm a clinical presence of acetylcholinesterase-induced muscle weakness. Higher doses of neostigmine seem to worsen respiratory outcomes more than lower doses. This seemingly paradoxical relation has several possible explanations.

- **Inadequate administration**: Either too early or inappropriately dosed neostigmine administration is one explanation.
- **Central depressant effect**: Neostigmine has a central depressant effect on nerve function, potentially resulting in respiratory muscle weakness.

In previous studies, we found lower diaphragmatic activity after neostigmine reversal of an NMB compared to sugammadex. In both studies, diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded in healthy volunteers during spontaneous breathing after NMB reversal. Lower diaphragm activity was associated with smaller tidal volumes and lower arterial oxygen levels. The alternative NMB reversal agent, sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent, does not directly interact with the cholinergic system. The use of sugammadex was associated with improved respiratory outcomes in a cohort of elderly patients relative to neostigmine-reversed or non-reversed patients. The recently published POPULAR study showed an increase in postoperative pulmonary complications after the use of specific agents.

### Comparison of neuromuscular blockade recovery co-administered with neostigmine and different doses of calcium gluconate: A randomized control trial [^113WMvqw]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). High credibility.

It has been well-reported that the release of acetylcholine (Ach) at the neuromuscular junction is calcium-dependent. Calcium increases the probability of transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. A brief calcium administration restrictively and immediately before the depolarizing phase accelerates transmitter release. However, the overall details of the role of ionized calcium for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) recovery by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI) have not yet been clarified.

AchEIs, such as neostigmine, are widely used clinically for non-depolarizing NMB recovery. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and increases the Ach concentration at the neuromuscular junction to achieve neuromuscular function recovery. However, in addition to the pharmacodynamics between non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and AchEIs, factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, anticholinesterase administration timing, body temperature, drug dosage, additional medications, and liver or kidney disease also affect neuromuscular recovery. Therefore, it is essential for anesthesiologists to take these various factors into consideration when recovering NMB.

To determine whether ionized calcium at different doses may have a quantitative effect, this study compared the neuromuscular recovery time and the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) according to the dosage of calcium gluconate co-administered with neostigmine in three patient groups: a 5 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 5 group), a 10 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 10 group), and an unspecified continuation as the text was cut off.

### Reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia: Sugammadex versus neostigmine [^114Pn32m]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

In some types of surgery, including many ENT, thoracic, abdominal, and neurosurgical procedures performed under general anesthesia, maintaining profound relaxation throughout the procedure may be beneficial. However, anesthesiologists are limited in their capacity to provide such levels of neuromuscular block, particularly towards the end of surgery, because the traditional agents available for the reversal of neuromuscular block (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) cannot rapidly reverse profound block. This limitation is especially important if volatile anesthetics have been used, as they are known to potentiate the blocking effect of neuromuscular blocking agents and impair reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

Sugammadex is a new selective relaxant binding agent. Previously, sugammadex has been shown to effectively reverse profound block induced by rocuronium 0.6–1.2 mg/kg, achieving a train-of-four (TOF) ratio > 0.9 within 2–3 minutes of administration. Vecuronium, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with greater potency than rocuronium, shares the same basic steroid nucleus structure as rocuronium. At the time of writing, a single dose-finding study has examined the efficacy of sugammadex to reverse profound block induced by vecuronium.

The present Phase III study was the first to examine the efficacy and safety of sugammadex compared with neostigmine in reversing profound neuromuscular block induced by vecuronium. This study consisted of two arms and assessed the efficacy and safety of sugammadex compared with neostigmine.

### Observational study on patterns of neuromuscular blockade reversal [^1174hT87]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Contrary to our initial hypothesis, deeper levels of neuromuscular blockade were not associated with larger reversal doses. The median neostigmine dosing remained clinically similar across different levels of NMB, as defined by the TOF counts. The median times to extubation following neostigmine administration were also similar for all TOF count categories.

On the other hand, there was significant variability in neuromuscular blocker and neostigmine dosing across different BMI categories. The total median dose of neuromuscular blocking agents increased with increasing BMI, while the median dose of neostigmine decreased with increasing BMI.

### Reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia: Sugammadex versus neostigmine [^114zWxgZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). High credibility.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cannot rapidly reverse profound neuromuscular block. Sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent, reverses the effects of rocuronium and vecuronium by encapsulation. This study assessed the efficacy of sugammadex compared with neostigmine in reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia.

- **Methods**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1–4, scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this phase III, multicenter, randomized, safety-assessor blinded study. Sevoflurane-anesthetized patients received vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.015 mg/kg as required. Patients were randomized to receive sugammadex 4 mg/kg or neostigmine 70 μg/kg with glycopyrrolate 14 μg/kg at 1–2 post-tetanic counts. The primary efficacy variable was time from start of study drug administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Safety assessments included physical examination, laboratory data, vital signs, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Eighty-three patients were included in the intent-to-treat population (sugammadex, n = 47; neostigmine, n = 36). Geometric mean time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 15-fold faster with sugammadex (4.5 minutes) compared with neostigmine (66.2 minutes; p < 0.0001) (median, 3.3 minutes with sugammadex versus 49.9 minutes with neostigmine). No serious drug-related adverse events occurred in either group.

- **Conclusions**: Recovery from profound vecuronium-induced block is significant.

### Bridion [^113R3emM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A comparative study of Bridion versus neostigmine as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium at 1 to 2 PTCs (deep blockade) was conducted. This multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, safety-assessor blinded study compared Bridion and neostigmine by enrolling 157 patients. The cohort consisted of 86 women and 71 men; 8% were ASA class 1, 71% class 2, and 21% class 3; 79% were Caucasian, with median weights of 81 kg and 84 kg, and median ages of 54 years and 56 years in the rocuronium and vecuronium groups, respectively.

Patients underwent elective surgical procedures under general anesthesia that required endotracheal intubation and maintenance of neuromuscular blockade. The surgical procedures were primarily abdominal (gynecological, colorectal, urological), orthopedic, reconstructive, or neurological. At 1 to 2 PTCs, after the last dose of rocuronium or vecuronium, 4 mg/kg of Bridion or 70 mcg/kg of neostigmine was administered in a randomized order as a single bolus injection. Although neostigmine was not expected to reverse neuromuscular blockade at a depth of 1 to 2 PTCs, the study assessed the time from the start of administration of Bridion or neostigmine to recovery of the TOF (T4/T1) ratio to 0.9. Generally, a T4/T1 ratio ≥ 0.9 correlates with recovery from neuromuscular blockade.

The return of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 in patients with 1 to 2 PTCs with Bridion 4 mg/kg had a wider range of recovery times, but the median time to recovery was comparable to the study of reversal at T2 (2.7 minutes, with 25th and 75th percentiles of 2.1).

### Diaphragmatic and intercostal electromyographic activity during neostigmine, sugammadex and neostigmine-sugammadex-enhanced recovery after neuromuscular blockade: A randomised controlled volunteer study [^111Ne9JP]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). High credibility.

Electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (EMGdi) during weaning from mechanical ventilation is increased after sugammadex compared with neostigmine.

- **Objective**: To determine the effect of neostigmine on EMGdi and surface EMG (sEMG) of the intercostal muscles during antagonism of rocuronium block with neostigmine, sugammadex, and neostigmine followed by sugammadex.

- **Design**: Randomised, controlled, double-blind study.

- **Setting**: Intensive care research unit.

- **Participants**: Eighteen male volunteers.

- **Interventions**: A transoesophageal EMGdi recorder was inserted into three groups of six anaesthetised study participants, and sEMG was recorded on their intercostal muscles. To reverse rocuronium, volunteers received 50 μg/kg neostigmine, 2 mg/kg sugammadex, or 50 μg/kg neostigmine followed 3 minutes later by 2 mg/kg sugammadex.

- **Main outcome measures**: We examined the EMGdi and sEMG at the intercostal muscles during recovery enhanced by neostigmine, sugammadex, or neostigmine-sugammadex as primary outcomes. Secondary objectives were the tidal volume, PaO2 recorded between the onset of spontaneous breathing and extubation of the trachea, and SpO2 during and after anaesthesia.

- **Results**: During weaning, the median peak EMGdi was 0.76 μV (95% confidence interval: 1.20 to 1.80) in the neostigmine group, 1.00 μV (1.23 to 1.82) in the sugammadex group, and 0.70 μV (0.91 to 1.21) in the neostigmine-sugammadex group (P < 0.0001 with EMGdi increased after sugammadex vs. neostigmine and neostigmine-sugammadex). The median peak intercostal sEMG for the neostigmine group was 0.39 μV (0.65 to 0.93).

### The effect of neostigmine on postoperative delirium after colon carcinoma surgery: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^113nTzcp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used to treat myasthenia gravis and intestinal paralysis after abdominal surgery. In general anesthesia, neostigmine is often utilized to antagonize the effects of nondepolarizing muscular relaxants. The positively charged nitrogen atom in the neostigmine molecule can electrostatically combine with the negatively charged catalytic site of cholinesterase. Additionally, the carbamate group in the molecule is covalently combined with the enzyme's hydrolysis site, inhibiting the enzyme's activity. Neostigmine can also directly excite the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor or increase acetylcholine release by inhibiting the potassium channel, promoting muscle fiber contraction. Thus, neostigmine can increase the level and duration of acetylcholine, enhancing the activity of the cholinergic system in our brain.

This study was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial intended to investigate the effect of neostigmine on postoperative delirium (POD) and clinical prognosis in patients aged 40–90 years undergoing colon carcinoma surgery.

### Half dose sugammadex combined with neostigmine is non-inferior to full dose sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium-induced deep neuromuscular blockade: a cost-saving strategy [^115EiHcP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we demonstrated that the combination of neostigmine 50 μg/kg and sugammadex 2 mg/kg is at worst 9% and 6% less effective than sugammadex 4 mg/kg by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, respectively, in terms of the proportion of patients who achieved full recovery from rocuronium-induced deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) within 5 minutes. Thus, the combination of neostigmine and half dose sugammadex is non-inferior to full dose sugammadex. Anesthesiologists might face the need to reverse deep NMB because of unanticipated short surgeries, inter-individual variability in the response to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, or as rescue for incomplete neostigmine reversal. Although cost price should not outweigh good clinical practice, our study has identified a safe cost-saving strategy for the use of sugammadex in these clinical scenarios.

### Therapeutic doses of neostigmine, depolarising neuromuscular blockade and muscle weakness in awake volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised volunteer study [^113zgfEp]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Neostigmine reverses non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade but may cause muscle weakness when administered after full recovery of neuromuscular function. We hypothesized that neostigmine in therapeutic doses impairs muscle strength and respiratory function in awake healthy volunteers. Twenty-one volunteers were randomized to receive two doses of either intravenous (i.v.) neostigmine 2.5 mg with glycopyrrolate 450 μg (neostigmine group, n = 14) or normal saline 0.9% (placebo group, n = 7). The first dose was administered immediately after obtaining baseline measurements, and the second dose was administered 15 minutes later. All 14 volunteers in the neostigmine group received the first dose, mean (SD) 35 (5.8) μg/kg, but only nine of these volunteers agreed to receive the second dose, 34 (3.5) μg/kg.

- **Primary outcome**: Hand grip strength.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Train-of-four ratio, single twitch height, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure.

The first dose of intravenous neostigmine with glycopyrrolate resulted in reduced grip strength compared with placebo, -20 (20)% vs. +4.3 (9.9)%, p = 0.0016; depolarising neuromuscular blockade with decreased single twitch height, -14 (11)% vs. -3.8 (5.6)%, p = 0.0077; a restrictive spirometry pattern with decreased predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, -15 (12)% vs. -0.47 (3.4)%, p = 0.0011; and predicted forced vital capacity, -20 (12)% vs. -0.59 (3.2)%, p < 0.0001 at 5 minutes after administration.

### Neostigmine [^112UyThJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection can lead to muscarinic symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, and bradycardia. This condition, known as cholinergic crisis, can be managed with additional atropine or glycopyrrolate. Careful monitoring of the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation can reduce the risk of iatrogenic overdose. In case of overdosage, artificial ventilation should be provided until spontaneous respiration is adequate, and cardiac function should be closely monitored.

Cholinergic crisis due to neostigmine methylsulfate injection is characterized by increasing muscle weakness and can involve respiratory muscles, potentially leading to death. This can be mistaken for myasthenic crisis, which also presents with extreme muscle weakness due to increased disease severity. Differentiating between these crises is crucial, as treatment strategies differ significantly. Increases in the dose of neostigmine or related medications during a cholinergic crisis or an unresponsive state can have severe consequences. Edrophonium chloride and clinical judgment can aid in distinguishing between the two crises.

- **Symptoms and management**: Myasthenic crisis requires intensified anticholinesterase therapy, whereas cholinergic crisis necessitates the prompt discontinuation of cholinergic medications.

### Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease [^117R6Uq3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia affecting older people. A therapeutic strategy aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease involves enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain by using cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first cholinesterase inhibitor to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, have been introduced with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and a lower risk of adverse effects. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries, including all member states of the European Union and the United States.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

- **Search methods**: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 2 March 2015 using the terms: rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR "SDZ ENA 713". ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries, and grey literature sources.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all unconfounded, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for 12 weeks.

### Rocuronium [^112V3gF5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In geriatric patients (n = 51) reversed with neostigmine, the median T4/T1 increased from 40% to 88% in 5 minutes.

In clinical trials with halothane, pediatric patients (n = 27) who received 0.5 mg/kg edrophonium experienced increases in the median T4/T1 from 37% at reversal to 93% after 2 minutes. Pediatric patients (n = 58) who received 1 mg/kg edrophonium had increases in the median T4/T1 from 72% at reversal to 100% after 2 minutes. Infants (n = 10) who were reversed with 0.03 mg/kg neostigmine recovered from 25% to 75% T1 within 4 minutes.

There were no reports of less-than-satisfactory clinical recovery of neuromuscular function.

The neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium bromide may be enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Hemodynamics**: There were no dose-related effects on the incidence of changes from baseline (30% or greater) in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) or heart rate associated with rocuronium bromide administration over the dose range of 0.12 to 1.2 mg/kg (4 x ED95) within 5 minutes after rocuronium bromide administration and prior to intubation. Increases or decreases in MAP were observed in 2% to 5% of geriatric and other adult patients, and in about 1% of pediatric patients. Heart rate changes (30% or greater) occurred in 0% to 2% of geriatric and other adult patients. Tachycardia (30% or greater) occurred in 12 of 127 pediatric patients. Most of the pediatric patients developing tachycardia were from a single study where the patients were anesthetized with halothane and did not receive atropine for induction.

### Reversal of profound rocuronium-induced blockade with sugammadex: A randomized comparison with neostigmine [^113FRzby]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Traditionally, reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents was achieved using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, but these are unable to adequately reverse profound blockade. Sugammadex is a novel reversal agent, reversing the effects of rocuronium by encapsulation. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of sugammadex versus neostigmine for the reversal of profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade.

- **Methods**: This phase III randomized study enrolled surgical patients aged 18 years or older with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-IV. Patients were randomized to receive sugammadex (4.0 mg/kg) or neostigmine (70 microg/kg) plus glycopyrrolate (14 microg/kg). Anesthetized patients received an intubating dose of rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg), with maintenance doses (0.15 mg/kg) as required. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed by acceleromyography. Sugammadex or neostigmine was administered at the reappearance of 1–2 posttetanic counts (profound neuromuscular blockade). The primary efficacy parameter was the time from sugammadex or neostigmine-glycopyrrolate administration to the return of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9.

- **Results**: In the intent-to-treat population (n = 37 in each group), the geometric mean time to recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 with sugammadex was 2.9 minutes versus 50.4 minutes with neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (P < 0.0001) (median, 2.7 min vs. 49.0 min). Most sugammadex patients (97%) recovered to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 within 5 minutes after administration. In contrast, most neostigmine patients (73%) recovered between 30 minutes.

### Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate administered after recovery from neuromuscular block increases upper airway collapsibility by decreasing genioglossus muscle activity in response to negative pharyngeal pressure [^111FPFmk]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, improves respiratory function. However, neostigmine may also impair muscle strength. We hypothesized that neostigmine administered after recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) ratio impairs upper airway integrity and genioglossus muscle function.

- **Methods**: We measured epiglottic and nasal mask pressures, genioglossus electromyogram, air flow, respiratory timing, and changes in lung volume in 10 healthy male volunteers before, during (TOF ratio: 0.5), and after recovery of the TOF ratio to unity. Measurements were also taken after administration of neostigmine 0.03 mg/kg IV (with glycopyrrolate 0.0075 mg/kg). Upper airway critical closing pressure (Pcrit) was calculated from flow-limited breaths during random pharyngeal negative pressure challenges.

- **Results**: Pcrit increased significantly after administration of neostigmine/glycopyrrolate compared with both TOF recovery (mean ± SD, by 27 ± 21%; P = 0.02) and baseline (by 38 ± 17%; P = 0.002). In parallel, phasic genioglossus activity evoked by negative pharyngeal pressure decreased by 37 ± 29% (P = 0.005) compared with recovery, almost reaching a level observed at a TOF ratio of 0.5. Lung volume, respiratory timing, tidal volume, and minute ventilation remained unchanged after neostigmine/glycopyrrolate injection.

- **Conclusion**: Neostigmine/glycopyrrolate, when administered after recovery from neuromuscular block, increases upper airway collapsibility and impairs genioglossus muscle activation in response to negative pharyngeal pressure.

### Impact of sugammadex versus neostigmine reversal on postoperative recovery time in patients with obstructive sleep apnea undergoing bariatric surgery: A double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^115BPX7x]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

We found no difference in OR discharge time with sugammadex compared to neostigmine for the reversal of NMB in morbidly obese patients with OSA undergoing bariatric surgical procedures.

Our study was designed to simulate usual clinical practice, increasing the generalizability of our results. Intraoperative use of muscle relaxants can be subjective and influenced by multiple factors, including surgeon requests, duration of surgery, and use of adjunct medications like remifentanil. Our patients were extubated as per usual clinical practice at our institution using well-established clinical criteria and qualitative TOFc measurement.

The US Food and Drug Administration–recommended dose for the use of neostigmine is 0.03 mg/kg to 0.07 mg/kg. In our study, we used an initial fixed dose of 2.5 mg of neostigmine to reverse NMB, which would result in a less-than-recommended dose being used in our patients. This is a limitation of our study; however, clinicians did have the option of giving a supplemental dose of neostigmine or sugammadex if they felt it was clinically indicated. We had a very low rate of redosing of the reversal agent, which implies that this did not affect our study results.

The lack of continuous quantitative neuromuscular monitoring and the ability to detect residual NMB at the time of extubation is a limitation of our study, as it could have influenced the behavior of the individual anesthesiologist with regards to administering additional boluses of NMBD. Some of our patients received remifentanil infusions or boluses during the surgery, possibly to minimize the amount of adjunctive medication used.

### Antagonism of low degrees of atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade: dose-effect relationship for neostigmine [^116w3q4y]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Low degrees of residual paralysis, defined as a train-of-four (TOF) ratio greater than 0.4, are relatively frequent, difficult to detect, and potentially harmful. The appropriate dose of anticholinesterase for this situation has not been determined. This is of clinical interest, as a high dose of neostigmine given at a shallow level of neuromuscular block may induce neuromuscular weakness. The study aimed to investigate the dose-effect relationship of neostigmine in antagonizing residual paralysis corresponding to TOF ratios of 0.4 and 0.6.

- **Methods**: Recovery after administration of 10, 20, or 30 microg/kg neostigmine, or placebo, at either a 0.4 or 0.6 TOF ratio, was assessed via acceleromyography in 120 patients undergoing intravenous anesthesia. The time to achieve 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios was measured, and the probability of successful reversal within 10 minutes of neostigmine administration was calculated. Additionally, the necessary dose of neostigmine to achieve the recovery targets within 5 or 10 minutes was determined.

- **Results**: When administered at a TOF ratio of either 0.4 or 0.6, the time to reach 0.9 and 1.0 TOF ratios was significantly shorter with any dose of neostigmine compared to placebo. The probability of successful reversal following 20 microg/kg neostigmine was 100% when the target TOF ratio was 0.9. For a TOF ratio of 1.0, the probability was 93% at a 0.6 TOF ratio but decreased to 67% at a 0.4 TOF ratio. A 30 microg/kg dose was expected to achieve a TOF ratio of 1.0 within approximately 5 minutes.

### A discrete event simulation model of clinical and operating room efficiency outcomes of sugammadex versus neostigmine for neuromuscular block reversal in Canada [^116tcZrb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). High credibility.

The study, set in a Canadian hospital, used a discrete event simulation model to assess clinical and operating room efficiency outcomes associated with neuromuscular blockade over a one-month period (21 working days). This simulation compared two reversal agents: sugammadex and neostigmine. No ethical committee approval was required due to reliance on secondary data.

- **Perspective**: The model focused on the operating room (OR) schedule and patient clinical outcomes when using either sugammadex or neostigmine for neuromuscular block reversal.

- **Treatment comparators**: Primary analysis centered on the reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex (2 mg/kg) was compared to neostigmine (50 μg/kg) combined with glycopyrrolate (10 μg/kg). Additionally, an exploratory analysis evaluated the reversal of deep neuromuscular block with a 4 mg/kg dose of sugammadex. Neuromuscular block was maintained with either rocuronium or vecuronium; however, in Canada, vecuronium is not typically used, yet sugammadex is indicated for the reversal of these blocks. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine are inadequate for reversing deep blockade, leading to the common practice of allowing the blockade to fade to moderate before the administration of neostigmine.

This scenario was modeled as an exploratory analysis since there was no corresponding clinical trial for sugammadex at the time. Some hypothetical values were applied to evaluate potential time savings with sugammadex, though clinical trials had not confirmed these findings, particularly for instances where the neostigmine arm involved deep block fading to moderate before reversal agent administration.

### Addition of neostigmine and atropine to conventional management of postdural puncture headache: A randomized controlled trial [^1159co9y]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) lacks a standard evidence-based treatment. A patient treated with neostigmine for severe PDPH prompted this study.

- **Methods**: This randomized, controlled, double-blind study compared neostigmine and atropine (n = 41) versus a saline placebo (n = 44) for treating PDPH in addition to conservative management of 85 patients with hydration and analgesics. The primary outcome was a visual analog scale score of ≤ 3 at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were the need for an epidural blood patch, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Patients received either neostigmine 20 μg/kg and atropine 10 μg/kg or an equal volume of saline.

- **Results**: Visual analog scale scores were significantly better after two doses of neostigmine/atropine. There were no between-group differences in neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting. Complications, including abdominal cramps, muscle twitches, and urinary bladder hyperactivity, occurred only in the neostigmine/atropine group (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Neostigmine/atropine was effective in treating PDPH after only two doses. Neostigmine can pass the choroid plexus but not the blood-brain barrier. The central effects of both drugs influence both cerebrospinal fluid secretion and cerebral vascular tone, which are the primary pathophysiological mechanisms involved in PDPH.

### The effect of neuromuscular blocking reversal agents on perioperative neurocognitive function after general anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117BReWq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Prior systematic reviews have identified that old age is a risk factor for perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Interestingly, our results indicate that neostigmine primarily enhances cognitive function in older patients rather than in younger ones (Supplementary Fig. S7). This phenomenon may be attributed to the diminished functional reserve of the elderly brain, which is affected by various factors, thereby demonstrating greater therapeutic potential. However, no study has evaluated the influence of sugammadex on PND in elderly patients. Therefore, there is a need to design rigorous randomized trials in the future to determine the effect of sugammadex on perioperative neurocognitive function in these patients.

Clinical guidelines recommend the use of neuromuscular transmission monitoring to ensure reversal of TOF ≥ 0.9 before extubation and to guide the use of reversal agents. The implementation of this monitoring is crucial, as anticholinergics themselves can induce muscle weakness when reversing patients in whom spontaneous recovery has started. Our results indicate that sugammadex could accelerate the recovery speed of TOF. This result further suggests that sugammadex possesses a stronger ability than neostigmine to reverse residual muscle blockade.

### Sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockade in neonates and infants less than 2 years old: Results from a Phase IV randomized clinical trial [^112jBkFj]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

With regard to efficacy, TTNMR was significantly faster in participants receiving 2 mg/kg sugammadex compared with neostigmine in the setting of moderate NMB. The median TTNMR for 2 mg/kg sugammadex in Part B was 1.4 min compared with 4.4 min for neostigmine, with a hazard ratio of 2.4. Based on Kaplan–Meier estimates, 79.3% of participants dosed with 2 mg/kg sugammadex reached neuromuscular recovery within 4 min compared with 41.9% of participants in the neostigmine group.

While no agent exists for comparative evaluation of 4 mg/kg sugammadex reversal of deep neuromuscular block, data pooled across Parts A and B showed that the median TTNMR for this dose of 1.1 min was comparable with the median TTNMR of 1.2 min observed for the 2 mg/kg moderate NMB group, thereby indicating highly efficient sugammadex-mediated recovery from deep blockade. These findings are generally consistent with the efficacy of sugammadex for neuromuscular recovery established in the pediatric population from 2 to less than 17 years old in previous trials, as well as trials in adults.

The possibility of reparalysis after initial sugammadex dosing in infants has been raised based on findings in a retrospective chart review report and individual case studies, but likely reflects rocuronium overdose, poor monitoring of NMB, and/or incorrect or inadequate dosing for depth NMB. Reparalysis was not observed in the study. These findings suggest that when administered as per the dosing in our study, the risk of reparalysis is likely to be small.

### The comparative efficacy and safety of sugammadex and neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults. A Cochrane systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^112VQkVW]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sugammadex and neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade in adults. Our outcomes were: recovery time from second twitch to train-of-four ratio greater than 0.9; recovery time from post-tetanic count 1–5 to train-of-four ratio greater than 0.9; and risk of composite adverse and serious adverse events. We searched for randomised clinical trials irrespective of publication status and date, blinding status, outcomes reported, or language. We included 41 studies with 4206 participants.

- **Time to reversal from second twitch**: Time to reversal of neuromuscular blockade from second twitch to a train-of-four ratio greater than 0.9 was 2.0 min with sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 12.9 min with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg, with a mean difference (MD) (95% CI) of 10.2 (8.5–12.0) [I² = 84%, 10 studies, n = 835, Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE): moderate quality].

- **Time to reversal from post-tetanic count**: Time to reversal of neuromuscular blockade from a post-tetanic count of 1–5 to a train-of-four ratio greater than 0.9 was 2.9 min with sugammadex 4 mg/kg and 48.8 min with neostigmine 0.07 mg/kg, with a MD (95% CI) of 45.8 (39.4–52.2) [I² = 0%, 2 studies, n = 114, GRADE: low quality].

- **Composite adverse events**: There were significantly fewer composite adverse events in the sugammadex group compared with neostigmine, with a risk ratio (95% CI) of 0.60 (0.49–0.74) [I² = 40%, 28 studies, n = 2298, number needed to treat (NNT): 8, GRADE: moderate quality].

	- Specifically, the risk of bradycardia was reduced (RR (95% CI) 0.16 (0.07–0.34), n = 1218, NNT: 14, GRADE: moderate quality).

	- Postoperative nausea and vomiting risk was also lower (RR (95% CI) 0.52 (0.28–0.97), n = 389, NNT: 16, GRADE: low quality).

### Optimal dose of neostigmine antagonizing cisatracurium-induced shallow neuromuscular block in elderly patients: A randomized control study [^114ihYxr]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

From January 2022 to November 2022, 240 ASA I-III patients aged 60 to 85 who were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled. Of these, 40 patients were excluded due to contraindications (n = 18), allergies (n = 12), or declined to participate (n = 10). A total of 200 patients completed randomization and participated in the study. Four patients were excluded due to protocol violation — three in the NS group and one in the 20 µg/kg group B. The number of patients included in the final statistical analysis was 196.

- **Comparison of general data and perioperative data between the groups**: Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics and perioperative data of patients. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or BMI between the four groups (P > 0.05), indicating that baseline characteristics were generally consistent between groups. As for the perioperative data, there was no significant difference in the amount of muscle relaxant cisatracurium, surgery duration, or anesthesia duration among the four groups (P > 0.05). Intergroup comparison suggests that patients from the 40 µg/kg group had more blood loss than those from the control group (P < 0.05). The type of surgery is comparable among the groups.

- **Comparison of results of postoperative muscle relaxation monitoring**: As listed in Table 2, the time to reach a TOF value of 0.9 after the administration of neostigmine, and the TOF value at 10 minutes after administration of neostigmine are analyzed.

### Reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia: Sugammadex versus neostigmine [^111GcfdV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cannot rapidly reverse profound neuromuscular block. Sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding agent, reverses the effects of rocuronium and vecuronium by encapsulation. This study assessed the efficacy of sugammadex compared with neostigmine in reversal of profound vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block under sevoflurane anesthesia.

- **Methods**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years, classified by the American Society of Anesthesiologists as class 1–4, and scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this phase III, multicenter, randomized, safety-assessor blinded study. Sevoflurane-anesthetized patients received vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg for intubation, with maintenance doses of 0.015 mg/kg as required. Patients were randomized to receive sugammadex 4 mg/kg or neostigmine 70 μg/kg with glycopyrrolate 14 μg/kg at 1–2 post-tetanic counts. The primary efficacy variable was time from start of study drug administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Safety assessments included physical examination, laboratory data, vital signs, and adverse events.

- **Results**: Eighty-three patients were included in the intent-to-treat population (sugammadex, n = 47; neostigmine, n = 36). Geometric mean time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 was 15-fold faster with sugammadex (4.5 minutes) compared with neostigmine (66.2 minutes; p < 0.0001) (median, 3.3 minutes with sugammadex versus 49.9 minutes with neostigmine). No serious drug-related adverse events occurred in either group.

### Comparison of incidence of anaphylaxis between sugammadex and neostigmine: a retrospective multicentre observational study [^1117ZMVD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Although cases of anaphylaxis caused by sugammadex have been reported, its incidence remains uncertain. Conversely, no studies have evaluated the incidence of anaphylaxis to neostigmine.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective multicentre observational study of patients who underwent surgery under general anaesthesia between 2012 and 2016. It aimed to compare the incidence of anaphylaxis with sugammadex to that of neostigmine at four tertiary hospitals in Japan. To ensure quality diagnosis, only cases with a clinical history suggestive of anaphylaxis, along with positive results from in vitro or in vivo testing, were assessed.

- **Results**: From a total of 49,532 patients who received general anaesthesia included in this study, 18 cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Of these, six were attributable to sugammadex and none to neostigmine. There were no fatalities attributable to anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphylaxis caused by all drugs or by sugammadex was calculated as 0.036% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.022–0.057%) and 0.02% (of the number of sugammadex cases) (95% CI: 0.007–0.044%), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that neostigmine might be safer than sugammadex when assessing only the incidence of anaphylaxis. There is room for reconsideration of the choice of reversal agent for neuromuscular blocking agents by all anaesthetists.

### A discrete event simulation model of clinical and operating room efficiency outcomes of sugammadex versus neostigmine for neuromuscular block reversal in Canada [^11272asY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016).

In the exploratory analyses, it is assumed that patients are maintained at a deep level of neuromuscular block through the end of the procedure and reversed with neostigmine or a 4 mg/kg dose of sugammadex. As described in the Methods section, because the amount of time saved with sugammadex versus neostigmine in clinical practice for these patients is unknown, hypothetical time savings of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes per procedure are explored. When the amount of OR time saved is fixed, the percentage of patients verified to have full neuromuscular recovery in the OR no longer influences sugammadex's impact upon OR time within the analysis. For illustrative purposes, it was therefore elected to conduct the exploratory analysis for the scenario where 0% of patients are verified to have full neuromuscular recovery in the OR, as results would be very similar for the other scenarios, with the exception of the incidence of clinical outcomes of residual blockade.

- **Exploratory analyses**: Comparison of sugammadex and neostigmine on OR efficiency and clinical outcomes in an OR over 1 month when deep block is maintained to the end of all procedures [0% of patients verified to have full neuromuscular recovery (TOF ratio ≥ 0.9) prior to extubation].

In the deep block analysis, as the number of minutes of OR time saved per procedure with sugammadex increases, the number of procedures cancelled due to a lack of OR time decreases, along with paid hours of staff ove.

### Is combining an anticholinergic with a cholinesterase inhibitor a good strategy for high-level CNS cholinesterase inhibition [^1171scYw]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The currently approved cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) produce gastrointestinal toxicity, which limits dosing to levels that result in only about 25% to 35% CNS cholinesterase inhibition in Alzheimer's disease patients undergoing treatment. This is below the minimum therapeutic target of approximately 40% to 50% CNS inhibition necessary to treat cognitive impairment.

A recent strategy for achieving high-level CNS acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (50% or higher) involves the co-administration of a muscarinic anticholinergic with the AChE inhibitor. This approach aims to block the dose-limiting cholinergic overstimulation of the gastrointestinal system, allowing for more robust AChE inhibition in the CNS and improving the efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease. However, most common muscarinic anticholinergics, such as solifenacin, readily penetrate the CNS and are directly associated with the long-term exacerbation of the underlying neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease and increased brain atrophy.

The co-administration of an anticholinergic with an AChE inhibitor is a rational strategy for enhancing efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of dementia, but there are significant long-term risks that have yet to be fully considered. For long-term safety in preventing the acceleration of underlying disease processes in Alzheimer's disease, anticholinergics used to increase the tolerability of AChE inhibitors should not penetrate, or have very limited penetration, of the blood-brain barrier. Neurotrophic-mediated mechanisms by which cholinergic drugs may affect neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease require further exploration.

### Low-dose neostigmine to antagonise shallow atracurium neuromuscular block during inhalational anaesthesia: A randomised controlled trial [^113wx2pK]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2013). High credibility.

Even shallow residual neuromuscular block [i.e. train-of-four (TOF) ratio around 0.6] is harmful. It can be effectively antagonised by small doses of neostigmine, but reports are limited to intravenous anaesthesia. Inhalational anaesthesia may enhance neuromuscular block and delay recovery. It is not known whether low doses of neostigmine are still effective in the context of inhalational anaesthesia.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of low doses of neostigmine to antagonise shallow atracurium block during desflurane anaesthesia.

- **Design**: Randomised controlled trial, four groups.

- **Setting**: Single centre, University Hospital, May 2010 to March 2011.

- **Participants**: Forty-eight American Society of Anesthesiologists I-III patients undergoing desflurane anaesthesia.

- **Intervention**: At TOF ratio 0.6, patients were randomised to one of four treatments (physiological saline, 10, 20, or 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, n = 12 for each).

- **Main outcome measure**: Primary efficacy endpoint: time interval between study drug injection and a TOF ratio more than 0.9 using acceleromyography. Secondary efficacy endpoint: neuromuscular recovery after 5 and 10 min.

- **Results**: After physiological saline, the time interval [median (range)] between a TOF ratio of 0.6 and 0.9 was 14 (7 to 18) min. After 10, 20, and 30 µg kg(-1) neostigmine, it was reduced to 5 (3 to 8) min, 5 (3 to 10) and 4 (2 to 6) min, respectively (P < 0.001 compared to physiological saline). At 5 min after physiological saline, the TOF ratio [mean (SD)] was 0.73 (0.05) and 0.91 (0.06), 0.90 (0.10), 0.96 (0.02) after neostigmine injection.

### Neuromuscular and clinical recovery in thoracic surgical patients reversed with neostigmine or sugammadex [^113zahcV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing thoracoscopic procedures may be at high risk for incomplete neuromuscular recovery and associated complications. This clinical investigation aimed to assess the incidence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade in adult thoracic surgical patients administered neostigmine or sugammadex when optimal dosing and reversal strategies for these agents were used. The effect of the choice of reversal agent on hypoxemic events and signs and symptoms of muscle weakness was also determined. Additionally, operative conditions in each group were graded by surgeons performing the procedures.

- **Methods**: Two hundred patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgical procedures were enrolled in this nonrandomized controlled trial. One hundred consecutive patients maintained at moderate levels of neuromuscular blockade were reversed with neostigmine (neostigmine group), followed by 100 consecutive patients given sugammadex to antagonize deeper levels of neuromuscular blockade (sugammadex group). Anesthetic and neuromuscular management were standardized. Surgeons rated operative conditions at the conclusion of the procedure on a 4-point scale (grade 1 = excellent to grade 4 = poor). Train-of-four ratios were measured immediately before extubation and at PACU admission (primary outcomes). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for adverse respiratory events and 11 signs and 16 symptoms of muscle weakness.

- **Results**: The two groups were similar in intraoperative management characteristics. The percentage of patients with residual neuromuscular blockade, defined…

### Do cholinergic therapies have disease-modifying effects in Alzheimer's disease [^1113HA1N]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2006). Low credibility.

The most widely studied and used therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) focus on improving cholinergic function in the central nervous system. The acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors (ChEIs) tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are all approved, with the latter three being widely used for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate AD. Recent research has found that these drugs may act through various mechanisms, including inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase, regulation of nicotinic receptors, reduction of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and A beta production, and regulation of tau phosphorylation, which may influence disease progression.

- **Emerging evidence**: There is also emerging evidence from clinical trials that ChEIs may delay cognitive and functional progression. Other cholinergic drugs, such as muscarinic agonists, have been explored; although they are not approved, robust preclinical evidence suggests a beneficial, potentially disease-modifying effect. This review summarizes evidence indicating that these drugs may do more than improve symptoms; they may delay the biological progression of the disease.
