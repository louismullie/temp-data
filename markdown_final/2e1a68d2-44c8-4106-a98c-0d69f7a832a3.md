## Question

Why do a 72hr fast

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why someone would do a 72-hour fast and what the evidence-based reasons are for choosing that duration versus shorter fasts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnostic context, especially the 72-hour fast as the gold standard for insulinoma. Then, I should verify the metabolic physiology that uniquely emerges around 48–72 hours, including ketone kinetics and growth hormone. Next, I will examine the evidence for therapeutic or wellness goals that might justify 72 hours, and contrast that with shorter intermittent fasting regimens. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer that distinguishes diagnostic from therapeutic fasting and highlights when a 72-hour fast is warranted versus when shorter alternatives suffice [^112fUJEN] [^114ME4nv].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic rationale, because that is the clearest, guideline-supported reason for a 72-hour fast. In suspected insulinoma, a supervised 72-hour fast is the gold standard to document Whipple's triad and confirm endogenous hyperinsulinism by measuring insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin during hypoglycemia; NCCN explicitly recommends this approach and provides diagnostic thresholds, which anchors the 72-hour duration in evidence-based oncology-endocrine practice [^112fUJEN]. Wait, let me verify whether we can shorten the fast reliably; multiple series show that while many insulinomas reveal themselves earlier, a meaningful minority require the full 72 hours, and anthropometrics do not predict duration, so truncating risks false negatives unless strict biochemical stopping rules are used [^1133nVvA]. I should also confirm the role of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB); serial BHB rises above about 2.7 mmol/L indicate adequate insulin suppression and can safely end a negative fast early without missing insulinoma, a strategy that reduces hospitalization time and cost while maintaining diagnostic yield [^113BqTXA] [^1173M66s].

> Now, I will examine the metabolic physiology that justifies the 72-hour window beyond simple caloric deprivation. Initially, I thought the "metabolic switch" to ketosis begins around 12–16 hours, but wait, let me verify the depth of ketogenesis; while measurable ketones appear after hepatic glycogen depletion, the trajectory of BHB typically accelerates after 24–36 hours and continues to rise toward a plateau by 48–72 hours, reflecting a more complete adaptation to fatty acid oxidation and ketone utilization, which is not fully captured by shorter fasts [^1173M66s] [^114u2qGi]. Hold on, I should also check hormonal shifts; prolonged fasting induces a robust increase in growth hormone that peaks around 24 hours and remains elevated, contributing to protein sparing and lipolysis, a pattern that is less pronounced with intermittent fasting of 16–24 hours [^112nda5i]. Let me consider circadian effects too; a 72-hour fast advances melatonin phase and alters central clock outputs, suggesting unique chronobiologic modulation that shorter fasts may not reproduce, although this evidence is limited and observational in women [^116RUVpZ].

> Next, I should review whether there are therapeutic or wellness indications where a 72-hour fast offers advantages over shorter regimens. I need to ensure I am not overextending claims; most human data on intermittent fasting use 12–48 hour protocols and show weight and cardiometabolic improvements comparable to continuous calorie restriction, without clear superiority of longer fasts for clinical endpoints [^115r48c8] [^114zjZBi]. But wait, what if the goal is deeper autophagy or ketone signaling; preclinical and translational work suggests that prolonged fasting can activate autophagy and induce ketone-mediated signaling, which some protocols deliberately target for hypothesized regenerative effects, though high-quality human outcome data are sparse and this remains investigational rather than standard care [^116g5WiV] [^114Y5pe2]. I should double-check that no major guideline endorses routine 72-hour fasting for chronic disease treatment; indeed, diabetes guidelines remain cautious or recommend against intermittent fasting in type 2 diabetes due to hypoglycemia risk, underscoring that prolonged fasting requires individualized risk assessment and medical supervision if undertaken therapeutically [^115hcaHP] [^113sDPfF].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness versus shorter intermittent fasting, because that often drives the clinical decision. Network meta-analyses and umbrella reviews indicate that alternate-day fasting, 5:2, and time-restricted eating achieve modest weight loss and lipid improvements similar to continuous calorie restriction, with no consistent superiority of longer fasts and with adherence challenges that worsen with more extreme regimens [^114qhyPD] [^115r48c8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that 72-hour fasting would outperform these strategies; I should correct that and emphasize that current evidence does not show clinically meaningful superiority of 72-hour fasts for weight or cardiometabolic outcomes compared with shorter intermittent fasting or matched caloric restriction, and the risk of dropout rises with stricter protocols, limiting feasibility [^116sfPTz] [^113vWjHj].

> I will now examine safety, contraindications, and monitoring, because a 72-hour fast is physiologically stressful and not appropriate for everyone. I need to ensure I flag high-risk groups; people with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes have increased hypoglycemia risk during fasting, and guidelines suggest against intermittent fasting in T2DM or require structured medical supervision and medication adjustments if attempted, which would be even more critical for a 72-hour fast [^115hcaHP] [^113sDPfF]. Hold on, I should verify other risks; prolonged fasting can precipitate gout flares, orthostatic symptoms, arrhythmias, and refeeding risk if nutrition is abruptly reintroduced, so any extended fast warrants screening for these vulnerabilities and a planned, gradual refeeding strategy to mitigate refeeding syndrome, especially in those with low baseline reserves or electrolyte abnormalities [^113gub4K] [^112aKrUn]. Let me reconsider the diagnostic context; even in supervised 72-hour fasts for insulinoma, protocols require frequent glucose and ketone monitoring with clear stopping rules, reinforcing that safety monitoring is non-negotiable for this duration [^112fUJEN] [^113BqTXA].

> Putting this together, I should clearly distinguish when a 72-hour fast is indicated versus when shorter alternatives are preferable. For suspected insulinoma, a supervised 72-hour fast remains the diagnostic gold standard because it maximizes sensitivity for uncovering autonomous hyperinsulinism and allows definitive biochemical confirmation; early termination using BHB thresholds can safely shorten negative fasts without compromising detection, which is a practical, evidence-based refinement [^112fUJEN] [^113BqTXA]. For therapeutic or wellness goals, routine 72-hour fasting is not currently supported by robust human outcome data over shorter intermittent fasting or calorie restriction, and the added burden and risks may outweigh marginal theoretical benefits; therefore, if the aim is weight loss or cardiometabolic risk improvement, shorter, sustainable intermittent fasting or caloric restriction is generally more appropriate and better supported by guidelines and trials [^115r48c8] [^114zjZBi] [^115hcaHP]. But wait, what if a carefully selected, medically supervised individual seeks deeper ketosis or autophagy for investigational reasons; in that narrow context, a 72-hour fast may be reasonable, provided there is explicit informed consent, close monitoring, and a plan for safe refeeding, recognizing the evidence gap and potential harms [^116g5WiV] [^112aKrUn].

---

A 72-hour fast is used to **diagnose insulinoma** [^112fUJEN] by documenting Whipple's triad and confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism when glucose is < 55 mg/dL, with insulin > 3 mIU/mL, C-peptide ≥ 0.6 ng/mL, and proinsulin ≥ 5 pmol/L [^112fUJEN]. It is the **gold standard** test because it maximizes diagnostic yield for insulinoma while helping exclude other causes of hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN]. The test is stopped at 72 hours or earlier if hypoglycemia with symptoms occurs; if no hypoglycemia occurs, insulinoma is unlikely [^1173M66s]. Beta-hydroxybutyrate levels can help identify negative fasts earlier, reducing duration without compromising accuracy [^113BqTXA] [^1173M66s].

---

## Clinical indications for a 72-hour fast

The primary clinical indication for a 72-hour fast is the **diagnosis of insulinoma**, a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that causes autonomous insulin secretion and hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN]. Insulinomas are typically benign, solitary, and intrapancreatic, and surgical resection is curative in most cases [^112NEM5N].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biochemical markers

During a 72-hour fast, blood samples are drawn every 6 hours to measure glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin. The diagnostic criteria for insulinoma include:

- **Hypoglycemia**: Plasma glucose < 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) with symptoms [^112fUJEN].
- **Hyperinsulinemia**: Insulin > 3 mIU/mL (usually > 6 mIU/mL) during hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN].
- **C-peptide**: ≥ 0.6 ng/mL during hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN].
- **Proinsulin**: ≥ 5 pmol/L during hypoglycemia [^112fUJEN].

These criteria help **differentiate insulinoma** from other causes of hypoglycemia, such as exogenous insulin administration, sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia, and non-insulin-mediated hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical protocol and safety considerations

The 72-hour fast is typically conducted in a hospital setting under medical supervision. The protocol includes:

- **Supervision**: Continuous medical supervision throughout the fast [^112NEM5N].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent monitoring of blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels [^notfound].
- **Termination**: The fast is terminated if symptomatic hypoglycemia occurs or if the patient completes the full 72 hours without hypoglycemia [^1133nVvA].
- **Safety**: The test is generally safe, but patients may experience hypoglycemic symptoms, fatigue, and weakness. Rare complications include seizures and arrhythmias [^113gub4K].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

While the 72-hour fast is the gold standard, alternative diagnostic methods include:

- **Imaging**: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for tumor localization [^notfound].
- **Selective arterial calcium stimulation test**: Useful when imaging fails to localize the tumor [^notfound].
- **Glucose tolerance test**: Less specific and rarely used for insulinoma diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and implications

A positive 72-hour fast confirms the diagnosis of insulinoma, enabling surgical resection — the definitive treatment with high cure rates [^112NEM5N]. A negative fast (no hypoglycemia) **effectively excludes insulinoma**, prompting evaluation for other causes of hypoglycemia [^1173M66s].

---

## Recent advancements and modifications

Recent studies have explored ways to shorten the duration of the fast without compromising diagnostic accuracy. For example, measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels can help identify negative fasts earlier, reducing the duration of fasting and hospital stay [^113BqTXA] [^1173M66s].

---

A 72-hour fast is a medically supervised diagnostic test primarily used to **diagnose insulinoma** by documenting Whipple's triad and confirming endogenous hyperinsulinism. It remains the gold standard due to its high diagnostic accuracy, though recent advancements aim to shorten the duration without compromising accuracy [^112fUJEN] [^113BqTXA].

### Impact of the addition of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the 72-hour fast protocol on hospitalization duration: a quality improvement report [^113BqTXA]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The 72-hour fast is the "gold standard" test for detecting insulinoma but imposes significant burdens on patients and expends hospital resources. Balancing diagnostic accuracy with patient comfort and cost remains challenging. We aimed to leverage the metabolic indicator beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), indicative of insulin suppression, to curtail inpatient fasting time without missing insulinoma cases.

Methods

Our institution implemented an inpatient 72-hour fast protocol in 2018, and updated the protocol in 2020 to include a BHB > 2.7 mmol/L stopping criterion. In this quality improvement and patient safety project, we retrospectively reviewed all patients who completed a 72-hour fast at our institution by the original (January 2018 to June 2020) and updated (June 2020 to December 2022) protocols.

Results

Sixty-four patients (78% female, mean age 48 ± 17 years) underwent fasting: 34 patients by the original protocol and 30 patients by the revised protocol. The original protocol had an average fast duration of 57.6 hours (median 72 hours, IQR [49,72]). After the update, 50% (N = 15) ended for BHB > 2.7 mmol/L, with an average fast duration of 49.7 hours (median 53 hours, IQR [39.1, 71.8], P = 0.03). This reduced cumulative inpatient fasting by 376.5 hours and reduced medical costs. All insulinoma cases (N = 7) developed hypoglycemia within 43 hours with BHB ≤ 1.2 mmol/L; no cases were missed.

Conclusion

Adding a BHB > 2.7 mmol/L stopping criterion reduced inpatient hospitalization time, medical costs, and patient burden without compromising insulinoma detection. This evidence-based intervention improves patient adherence and more effectively uses hospital resources.

### Alternate-day fasting gets a safe bill of health [^112YYRPX]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Various forms of fasting improve health and longevity in preclinical models. However, safety, outcomes, and the molecular changes underpinning human fasting are unclear. Stekovic et al. (2019) report improved markers of health for up to 6 months and associated metabolic changes among healthy adults who followed alternate-day fasting.

### Fasting, circadian rhythms, and time-restricted feeding in healthy lifespan [^116K5LkZ]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Most animals alternate periods of feeding with periods of fasting often coinciding with sleep. Upon > 24 hr of fasting, humans, rodents, and other mammals enter alternative metabolic phases, which rely less on glucose and more on ketone body-like carbon sources. Both intermittent and periodic fasting result in benefits ranging from the prevention to the enhanced treatment of diseases. Similarly, time-restricted feeding (TRF), in which food consumption is restricted to certain hours of the day, allows the daily fasting period to last > 12 hr, thus imparting pleiotropic benefits. Understanding the mechanistic link between nutrients and the fasting benefits is leading to the identification of fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) that achieve changes similar to those caused by fasting. Given the pleiotropic and sustained benefits of TRF and FMDs, both basic science and translational research are warranted to develop fasting-associated interventions into feasible, effective, and inexpensive treatments with the potential to improve healthspan.

### Intermittent fasting and health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114zjZBi]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benefits of Intermittent fasting (IF) on health-related outcomes have been found in a range of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Our umbrella review aimed to systematically analyze and synthesize the available causal evidence on IF and its impact on specific health-related outcomes while evaluating its evidence quality.

Methods

We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases (from inception up to 8 January 2024) to identify related systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the association between IF and human health outcomes. We recalculated the effect sizes for each meta-analysis as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed for populations based on three specific status: diabetes, overweight or obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The quality of systematic reviews was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023382004).

Findings

A total of 351 associations from 23 meta-analyses with 34 health outcomes were included in the study. A wide range of outcomes were investigated, including anthropometric measures (n = 155), lipid profiles (n = 83), glycemic profiles (n = 57), circulatory system index (n = 41), appetite (n = 9), and others (n = 6). Twenty-one (91%) meta-analyses with 346 associations were rated as high confidence according to the AMSTAR criteria. The summary effects estimates were significant at p < 0.05 in 103 associations, of which 10 (10%) were supported by high certainty of evidence according to GRADE. Specifically, compared with non-intervention diet in adults with overweight or obesity, IF reduced waist circumference (WC) (MD = -1.02 cm; 95% CI: -1.99 to -0.06; p = 0.038), fat mass (MD = -0.72 kg; 95% CI: -1.32 to -0.12; p = 0.019), fasting insulin (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.02; p = 0.030), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (SMD = -0.20; 95% CI: -0.38 to -0.02; p = 0.027), total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.10; p = 0.003), and triacylglycerols (TG) (SMD = -0.23; 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.06; p = 0.007), but increased fat free mass (FFM) (MD = 0.98 kg; 95% CI: 0.18–1.78; p = 0.016). Of note, compared with the non-intervention diet, modified alternate-day fasting (MADF) reduced fat mass (MD = -0.70 kg; 95% CI: -1.38 to -0.02; p = 0.044). In people with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes, IF increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels compared to continuous energy restriction (CER) (MD = 0.03 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.01–0.05; p = 0.010). However, IF was less effective at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) than a CER diet in adults with overweight or obesity (SMD = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.05–0.36; p = 0.008).

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that IF may have beneficial effects on a range of health outcomes for adults with overweight or obesity, compared to CER or non-intervention diet. Specifically, IF may decreased WC, fat mass, LDL-C, TG, TC, fasting insulin, and SBP, while increasing HDL-C and FFM. Notably, it is worth noting that the SBP lowering effect of IF appears to be weaker than that of CER.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116Gp6QS]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — intermittent fasting recommendation and evidence: In adults with T2DM, the harms of intermittent fasting (IF) slightly outweighed the benefit of a 1.89 kg weight loss when compared with a standard diet; IF conferred no additional reduction in HbA1c and was not associated with other positive effects on lipid profile, waist circumference, fasting glucose, or blood pressure compared with a standard diet, leading to the statement, "we suggest against intermittent fasting". The Work Group also notes there were no studies comparing the glycemic profile in patients who restrict macronutrients but do not fast versus those who limit macronutrient intake through fasting.

### Flipping the metabolic switch: understanding and applying the health benefits of fasting [^114u2qGi]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Intermittent fasting (IF) is a term used to describe a variety of eating patterns in which no or few calories are consumed for time periods that can range from 12 hours to several days, on a recurring basis. This review is focused on the physiological responses of major organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system, to the onset of the metabolic switch: the point of negative energy balance at which liver glycogen stores are depleted and fatty acids are mobilized (typically beyond 12 hours after cessation of food intake).

Results and Conclusions

Emerging findings suggest that the metabolic switch from glucose to fatty acid-derived ketones represents an evolutionarily conserved trigger point that shifts metabolism from lipid/cholesterol synthesis and fat storage to mobilization of fat through fatty acid oxidation and fatty acid-derived ketones, which serve to preserve muscle mass and function. Thus, IF regimens that induce the metabolic switch have the potential to improve body composition in overweight individuals. Moreover, IF regimens also induce the coordinated activation of signaling pathways that optimize physiological function, enhance performance, and slow aging and disease processes. Future randomized controlled IF trials should use biomarkers of the metabolic switch (e.g., plasma ketone levels) as a measure of compliance and of the magnitude of negative energy balance during the fasting period.

### Intermittent fasting for the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112DYvni]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Lifestyle changes are at the forefront of preventing the disease. This includes advice such as increasing physical activity and having a healthy balanced diet to reduce risk factors. Intermittent fasting (IF) is a popular dietary plan involving restricting caloric intake to certain days in the week such as alternate day fasting and periodic fasting, and restricting intake to a number of hours in a given day, otherwise known as time-restricted feeding. IF is being researched for its benefits and many randomised controlled trials have looked at its benefits in preventing CVD.

Objectives

To determine the role of IF in preventing and reducing the risk of CVD in people with or without prior documented CVD.

Search Methods

We conducted our search on 12 December 2019; we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched three trials registers and searched the reference lists of included papers. Systematic reviews were also viewed for additional studies. There was no language restriction applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing IF to ad libitum feeding (eating at any time with no specific caloric restriction) or continuous energy restriction (CER). Participants had to be over the age of 18 and included those with and without cardiometabolic risk factors. Intermittent fasting was categorised into alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting and time-restricted feeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extraction. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Secondary outcomes include the absolute change in body weight, and glucose. Furthermore, side effects such as headaches and changes to the quality of life were also noted. For continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Our search yielded 39,165 records after the removal of duplicates. From this, 26 studies met our criteria, and 18 were included in the pooled analysis. The 18 studies included 1125 participants and observed outcomes ranging from four weeks to six months. No studies included data on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure at any point during follow-up. Of quantitatively analysed data, seven studies compared IF with ab libitum feeding, eight studies compared IF with CER, and three studies compared IF with both ad libitum feeding and CER. Outcomes were reported at short term (≤ 3 months) and medium term (> 3 months to 12 months) follow-up. Body weight was reduced with IF compared to ad libitum feeding in the short term (MD -2.88 kg, 95% CI -3.96 to -1.80; 224 participants; 7 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of IF when compared to CER in the short term (MD -0.88 kg, 95% CI -1.76 to 0.00; 719 participants; 10 studies; very low-certainty evidence) and there may be no effect in the medium term (MD -0.56 kg, 95% CI -1.68 to 0.56; 279 participants; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of IF on glucose when compared to ad libitum feeding in the short term (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.19; 95 participants; 3 studies; very-low-certainty of evidence) and when compared to CER in the short term: MD -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.12; 582 participants; 9 studies; very low-certainty; medium term: MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.11; 279 participants; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence). The changes in body weight and glucose were not deemed to be clinically significant. Four studies reported data on side effects, with some participants complaining of mild headaches. One study reported on the quality of life using the RAND SF-36 score. There was a modest increase in the physical component summary score.

Authors' Conclusions

Intermittent fasting was seen to be superior to ad libitum feeding in reducing weight. However, this was not clinically significant. There was no significant clinical difference between IF and CER in improving cardiometabolic risk factors to reduce the risk of CVD. Further research is needed to understand the safety and risk-benefit analysis of IF in specific patient groups (e.g. patients with diabetes or eating disorders) as well as the effect on longer-term outcomes such as all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction.

### Clinical application of intermittent fasting for weight loss: progress and future directions [^111eiqvj]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Intermittent fasting diets have become very popular in the past few years, as they can produce clinically significant weight loss. These diets can be defined, in the simplest of terms, as periods of fasting alternating with periods of eating. The most studied forms of intermittent fasting include: alternate day fasting (0–500kcal per 'fast day' alternating with ad libitum intake on 'feast days'); the 5:2 diet (two fast days and five feast days per week) and time-restricted eating (only eating within a prescribed window of time each day). Despite the recent surge in the popularity of fasting, only a few studies have examined the health benefits of these diets in humans. The goal of this Review is to summarize these preliminary findings and give insights into the effects of intermittent fasting on body weight and risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases in humans. This Review also assesses the safety of these regimens, and offers some practical advice for how to incorporate intermittent fasting diets into everyday life. Recommendations for future research are also presented.

### Substituting carbohydrate at lunch for added protein increases fat oxidation during subsequent exercise in healthy males [^115VvaJ5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous well-established health benefits and can aid weight management. Interestingly, pre-exercise nutritional state can mediate the benefits of exercise, as performing a single bout of exercise after a prolonged fast (> 12 hours) has been shown to increase fat oxidation which, if performed regularly over a 6-week period, can improve fat oxidative capacity. This is associated with improved markers of metabolic health, meaning regular overnight-fasted exercise training may augment improvements in insulin sensitivity. Compared to fed exercise, overnight-fasted exercise may also aid in regulating energy balance. For example, compared to consuming breakfast before exercise, an acute bout of fasted exercise has no effect, or only slightly increases lunch energy intake. This leads to a reduced cumulative energy intake which appears to persist over 24 hours, without any compensatory effects on 24-hour energy expenditure.

Most fasted exercise studies have been conducted in the morning, but morning exercise may not be possible or desirable for many. Macronutrient metabolism and appetite demonstrate circadian variation, so findings from overnight-fasted morning exercise may not translate to other times of day. One study showed that fasted exercise later in the day upregulates fat oxidation, but prolonged daytime fasting also elevates appetite, increases energy intake, and ultimately reduces motivation to exercise, exercise enjoyment, and exercise performance.

The metabolic benefits of fasted exercise may be driven by carbohydrate restriction, rather than fasting per se, with studies demonstrating that low-carbohydrate, high-protein feeding before morning exercise does not blunt fat oxidation compared to fasted exercise. Moreover, markers of training adaptation with implications for improved insulin sensitivity, such as AMPK signaling, as well as CD36 and PGC-1α mRNA expression, are upregulated following protein-only feeding. A high-protein meal also reduces appetite and energy intake to a greater extent than high-carbohydrate or high-fat meals, which may aid weight management efforts. This provides a practical rationale for overcoming some of the difficulties associated with conducting fasted exercise later in the day, but the metabolic and appetite-related effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein pre-exercise meal, relative to a more typical high-carbohydrate pre-exercise meal and fasting, are not well understood.

### Intermittent fasting and obesity-related health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials [^115r48c8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the many health benefits of intermittent fasting (IF). However, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this evidence in aggregate to date.

Objective

To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the associations of IF (zero-calorie alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating) with obesity-related health outcomes.

Evidence Review

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched from database inception to January 12, 2021. Data analysis was conducted from April 2021 through July 2021. Meta-analyses of RCTs investigating effects of IF in adults were included. The effect sizes of IF were recalculated using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence per association by applying the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) as high, moderate, low, and very low.

Findings

A total of 11 meta-analyses comprising 130 RCTs (median [IQR] sample size, 38 [24–69] participants; median [IQR] follow-up period, 3 [2–5] months) were included describing 104 unique associations of different types of IF with obesity-related health outcomes (median [IQR] studies per association, 4 [3–5]). There were 28 statistically significant associations (27%) that demonstrated the beneficial outcomes for body mass index, body weight, fat mass, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and blood pressure. IF was found to be associated with reduced fat-free mass. One significant association (1%) supported by high-quality evidence was modified alternate-day fasting for 1 to 2 months, which was associated with moderate reduction in body mass index in healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with regular diet. Six associations (6%) were supported by moderate quality evidence. The remaining associations found to be significant were supported by very low (75 associations [72%]) to low (22 associations [21%]) quality evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this umbrella review, we found beneficial associations of IF with anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes supported by moderate to high quality of evidence, which supports the role of IF, especially modified alternate-day fasting, as a weight loss approach for adults with overweight or obesity. More clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of IF on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality.

### Intermittent fasting: eating by the clock for health and exercise performance [^111W1xUs]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

IF practices are increasingly common in modern society and are well tolerated. Preliminary evidence supports their use in clinical populations at risk of metabolic conditions, and they may be of significant benefit to individuals by mechanisms which reduce systemic inflammation. Further research will allow us to understand the exact mechanisms behind the health benefits of IF and how these may be used in community populations to help fasting athletes train and prepare for competition.

### Do we need fasting prior to coronary angiography? The CORO-NF randomized pragmatic study [^114L519Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Similar to procedures requiring general anesthesia, current guidelines recommend fasting for 6 hours for solids and for 2 hours for liquids prior to coronary angiography, but without data supporting such recommendation. The CORO-NF study aimed at assessing whether a shorter fasting period prior to elective coronary angiography associates with improved patient satisfaction without more complications compared with the standard fasting approach.

Methods

We conducted a single-center, randomized, prospective, pragmatic study in 2 sequential phases: a "conventional protocol phase", continuing the usual practice (F Group); and an "experimental phase" (NF Group), reducing minimum fasting duration to 2 hours. Patients received a questionnaire to express a satisfaction score ranging from 1 (maximum complain/no approval) to 5 (minimum or no complain/full approval). All patients admitted acutely were enrolled in a control A Group registry. Fasting time and every major complication and periprocedural complications were analyzed.

Results

Fasting time was 821 ± 357 minutes in the F Group and 230 ± 146 minutes in the NF Group (P < .001). The satisfaction score was higher in the NF Group (4.2 ± 0.7 vs 2.9 ± 1.2, P < .001), even at multivariable analysis considering fasting time (P < .001). No intraprocedural food ingestion-related adverse events occurred in either of the 2 experimental groups, as well as in the parallel A Group, with no excess of peri- and postprocedural complications in the NF Group.

Conclusions

The significantly higher satisfaction scores among patients undergoing a shorter-than-recommended fasting period prior to coronary angiography, not counterbalanced by decreased safety, underscores the potential benefits of revising the traditional 6-hour fasting protocols.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^113oQMoz]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD adult overweight and obesity guideline — research priorities emphasize that because BMI may not be the best predictor of future disease and mortality, future trials should include more recently developed classification systems to characterize obesity severity, including use of body composition measures that are relevant to military service and readiness, and there is an imperative to develop an actionable diagnosis and staging system relevant to the current needs of the U.S. military. Future research should also focus on the benefits of weight-loss interventions in lower risk and specific subgroups to determine if weight loss has lasting benefits in these populations. Comprehensive lifestyle intervention programs can be expensive and difficult to deliver and maintain, so more research is needed to identify accessible, scalable, and practical ways to deliver the three core elements of these programs (behavior change, nutrition, and physical activity) in ways that align with patients' abilities, values, and preferences. For nutrition, consensus within the research community as to what constitutes various dietary interventions, including a low-fat diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, a low glycemic index diet, a Mediterranean diet, and duration and timing of fasts within intermittent fasting, would be of critical importance to move this field forward, and clarity and consistency in definitions of diets would then allow for more head-to-head comparisons; research comparing calorie restriction and carbohydrate restriction to assess effectiveness and feasibility in the long term is also needed. As with other chronic disease states, obesity pharmacotherapy management likely requires long-term use, with research needed to determine the underlying causes of variability in weight-loss response to medications, to quantify the degree of weight regain after cessation of each of the pharmacologic agents, and to evaluate whether multi-modal pharmacotherapy may be synergistic when agents with different mechanisms of action are used in tandem.

### Intermittent fasting and health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^114Hh5QA]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent fasting (IF), an eating pattern characterized by alternating periods of eating and fasting, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential health benefits and lifespan extension. IF encompasses various categories. The first category is zero-calorie alternate-day fasting (ADF) or modified alternate-day fasting (MADF). ADF involves alternating days of complete fasting with days of unrestricted eating. MADF, where participants alternate between days of unrestricted eating and days of fasting with caloric intake ranging from 0% to 40% or 0–600 kcal per day for 3–5 days per week. Another category is the twice-per-week fasting diet (TWF), where individuals fast for 2 days per week (either consecutively or nonconsecutively) with caloric intake ranging from 0% to 40% or 0–600 kcal per day, and have 5 days of unrestricted eating. The third category time-restricted eating (TRE) involves fasting for 12–24 h per day. Additionally, there is a category known as periodic fasting, which involves less frequent but longer periods of fasting. For instance, a 2–5 day pure water fast or a 4–7 day fasting simulated diet, designed to mimic the metabolic effects of fasting, fall into this category.

### Fasting for weight loss: an effective strategy or latest dieting trend? [^116BW98K]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

With the increasing obesity epidemic comes the search for effective dietary approaches for calorie restriction and weight loss. Here I examine whether fasting is the latest 'fad diet' as portrayed in popular media and discuss whether it is a safe and effective approach or whether it is an idiosyncratic diet trend that promotes short-term weight loss, with no concern for long-term weight maintenance. Fasting has long been used under historical and experimental conditions and has recently been popularised by 'intermittent fasting' or 'modified fasting' regimes, in which a very low-calorie allowance is allowed, on alternate days (ADF) or 2 days a week (5:2 diet), where 'normal' eating is resumed on non-diet days. It is a simple concept, which makes it easy to follow with no difficult calorie counting every other day. This approach does seem to promote weight loss, but is linked to hunger, which can be a limiting factor for maintaining food restriction. The potential health benefits of fasting can be related to both the acute food restriction and chronic influence of weight loss; the long-term effect of chronic food restriction in humans is not yet clear, but may be a potentially interesting future dietary strategy for longevity, particularly given the overweight epidemic. One approach does not fit all in the quest to achieve body weight control, but this could be a dietary strategy for consideration. With the obesity epidemic comes the search for dietary strategies to (i) prevent weight gain, (ii) promote weight loss and (iii) prevent weight regain. With over half of the population of the United Kingdom and other developed countries being collectively overweight or obese, there is considerable pressure to achieve these goals, from both a public health and a clinical perspective. Certainly not one dietary approach will solve these complex problems. Although there is some long-term success with gastric surgical options for morbid obesity, there is still a requirement for dietary approaches for weight management for the overweight and obese population, particularly as invasive interventions carry post-operative risk of death due to complications. Effective dietary interventions are required that promote long-term adherence and sustained beneficial effects on metabolic and disease markers. In general, such interventions need to be palatable and satiating, meet minimal nutritional requirements, promote loss of fat and preserve lean body mass, ensure long-term safety, be simple to administer and monitor and have widespread public health utility. Intermittent fasting or alternate day fasting may be an option for achieving weight loss and maintenance.

### A critical assessment of fasting to promote metabolic health and longevity [^116g5WiV]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The adaptive starvation response allows us to survive periods of starvation - a characteristic of the environment in which humans evolved. We are now in an evolutionary transition from a global environment which was characterized by periods of famine to a world where obesity and caloric excess have become a new reality, but the mechanisms of fasting physiology remain relevant. First, many parts of the world are still plagued by famine with insufficient food resources and therefore the adaptive mechanisms required for survival during periods of decreased caloric intake are not simply relevant to our evolutionary past. Second, the obesity epidemic provides strong rationale for understanding the biology of fasting, as the same efficiencies that have evolved to allow us to survive periods of starvation also likely drive a genetic predisposition to obesity, and therefore some of the adaptive mechanisms may be maladaptive in the setting of food excess. A third compelling reason to explore the biology of fasting is that in model organisms, caloric restriction without overt starvation, is an intervention that prolongs lifespan. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the biology of fasting. We will highlight potential mechanisms of benefit from fasting as well as examine data from model organisms and humans that indicate potential health risks to fasting, particularly related to bone fragility. Finally, we will review clinical studies to date that have investigated the effects of fasting on metabolic outcomes and suggest signals of benefit.

### Insulin resistance reduction, intermittent fasting, and human growth hormone: secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^112nda5i]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intermittent fasting safely produces significant weight loss and consequent cardiometabolic health improvements in controlled trials of alternate-day fasting, twice-per-week fasting, and time-restricted eating –. Compared to standard caloric restriction dieting, though, fasting does not produce clinically superior results for weight loss or related changes in fat mass. The time-restricted eating form of intermittent fasting may, however, also produce health benefits that are independent of weight loss. Time-restricted eating may act in part through chronobiological changes that normalize metabolic circadian rhythms through the timing of meals. Other intermittent fasting regimens may also have effects that are independent of weight loss, such as prolonged duration water-only fasting regimens whose calorie-free period of more than 20 hours may trigger survival-enhancing physiological adaptations that optimize and renew cellular, tissue, and organ-level functions –.

Prolonged water-only fasting induces a profound increase in human growth hormone (HGH) –, with a rapid 24-hour rise in HGH of 5- to 14-fold in males and females, respectively. Fasting alters HGH independent of acute weight loss during extended episodes of fasting, and basal HGH concentrations and the fasting-induced increases of HGH may be inversely related to cardiometabolic risk –. During fasting, HGH stimulates protein synthesis and conserves lean muscle. Through HGH, fasting regulates insulin, alters insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and activates the conversion of triglycerides into free fatty acids.

While HGH is a key mediator through which fasting acts to adapt the human body to a low-food-intake environment, it is unknown whether HGH has a larger role in personalizing the clinical improvements from intermittent fasting. One report from a crossover trial examining acute biomarker changes during one episode of 24-hour water-only fasting suggested that basal HGH concentration may modify the effect of fasting on changes in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Individuals with lower basal HGH experienced qualitatively greater reductions in HOMA-IR from fasting than those with higher baseline HGH, but the difference across 1 day of fasting was not statistically significant. The present study is a post hoc examination of a 26-week randomized controlled trial of low-frequency 24-hour water-only intermittent fasting. Through existing data from that trial, this study evaluated the interaction of HGH and intermittent fasting on changes in HOMA-IR or, secondarily, changes in its components (i.e. insulin or glucose) and changes in HGH.

### Intermittent fasting strategies and their effects on body weight and other cardiometabolic risk factors: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^114qhyPD]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of intermittent fasting diets, with continuous energy restriction or unrestricted (ad-libitum) diets on intermediate cardiometabolic outcomes from randomised clinical trials.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, and central databases from inception to 14 November 2024.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised clinical trials comparing the association of intermittent fasting diets (alternate day fasting, time restricted eating, and whole day fasting), continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets were included.

Main Outcomes

Outcomes included body weight (primary) and measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and markers of liver disease.

Data Synthesis

A network meta-analysis based on a frequentist framework was performed with data expressed as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE).

Results

99 randomised clinical trials involving 6582 adults of varying health conditions (720 healthy, 5862 existing health conditions) were identified. All intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction diet strategies reduced body weight when compared with ad-libitum diet. Compared with continuous energy restriction, alternate day fasting was the only form of intermittent fasting diet strategy to show benefit in body weight reduction (mean difference -1.29 kg (95% CI -1.99 to -0.59), moderate certainty of evidence). Additionally, alternate day fasting showed a trivial reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg (-2.49 to -0.88) and -1.05 kg (-1.90 to -0.19), respectively, both with moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up (n = 76); however, moderate-to-long-term trials (≥ 24 weeks, n = 17) only showed benefits in weight reduction in diet strategies compared with ad-libitum. Furthermore, in comparisons between intermittent fasting strategies, alternate day fasting lowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high density lipoprotein compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol. No differences were noted between intermittent fasting, continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets for HbA 1c and high density lipoprotein.

Conclusions

Minor differences were noted between some intermittent fasting diets and continuous energy restriction, with some benefit of weight loss with alternate day fasting in shorter duration trials. The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^116JY6z1]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Preoperative fasting — adults undergoing nonemergent surgical procedures: Fasting from the intake of clear liquids at least two hours before elective procedures requiring general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation/analgesia is recommended. Fasting from the intake of a light meal and/or nonhuman milk six hours or more before elective procedures requiring general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation/analgesia is recommended. Additional fasting (eight hours or more) may be required depending on the amount and type of food ingested, and fried, fatty foods, or meat may prolong gastric emptying; these guidelines may not apply to patients with comorbidities or diseases (for example, diabetes, hiatal hernia) that affect gastric emptying or fluid volumes. At present, the American Society of Anesthesiologists 2011 practice guidelines on preoperative fasting represent the most widely-used reference for appropriate preoperative fasting practices, and these guidelines do not specifically address preoperative fasting in elderly patients; however, the recommendations below draw primarily from these existing guidelines. There is increasing agreement regarding the benefit of limiting extended periods (greater than four to six hours) of preoperative fasting, and a recent review of the topic demonstrated there was not a significant association between a shortened (two to three hours) clear fluid fast and subsequent postoperative complications, including delirium.

### Frequency of screening and spontaneous breathing trial techniques: a randomized clinical trial [^111h49rD]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) was published by Karen E A Burns and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Mechanical ventilation and Critical illness. In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the trial question was: what is the role of frequent screening and pressure-supported spontaneous breathing trial in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation? In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the population was: 393 patients (163 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization after cardiopulmonary arrest or with brain death or expected brain death; evidence of myocardial ischemia in the 24 hour period before enrolment; continuous invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥ 2 weeks; tracheostomy in situ; sedative infusions for seizures or alcohol withdrawal; requirement of escalating doses of sedative agents. In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the interventions were: n = 195 frequent screening (at least BID screening and pressure-supported spontaneous breathing trial lasting 30–120 minutes) n = 198 daily screening (once-daily screening and pressure-supported spontaneous breathing trial lasting 30–120 minutes). In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median time to successful extubation (3.9 days vs. 2 days; HR 1.43, 95% CI 1 to 2). In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median time to first successful spontaneous breathing trial (0.9 days vs. 0.8 days; HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.67) Significant increase in median duration of ventilation in the ICU (82.2 hours vs. 46.7 hours; IRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.6) No significant difference in death at day 90 (22.1% vs. 20.7%; OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.6 to 2). In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the FAST (SBT-PS, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours, frequent screening was inferior to daily screening with respect to median time to successful extubation.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112fUJEN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — evaluation of insulinomas (diagnostic thresholds): Insulinomas should be suspected in people with hypoglycemia (generally fasting or nocturnal) and a pancreatic mass, and also when hypoglycemia occurs despite non-visualization on imaging; evaluation with a 72-hour fast testing serum insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide during concurrent hypoglycemia is the gold standard. An insulin level > 3 mIU/mL (usually > 6 mIU/mL), C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 ng/mL, and proinsulin levels of ≥ 5 pmol/L when fasting blood glucose is < 55 mg/dL is suspicious for insulinoma. The Panel also recommends evaluating fasting blood glucose levels if clinically feasible, and other causes of hypoglycemia (including adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and non–insulin-mediated causes) should be ruled out prior to performing a 72-hour fast.

### A scoping review of intermittent fasting, chronobiology, and metabolism [^117JrhDq]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronobiology plays a crucial role in modulating many physiologic systems in which there is nutritional synergism with meal timing. Given that intermittent fasting (IF) has grown as a flexible dietary method consisting of delayed or early eating windows, this scoping review addresses the effects of IF protocols on metabolism as they relate to clinical nutrition and the circadian system. Although nocturnal habits are associated with circadian misalignments and impaired cardiometabolic profile-and nutritional physiology is better orchestrated during the day-most findings are based on animal experiments or human studies with observational designs or acute meal tests. Well-controlled randomized clinical trials employing IF protocols of delayed or early eating windows have sometimes demonstrated clinical benefits, such as improved glycemic and lipid profiles, as well as weight loss. However, IF does not appear to be more effective than traditional diets at the group level, and its effects largely depend on energy restriction. Thus, efforts must be made to identify patient biological rhythms, preferences, routines, and medical conditions before individual dietary prescription in clinical practice.

### Effect of time restricted eating on body weight and fasting glucose in participants with obesity: results of a randomized, controlled, virtual clinical trial [^1141L7y1]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Time restricted eating (TRE) is an emerging dietary intervention strategy for weight management –. Common TRE schedules consist of fasting for 12–18 h each day, beginning in the evening or nighttime. Restricting the nonfasting (eating) duration to 12 h or less during waking hours has been shown to improve measures of cardiometabolic health, and is increasing in popularity as a unique method for weight loss –.

Limiting the portion of the day where eating occurs allows greater opportunity for the beneficial effects of fasting to take place. During the overnight fast, fuel utilization shifts from glucose to ketones, which are produced by the liver from fatty acids. Ketogenesis and ketosis are maintained in the absence of dietary carbohydrate. This daily metabolic switch from glucose to ketones reinforces metabolic circadian rhythms, reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, and has numerous other benefits –. Studies of TRE suggest that extending the duration of the daily fast to periods longer than 12 h may yield further cardiometabolic benefits; however, daily fasting for durations of 16 h or longer usually necessitates missing a meal, which can reduce adherence. Because fasting is difficult by nature, foods designed to mimic the ketogenic effect of fasting (i.e. high fat, low carbohydrate, and low protein) have been demonstrated by Longo and colleagues to have potential in providing relief from the hunger while maintaining ketosis, or metabolic fasting. A low calorie, high fat, low carbohydrate, low protein, "fasting snack" introduced during the daily fast may be useful in assisting individuals to adhere to longer metabolic fasting durations (i.e.g.reater than 12 h), during TRE by preventing the metabolic shift from ketones to glucose that occur with consumption of a mixed meal.

### Frequency of screening and spontaneous breathing trial techniques: a randomized clinical trial [^112eYZgF]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) was published by Karen E A Burns and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness and Mechanical ventilation. In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the trial question was: what is the role of frequent screening and T-piece spontaneous breathing trial in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation? In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the population was: 404 patients (162 female, 242 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours. The key exclusion criteria were hospitalization after cardiopulmonary arrest or with brain death or expected brain death; evidence of myocardial ischemia in the 24 hour period before enrolment; continuous invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥ 2 weeks; tracheostomy in situ; sedative infusions for seizures or alcohol withdrawal; requirement of escalating doses of sedative agents. In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the interventions were: n = 200 frequent screening (at least BID screening and T-piece spontaneous breathing trial lasting 30–120 minutes) n = 204 daily screening (once-daily screening and T-piece spontaneous breathing trial lasting 30–120 minutes). In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median time to successful extubation (2.9 days vs. 3.1 days; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.25). In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in median time to first successful spontaneous breathing trial (1 days vs. 1.1 days; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.11) Significant decrease in median duration of ventilation in the ICU (55.6 hours vs. 71.7 hours; IRR 0.9, 95% CI 0.9 to 0.9) No significant difference in death at day 90 (18% vs. 19.1%; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.8). In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the FAST (T-piece SBT, frequent screening vs. daily screening) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for > 24 hours, frequent screening was not superior to daily screening with respect to median time to successful extubation.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on glycemic control for critically ill children and adults 2024 [^114GAvwj]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Research considerations for individualized glycemic targets — observational data have generated hypotheses for future randomized controlled trials, with a lower target in non-DM patients associated with benefit and higher mean BG levels associated with greater mortality; this contrasts with the failure to show a benefit of INT in TGC-Fast, despite 80% of patients having no history of DM. Patients with DM and high admission HbA1C may have less risk from hyperglycemia but greater mortality with relative hypoglycemia, and a glycemic ratio of 80–90% is a proposed target (ratio of mean ICU BG/chronic estimated BG) but requires prospective trials using individualized targets that achieve adequate time in each target range.

### A meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of alternate day fasting, the 5: 2 diet, and time-restricted eating for weight loss [^112a71LT]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The rise in prevalence of obesity and related metabolic diseases has led to an increase in dietary interventions to restrict energy intakes to promote weight loss. Caloric energy restriction (CER), which involves a daily energy deficit of 500 to 750 kcal, is traditionally recommended in weight‐loss or weight‐management strategies. Over the past decade, intermittent fasting (IF), also called intermittent energy restriction, has increased in popularity as an alternative to conventional weight‐loss strategies. IF alternates periods of eating with periods of complete fasting or very limited caloric intake, and it is thought to have health promoting effects, dependent and independent of the weight‐loss benefits.

IF is an umbrella term for different variations of fasting regimens, but the three most mentioned variations are the following: alternate day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and time‐restricted eating (TRE; also called time‐restricted feeding). The ADF regimen consists of a fasting day, alternated with a day when participants can eat as desired, called ad libitum eating day. There are two main variations of ADF: zero‐calorie ADF and modified alternate day fasting (MADF). In the zero‐calorie ADF regimen, no foods or caloric beverages are consumed on fasting days whereas in the MADF regimen the caloric intake during the fasting days accounts for 20% to 30% of that of a normal dietary intake. The 5:2 diet is characterized by individuals eating normally on 5 d/wk and fasting (or reduced caloric intake) on two consecutive or nonconsecutive days. A third popular regimen is TRE, in which individuals typically fast for 14 to 16 h/d and consume food ad libitum for 4‐ to 12‐hour feeding windows. The TRE regimen has the most variable design compared with other regimens, as the fasting window can extend from 12 to 21 h/d. TRE differs from the 5:2 diet and ADF, as TRE focuses on a consistent daily eating window rather than energy restriction per se, seeking to trigger other potential health benefits.

Cirrhosis — timing of nutritional intake emphasizes minimizing fasting and structured snacks: Fasting time should be minimized, with a maximum interval of 3–4 hours between nutritional intake while awake, and to minimize nocturnal fasting time, an early breakfast and/or late-evening snack should be recommended. Prolonged periods of fasting should be avoided in cirrhosis, with evidence supporting the benefits on muscle mass of an early morning breakfast, late evening snack, and intake of small, frequent meals and snacks every 3–4 hours while awake.

### Pro-con debate: 1-vs 2-hour fast for clear liquids before anesthesia in children [^116hZYWm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Perioperative fasting guidelines are designed to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastrointestinal contents. The current recommendations from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) are for a minimum 2-hour fast after ingestion of clear liquids before general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or procedural sedation and analgesia. Nonetheless, in children, fasting guidelines also have consequences as regards to child and parent satisfaction, hemodynamic stability, the ability to achieve vascular access, and perioperative energy balance. Despite the fact that current guidelines recommend a relatively short fasting time for clear fluids of 2 hours, the actual duration of fasting time can be significantly longer. This may be the result of deficiencies in communication regarding the duration of the ongoing fasting interval as the schedule changes in a busy operating room as well as to poor parent and patient adherence to the 2-hour guidelines. Prolonged fasting can result in children arriving in the operating room for an elective procedure being thirsty, hungry, and generally in an uncomfortable state. Furthermore, prolonged fasting may adversely affect hemodynamic stability and can result in parental dissatisfaction with the perioperative experience. In this PRO and CON presentation, the authors debate the premise that reducing the nominal minimum fasting time from 2 hours to 1 hour can reduce the incidence of prolonged fasting and provide significant benefits to children, with no increased risks.

VA/DoD guideline — intermittent fasting in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is addressed with a weak recommendation against its use; specifically, "we suggest against intermittent fasting" for this population and the recommendation is "Weak against | Reviewed, New-added", with the Work Group stating its confidence in the evidence was "very low". Evidence cited includes a 2021 systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials (n = 338) in obese patients with T2DM showing that effects on HbA1c, lipid profile, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure were equivalent between intermittent fasting (IF) and a standard diet, with median follow-up of 24 weeks, while weight loss favored IF by 1.89 kg (95% CI: -2.91 to -0.86 kg). Safety concerns include that patients taking medication with the potential to cause hypoglycemia should exercise caution and that the risk of having a hypoglycemic event was twofold greater during periods of IF.

### Effect of alternate-day fasting on weight loss, weight maintenance, and cardioprotection among metabolically healthy obese adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113vWjHj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Alternate-day fasting has become increasingly popular, yet, to date, no long-term randomized clinical trials have evaluated its efficacy.

Objective

To compare the effects of alternate-day fasting vs daily calorie restriction on weight loss, weight maintenance, and risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-center randomized clinical trial of obese adults (18 to 64 years of age; mean body mass index, 34) was conducted between October 1, 2011, and January 15, 2015, at an academic institution in Chicago, Illinois.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups for 1 year: alternate-day fasting (25% of energy needs on fast days; 125% of energy needs on alternating "feast days"), calorie restriction (75% of energy needs every day), or a no-intervention control. The trial involved a 6-month weight-loss phase followed by a 6-month weight-maintenance phase.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes were adherence to the dietary intervention and risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.

Results

Among the 100 participants (86 women and 14 men; mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years), the dropout rate was highest in the alternate-day fasting group (13 of 34 [38%]), vs the daily calorie restriction group (10 of 35 [29%]) and control group (8 of 31 [26%]). Mean weight loss was similar for participants in the alternate-day fasting group and those in the daily calorie restriction group at month 6 (-6.8% [95% CI, -9.1% to -4.5%] vs -6.8% [95% CI, -9.1% to -4.6%]) and month 12 (-6.0% [95% CI, -8.5% to -3.6%] vs -5.3% [95% CI, -7.6% to -3.0%]) relative to those in the control group. Participants in the alternate-day fasting group ate more than prescribed on fast days, and less than prescribed on feast days, while those in the daily calorie restriction group generally met their prescribed energy goals. There were no significant differences between the intervention groups in blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, or homocysteine concentrations at month 6 or 12. Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at month 6 significantly increased among the participants in the alternate-day fasting group (6.2 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.1–12.4 mg/dL]), but not at month 12 (1.0 mg/dL [95% CI, -5.9 to 7.8 mg/dL]), relative to those in the daily calorie restriction group. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated by month 12 among the participants in the alternate-day fasting group (11.5 mg/dL [95% CI, 1.9–21.1 mg/dL]) compared with those in the daily calorie restriction group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alternate-day fasting did not produce superior adherence, weight loss, weight maintenance, or cardioprotection vs daily calorie restriction.

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in NSTE ACS — timing evidence and practice implication: In the Class I GUSTO IV-ACS trial among patients not scheduled for early coronary intervention within 48 hours, abciximab showed no difference in the 30-day composite of death or MI versus placebo (odds ratio 1.0; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.24 for 24-hour abciximab and 1.1 [95% CI 0.94 to 1.39] for 48-hour abciximab), with increased mortality at 48 hours for 24- or 48-hour infusions; the Class II ACUITY Timing Trial found that immediate glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration versus deferral until PCI within 72 hours did not confer additional benefit but increased bleeding; a Class II trial by Giugliano et al showed no added benefit of early versus late eptifibatide with reduced non-life-threatening bleeding and transfusions when waiting until after catheterization. In clinical context, it is reasonable to defer starting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion until the time of cardiac catheterization or hospital admission.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^115aGCkE]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Focused Assessment Sonography in Trauma (FAST) — in hemodynamically unstable trauma patients, FAST is performed to detect intraabdominal free fluid suggestive of hemoperitoneum, and a positive FAST allows quick triage to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy; because FAST has high specificity, an unstable trauma patient with a positive FAST goes to the OR. FAST has acceptable sensitivity (69–98 percent) for detection of free fluid and lower sensitivity (63 percent) for detection of solid organ injury, and obtaining serial FAST examinations increases overall sensitivity (72–93 percent). In stable patients, FAST has limited sensitivity for detecting the presence of an injury that might require intervention, and not all injuries detectable by FAST require intervention.

### Effect of time restricted eating on body weight and fasting glucose in participants with obesity: results of a randomized, controlled, virtual clinical trial [^116mV7Eg]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Time restricted eating (TRE) is an emerging dietary intervention for weight loss that is hypothesized to reinforce the metabolic benefits of nightly fasting/ketosis. This pilot study investigated the effectiveness of a daily 14-h metabolic fast (14:10 TRE beginning after dinner, a "fasting snack" at hour 12, and ending with breakfast 14h later) combined with a commercial weight management program on body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in individuals with obesity. We also investigated the effect of the low-calorie, high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-protein "fasting snack" on blood glucose.

Methods

This 8-week, randomized, controlled, clinical trial included men and women (BMI ≥ 30kg/m 2) between June and October 2020. Study procedures were conducted remotely. Participants were randomized to 14:10 or 12-h TRE (12:12, active comparator) and prescribed a diet (controlled for calories and macronutrient composition) and exercise program that included weekly customized counseling and support. The primary outcome was change from baseline in body weight in the 14:10 group.

Results

Of the 78 randomized participants, 60 (n = 30/group) completed 8 weeks. The LS mean change from baseline in weight in the 14:10 group was -8.5% (95% CI -9.6 to -7.4; P < 0.001) and -7.1% (-8.3 to -5.8; P < 0.001) in the 12:12 group (between group difference -1.4%; -2.7 to -0.2; P < 0.05). There was a statistically significant LS mean change from baseline to week 8 in FBG in the 14:10 group of -7.6mg/dl (95% CI -15.1 to -0.1; P < 0.05) but not in the 12:12 group (-3.1mg/dl, -10.0 to 3.7; P = NS). Both interventions resulted in a larger reduction in FBG in participants with elevated FBG (≥ 100mg/dl) at baseline (both P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In participants with obesity who completed 8 weeks of the 14:10 TRE schedule combined with a commercial weight loss program, there was statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in FBG.

### International consensus on fasting terminology [^114ME4nv]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Although fasting is increasingly applied for disease prevention and treatment, consensus on terminology is lacking. Using Delphi methodology, an international, multidisciplinary panel of researchers and clinicians standardized definitions of various fasting approaches in humans. Five online surveys and a live online conference were conducted with 38 experts, 25 of whom completed all 5 surveys. Consensus was achieved for the following terms: "fasting" (voluntary abstinence from some or all foods or foods and beverages), "modified fasting" (restriction of energy intake to max. 25% of energy needs), "fluid-only fasting", "alternate-day fasting", "short-term fasting" (lasting 2–3 days), "prolonged fasting" (≥ 4 consecutive days), and "religious fasting". "Intermittent fasting" (repetitive fasting periods lasting ≤ 48 h), "time-restricted eating", and "fasting-mimicking diet" were discussed most. This study provides expert recommendations on fasting terminology for future research and clinical applications, facilitating communication and cross-referencing in the field.

### Facilitating positive health behaviors and well-being to improve health outcomes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113BsGDD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Nonreligious fasting — intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating are described as alternate-day fasting with energy restriction of 500–600 calories on alternate days, the 5:2 diet with energy restriction of 500–600 calories on consecutive or nonconsecutive days with usual intake the other five, and time-restricted eating with a window of 8–15 h, which produces mild to moderate weight loss (~3–8% body weight) over 8–12 weeks with no significant differences in weight loss versus continuous calorie restriction. A 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of studies lasting 2–52 weeks concluded intermittent energy restriction produces small but significant reductions in waist circumference and fat-free mass but were otherwise not superior to continuous energy restriction diets. Time-restricted eating has been shown to be safe for adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and people with diabetes who are taking insulin and/or secretagogues should be medically monitored during the fasting period. Use of partial or total meal replacements is an additional strategy for energy restriction, and a meta-analysis involving 17 studies showed greater weight loss and improvements in A1C and fasting blood glucose versus conventional meal plans; trial results indicate partial or total meal replacements can be a potential short-term strategy, and long-term follow-up and support from members of the diabetes care team are needed. Chrononutrition is noted as an emerging subspecialty focused on how the timing of food ingestion affects metabolic health.

### Lipid measurements in the management of cardiovascular diseases: practical recommendations a scientific statement from the National Lipid Association writing group [^116vPj3J]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). High credibility.

Fasting status for lipid testing — Although it has been common to "advise patients to fast about 8 to 10 hours prior to lipid testing", several recent guidelines "now recommend that fasting is unnecessary, at least for the initial screen". Among commonly measured lipids, "Plasma triglyceride level is the only commonly measured lipid test that significantly changes after a meal, and population differences between fasting and non-fasting triglyceride levels are generally less than 15%". Additionally, "Some studies have reported that nonfasting lipids may better predict ASCVD risk than fasting levels".

### Evidence analysis library review of best practices for performing indirect calorimetry in healthy and non-critically ill individuals [^115gfPow]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2015). Medium credibility.

EE: Fasting Requirements in Healthy Adults — For indirect calorimetry, consuming meals increases metabolic rate in healthy adults for at least three to five hours and the thermic effect of food (TEF) dissipates depending on the amount of calories consumed. The recommendation EE: Exceptions to Fasting Requirements for Healthy Adults applies to individuals for whom extended fasting is not possible (e.g., individuals on medications requiring food or caloric beverages, etc.). A total of 13 studies were included in the evidence analysis for this recommendation, and the conclusion statement supporting these recommendations is grade III. There are no obvious costs that may be associated with the application of these recommendations.

### Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of exogenous ketosis induced by orally administered free β-hydroxybutyrate in healthy adult subjects [^114Atbh4]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Several ketogenic interventions have shown benefits in a wide variety of clinical scenarios. Ketosis can be induced in different ways: by 72 hours of fasting, with a carbohydrate-restricteddiet, and within minutes using supplements. While endogenous ketosis interventions have proven useful in many illnesses such as diabetes, psychiatric illnesses, migraine, and cognitive decline, in some time-sensitive clinical scenarios where ketosis could be beneficial (eg, heart failureor sepsis) endogenous ketosis is impractical as patients cannot wait 72 hours for achieving a physiologically relevant production.

Beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB) is a metabolite with intrinsic signalling activity, therefore, it has gained attention as a potentially clinically useful supplement. There are three thoroughly studied ketone supplements for inducing ketosis: ketone salts, ketone estersand medium-chain triglycerides. Even when they all raise the D-BHB in the blood and all are safe and well tolerated, they significantly differ in their safety profile, palatability and price.

A fourth and potentially interesting option is to use biologically identical (D-BHB). Being salt-free and having no intermediate metabolites or precursors, it could have a broader clinical reach than previous ketone supplements (eg, patients with mineral load restrictions such as those living with heart failureor chronic kidney disease). While it is already commercially available in the United States (American Ketone) and Greater China (MedPHA), its safety and tolerability had not yet been documented in the scientific literature. In this work, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of Free D-BHB as a ketogenic supplement in healthy adults.

### Fasting and fasting mimicking diets in obesity and cardiometabolic disease prevention and treatment [^113ZuUoq]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Worldwide obesity has risen to record levels generating a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease as well as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we discuss the impact of obesity on lifespan and cardiometabolic disease in mice and humans and how different types of fasting can help prevent and treat them. We argue that specific types of fasting regimens which are associated with low burden, high long-term compliance and safety, can reduce obesity and other disease risk factors, lower morbidity and extend healthspan.

### Does time-restricted eating add benefits to calorie restriction? A systematic review [^112R28um]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

A growing body of evidence has supported the health benefits of extended daily fasting, known as time-restricted eating (TRE); however, whether the addition of TRE enhances the known benefits of calorie restriction (CR) remains unclear.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched through April 2023. This systematic review includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CR+TRE with CR alone in energy-matched conditions of at least 8weeks in duration that assessed changes in body weight and cardiometabolic disease risk factors in adults with overweight and/or obesity.

Results

Seven studies were identified (n = 579). Two studies reported greater weight loss and reductions in diastolic blood pressure with CR+TRE compared with CR alone after 8 to 14weeks, whereas one study reported greater improvements in triglycerides and glucose tolerance with CR+TRE (3days/week) compared with CR alone following 26weeks. One study reported significant increases in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels with CR+TRE versus CR alone after 8weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in any other outcome variable between the two interventions.

Conclusions

The addition of TRE to CR regimens resulted in greater weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in some studies; however, the majority of studies did not find additional benefits.

### Effects of intermittent versus continuous energy intakes on insulin sensitivity and metabolic risk in women with overweight [^1124tk3N]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare intermittent fasting (IF) versus continuous energy intakes at 100% or 70% of calculated energy requirements on insulin sensitivity, cardiometabolic risk, body weight, and composition.

Methods

Women with overweight (n = 88; 50 ± 1 years, BMI 32.3 ± 0.5 kg/m 2) were randomized to one of four diets (IF70, IF100, dietary restriction [DR70], or control) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio for 8 weeks. IF groups fasted for 24 hours after breakfast on three nonconsecutive days per week. All foods were provided and diets matched for macronutrient composition (35% fat, 15% protein, 50% carbohydrate). Insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, weight, body composition, and plasma markers were assessed following a "fed" day (12-hour fast) and a 24-hour fast (IF only).

Results

IF70 displayed greater reductions in weight, fat mass, total- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids compared with DR70 and IF100 (all P ≤ 0.05). IF100 lost more weight and fat than control. However, fasting insulin was increased. There were no group differences in insulin sensitivity by clamp; however, a 24-hour fast transiently reduced insulin sensitivity.

Conclusions

When prescribed at matched energy restriction, IF reduced weight and fat mass and improved total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol more than DR. IF prescribed in energy balance did not improve health compared with other groups, despite modest weight loss.

### Anthropometric features are not predictive of 72-hour fast duration in insulinomas [^1133nVvA]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The 72-hour fast is used to document Whipple's triad and understand the mechanism of hypoglycemia. Although hypoglycemia develops within 24 hours in the majority of fasts, identifying possible determinants of fast duration may help to predict the need for admission. Therefore, we determined the relation between anthropometric features on fast duration and assessed end of fast parameters on maximal tumor size, extent of disease, or tumor recurrence.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients with insulinoma in the past 25 years who underwent a 72-hour fast was conducted. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain anthropometric patient data and tumor characteristics.

Results

A total of 233 patients underwent the 72-hour fast. The mean age at diagnosis was 50 ± 16 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 29 ± 7 kg/m 2, and 66% (153 of 233) were female. Duration of fast was not associated with gender (P = 0.2), age (P = 0.3), or BMI (P = 0.7). A shorter fast duration was inversely related to end of fast C-peptide (P = 0.0075) but not insulin (P = 0.13) or proinsulin (P = 0.28) concentration. End of fast C-peptide was associated with increased tumor size (P = 0.036) and multiplicity (P = 0.01). Proinsulin was associated with increased tumor size (P < .01) and malignancy (P = 0.018).

Conclusion

Duration of fast was not significantly related age, gender, weight, or BMI, although end-of-fast C-peptide and proinsulin may provide some information regarding tumor characteristics. Consequently, the duration of fast cannot be predicted a priori and should be allowed to run for the planned length unless hypoglycemia develops. Abbreviation: BMI = body mass index.

### Endocrine and chronobiological effects of fasting in women [^116RUVpZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether fasting in women would suppress GnRH/LH drive in a high- versus low-gonadal steroid milieu.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

Academic clinical research center.

Patient(S)

Eleven eumenorrheic women and eleven women taking combined oral contraceptives.

Intervention(S)

Seven of the eleven women in each group underwent an acute 72-hour fast. Blood samples were obtained at 15-minute intervals for 24 hours before the fast and during the last 24 hours of fasting.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Twenty-four-hour profiles of LH, cortisol, and melatonin were assessed. Ovarian activity was tracked with estradiol and progesterone levels, and metabolic responses were gauged by measuring thyroid hormone and beta-hydroxy-butyric acid levels.

Result(S)

Fasting increased beta-hydroxy-butyric acid and reduced free thyronine. Fasting in the midfollicular phase had no effect on LH pulsatility or on FSH, estradiol, or subsequent luteal-phase progesterone levels. However, fasting elevated cortisol and resulted in a phase advance in melatonin secretion of 81 minutes in both the midfollicular and luteal phases.

Conclusion(S)

Fasting in women elicited expected metabolic responses and apparently advanced the central circadian clock without compromising reproductive function.

### Meal timing during alternate day fasting: impact on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk in obese adults [^116zmRb6]. Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Alternate day fasting (ADF; 24-h feeding/24-h 25% energy intake at lunchtime), is effective for weight loss, but diet tolerability is questionable. Moving the fast day meal to dinnertime, or dividing it into smaller meals, may improve tolerability. Accordingly, this study compared the effects of ADF with three meal times on body weight and heart disease risk.

Methods

Obese subjects (n = 74) were randomized to 1 of 3 groups for 8 weeks: 1) ADF-L: lunch, 2) ADF-D: dinner, or 3) ADF-SM: small meals.

Results

Body weight decreased similarly (P < 0.001) in all groups (ADF-L: 3.5 ± 0.4 kg, ADF-D 4.1 ± 0.5 kg, ADF-SM 4.0 ± 0.5 kg). Reductions (P < 0.001) in fat mass and visceral fat were also comparable. Plasma lipids remained unchanged, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size increased (P < 0.05) in all groups (1.3 ± 0.5 Å). Systolic blood pressure decreased (P < 0.05) by ADF-SM only. Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR remained unchanged.

Conclusions

Thus, allowing individuals to consume the fast day meal at dinner or small meals produces similar weight loss and cardio-protection as consuming the meal at lunch. This flexibility in meal timing may increase tolerability and long-term adherence to ADF protocols.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^113nTzdN]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key Action Statement 3C — administration with feeds and dose holding to minimize hypoglycemia during propranolol therapy for IHs: Clinicians should counsel that propranolol be administered with or after feeding and that doses be held at times of diminished oral intake or vomiting to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (grade X, strong recommendation). Aggregate Evidence Quality is Grade X with a strong recommendation, benefits include reducing the likelihood of adverse reactions and benefits outweigh harms. Hypoglycemia occurs infrequently and can be minimized with caregiver education to give propranolol during or immediately after a feeding and to temporarily withdraw therapy during periods of fasting or vomiting; prolonged fasting should be avoided and parents should be advised that hypoglycemia becomes more likely after ≥ 8 hours of fasting in infants and young children; routine glucose screening is not indicated.

### Increasing serum betahydroxybutyrate concentrations during the 72-hour fast: evidence against hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [^1173M66s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

We have determined whether the behavior of betahydroxybutyrate (BOHB) during the 72-h fast of persons without evidence of hyperinsulinemic or any form of organic hypoglycemia might provide indicators of a negative fast.

Design

Twenty-one patients with surgically confirmed insulinoma and 34 patients with negative 72-h fasts had BOHB measured every 6 h until Whipple's triad in the former and until 72-h in the latter.

Results

Quadratic regression curves of BOHB from the negative fasts showed the typical curve to be flat initially, then increase in a manner that was roughly linear. Using time-specific medians, the changes were: 12–18 h, 0% increase; 18–36 h, 333% increase; 36–54 h, 210% increase, and 54–72 h, 167% increase. In contrast, patients with insulinoma had suppressed BOHB concentrations. Two successive BOHB values in excess of the 18-h level seemed to portend a negative fast. By using the previously published criterion of BOHB more than 2.7 mmol/liter (a surrogate for hypoinsulinemia and thereby an indicator of a negative fast), 74% of persons with a negative fast reached this level before the 72-h point.

Conclusions

Serial measurements of BOHB during the 72-h fast have the potential to provide not only clues during the fast that it will ultimately be negative, but also the opportunity to truncate the fast if the endpoint BOHB criterion for a negative fast is met before 72 h.

### Guidelines for sedation and anesthesia in GI endoscopy [^1124g94P]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2018). Medium credibility.

Pre-procedural preparation and assessment for sedation in GI endoscopy — Patients "should provide informed consent for administration of sedation through a process that involves a discussion of benefits, risks, and limitations as well as possible alternatives to the sedation plan". "As much as possible, the level of sedation targeted should be commensurate with the patient's expectation of sedation depth as well as that necessary to perform the procedure safely and effectively". Because of aspiration risk, "patients undergoing sedation should be asked to fast for a specific time period". The ASA guidelines indicate that patients "should not drink fluids or eat solid foods for a sufficient period of time to allow for gastric emptying before the procedure", and specifically, patients "should fast a minimum of 2 hours after ingestion of clear liquids and 6 hours after ingestion of light meals before sedation is administered". The document also notes "There are no data to support a direct relationship between duration of fasting and the risk of pulmonary aspiration" and "There is no practice standard for pre-procedural fasting that has been universally accepted".

### Serum adiponectin concentrations during a 72-hour fast in over-and normal-weight humans [^113cLdwU]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Adiponectin is currently considered an important link between obesity and insulin resistance, since circulating levels of this insulin sensitizing hormone have consistently been found to be reduced in obese subjects. However, until now it is not known how the secretion of adiponectin is regulated in response to acute metabolic changes. Here, we assessed the influence of complete fasting for 72 h on serum adiponectin levels.

Design

Between group comparison of repeated measurements.

Subjects

In total, 18 normal-weight (mean ± s.e.m. BMI: 22.2 ± 0.4 kg/m(2); age: 39.2 ± 4.4 y) and nine over-weight (BMI: 33.2 ± 1.8 kg/m(2); age: 36.9 ± 4.5 y) subjects.

Measurements

Serum adiponectin levels were measured every 4 h during a 72-h fasting period. Additionally, concentrations of plasma glucose and serum insulin and leptin were assessed at the beginning and in the end of the fasting experiment. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).

Results

While concentrations of glucose, insulin, and leptin decreased across the fasting period by 31.0, 33.1 and 60.0%, respectively (all P < 0.005), adiponectin levels remained unchanged (P = 0.817). Overall, over-weight subjects exhibited slightly lower adiponectin levels than normal-weight subjects (P = 0.092), but there was no difference in the time course of adiponectin levels during fasting between these two groups (P = 0.970). Although, averaged adiponectin levels before and after fasting did not systematically differ, individual changes in adiponectin levels across fasting displayed a slight but significant inverse correlation with changes in plasma glucose concentration (r = -0.42, P = 0.03).

Discussion

The data show that serum adiponectin concentrations remain remarkably stable during 72 h of fasting in normal- and over-weight subjects. Thus, adiponectin appears to reflect primarily long-term changes in body weight with little evidence for a dependence on short-term regulatory influences.

### Fasting or nonfasting lipid measurements: It depends on the question [^115Vm5w2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

In the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association Guideline (AHA) on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment thresholds have been replaced with a focus on global risk. In this context, we re-examine the need for fasting lipid measurements in various clinical scenarios including estimating initial risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in a primary prevention patient; screening for familial lipid disorders in a patient with a strong family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or genetic dyslipidemia; clarifying a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome so it can be used to make lifestyle counseling more effective; assessing residual risk in a treated patient; diagnosing and treating patients with suspected hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis; or diagnosing hypertriglyceridemia in patients who require therapy for other conditions that may further elevate triglycerides. Posing a specific question can aid the clinician in understanding when fasting lipids are needed and when nonfasting lipids are adequate.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin initiated between 24 to 72 hours for mild ischemic stroke: a subgroup analysis of the INSPIRES randomized clinical trial [^115oA7cF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Extension of the treatment time window of DAPT may benefit more patients, since the current guidelines recommend a short time window (within 24 hours after symptom onset) of opportunity for secondary stroke prevention. Previous studies showed that the risk of new stroke was still high in the second and third days after symptom onset of minor stroke and TIA, indicating potential benefit from delayed DAPT for these patients. Previous meta-analysisand simulation study from the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Strokeand the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Ticagrelor and Acetylsalicylic Acid for Prevention of Stroke and Deathtrials suggested that the benefit of DAPT in reducing major ischemic events may persist with a delay in initiation as late as 3 days after the onset of mild ischemic stroke or TIA. The recent Antiplatelet Therapy in Acute Mild-Moderate Ischemic Stroke trial showed that DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was superior to aspirin alone reducing early neurologic deterioration at 7 days in patients with acute mild to moderate ischemic stroke (NIHSS score of 4 to 10) presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset. The present subgroup analysis further provided additional evidence that DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin had consistent benefit and risk between patients within more than 24 hours to 72 hours and those within 24 hours or less after symptom onset. Additionally, the absolute increase in risk of moderate-to-severe bleedings for clopidogrel-aspirin treatment was low: a 0.44% risk difference with a number needed to harm of 227 to produce 1 moderate-to-severe bleeding event within 90 days for patients with a time to randomization of more than 24 to 48 hours and a 0.39% risk difference with a number needed to harm of 256 for patients with a time to randomization of more than 48 hours to 72 hours.

### Fasting is not routinely required for determination of a lipid profile: clinical and laboratory implications including flagging at desirable concentration cut-points-a joint consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society and European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine [^116UyiiC]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Why has fasting been the standard?

Venipuncture is a universal practice involved in testing the lipid profile with the purposes of predicting cardiovascular risk and/or monitoring responses to lipid-lowering therapy. Some guidelines continue to promulgate the conventional practice of measuring the lipid profile in the fasting state, although other organizations endorse non-fasting lipid profiles. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines do not require fasting for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation; however, they do recommend a fasting lipid panel before statin initiation to calculate LDL cholesterol and for individuals with non-HDL cholesterol ≥ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) or triglycerides ≥ 5.7 mmol/L (500 mg/dL), as these may be clues to genetic and/or secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia. One reason among others for preferring fasting lipid profiles is the increase in triglyceride concentration seen during a fat tolerance test;, however, the increase in plasma triglycerides observed after habitual food intake in most individuals is much less than that observed during a fat tolerance test. As a fast-food meal consisting of e.g. a burger, a shake, and fries might be considered a fat tolerance test, in areas where fast-food consumption is especially high patients may be advised to avoid high-fat, fast-food meals on the day of lipid profile testing. Also, as LDL cholesterol is often calculated by the Friedewald equation, which includes the triglyceride concentration, calculated LDL cholesterol has been thought to be affected substantially by food intake; however, directly measured and calculated LDL cholesterol values are similar using both fasting and non-fasting lipid profiles (Figure 2). If this Friedewald equation is employed, there may be some underestimation of LDL cholesterol when chylomicrons are present, which may even be circumvented if a modification of this equation is used. Also, many randomized lipid-lowering trials have used fasting lipid measurements and, in order to follow evidence-based practice, fasting blood sampling has often been the standard in everyday risk assessment. However, numerous population-based studies and at least three major statin trials used random, non-fasting blood sampling (Table 2), providing a robust evidence base for a change in the conventional practice of using fasting samples.

### Gadobutrol versus gadofosveset-trisodium in MR venography of the lower extremities [^116M2HBN]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Performing high-resolution MRV with a regular gadolinium-based agent such as gadobutrol instead of a blood pool contrast agent such as gadofosveset-trisodium is possible, allowing for high-quality MRV studies. Even though the two contrast agents used are different in terms of concentration and protein binding, we did not find any significant differences in reported image quality, confidence of interpretation or image findings.

In our daily practice, we used gadofosveset-trisodium as contrast material of choice for MRV. With regard to contrast clearance after injection, 94% of gadofosveset-trisodium is cleared after 72 hours compared to gadobutrol that is cleared 90% after 12 hours. To prevent any interference related to the prolonged clearance time of the blood pool agent, the initial scan of the study protocol was performed using gadobutrol and a safety margin of 3 days was used to allow for (near) complete clearance of the contrast administered. Since patients with chronic venous disease generally have stable disease no confounding factor was introduced by allowing 3 to a maximum of 14 days in between the two scans.

Secondly, the reported findings with the ultra-fast GE sequence in comparison to the HR-FFE sequence are virtually equal. Additionally, we observed a slight increase in overall image quality using the ultra-fast GE sequence. This particularly holds true for the abdomino-pelvic segments, which are regarded as the most important segments in clinical practice. The main reason for the acquisition of the non-contrast enhanced BTFE images in our study protocol were well known evaluation problems of the inferior vena cava on the HR-FFE sequence. In 6 out of 20 patients we observed image quality problems due to motion artefacts which hampered assessment on the HR-FFE sequence, that were not encountered on the ultra-fast GE sequence. This implies an additional benefit in terms of confidence and reduction in scan time (non-contrast enhanced acquisitions can be omitted) when implementing an ultra-fast GE sequence to the scan protocol.

### One-step or 2-step testing for gestational diabetes: which is better? [^116adgqe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the United States, the common approach to detecting gestational diabetes mellitus is the 2-step protocol recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A 50 g, 1-hour glucose challenge at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation is followed by a 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test when a screening test threshold is exceeded. Notably, 2 or more elevated values diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 2-step screening test is administered without regard to the time of the last meal, providing convenience by eliminating the requirement for fasting. However, depending upon the cutoff used and population risk factors, approximately 15% to 20% of screened women require the 100 g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommends a protocol of no screening test but rather a diagnostic 75 g, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. One or more values above threshold diagnose gestational diabetes mellitus. The 1-step approach requires that women be fasting for the test but does not require a second visit and lasts 2 hours rather than 3. Primarily because of needing only a single elevated value, the 1-step approach identifies 18% to 20% of pregnant women as having gestational diabetes mellitus, 2 to 3 times the rate with the 2-step procedure, but lower than the current United States prediabetes rate of 24% in reproductive aged women. The resources needed for the increase in gestational diabetes mellitus are parallel to the resources needed for the increased prediabetes and diabetes in the nonpregnant population. A recent randomized controlled trial sought to assess the relative population benefits of the above 2 approaches to gestational diabetes mellitus screening and diagnosis. The investigators concluded that there was no significant difference between the 2-step screening protocol and 1-step diagnostic testing protocol in their impact on population adverse short-term pregnancy outcomes. An accompanying editorial concluded that perinatal benefits of the 1-step approach to diagnosing gestational diabetes mellitus "appear to be insufficient to justify the associated patient and healthcare costs of broadening the diagnosis". We raise several concerns about this conclusion. The investigators posited that a 20% improvement in adverse outcomes among the entire pregnancy cohort would be necessary to demonstrate an advantage to the 1-step approach and estimated the sample size based on that presumption, which we believe to be unlikely given the number of cases that would be identified. In addition, 27% of the women randomized to the 1-step protocol underwent 2-step testing; 6% of the study cohort had no testing at all. A subset of women assigned to 2-step testing did not meet the criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus but were treated as such because of elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, presumably contributing to the reduction in adverse outcomes but not to the number of gestational diabetes mellitus identified, increasing the apparent efficacy of the 2-step approach. No consideration was given to long-term benefits for mothers and offspring. All these factors may have contributed to obscuring the benefits of 1-step testing; most importantly, the study was not powered to identify what we understand to be the likely impact of 1-step testing on population health.

Subjects and methods

Subjects and study design

As previously described, obese subjects (n = 35) were recruited from the Chicago area based on the following inclusion criteria: female, age 25–65 years, body mass index between 30 and 39.9 kg m –2, weight for 3 months before the beginning of the study (that is, < 5 kg weight loss or gain), non-diabetic, no history of cardiovascular disease, sedentary or lightly active for 3 months before the beginning of the study (that is, < 3 h per week of light-intensity exercise at 2.5–4.0 metabolic equivalents), non-smoker, and not taking weight loss, lipid-lowering, or glucose-lowering medications. The experimental protocol was approved by the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects at the University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA, and all volunteers gave written informed consent. Eligible subjects were randomized by way of a stratified random sample based on body mass index (categories: 30–34.9 and 35–39.9 kg m –2) and age (categories: 25–44 and 45–65 years). These strata were counterbalanced between groups. Subjects from each stratum were then randomized to one of two intervention groups: (1) ADF-HF group (n = 17) or (2) ADF-LF group (n = 18). The 10-week trial consisted of two dietary phases: (1) a 2-week baseline weight maintenance period and (2) an 8-week weight loss ADF period.

### Nutrition and physical activity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^113gub4K]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Intermittent fasting protocols in obesity management — Intermittent fasting (IF) limits food intake on certain days and includes the 5:2 protocol with limited intake for two days and normal feeding for five days, the 2:1 protocol with one day limited followed by two days of normal meals, and the 1:1 protocol alternating between limited and full feeding in equal durations; time restricted feeding (TRF) limits eating to a fixed daily period. Potential advantages include reducing "decision fatigue", being quickly reversible, and possibly reducing body weight and improving metabolic parameters, while disadvantages include not emphasizing healthful meal quality, inappropriateness for patients with eating disorders, and risks with prolonged fasting such as gout, acute nephrolithiasis, postural hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Introduction: Recent RCTs revealed clinical benefit of early macronutrient restriction in critical illness, which may be explained by enhanced autophagy, an evolutionary conserved process for intracellular damage elimination [1]. However, in the absence of specific and safe autophagy-activating drugs, enhancing autophagy through prolonged starvation may produce harmful side effects. A fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) may activate autophagy while avoiding harm of prolonged starvation, which also improved biomarkers of age-related diseases in an experimental study [2]. We evaluated if short-term interruption of continuous feeding can induce a metabolic fasting response in prolonged critically ill patients.

Methods: In a randomized cross-over design, 70 prolonged critically ill patients receiving artificial feeding were randomized to be fasted for 12 hours, followed by 12 hours full enteral and/or parenteral feeding, or vice versa. Patients were included at day 8 in ICU and blood glucose was maintained in the normal range. At the start and after 12 and 24 hours, we quantified total bilirubin, urea, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOH) in arterial blood. Insulin requirements were extracted from patient files. Changes over time were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA after square root transformation.

Results: As compared to 12 hours of full feeding, 12 hours of fasting decreased bilirubin (-0.23 ± 0.06mg/dl; p = 0.001) and IGF-I (-13.94 ± 1.62ng/ml; p < 0.0001), and increased BOH (+0.47 ± 0.07mmol/l; p < 0.0001), without affecting urea concentrations (Fig 1). Fasting reduced insulin requirements (-1.16 ± 0.14IU/hour; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Short-term fasting induces a metabolic fasting response in prolonged critically ill patients, which provides perspectives for the design of a FMD, aimed at activating autophagy and ultimately at improving outcome of critically ill patients.

### A plasma glucose concentration below 2.5 mmol L-1 is not an appropriate criterion to end the 72-h fast [^115Rp8N6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Context

The classical end-point to terminate the 72-h fast in a patient evaluated for a hypoglycaemic disorder is the occurrence of hypoglycaemic symptoms in association with a low plasma glucose level. However, neither the symptoms nor the plasma glucose level have been exactly defined.

Objective

To determine whether a useful cut-off plasma glucose concentration as criterion to end the prolonged fast in the absence of neuroglycopenic symptoms can be defined.

Design

Single centre case-control study.

Setting

Tertiary referral hospital in Switzerland.

Subjects

The 72-h fast was prospectively performed in 23 consecutive patients (17 women and six men) following a standardized protocol between July 1999 and January 2002. All patients were referred to our clinic for evaluation of suspected hypoglycaemia. The criterion to end the fast before 72 h was defined by the occurrence of symptoms or signs typical for neuroglycopenia irrespective of plasma glucose levels.

Main Outcome Measure

Insulin levels and insulin to plasma glucose ratios in insulinoma patients and in individuals without insulin-secreting tumours at termination of the fast and at plasma glucose levels ≤ 2.5 mmol L-1, prior to the occurrence of neuroglycopenic symptoms.

Results

In seven patients, the fast was terminated before 72 h because they developed neuroglyco-penic symptoms. Insulin-secreting tumours were found and successfully removed in these seven patients. Sixteen individuals developed no neuroglycopenic symptoms throughout the 72-h fast and an insulin-secreting tumour could be excluded in these 16 patients. Five of these 16 individuals had plasma glucose levels ≤ 2.5 mmol L-1 during the 72-h fast. Insulin levels and insulin to glucose ratios in insulinoma patients and healthy individuals overlapped during as well as at termination of the fast. Prior to the occurrence of neuroglycopenic symptoms and at venous plasma glucose ≤ 2.5 mmol L-1, insulin to plasma glucose ratios dropped in insulinoma patients to values within the normal range on several occasions.

Conclusions

Terminating the fast at plasma glucose levels ≤ 2.5 mmol L-1 does not allow confirmation or exclusion of an insulin-secreting tumour. Thus, the occurrence of symptoms or signs typical for neuroglycopenia is the prerequisite criterion to end the fast before 72 h.

Religious and intermittent fasting — differences and similarities emphasize that risk assessment and education is essential pre fasting and that treatment adjustment is required. Religious fasting is described as having fixed duration and timing and high levels of intrinsic motivation, with risk of hyperglycemia at end of fasting hours with or without ketoacidosis and dehydration is possible in some types. Intermittent fasting is characterized by flexible duration and timing and varying levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, with hyperglycemia is unlikely as motive is health related and no added risk of dehydration.

### How to use a controlled fast to investigate hypoglycaemia [^114SogeN]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Controlled fasts can play a valuable role in the diagnosis and management of hypoglycaemia in paediatric clinical practice, but are no substitute for the collecting of appropriate critical samples at the time of hypoglycaemia for metabolic and endocrine studies. Fatty acid oxidation defects, hyperinsulinism and adrenal insufficiency should always be excluded prior to organising controlled fasts. Controlled fasts are safe if conducted in an experienced setting with strict protocols in place. Failure to adhere to protocol can defeat the purpose of the study and can potentially be dangerous. Proper planning in conjunction with the laboratory and close supervision by staff experienced in controlled fasts is crucial to ensure the best quality information is yielded from these procedures.

### The management of insulinoma [^112NEM5N]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare tumours. Their clinical presentation, localization techniques and operative management were reviewed.

Methods

An electronic search of the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases was undertaken for articles published between January 1966 and June 2005 on the history, presentation, clinical evaluation, use of imaging techniques for tumour localization and operative management of insulinoma.

Results and Conclusion

Most insulinomas are intrapancreatic, benign and solitary. Biochemical diagnosis is obtained during a supervised 72-h fast. Non-invasive preoperative imaging techniques to localize lesions continue to evolve. Intraoperative ultrasonography can be combined with other preoperative imaging modalities to improve tumour detection. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice. In the absence of preoperative localization and intraoperative detection of an insulinoma, blind pancreatic resection is not recommended.

### Fasting is not routinely required for determination of a lipid profile: clinical and laboratory implications including flagging at desirable concentration cut-points-a joint consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society and European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine [^111GpKdr]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Arguments against the use of non-fasting samples also merit consideration. There is evidence that the non-fasting condition may marginally lower plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations owing to liberal intake of fluids (Table 3), and therefore lead to a potential minor misclassification of cardiovascular risk, as well as to error in initiating or altering lipid-lowering medication; although not all studies agree, this risk is small and may chiefly apply to diabetic subjects. While a non-fasting sample is sufficient to diagnose an isolated hypercholesterolaemia, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia, or elevated Lp(a), it can possibly confuse the distinction between familial hypercholesterolaemia and genetic forms of high triglycerides. Since non-fasting may therefore impair the accuracy in diagnosing some forms of hyperlipidaemia, we recommend that laboratories should also offer measurement of fasting triglycerides according to clinical context and indications, as in the case of very high non-fasting triglyceride concentration. Plasma lipids can be highly variable in children and a precise diagnosis of a lipid disorder that requires drug therapy may necessitate at least a second sample in the fasting state. From an evidence-based perspective, fasting and non-fasting samples have never been tested head-to-head in a clinical trial to assess how the corresponding lipid profiles alter clinical management and the disposition of patients, and what the relative cost-effectiveness of both approaches is. It is most unlikely that such a study will ever be funded, however.

What pragmatic recommendations can be made? First, non-fasting and fasting measurements of the lipid profile must be viewed as complementary and not mutually exclusive (Table 4). Common sense must prevail and a distinction made between their use in screening, assessment, and diagnosis. Fasting is less critical for first-stage screening, but may be more important when trying to establish a phenotypic diagnosis of genetically determined dyslipidaemias. Further, one circumstance where fasting may be especially value is getting a baseline lipid determination for those about to start medications that cause severe hypertriglyceridaemia in a genetically predisposed individual. Noting that fasting triglycerides are elevated can thus be useful before, e.g. steroid, oestrogen, or retinoid acid therapy. Also, fasting lipids have been used to follow the course of those recovering from hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis. Nevertheless, non-fasting blood samples can routinely be used for assessment of plasma lipid profiles in most situations (Table 4).

### A test in context: lipid profile, fasting Versus nonfasting [^1131QLqT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Fasting for > 8 h, as previously required for lipid profiles, normally only occurs a few hours before breakfast. By contrast, the nonfasting state predominates most of a 24-h cycle and better captures atherogenic lipoprotein levels. Plasma contains atherogenic lipoproteins of hepatic origin in the fasting state and additionally those of intestinal origin in the nonfasting state. Maximal mean changes for random, nonfasting versus fasting levels are +26 mg/dl for triglycerides, -8 mg/dl for total cholesterol, -8 mg/dl for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +8 mg/dl for remnant cholesterol, and -8 mg/dl for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are largely unaffected. For patients, laboratories, and clinicians alike, nonfasting lipid profiles represent a simplification without negative implications for prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic options for cardiovascular disease prevention. Several societies' guidelines and statements in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, Brazil, and the United States endorse nonfasting lipid profiles.

### Is fasting necessary for elective cerebral angiography? [^114t2Ubh]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In order to prevent unexpected events such as aspiration pneumonia, cerebral angiography has been performed under fasting in most cases. We investigated prospectively the necessity of fasting before elective cerebral angiography.

Materials and Methods

The study is an open-labeled clinical trial without random allocation. In total, 2554 patients who underwent elective cerebral angiography were evaluated on development of nausea, vomiting, and pulmonary aspiration during and after angiography. Potential risks and benefits associated with fasting were provided in written documents and through personal counseling to patients before the procedure. The patients chose their fasting or nonfasting option. No restriction in diet was given after angiography. The patients were observed for 24 hours. Nausea and vomiting during and within 1 hour after angiography was considered as a positive event associated with cerebral angiography.

Results

The overall incidence of nausea and vomiting during and within 1 hour after angiography was 1.05% (27/2554 patients). There was no patient with pulmonary aspiration. No statistical difference in nausea and vomiting development between the fasting and the diet groups was found.

Conclusions

The incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with cerebral angiography is low and not affected by diet or fasting. Pulmonary aspiration had no difference between the diet and the fasting group. Our study suggests that fasting may not be necessary for patients who undergo elective cerebral angiography.

### International consensus on fasting terminology [^111KJded]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Total/complete fasting

A total/complete fast was ultimately decided to refer only to those fasting regimens "where no calories are consumed for a certain period of time". Participants concluded that total/complete fasts may be equated with water-only fasting but not with dry fasting.

FMD

In the consensus conference, it was initially decided that the fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) should be categorized as a modified fasting regimen. Ultimately, FMDs were instead classified under "specific fasting regimens" for the following reasons: it was agreed to set the threshold for maximum caloric intake on modified fasting days at up to 25% of energy requirements, and FMDs may allow an intake of ≥ 50% (≥ 1,000 kcal) of energy needs on some "fasting" days. If the caloric threshold for modified fasting was set at such a high value, the definition of modified fasting would have been similar to the definition of caloric restriction.

IF regimens

IF, TRE, and intermittent energy restriction (IER) were the most discussed terms in this category.

### INTERmittent FASTing in people with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus-the INTERFAST-2 study protocol [^116sEKJ3]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Intermittent fasting, a dietary intervention of alternate eating and fasting, has gained popularity in people trying to lose weight. Intermittent fasting could provide an alternative to classic caloric restriction in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the study is to determine the impact of a 12-week intermittent fasting regimen compared with usual care in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving insulin therapy.

Methods

This open, single-centre, randomized controlled trial investigates participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy and a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≥ 53 mmol/mol (≥ 7.0%) and a minimum insulin dose of 0.3 IU/kg body weight per day. Participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 12 weeks of intermittent fasting or the standard care group. All participants receive dietary counselling, continuous glucose monitoring, measurement of the resting metabolic rate, an oral glucose tolerance test, body composition measurement via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and stool samples for microbiome analyses at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Two co-primary outcomes (analysed in hierarchical order) were chosen for the study: (i) the difference in the change of HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks and (ii) the difference in the number of participants achieving a combined end point encompassing a body weight reduction of at least 2%, an insulin dose reduction of at least 10% and an absolute HbA1c reduction of at least 3 mmol/mol (0.3%) between the two groups.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1149LJCZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — combination antiviral therapy with steroids (Statement 5B) may be offered within 72 hours of symptom onset as an option for patients with Bell's palsy, with aggregate evidence quality Grade B, a small potential improvement in facial nerve function, treatment side effects and cost as risks, and an equilibrium of benefit and harm; exceptions include diabetes, morbid obesity, previous steroid intolerance, and individualized management in pregnancy. Trial data include 221 patients showing higher full facial nerve recovery at 6 months with valacyclovir plus prednisolone versus placebo plus prednisolone (96.5% vs 89.7%); a meta-analysis of 18 trials found a 25% reduced risk of incomplete nerve recovery with combination therapy versus steroids alone (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–1.00), with an estimate that 26 patients would require treatment to achieve 1 better facial nerve outcome than with steroid therapy alone, and an additional large trial of 829 patients within 72 hours of onset has been published. Due to the potential of a small benefit and relatively low risk, the guideline development group concluded that patients may be offered combination therapy if treated within 72 hours of onset of Bell's palsy, with a large role for shared decision making.

Exploring the mechanism behind IF

TRE practices are increasing in popularity in the general population, with recent evidence supporting their use for diabetes and weight management in clinical populations under medical guidance. These regimes have been shown to be well-tolerated, and lead to an average of 20% unintentional reduction in caloric intake. It has been suggested that TRE may have additional benefits beyond calorie restriction, with several studies showing that these dietary patterns can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers such as systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, fat mass and triglycerides, even in eucaloric conditions.

There are three main theories that have been suggested to explain this metabolic effect; (i) the Ketosis theory, (ii) oxidative stress hypothesis and (iii) the circadian rhythm hypothesis. The 'Ketosis theory' has the greatest traction both in mainstream and scientific communities. The theory postulates that IF leads to a reduction of total calorie intake, causing a metabolic shift which results in greater fat metabolism and reduced fat storage(figure 1). Studies on IF have also been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease levels of low-density lipoproteins.

An overview of current theories on how intermittent fasting may impact health or performance.

The longer-term benefits of IF have also been attributed to reduced systemic inflammation (oxidative stress theory). This theory suggests the decreased energy intake and production of reactive oxidative species by the mitochondria results in a diminished cellular inflammatory process. There are also additional circadian benefits on the timing of food intake, as the performance and function of key physiological processes (food absorption and metabolism) vary in keeping with our internal 24-hour circadian rhythm. These processes are highly sensitive to the time-of-day impact at both a central and peripheral cellular level and require distinct periods of fasting for optimal physiological function (circadian rhythm hypothesis). IF has been shown to increase the expression of a circadian rhythm regulating gene, NR1D1, which lowers fat accumulation in the liver and adipose tissues, as well as reducing inflammation and decreasing susceptibility to metabolic syndrome.

Understanding these circadian effects in detail will provide us with practical recommendations of how best to implement IF. This may involve matching caloric intake to diurnal patterns of hormone secretion (eg, insulin secretion or sensitivity), or times of day when gut motility and absorption are optimised, or when higher proportions of energy are produced by carbohydrate metabolism. A practical example of this is abstaining from night-time eating, which decreases post-prandial glucose levels, increases insulin sensitivity and reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

ABM Clinical Protocol #25 — excessive fasting times: It is suggested that NPO guidelines are excessive and that the time from the last meal to the time of the procedures exceeds the amount of time required by fasting guidelines. Fasting children 2–16 years old report significant hunger and thirst, yet no studies have addressed excessive fasting in breastfeeding infants. In newborn infants, a fasting period of longer than 4 hours can be detrimental, and more evidence is needed regarding actual fasting times in breastfeeding infants.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease — risk stratification and rationale for prophylaxis emphasize epidemiology and attachment duration: in endemic regions "nymphal I. scapularis infection prevalence exceeds 20%", whereas I. pacificus infection prevalence "often is < 20%", though some areas have " > 20%" prevalence. Transmission risk rises with attachment time, with "the majority of transmission" occurring after "36–48 hours", a "positive association between duration of tick attachment (over vs under 72 hours)" and outcomes, and risk that "may exceed 20%" when attached for " ≥ 72 hours". A meta-analysis showed that giving prophylactic antibiotics "within 72 hours" reduced subsequent Lyme disease "from 2.2% to 0.2%". Lower-risk exposures include " < 36 hours" attachment or low-incidence regions, where absolute risk and benefit of prophylaxis decrease. Counseling remains important: "clinicians should counsel patients" and "prophylaxis with doxycycline does not guarantee infection avoidance", and "we advise pregnant women to have an informed discussion" about antibiotics versus observation.

### Quadrupling inhaled glucocorticoid dose to abort asthma exacerbations [^114PTkAs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study FAST was published by McKeever T and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Severe asthma phenotypes and Asthma. In the FAST study, the trial question was: what is the effect of temporary quadrupling of the dose of ICSs in patients who had a severe asthma exacerbation? In the FAST study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FAST study, the population was: 1922 patients (1305 female, 617 male). The inclusion criteria were adult and adolescent patients with asthma who were receiving ICSs, with or without add-on therapy, and who had at least one exacerbation in the previous 12 months. The key exclusion criteria were history of smoking related to COPD, on maintenance oral corticosteroids, use of a corticosteroid/long-acting bronchodilator combination inhaler for both maintenance and relief treatment, an exacerbation within four weeks of randomization, pregnancy. In the FAST study, the interventions were: n = 957 quadrupling (increased bronchodilator medication and an increase in the dose of ICSs by a factor of 4) n = 965 non-quadrupling (increased bronchodilator medication alone). In the FAST study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of severe exacerbation of asthma in the year after randomization (45% vs. 52%;). In the FAST study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in use of systemic corticosteroids (33% vs. 40%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.96) Significant decrease in unscheduled healthcare consultation (41% vs. 47%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99) Significant increase in mean AUC of the peak flow (1166 L/min/day vs. 1130 L/min/day; AD 38 L/min/day, 95% CI 13 to 62). In the FAST study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection. significant difference in serious adverse events (2% vs. 4%) and nonserious adverse events (7% vs. 2%). In the FAST study, the conclusion was: in adult and adolescent patients with asthma who were receiving ICSs, with or without add-on therapy, and who had at least one exacerbation in the previous 12 months, quadrupling was superior to non-quadrupling with respect to the rate of severe exacerbation of asthma in the year after randomization.

Infant comfort and prolonged fasting times are highlighted: when an infant is not required to fast, breastfeeding can provide comfort during a painful procedure, whereas inability to access the breast for 4 hours may lead to separation anxiety, hunger, and crying; extensive crying in full-term healthy neonates causes oxygen desaturation, which can occasionally lead to cyanosis and bradycardia, and non‑nutritive sucking on a pacifier can reduce crying; fasting times are often prolonged beyond recommendations, including a study of 1,250 healthy children 2–16 years old in which children were fasting 12 hours from solids instead of 6–8 hours and fasting from fluids for 7 hours instead of 2–4 hours, and fasting times for newborn breastfeeding infants may also exceed the recommended 4-hour period causing unnecessary hypoglycemia, discomfort, and anxiety.

### Fasting is not routinely required for determination of a lipid profile: clinical and laboratory implications including flagging at desirable concentration cut-points-a joint consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society and European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine [^112XfnL8]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Influence of food intake on the prediction of cardiovascular risk

We exist mostly in the non-fasting state, which therefore reflects our habitual physiological status. However, blood samples typically measured after an 8–12 h fast have been the standard for assessing the plasma lipid profile. Postprandial effects do not appear to diminish, and may in fact enhance, the strength of the associations between plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentrations and risk of cardiovascular disease.

Since the 1970s, numerous reports from well-conducted, large, representative, and mostly prospective studies with medium- to long-term follow-up have consistently found that non-fasting lipids suffice for screening of cardiovascular disease risk. These studies have examined clinical outcomes ranging from incident cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization) to cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, with consistent associations for non-fasting lipid profiles with cardiovascular disease risk. Furthermore, studies that included fasting and/or non-fasting individuals have found generally similar or sometimes superior cardiovascular disease risk associations for non-fasting compared with fasting lipid profiles, including for triglycerides;, the challenge of taking small amounts of alcohol during non-fasting hours of the day and its influence on lipid profile values has often not been studied. Prospective studies that have assessed non-fasting lipid profiles are shown in Table 2.

A meta-analysis from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration that analysed the association of lipid profiles and risk of coronary heart disease events from 68 prospective studies, and included over 300 000 individuals, equally found no attenuation of the strength of the association between plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and incident cardiovascular events in the 20 studies that used non-fasting blood samples; indeed, non-fasting non-HDL cholesterol and non-fasting calculated LDL cholesterol were superior to fasting measurements for predicting cardiovascular risk (n = 103 354; number of events 3829). Furthermore, at least three large clinical trials of statin therapy (Heart Protection Study, Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial — Lipid Lowering Arm, and the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine) involving nearly 43 000 participants used non-fasting lipid profile measurements (Table 2).

### Early enteral nutrition (within 48 hours) versus delayed enteral nutrition (after 48 hours) with or without supplemental parenteral nutrition in critically ill adults [^113PNvtu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Early enteral nutrition support (within 48 hours of admission or injury) is frequently recommended for the management of patients in intensive care units (ICU). Early enteral nutrition is recommended in many clinical practice guidelines, although there appears to be a lack of evidence for its use and benefit.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early enteral nutrition (initiated within 48 hours of initial injury or ICU admission) versus delayed enteral nutrition (initiated later than 48 hours after initial injury or ICU admission), with or without supplemental parenteral nutrition, in critically ill adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to April 2019), Embase Ovid SP (1974 to April 2019), CINAHL EBSCO (1982 to April 2019), and ISI Web of Science (1945 to April 2019). We also searched Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP), trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry), and scientific conference reports, including the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. We applied no restrictions by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared early versus delayed enteral nutrition, with or without supplemental parenteral nutrition, in adults who were in the ICU for longer than 72 hours. This included individuals admitted for medical, surgical, and trauma diagnoses, and who required any type of enteral nutrition.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted study data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We expressed results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, and as mean differences (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 345 participants. Outcome data were limited, and we judged many trials to have an unclear risk of bias in several domains. Early versus delayed enteral nutrition Six trials (318 participants) assessed early versus delayed enteral nutrition in general, medical, and trauma ICUs in the United States, Australia, Greece, India, and Russia. Primary outcomes Five studies (259 participants) measured mortality. It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects the risk of mortality within 30 days (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.38; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-quality evidence). Four studies (221 participants) reported mortality without describing the timeframe; we did not pool these results. None of the studies reported a clear difference in mortality between groups. Three studies (156 participants) reported infectious complications. We were unable to pool the results due to unreported data and substantial clinical heterogeneity. The results were inconsistent across studies. One trial measured feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications; it is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects this outcome (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01; 59 participants; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes One trial assessed hospital length of stay and reported a longer stay in the early enteral group (median 15 days (interquartile range (IQR) 9.5 to 20) versus 12 days (IQR 7.5 to15); P = 0.05; 59 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three studies (125 participants) reported the duration of mechanical ventilation. We did not pool the results due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. The results were inconsistent across studies. It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition affects the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.06; 4 studies, 192 participants; very low-quality evidence). Early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition versus delayed enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition We identified one trial in a burn ICU in the United States (27 participants). Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition affects the risk of mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.18; very low-quality evidence), or infectious complications (MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.94; very low-quality evidence). There were no data available for feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications. Secondary outcomes It is uncertain whether early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 9.00, 95% CI -10.99 to 28.99; very low-quality evidence). There were no data available for hospital length of stay or pneumonia.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether early enteral nutrition, compared with delayed enteral nutrition, affects the risk of mortality within 30 days, feed intolerance or gastrointestinal complications, or pneumonia. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain if early enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition compared with delayed enteral nutrition with supplemental parenteral nutrition reduces mortality, infectious complications, or duration of mechanical ventilation. There is currently insufficient evidence; there is a need for large, multicentred studies with rigorous methodology, which measure important clinical outcomes.

The overall outcome of the primary aim: random-effects model meta-analysis while fasting and 2, 3, and 4 hours after eating

Forest plots of postprandial FMD changes from fasting to 2, 3, and 4 hours after eating are presented in Figure 3. The mean postprandial FMD changes from fasting were −1.02 pp (95% CI: −1.34 to −0.70 pp; P < 0.01) at 2 hours, −1.04 pp (95% CI: −1.48 to −0.59 pp; P < 0.001) at 3 hours, and −1.19 pp (95% CI: −1.53 to −0.84 pp; P < 0.01) at 4 hours. The mean fasting FMD% effect size was 6.31% (95% CI: 5.89%–6.72%; P < 0.01); the forest plot for fasting FMD% values is depicted in Supplemental Figure 1. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was high at 2 hours (I 2, 93.3%; 95% CI: 93%–94%), 3 hours (I 2, 84.5%; 95% CI: 74%–85%), and 4 hours (I 2, 94.6%; 95% CI: 90%–95%) after eating and while fasting (I 2, 97.8%; 95% CI: 97%–98%).

Suggested areas for further research — HBM composition and timing: The page states, "There is insufficient evidence to determine if the variable consistency and components of HBM… alter gastric emptying times". It notes conflicting findings: "Although studies have shown that it is safe to provide HBM up to 2 hours prior to a procedure, others report that the gastric emptying time can match that of 3% fat milk". Pending clarity, "In general it is safer to recommend that an infant not be fed HBM within 4 hours of sedation or anesthesia because it is undetermined if breastmilk will clear faster than this time period".

### Potential benefits of hybrid closed-loop systems for managing moderate-to high-risk individuals with type 1 diabetes during ramadan fasting [^111WfFGd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations. First, we did not measure formal quality‐of‐life or psychosocial indicators, though other investigations suggest that HCL use generally confers benefits in these domains. Second, this was a real‐world study without laboratory‐based HbA1c evaluations, but numerous trials have demonstrated strong consistency between CGM‐based metrics and lab measures. Although the design does not fully isolate the effect of HCL from potential confounders, the consistency of our findings with previously reported benefits of HCL in both randomized and observational studies strengthens the clinical relevance of our results. Nevertheless, we also acknowledge the absence of randomization or a cross‐over design. While the results favour HCL, causal inference is limited. The HCL group had significantly lower HbA1c, was younger and experienced fewer hypoglycaemic episodes at baseline, suggesting they may have already been better controlled or more engaged in diabetes management. Third, our MDI + CGM group tended to be modestly older than HCL users, an inherent demographic difference in real‐world settings that was not fully controllable. Nonetheless, our multicentre real‐world approach and relatively large high‐risk sample for a Ramadan study strengthens the generalizability of our results. Lastly, all CGM metrics were extracted from different CGM platforms and, hence, limit the validity of comparisons.

In summary, for moderate‐ to high‐risk T1D adults, HCL systems appear to markedly improve both the safety and effectiveness of extended daytime fasting during Ramadan. By extending time‐in‐range, reducing hypoglycaemia and enabling completion of more fasting days, HCL users surpassed MDI + CGM users in a composite endpoint encompassing fasting duration and glycaemic goals. These data align with emerging literature advocating more flexible, technology‐driven approaches for Ramadan. We propose that current "no fasting" guidance for high‐risk T1D populations may need to be revisited, acknowledging the real‐world benefits of advanced systems. These findings may have broader applicability beyond Ramadan, including other religious fasts and intermittent fasting practices. HCL systems offer allows for automated basal insulin delivery adjustments helping to mitigate hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability. Their use can support user autonomy in adjusting meal timing without compromising glycaemic control and therefore achieve safe fasting across diverse cultural and clinical contexts. To conclude, for moderate‐ to high‐risk T1D adults, HCL systems are associated with improvements in safety and effectiveness of extended daytime fasting during Ramadan.

### Fasting is not routinely required for determination of a lipid profile: clinical and laboratory implications including flagging at desirable concentration cut-points-a joint consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society and European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine [^113eEkwp]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most individuals consume several meals during the day and some consume snacks between meals; the postprandial state therefore predominates over a 24 h period. Nonetheless, in clinical practice, the lipid profile is conventionally measured in blood plasma or serum obtained after fasting for at least 8 h, and therefore may not reflect the daily average plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and associated risk of cardiovascular disease.

Interestingly, evidence is lacking that fasting is superior to non-fasting when evaluating the lipid profile for cardiovascular risk assessment. However, there are advantages to using non-fasting samples rather than fasting samples for measuring the lipid profile. Since 2009, non-fasting lipid testing has become the clinical standard in Denmark, based on recommendations from the Danish Society for Clinical Biochemistry that all laboratories in Denmark use random non-fasting lipid profiles as the standard, while offering clinicians the option of re-measuring triglyceride concentrations in the fasting state if non-fasting values are > 4 mmol/L (350 mg/dL). Furthermore, the UK NICE guidelines have endorsed non-fasting lipid testing in the primary prevention setting since 2014.

The most obvious advantage of non-fasting rather than fasting lipid measurements is that it simplifies blood sampling for patients, laboratories, general practitioners, and hospital clinicians and is also likely to improve patient compliance with lipid testing. Indeed, patients are often inconvenienced by having to return on a separate visit for a fasting lipid profile and may default on essential testing. Also, laboratories are burdened by a large volume of patients attending for tests in the morning. Finally, clinicians are burdened by having to review and make decisions on the findings in the lipid profile at a later date. This situation may also require an additional phone call, email, or even a follow-up clinic visit, placing extra workloads on busy clinical staff.

Perceived limitations to adopting non-fasting lipid measurements include the following: (i) fasting before a lipid profile measurement is believed to provide more standardized measurements; (ii) non-fasting lipid profiles are perceived as providing less accurate measurements and may make calculation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol via the Friedewald equation invalid; (iii) as fasting has been the clinical standard, it is unclear what values should be flagged as abnormal when using non-fasting rather than fasting plasma lipid profiles. These perceived limitations will be addressed in this paper.

Table 5.5 — changes in medications during fasting specify the following: For metformin, SGLT2 inhibitor, DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, acarbose, or pioglitazone (low risk of hypoglycemia), if once daily then take at main mealtime, if twice daily then split dose between the two meals, if once weekly no change of time, and total daily dose is no change. For new generation sulfonylurea (glimepiride and gliclazide; low to moderate risk), if once daily then take at main mealtime and if twice daily then split dose between the two meals, with total daily dose reduced if glucose levels are within individualized goal range and if no hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia is present at baseline. For older generation sulfonylurea (glyburide; moderate to high risk), take at time of main meal and replace with newer-generation sulfonylurea or reduce dose by 50%. For prandial insulin (high risk), take at mealtime and reduce dose of insulin for the meal followed by fasting (35–50%); for other meals, insulin dose should match carbohydrate intake. For mixed insulin and insulin coformulations (high risk), if once daily then take at main mealtime and if twice daily then split dose between the two meals, and reduce dose of insulin for the meal followed by fasting (35–50%); for other meals, no change of dose.

### Patient information: intermittent fasting… [^116sfPTz]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Intermittent fasting involves intervals of limiting food intake for extended periods of time. This dietary approach may be used for attempts at weight loss, for other health objectives, or as part of some religious practices. Popular intermittent fasting diets involve daily time-restricted feeding or intermittent full-day fasting on 2 to 4 days per week. Some regimens allow very low calorie intake on a fasting day. What Happens to the Human Body During Periods of Intermittent Fasting. After an 8- to 12-hour period of fasting, the liver starts to break down fatty acids to produce ketone bodies. The human body uses ketone bodies as an alternate source of fuel to sustain vital organs and tissues when the typical source is not available.

Studies have shown that intermittent fasting decreases blood inflammatory markers and improves glucose regulation. Does Intermittent Fasting Help People Lose Weight. Studies lasting between 12 weeks and 12 months have shown no difference in weight loss when intermittent fasting is compared with a daily calorie-restricted diet. However, between 27% and 40% of these study participants dropped out of intermittent fasting, demonstrating the challenge of adherence to intermittent fasting diets. Does Intermittent Fasting Improve Health. Intermittent fasting has been shown to result in decreases in blood pressure, resting heart rate, cholesterol and triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. While these improvements in cardiovascular risk factors typically begin within 2 to 4 weeks of starting an intermittent fasting diet, they dissipate within several weeks of resuming a normal diet.

Intermittent fasting may be dangerous for patients with diabetes due to the increased likelihood of hypoglycemia. Patients with diabetes or other health conditions who are considering trying an intermittent fasting diet should discuss the potential benefits and risks with their doctor before starting.
