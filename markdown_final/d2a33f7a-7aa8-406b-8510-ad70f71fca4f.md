## Question

what age does periods usually stop

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the usual age when periods stop and how menopause is defined and staged. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of menopause. Then, I should verify the average and typical age range for natural menopause. Next, I will review how the menopausal transition is staged and how irregular cycles evolve. After that, I need to check the prevalence and implications of early and premature menopause. Finally, I will synthesize a concise answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it: menopause is not a single-day diagnosis but a retrospective designation made after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea without another cause. Until that 12-month mark, a woman is considered perimenopausal, not postmenopausal, and hormone testing is not required to make the diagnosis in women with a uterus.

> I should double-check the average age. Multiple high-quality sources converge on a median age of natural menopause around 51 years, with a commonly cited figure of 51.3 years in the United States and 51.4 years in high-income countries. This aligns with guideline statements and large epidemiologic summaries, so I can confidently anchor the average at approximately 51 years [^115L7xX8] [^117Pk8X3].

> Wait, let me verify the typical range so I don't overgeneralize. Natural menopause most often occurs between the late 40s and early 50s, with a commonly cited interval of 49–52 years. Broader clinical ranges describe natural menopause between about 42–58 years, which captures most but not all physiologic variation across populations and individuals [^117Pk8X3] [^113qHJwk].

> Next, I should review how the transition unfolds. The perimenopausal period typically lasts 2–8 years and is characterized by increasing cycle irregularity, skipped periods, and rising follicle-stimulating hormone, with the late transition often marked by cycles of 60 or more days. STRAW+10 provides standardized bleeding criteria to stage the early and late transition and early postmenopause, which helps frame expectations for patients and clinicians [^112N8ns5] [^116xD4wk] [^113gcCPQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the boundaries for early and premature menopause because patients often ask about these. Early menopause is cessation of menses between ages 40 and 45 and occurs in roughly 5–8% of women, whereas premature menopause or primary ovarian insufficiency before age 40 affects about 1–2%. Both are associated with higher risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, and management often includes hormone therapy through the average age of natural menopause when not contraindicated [^117Pk8X3] [^1165eqt2] [^114TFAjK].

> Let me consider ethnic and geographic variation briefly so I don't imply uniformity. Mean age at menopause is slightly younger in some Asian cohorts, for example around 48 years in Chinese women, reinforcing that while 50–51 is typical globally, population averages can differ by a few years and should be interpreted in context [^111qptKg].

> I need to ensure I'm not overpromising precision. Age remains the strongest predictor of menopause timing, but individual variation is substantial; biomarkers like AMH, inhibin B, and FSH can hint at ovarian reserve but do not reliably predict the exact timing of the final menstrual period, so counseling should emphasize ranges and the retrospective nature of diagnosis rather than a fixed age [^114eLRQR] [^115L7xX8].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: periods usually stop at a median age of about 51 years, with a typical range of 49–52 years and a broader physiologic span of roughly 42–58 years. The diagnosis of menopause is made retrospectively after 12 months of no bleeding, and the preceding transition commonly lasts several years with increasing irregularity before final cessation [^115L7xX8] [^117Pk8X3] [^113qHJwk] [^112N8ns5].

Periods typically stop at a median age of **51.3 years** [^115L7xX8], with a normal range of 45–55 years [^112EForY]. Menopause is defined as **12 consecutive months without menstruation**, and the transition often lasts 2–8 years with irregular cycles and symptoms such as hot flashes and mood changes [^112N8ns5]. Early menopause (40–45 years) occurs in about 5% of women, and premature menopause (< 40 years) in about 1% [^117Pk8X3]; risk factors include smoking, genetics, and certain medical treatments [^114We16w] [^114kU4Qa]. After 12 months of amenorrhea, a woman is considered postmenopausal and no longer fertile.

## Average age of menopause

The **median age** is 51.3 years in the United States [^115L7xX8], and the **typical range** is 45–55 years [^112EForY].

---

## Definition of menopause

Menopause is the **permanent cessation of menstruation**, diagnosed retrospectively after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea without other causes [^1138Y254] [^116fv8Zt].

---

## Perimenopause: the transition period

Perimenopause is the transition leading to menopause, characterized by **hormonal fluctuations and irregular cycles** [^113db1pe]. Duration is typically 2–8 years, and symptoms include irregular periods, hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, and sleep disturbances [^112N8ns5] [^114rCr4C] [^113zmywG].

## Factors influencing age at menopause

Several factors influence the **age at menopause**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on age at menopause** |
|-|-|
| Smoking | Earlier menopause |
| Genetics | Family history of early menopause increases risk |
| Medical treatments | Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery can induce earlier menopause [^114kU4Qa] [^114rCr4C] |
| Lifestyle factors | Diet, physical activity, socioeconomic status may influence timing [^notfound] |

---

## Early and premature menopause

Early menopause occurs at **40–45 years** in about 5% of women [^117Pk8X3], and premature menopause occurs before 40 years in about 1% [^114kU4Qa]. Associated risks include increased risks of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and cognitive decline [^notfound].

---

## Postmenopause

Postmenopause begins after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea; **ovarian hormone production ceases**, and menstruation permanently stops [^1138Y254] [^116fv8Zt].

---

## Clinical implications

Clinical implications include **increased risks** of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic changes after menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Management may involve hormone therapy, lifestyle modifications, and regular health screenings [^112EForY] [^115SF8aJ].

---

Periods typically stop at a median age of 51.3 years, with a normal range of 45–55 years. Menopause is defined as 12 consecutive months without menstruation, and the transition period can last several years with irregular cycles and symptoms.

### A social media survey of US adolescent preferences for menstrual bleeding patterns [^115GbMzD]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To assess preferences for menstrual pattern and acceptability and knowledge about the safety of induced amenorrhea among adolescents and young adults METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of US residents aged 14–24 years at least 1 year post-menarche. Online recruitment was conducted via the social media platform TikTok on a teen reproductive health channel. Survey questions focused on menstrual history, menstrual pattern preferences, and demographic characteristics. The primary outcome was the proportion of postmenstrual individuals who would prefer amenorrhea vs scheduled bleeding.

Results

From 5113 potential respondents who accessed the eligibility screening, 3001 completed surveys and met the inclusion criteria. Most were aged 14–18 (63.7%), distributed proportionally among all US Census regions. When asked if they could pick their period-bleeding style without any permanent impacts, almost three-quarters chose no bleeding at all (amenorrhea; 71.5%) compared with scheduled periods (28.5%). However, 63.7% agreed or were uncertain when faced with the statement "It might be unsafe if hormone medications stop your period bleeding". After adjusting for age, gender expression, race, religion, heavy bleeding, and frequent bleeding, factors associated with preference for amenorrhea vs regular bleeding were younger age, masculine gender expression, White race, and non-Christian religious background. Baseline bleeding amount and frequency were not associated with preference for amenorrhea.

Conclusion

More than two-thirds of US adolescents and young adults indicated a preference for medication-induced amenorrhea if the method was assured to not have any permanent effects on the body, despite highly prevalent misconceptions about health and safety.

### Menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause is an inevitable component of ageing and encompasses the loss of ovarian reproductive function, either occurring spontaneously or secondary to other conditions. It is not yet possible to accurately predict the onset of menopause, especially early menopause, to give women improved control of their fertility. The decline in ovarian oestrogen production at menopause can cause physical symptoms that may be debilitating, including hot flushes and night sweats, urogenital atrophy, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, bone loss, and metabolic changes that predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The individual experience of the menopause transition varies widely. Important influential factors include the age at which menopause occurs, personal health and wellbeing, and each woman's environment and culture. Management options range from lifestyle assessment and intervention through to hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy, each of which has specific benefits and risks. Decisions about therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women depend on symptomatology, health status, immediate and long-term health risks, personal life expectations, and the availability and cost of therapies. More effective and safe therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms need to be developed, particularly for women who have absolute contraindications to hormone therapy.

### Menstruation: science and society [^112tJMQN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Earlier than 2004–2005

Before 2005, multiple efforts were underway exploring or addressing menstruation within global health. The population of interest included adult women of reproductive age, and in high-income countries, an interest in the declining age of menarche among girls. Interventions addressing adult women's menstruation-related needs were primarily within the clinical realm, such as a focus on reproductive health and disorders, and the promotion of family planning. Although the latter did not address menstruation as a life course issue, there was attention to the challenges of unscheduled, breakthrough bleeding among other contributors to contraceptive discontinuation. There also existed a rich literature on menstruation within the social sciences, primarily derived from anthropologists documenting menstrual traditions and rituals, and its relationship to girls' and women's roles within society. In the 1980s and 1990s, in high-income countries in particular, researchers explored girls' maturation experiences, examining the psychological effects of menarche, and the associations of early menarche with girls' engagement in risky behaviors, such as increased vulnerability to early sexual initiation, depression, and substance use. Overall, the focus in high-income countries remained on the individual and the clinical aspects of menstruation.

In contrast, in low- and middle-income countries, there began to emerge a public health lens on menstruation. Alongside the family planning agenda, there were burgeoning efforts within the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) field to address menstruation as a challenge faced by girls in school. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) hosted a roundtable event in Oxford aimed at bringing attention to "menstrual hygiene management" (MHM), a newly coined concept focused on addressing menstrual management within WASH, and the Rockefeller Foundation supported a series of case studies on sexual maturation in schools in Africa. In humanitarian contexts, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recognized the provision of sanitary pads to refugees as part of one of its core mandates, providing important recognition of menstruation as a key response aspect.

### Can we predict menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency? [^114eLRQR]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

The prediction of menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves understanding the factors that contribute to the timing of these events. Menopause is a natural biological process marked by the cessation of menstrual periods, typically occurring around the age of 51. On the other hand, POI refers to the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40. Several factors have been used to predict menopause and POI such as age, antimüllerian hormone, inhibins and follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels, antral follicle counts, menstrual cycle length, and, recently, some genetic markers. It seems that age has the best predictive power and all the other ones are only adding in a very limited way to the prediction of menopause. Low levels of antimüllerian hormone in young women might indicate a greater risk for POI and could facilitate early diagnosis. It is, however, important to note that predicting the exact timing of menopause and POI is challenging, and individual variations are significant. Although these factors can provide some insights, they are not foolproof predictors. Advances in medical research and technology may lead to more accurate methods for predicting menopause and POI in the future.

### Development and validation of a new rating scale for perimenopausal depression-the meno-D [^111VN5i8]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Women have approximately twice the risk of developing depression or anxiety disorders compared to men. The menopause transition is a time when women are at an increased risk for new onset depression, as well as relapse for women with a history of depression –. While there are many overlapping symptoms between major depressive disorder and depression occurring during the menopause transition, there are also key differences that indicate 'perimenopausal depression' may be a unique subtype of depression. The diagnosis and quantification of perimenopausal depression requires a new rating scale to reflect the unique subset of symptoms. This study presents the development and validation of a novel scale specifically designed to measure the severity of perimenopausal depression symptoms.

The perimenopausal period refers to the interval immediately preceding menopause, when women transition from a reproductive to a non-reproductive state, until menopause, when menses have ceased for a period of at least 12 months. The perimenopausal period typically begins for women during their mid-to late 40s with a number of physical and mental health changes which continue for ~4–5 years before menopause is reached. The Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria provide the gold standard for characterizing reproductive aging through reproductive stages and menopause. The STRAW recommends that the late reproductive stage is accompanied with subtle endocrine changes that transition into a perimenopausal period that includes an 'early' and 'late' transition phase as well as the 'early' stage of postmenopause.

The perimenopausal period encompasses a range of endocrine changes that can be accompanied by varied biological and emotional symptoms. Menstrual cycle changes typically commence with irregularities in cycle length and progress to cessation of menses. Endocrine features include changes to FSH, estradiol, AMH, and ihibin-B; although, the STRAW recommendations are based on qualitative FSH criteria. Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats are the most common menopausal symptom. Perimenopausal women are at an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, as compared to pre or postmenopausal women, even after adjusting for variables such as personal history of depression, vasomotor symptoms, stressful life events and other demographic factors, such as age, race and socioeconomic status. It has been estimated that 20% of perimenopausal women present to their primary healthcare physician with depressive symptoms.

### Symptom experience during the late reproductive stage and the menopausal transition: observations from the women living better survey [^113TDpMC]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

The transition from her reproductive years to menopause has a unique script for each woman and for many it is a confusing and sometimes difficult journey. Efforts to characterize the physiologic changes and symptoms associated with this transition have increased in recent decades. The creation and revision of the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) framework has been an attempt to define and characterize distinct stages on the path to menopause to define and standardize the process for researchers, clinicians, and the women who live it. Currently it is unclear when women begin to experience symptoms associated with this transition.

Both the healthcare and lay communities have long associated the beginning of the menopausal transition (MT) with clear changes in the menstrual cycle. In 2001 and 2011, STRAW defined entry into the MT as consecutive menstrual cycles that vary by more than 7 days. The late reproductive stage (LRS) immediately precedes the MT in the STRAW framework and is associated with subtle changes to menstrual flow and cycle length. A recent scoping review of research about the LRS revealed little attention to women's experiences during this stage. Since 2001, when the STRAW criteria were published, only nine studies focused explicitly on the LRS. Results of these studies suggest that women reported symptoms typically associated with the MT such as sleep disruption, hot flashes, breast pain, vaginal dryness, urinary incontinence and nocturia, memoryand mood changes, and painbefore their periods changed significantly.

Since 2018 women have been contributing data about symptoms experienced before the onset of cycle irregularity to Women Living Better (WLB), an evidence-based online resource about the MT. This prompted us to embark on further study of the LRS. To investigate women's experience during the LRS and the MT we surveyed a convenience sample of midlife women about their experiences with a broad list of symptoms. The aims of this study were to (1) identify symptoms women reported during the LRS, including their frequency, bother, and symptom burden; (2) compare the symptom experiences between women in the LRS and MT stages; (3) describe the level of interference women associate with symptoms during the LRS and MT; and (4) examine women's expectations of when they would experience symptoms possibly related to the MT.

### Macular, choroidal and disc associations across women's reproductive life stages: a scoping review from menarche to post-menopause [^116qa1VL]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Determining menstrual cycle phase

Various methods exist for reporting menstrual cycle phases, each with its strengths and weaknesses. These include relying solely on self-reported information, utilising published ranges for ovarian hormone levels (with direct assays available in saliva, blood serum, blood plasma, and urine), combining self-report with hormonal levels or basal body temperature, and examining within-person changes in ovarian hormone levels collected multiple times over the cycle. While self-reporting alone is very common, it is the weakest method in isolation. However, if the calculation of the menstrual cycle phase is transparent and standardised, using it as a proxy for hormonal action could be acceptable since it is the most cost-effective and minimally burdensome for participants. Since it lacks the precision to identify specific cycle subphases, such as early, mid, or late phases, when used in isolation, the identification of ovulation exhibits the lowest accuracy and should not be considered. Finally, it is recommended that cycle tracking by the participants be initiated a couple of months before answering self-report questionnaires and that ovarian hormonal levels are used in conjunction with self-reporting.

Determining menopausal status

Spontaneous menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, established retrospectively after a woman has undergone 12 consecutive months of amenorrhoea without any apparent alternative cause. Determining menopausal status is a more straightforward process, often defined by questionnaire. Longitudinal studies would be particularly valuable for understanding the impact of perimenopause through menopause within individuals, extending beyond chronological age. Caution is advised when including participants in perimenopause as controls since this period has irregular cycle lengths and anovulatory cycles. In the case of potential perimenopausal participants, the staging system 'Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW + 10)' for participants aged 40 and above helps in calculating their menopausal status. Finally, in studies exploring pre- and post-menopausal changes, maintaining consistency in the menstrual cycle phase of the pre-menopausal group is crucial for obtaining reliable and comparable results.

Contraception

In the investigation of the natural menstrual cycle or menopause, it is recommended that cycling participants have experienced a minimum of two natural cycles after discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. This approach allows for a more accurate representation of the physiological changes associated with the cycle. Furthermore, consistent exclusion of all types of hormonal contraception and not only oral contraceptives, including hormonal intra-uterine devices, implants, or injections, is essential to minimise confounding variables and enhance the internal validity of the research findings.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### Menopause, reproductive life, hormone replacement therapy, and bone phenotype at age 60–64 years: a British birth cohort [^114d7V3H]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Timing of menopause

Information on menstrual irregularity, month and year of last menstrual cycle or any operation to remove the uterus or ovaries, and monthly HRT use was obtained from annual postal questionnaires between ages 47 and 54 years (inclusive) with an additional one at 57 years and from face-to-face interviews with trained research nurses at 43, 53, and 60–64 years. Months since birth until periods ceased naturally or because of hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy (n = 76), bilateral oophorectomy only (n = 2), hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy (n = 21), hysterectomy only (n = 96), or for other reasons were obtained. It was not possible to assign a date of menopause to women who started HRT before the menopause and had not come off HRT for at least a year when giving responses about period regularity and the timing of the last period.

Age at menarche and length of reproductive life

Age at menarche was obtained from reports of the mother at a medical examination and interview by a school doctor when the study member was aged about 14.5 years. For the 7% of women who had not reached menarche by the time of this examination, retrospective reports obtained from the postal questionnaire at age 48 years were used instead. Length of reproductive life was derived by taking age at menarche from age at natural menopause or hysterectomy (all in months since birth).

HRT use

From the dates of starting and stopping HRT, we derived an ever-use of HRT (yes vs no), length of HRT use in years, and time since last use (within the last year, 1–5 y ago, more than 5 y ago). Women who provided information on HRT use for at least five of the 10 possible updates were included.

Other covariables

Height (centimeters) and weight (kilograms) were measured according to a standard protocol at the time of the bone scans and were standardized to give a mean of 0 and a SD of 1. Smoking at age 60–64 years (yes/no) and main occupation (manual vs nonmanual) according to the Registrar General's social class classification were also included as covariates.

### Menstruation and the menopausal transition [^116Hidtd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This paper characterizes changes in menstrual bleeding during perimenopause, including bleeding changes that represent markers of the menopausal transition. Recent results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation and other cohort studies are reviewed. Emerging data describing subpopulation differences in the transition experience are highlighted. When treating women in the midlife, clinicians should pay careful attention to medical factors, including both conditions and treatments, that may increase menstrual blood loss or alter menstrual cycle characteristics sufficiently to obscure the onset of the menopausal transition or the final menstrual period.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^112zEWYv]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Cycle characteristics by user age

Table 2 lists the mean cycle length, follicular phase length, luteal phase length, bleed length and per-user cycle length variation in cohorts of cycles by user age (n = 612,613). Cycle length decreased with increasing age with a mean difference of 2.9 days or 10% (95% CI: 2.9–3.0) between the youngest and oldest cohorts. The bleed length reduced slightly with age with a mean difference of 0.5 days or 12% (95% CI: 0.4–0.5) between the youngest and oldest cohorts. Per-user cycle length variation reduced by 0.5 days or 20% (95% CI: 0.4–0.6 days) between the youngest and oldest cohorts. The follicular phase length became shorter with age with a mean difference of 3.2 days or 20% (95% CI: 3.2–3.3 days) between the youngest and oldest cohorts. The luteal phase length varied very little between age cohorts.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111g5hPA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) initiation timing — Current recommendations suggest that the initiation of MHT should generally be limited to women < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause onset; evidence in younger, symptomatic women is limited, with no adequately powered RCTs with clinical outcomes, and the best available evidence comes from subgroup analyses of WHI data in women 50 to 59 years of age or < 10 years since menopause onset.

### The menopause transition: signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

Evidence Synthesis

The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

Conclusions

The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of the transition and be prepared to offer treatment to mitigate these symptoms. Many safe and effective options, including HT, are available.

### Association of parity and breastfeeding with risk of early natural menopause [^112V3pV1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Assessment of Early Menopause

Beginning in 1989, NHS2 members were asked if their menstrual periods had ceased permanently with the following response options: "no: premenopausal", "yes: no menstrual periods", "yes: had menopause but now have periods induced by hormones", and "not sure". Women reporting that their periods had ceased were then asked, "Age periods ceased?" with an open response field, and "For what reason did your periods cease?" with response options of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, or natural. Women were also asked about use of hormone therapy (HT), including timing and type used. These questions were repeated on each biennial questionnaire. Age at menopause was defined as age after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. For the women who reported being postmenopausal on 1 questionnaire and then subsequently reported being premenopausal, we defined age at menopause as the age at which periods ceased for at least 12 months, followed by consistent reporting of cessation on at least 3 consecutive questionnaires.

The present study was limited to 108 887 women who were premenopausal at baseline, had no prior cancer diagnosis (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer), and had no history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy. We defined cases of early menopause as women who reported natural menopause at younger than 45 years.

Covariates

Age at menarche, race/ethnicity, and height were reported in 1989. Body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was calculated using height reported at baseline and weight reported biennially. Age, smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked per day, OC use, and duration of OC use were assessed every 2 years. Infertility was assessed at baseline by asking women if they had ever tried to become pregnant for more than 1 year without success and, if so, what the cause was (eg, ovulatory disorder, tubal blockage, spouse or partner). On biennial questionnaires to 2001 and every 4 years thereafter, women were asked if they experienced infertility since the last questionnaire. Dietary factors, including percentage of vegetable protein intake, amount of vitamin D from foods and supplements, and alcohol intake, were assessed in 1991 and every 4 years thereafter via semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. Intake measures were adjusted for energy using the residual method.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^1117h5r2]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this article is to summarize the recommended updates to the 2001 Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) criteria. The 2011 STRAW + 10 reviewed advances in understanding of the critical changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function that occur before and after the final menstrual period.

Methods

Scientists from five countries and multiple disciplines evaluated data from cohort studies of midlife women and in the context of chronic illness and endocrine disorders on change in menstrual, endocrine, and ovarian markers of reproductive aging including antimüllerian hormone, inhibin-B, follicle-stimulating hormone, and antral follicle count. Modifications were adopted by consensus.

Results

STRAW + 10 simplified bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage -3) and the early postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage -1) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics.

Conclusions

STRAW + 10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts. Application of the STRAW + 10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making. Nonetheless, important knowledge gaps persist, and seven research priorities are identified.

### The menopausal transition period and cardiovascular risk [^112N8ns5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The menopausal transition period spans, on average, 2–8 years before the final menstrual period and is associated with an increase in clinical and subclinical cardiovascular risk. In this Review, we discuss the metabolic and cardiovascular changes that occur during the menopausal transition period and the role of ovarian ageing, chronological ageing and other ageing-related risk factors in mediating these changes. Disentangling the relative contributions of chronological and reproductive ageing to cardiovascular risk is challenging, but data from longitudinal studies in women transitioning from premenopause to post-menopause have provided valuable insights. We also discuss evidence on how cardiovascular risk is altered by premature or early menopause, surgical menopause, and vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. Whether targeted interventions can slow the progression of atherosclerosis and subclinical disease during the menopausal transition, thus delaying or preventing the onset of cardiovascular events, remains to be determined. Furthermore, we consider the recommended strategies for cardiovascular risk reduction in women undergoing menopausal transition using the framework of the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health, and discuss the cardiovascular risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy. Finally, we also discuss novel therapies that might benefit this population in reducing cardiovascular risk.

### Revisiting the duration of vasomotor symptoms of menopause: a meta-analysis [^114EdrYT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment decisions about menopause are predicated on a transient duration of vasomotor symptoms. However, evidence supporting a specific duration is weak.

Objective

To estimate the natural progression of vasomotor symptoms during the menopause transition by systematically compiling available evidence using meta-analytic techniques.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, hand searched secondary references in relevant studies, book chapters, and review papers, and contacted investigators about relevant published research.

Review Methods

English language, population-based studies reporting vasomotor symptom prevalence among women in menopausal transition in time intervals based on years to or from final menstrual period were included. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality of studies and extracted data for vasomotor symptom prevalence.

Results

The analyses included 10 studies (2 longitudinal, 8 cross sectional) with 35,445 participants. The percentage of women experiencing symptoms increased sharply in the 2 years before final menstrual period, peaked 1 year after final menstrual period, and did not return to premenopausal levels until about 8 years after final menstrual period. Nearly 50% of all women reported vasomotor symptoms 4 years after final menstrual period, and 10% of all women reported symptoms as far as 12 years after final menstrual period. When data were examined according to symptom severity ('any' vs. 'bothersome'), bothersome symptoms peaked about 1 year earlier and declined more rapidly than symptoms of any severity level.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a median symptom duration of about 4 years among symptomatic women. A longer symptom duration may affect treatment decisions and clinical guidelines. Further prospective, longitudinal studies of menopausal symptoms should be conducted to confirm these results.

### Impact of sex on multiple sclerosis therapy [^1164mQFL]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The rise in MS after puberty suggests neuroendocrine factors are at play. The peri-pubertal timeframe may also be tied to ongoing CNS development, which is influenced by sex and sex hormone levels as well. Cortical gray matter increases are said to peak during adolescence.

The menstrual cycle has been evaluated in MS, but not in large numbers. Some MS women note worsening of symptoms prior to menstruation. In one study, MS women had worse cognitive performance in the pre-menstrual period vs. the periovulatory period, as well as a decline in physical measures. The MS cohort (vs. healthy controls) had worse baseline measurements and greater pre-menstrual deterioration. Basal body temperature increases before ovulation, and remains up during the luteal phase. In a very small MRI study (N ​ = ​8), MRI activity appeared to be related to the sex steroid balance during the luteal phase: higher ratio of progesterone to estradiol levels correlated with number and volume of contrast brain lesions. In a pilot study, symptom severity did not clearly fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. Those on continuous vs. cyclic oral contraceptive use were less likely to be affected by fatigue and daily hassles. This was in a cohort of N ​ = ​47 MS women. Clearly further studies are needed in this area.

Menopause

Menopause is a normal aging process. It refers to the loss of menstrual periods and loss of the ability to become pregnant, along with a dramatic drop in estrogen and progesterone. It may be accompanied by varying degrees of mood and cognitive issues, fatigue, poor sleep, vasomotor disturbances (hot flashes), joint and muscle aches, urinary urgency, and sexual dysfunction. All these issues may also be seen in MS. Menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45–55 years (average age 51 years). True menopause requires no menses for a year. Perimenopause is the preceding transitional period that can last 2–8 years. Menses become more irregular, shorter, and may have skipped months. MS does not affect the timing of menopause. Male menopause, andropause, is more accurately referred to as androgen deficiency in the aging male (ADAM), or late onset hypogonadism. After age 40, testosterone levels in men decline about 1 ​% a year. It is estimated only 10 ​%–25 ​% have levels that are truly low. This is very different from menopause experienced by women.

### Menopause: hormones, lifestyle, and optimizing aging [^115uQdHc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Although American women spend approximately 30% to 40% of their lives in menopause, a state defined by the cessation of estrogen production by the ovaries, obstetricians and gynecologists in North America receive little formal education about menopausal health. Hormonal therapy has been available for more than 75 years; however, controversies surrounding its use have impacted training of care providers in all specialties. This article offers updates on care for menopausal women, focusing on symptomatology and health issues that arise related to the decline in all reproductive hormones. Lifestyle adaptations and nonmedical approaches, and nonhormonal and hormonal medications are discussed.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^116nmZBo]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we analysed the key characteristics of more than 600,000 menstrual cycles. This large analysis of menstrual cycle parameters provides insight into the physiology of the menstrual cycle amongst the general population, which is not widely known. It demonstrates significant variability in cycle and follicular phase length amongst a large group of women with wide age and BMI ranges. Using this large data set, our analysis reveals important information on menstrual cycle characteristics in a real-world population of women. Knowledge and understanding of the menstrual cycle, ovulation day and the fertile period is important for both individual women and healthcare professionals providing services in reproductive health. These data are valuable for fertility educators to support educational activites around female fertility that address knowledge gaps across both the general population and the medical community.

It is a common belief that ovulation occurs on day 14 of the cycle, but our analysis has shown that for the majority of women in the real-world that this is not the case. Cycle length differences were found to be predominantly caused by follicular phase length differences (i.e. differences in ovulation day). The mean follicular phase length was 16.9 days (95% CI: 10–30). For women with a typical cycle length (25–30 days) the follicular phase length was on average 15.2 days. For women with normal but longer cycles (31–35 days), it was 19.5 days and for women with normal but shorter cycles (21–24 days) it was 12.4 days. In very short cycles (15–20 days) the mean follicular phase length was 10.4 days and in very long cycles (36–50 days) it was at 26.8 days. These findings demonstrate that the widely held belief that ovulation occurs consistently on day 14 of the cycle is not correct. Clinically, it is important that women who wish to plan a pregnancy are having intercourse on their fertile days. In order to identify the fertile period it is important to track physiological parameters such as BBT and not just cycle length.

### Characteristics related to early secondary amenorrhoea and pregnancy among women diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus: an analysis using the GOAL study [^1114nbxR]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The main outcome of interest, secondary amenorrhoea, was measured by self-report of whether the woman's menstrual periods stopped before the age of 40. In order to investigate secondary amenorrhoea related to hypogonadism, women were only considered to have the outcome of interest if they indicated their period stopped without a hysterectomy. This group was compared with women whose periods had not stopped and women who were currently pregnant. Women who had a hysterectomy were at risk for early secondary amenorrhoea until the time of their hysterectomy, but we do not have this timing information. Therefore, these women were excluded from the primary analyses, but to address this time at risk we conducted sensitivity analyses in which women who had a hysterectomy were included with those women who did not experience secondary amenorrhoea before the age of 40. Women below the age of 40 at the time of the survey were also asked if they had stopped menstruating. However, we excluded these women who were not yet 40 years old because they might still experience early secondary amenorrhoea before reaching this age (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow chart depicting the exclusion criteria for this study and which women were included in the primary and sensitivity analyses. GOAL, Georgians Organized Against Lupus; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus.

Additional outcomes of interest included whether the woman was ever pregnant and whether she had a child and whether these events occurred prior to and after their lupus diagnosis. Cyclophosphamide use was characterised by ever or never use before the age of 40. Other demographic and disease-related characteristics were also obtained from the questionnaire. The self-administered version of disease damage, the Brief Index of Lupus Damage (BILD), was calculated for each woman as an indicator of disease severity. This score typically includes whether a woman has had a hysterectomy before the age of 40, but because this is related to the outcome of interest, in this analysis we recalculated the score without this factor.

### Menstrual cycle characteristics of U. S. adolescents according to gynecologic age and age at menarche [^114s5r1T]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To characterize typical menstrual cycle characteristics in adolescents and determine how these differ with age at menarche or years since menarche (gynecologic age).

Methods

We surveyed 13 to 18-year-old U.S. users of the Clue app (N = 6,486) and linked their responses to app-recorded cycle data (N = 38,916 cycles). We analyzed cycle characteristics including cycle length, cycle variability, period length, experience of heavy flow, and dysmenorrhea in relation to gynecologic age and menarcheal age using mixed effects models.

Results

With increasing gynecologic age, we observed dose-dependent associations of lower odds of cycle irregularity (defined as cycles that were highly variable, short, or long) and higher odds of reporting ≥ 1 day of heavy flow. Individuals < 1 year post-menarche had lower odds of heavy flow (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 0.6), and increased odds of having a highly variable cycle (OR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.2) or short cycles (OR = 5.0; 95% CI: 2.3, 11.0) compared to those who were 6+ years post-menarche. We also found associations with early and late age at menarche. Compared to menarcheal age of 14+ years, menarcheal age ≤ 10 years was associated with shorter cycle length (β = -1.63 days; 95% CI: -2.51, -0.75), increased odds of dysmenorrhea (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 4.6), and decreased odds of high cycle variability (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.0).

Conclusion

Cycle characteristics in adolescence are associated with menarcheal age and gynecologic age. Notably, highly variable cycles are common, especially among those with younger gynecologic age or older menarcheal age.

### Dorsal brain activity reflects the severity of menopausal symptoms [^113zmywG]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause, which refers to a point in time when menstrual bleeding completely stops, is attributed to the decrease in blood estrogen levels (ie, concentration) as a result of the loss of ovarian follicular function due to aging. The blood levels of estrogen and other sex hormones fluctuate during the perimenopausal period and reach a lower level than earlier. This significant shift in hormonal environment in women occurs during the menopausal transition (ie, perimenopause), between the ages of 40 and 60 years. Although menopause is a natural part of a woman's life cycle, more than 80% of women experience unpleasant symptoms such as (i) vasomotor symptoms (ie, hot flashes and night sweats), (ii) vaginal dryness (ie, dyspareunia), (iii) difficulty in sleeping (ie, insomnia), and (iv) adverse mood (ie, depression), due to changes in hormonal levels. "Unpleasantness" associated with menopausal symptoms negatively affects the patient's quality of life and performance at the workplace. It is, therefore, clinically and socially imperative to treat women with these symptoms. However, the menopausal symptoms tend to be underrecognized by others including health care providers, presumably because they are not objectively "visible" and patients may lack confidence about the severity of their symptoms, unsure if they are "severe enough" to warrant medical attention. Recently, pharmacological treatments have been recommended to manage these symptoms and have been proven effective to some extent. To deliver better treatments to more patients, the level of unpleasantness (ie, severity of symptoms) should be assessed properly, primarily through careful medical interviews by experienced gynecologists and supported by clinical examinations. As the patients' chief complaints associated with menopausal symptoms are subjective experiences, questionnaires are mainly used for evaluating menopausal symptoms, such as the Kupperman Kohnenki Shogai Index (KKSI)and Simplified Menopausal Index. Although subjective questionnaires are useful clinical tools which directly reflect participants' complaints, they have inherent limitations such as practice and ceiling/floor effects. Consequently, patients and clinicians may sometimes lack confidence in the presence or intensity of the symptoms. Clinicians assume that subjective complaints and assessments are the gold standard in menopause clinical practice; however, they acknowledge that the subjective assessments are unstable. Availability of objective measurements to support patients' subjective complaints and questionnaire scores would enhance patients' self-awareness of their symptoms and provide them with opportunities to elaborate on their symptoms, which would consequently contribute to increasing the overall consensus on treatment procedures and encouraging treatment uptake. The objective assessments would be also useful for monitoring treatment outcomes because they are less biased by practice effects. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity in terms of neural oscillation. We previously demonstrated that MEG is sensitive to changes in brain activities associated with the menstrual cycle. Other studies have demonstrated that it is also sensitive to the changes in brain activities associated with unpleasant experiences, such as painand fatigue. Furthermore, most menopausal symptoms are neurological(Fig. 1). Therefore, we assumed that MEG could capture the level of unpleasantness associated with menopausal symptoms.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112kx7a3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A somewhat similar experience exists at the opposite end of the reproductive age spectrum, beyond the age of 45 years, as women enter what has been called the menopausal transition, where cycle length typically becomes more infrequent or irregular before culminating in amenorrhea as ovarian secretion of estradiol declines and ultimately ceases. However, this experience is perhaps even less orderly than that of the post‐menarcheal period, as there may be highly variable endocrine changes resulting in unpredictable impacts on menstrual function. Again, what is common, and often portrayed as "normal", can be highly disruptive, particularly when coupled with other symptoms.

Women who present with infertility may have accompanying menstrual symptoms typical of ovulatory disorders. However, women with cyclically normal onset of menstrual bleeding may not be ovulating, or at least not ovulating regularly, as the frequency of single‐cycle anovulation in the context of normal regular cycles is in the range of 3.7%–26.7%. Consequently, further evaluation beyond a detailed history will be necessary to identify those with ovulatory disorders.

The optimal way to assess for ovulation and, by extension, confirm ovulatory disorders may vary according to the clinical circumstance. The menstrual history of regular, predictable cycles between 24 and 38 days remains a helpful tool, and reflects the overall experience better than evaluation of endocrine or imaging parameters from a single cycle does. While patients and clinicians have traditionally used measurement of basal body temperature, interpretation can be difficult, so this approach should be used with caution. If available, ovulation predictor kits that measure the levels of luteinizing hormone in urine samples generally accurately reflect levels of serum luteinizing hormone and are a valuable tool for detecting ovulation in a given cycle. Simply measuring progesterone in the predicted luteal phase may provide satisfactory evidence supporting ovulatory function, particularly when the first day of the next menstrual period is known. Such an approach may be helpful in circumstances such as hirsutism, where the incidence of anovulation in women with cyclically predictable menstrual cycles is higher.

There are other, less common ovulatory disorders that may require more complex evaluation to determine if they are present in a given individual. For example, identifying LUF cycles, somewhat common in infertile women, requires both confirmation of the LH surge and the performance of serial ultrasound to demonstrate failed rupture of the dominant follicle. It should be remembered that scrutiny of a single cycle may not reflect the overall experience for a given individual.

### Menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^113XF4eq]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Young patients and their parents often are unsure about what represents normal menstrual patterns, and clinicians also may be unsure about normal ranges for menstrual cycle length and amount and duration of flow through adolescence. It is important to be able to educate young patients and their parents regarding what to expect of a first period and about the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. It is equally important for clinicians to have an understanding of bleeding patterns in girls and adolescents, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate young patients' conditions appropriately. Using the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign adds a powerful tool to the assessment of normal development and the exclusion of pathological conditions.

### NAMS 2019 pre-meeting symposium, September 2019, Chicago Illinois: the perimenopause [^112ckXh4]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

The North American Menopause Society held the 2019 Pre-Meeting Symposium on September 25, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, to review the current state of the science related to the physiology of the perimenopause and to address management of the most prevalent and pressing clinical issues. The perimenopause, as defined by the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10, encompasses the menopause transition as well as the first year following menopause, the final menstrual period. This phase in the continuum of women's reproductive lives had been one of the least well understood. Fortunately, contributions from a number of prospective, longitudinal, decades-long studies have provided a better understanding of the perimenopause, whereas posing important new questions related to symptom interaction and linkages between symptoms and long-term health. There is now added clarity to distinguish the effects of reproductive hormonal changes from aging. The variation in symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, among women over time including differences in experiences by ethnicity and race, provides paradigm shifts in clinical perspective. Refinements in understanding the character, timing, and potential predictive markers for menstrual cycles during the transition have emerged. From the perspective of myriad clinical management challenges, significant progress in recommendations for evaluation and therapeutic approaches has been achieved. Finally, recognizing the menopause transition as an opportunity to initiate positive lifestyle changes to enhance future health was emphasized.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer: what is the true size of the increased risk? [^113MHGXX]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Menopausal age was known for 39 183 women and was uncertain (i.e. by hysterectomy, MHT, or oral contraceptive use) for 18 965 women. Of those with known menopausal age, 88.9% reported a natural menopause and 9.4% reported bilateral oophorectomy as the reason for menopause; the remaining 1.7% reported various other procedures or treatments. The median interval between menopause and subsequent recruitment for the 30 113 women known to be post-menopausal at recruitment was 7 years (interquartile range: 3 to 13 years). There were 9070 women pre-menopausal at recruitment who subsequently became post-menopausal during follow-up and at that point became eligible for analysis (median interval between recruitment and incident menopause for these 9070 women: 4 years; interquartile range: 2 to 5 years). The following results, unless otherwise stated, are based on the women with known menopausal age. The mean menopausal age was 50.2 (s.d.: 4.6) years and mean post-menopausal BMI was 25.7 (s.d.: 4.5) kg m −2. Table 1 presents further descriptive characteristics of the cohort and the pattern of MHT use at recruitment: 5.0% of women who had not used MHT by recruitment subsequently used MHT sometime during follow-up and 65.4% of current users at recruitment ceased use by end of follow-up. At recruitment the median duration of use of oestrogen-only MHT was 6.5 years (interquartile range: 2.5 to 10.5 years), of oestrogen plus progestogen MHT was 5.5 years (interquartile range: 2.5 to 9.5 years), and was 4.5.years (interquartile range: 1.5 to 8.5 years) for other types of MHT. Supplementary Table 1 describes the 775 first incident invasive or in situ breast cancers that were diagnosed during 204 390 person-years (median 6.0 years) of follow-up among 39 183 women with known age at menopause (and similar descriptive statistics for 18 965 women with unknown age at menopause).

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112ZEt6h]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is no single pathway to the end of menses. Menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different symptom experiences and health risks. Differentiating between menopausal types in research is an important step toward clarifying the uniqueness of menopause experience for each woman. Acknowledging menopausal types in design and analysis is an important next step for clinical research. The absence of menopausal differentiation in one year of research alone suggests that menopause remains for many a monolithic and uniform process. When taking the many menopauses into account, differences in memory and cognitive outcomes are seen for each type of menopause. Explicitly acknowledging the many menopauses will allow for more rigorous clinical research and the development of clinical guidelines that are applicable to each type of menopause in all women.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^1175FnBY]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

4 SYSTEM 1

4.1 Normal and abnormal uterine bleeding definitions and terminology

FIGO System 1 was developed to formalize the nomenclature and definitions of normal and abnormal menstrual bleeding, allowing clinicians, investigators, and patients to align on the description of the bleeding patterns of those complaining of AUB (Figure 1). Each element is considered in the context of a structured history and defines normal and, therefore, abnormal features generally based on the fifth to 95th percentiles from large‐scale clinical studies. System 1 was the product of a rigorous Delphi process that was used to develop simple and translatable definitions while identifying and removing the need for obsolete terminologies such as menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

FIGURE 1
FIGO Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB) System 1, defining the nomenclature and definition of AUB (30). *The normal range is age dependent, with shortest to longest days for 18–25 years at ≤ 9 days, 26–41 years at ≤ 7 days, and 42–45 years at ≤ 9 days.

As seen in Figure 1, application of FIGO System 1 in a clinical scenario requires a structured history that allows a description of the four parameters of frequency, duration, regularity, and subjective flow volume, as well as the presence or absence of IMB and unscheduled bleeding for those on progestin‐based gonadal steroid formulations. Of course, cyclical administration of estrogen and progestin‐containing agents, typically for contraception, is expected to result in cyclical withdrawal bleeding from the endometrium. All the metrics are based on the previous 6 months, provided there has been no pregnancy or puerperium.

Frequency

The number of days in an average menstrual cycle from the first day of bleeding in one cycle to the first day of the next cycle. The normal length of a menstrual cycle ranges from 24 to 38 days, whereas abnormal frequency of menstruation is less than 24 days (frequent menses) or more than 38 days (infrequent menses). The absence of menstrual bleeding, without an iatrogenic cause, should be characterized as amenorrhea, as this too is abnormal.

Duration

The number of consecutive bleeding days in each cycle, where the count begins with the onset of bleeding and ends on the last day of blood flow, including the light bleeding, often called spotting. It is normal for women to bleed for up to eight consecutive days, whereas longer than this would be considered prolonged and abnormal.

Gestational age (GA) and the first trimester — "The duration of pregnancy is called gestational age (GA) and is reported as number of weeks and number of days", and "GA is calculated by the best obstetric estimate, typically using the first day of the last menstrual period and/or an early-dating US examination". Synonyms are provided: "Alternate terms for GA are menstrual age, gestational duration, clinical age, or clinical dates". The first-trimester boundary is explicit: "The first trimester of pregnancy is defined as a GA of 13 weeks 6 days or less". Terminology use is constrained: "The term normal should only be used to describe the first-trimester US examination characteristics, such as normal first-trimester US examination or normal location", and "'Normal first-trimester pregnancy' should be avoided since abnormalities may be undetectable at this early GA".

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^1179TVay]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Validity of lifetime estradiol exposure hypothesis can be challenged by recent in vivo multimodality imaging study findings showing a gradual increase in estrogen receptor density in the brain during the menopause transition, accompanied by changes in brain volume, perfusion, and energy metabolism. Significant overlap with estrogen-regulated brain networks linked to reproductive and higher-order cognitive functions was observed, independent of chronological age and plasma estradiol levels. This suggests a novel connection between female endocrine aging and heightened expression of estrogen receptors in brain regions associated with cognitive functions, spanning mood, memory, stress, pain, and fine motor skills. Also supporting the concept of estrogenic and biochemical adjustments during perimenopause and early postmenopausal phases that are linked to health issues.

Sex hormones vary throughout the lifespan and most important shifts depend on reproductive stage known as reproductive ageing. Although age correlated with reproductive age, the actual developmental stage cannot be determined solely based on chronological age. At puberty, girls typically experience menarche between ages 9 and 18 years; this stage is characterised by elevated levels of estradiol and profound changes in the brain and body from childhood to puberty, (please see earlier reviews). Menopause marks the end of fertility and is linked to a decrease in estradiol levels, with estrone becoming the dominant form of estrogen in postmenopausal women. These reproductive stages are critical periods defined by major hormonal changes, acting as important proxy measures primarily reflecting fluctuations in estradiol levels.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^112hvscR]. Climacteric (2024). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary ovarian insufficiency, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guidelines recommend to take into consideration the following points when diagnosing POI:

- exclude pregnancy in females presenting with amenorrhea

- use of hormonal therapy (including oral, injectable or long-acting contraceptives) may conceal or cause amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles, and potentially lower FSH concentrations

- consider ceasing some hormonal therapy (such as combined oral contraceptive) before confirming a diagnosis of POI

- females who had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy before age 40 years have a diagnosis of POI and additional diagnostic testing is unnecessary.

### Challenges of diagnosing and managing the adolescent with heavy menstrual bleeding [^115PBPwR]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Unpredictable, prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) may be expected for many adolescents soon after menarche. A decade of clinical experience and research has now established firmly that bleeding disorders (BD) are common in adolescents with HMB. Despite these advances, many questions remain, and several aspects of the diagnosis and management of BDs in adolescents are not supported by rigorous clinical trials. In this overview, four major areas will be discussed. First, we will discuss the frequency of BDs in young women with HMB. Up to 20% of older females with HMB are thought to have an underlying BD. Estimates from retrospective studies in adolescents suggest a prevalence that varies anywhere from 10 to 62%. Prospective studies with uniform hemostatic evaluation are needed to answer this question definitively. Second, we will review existing tools that help screen and diagnose adolescents with HMB with an underlying BD. Although identification of an underlying BD in older women with HMB is relatively straight forward, uncertainties remain for adolescents. Heavy menstrual bleeding in this age group may have different pathophysiological underpinnings than those in older women and may often be disregarded as anovulatory. There is an urgent need to develop novel tools, and evaluate existing diagnostic strategies in adolescents. Third, we will discuss the optimal medical management of HMB in young adolescents. As direct evidence is largely lacking, these areas are also subject to extrapolation from older women. Lastly, an important area- prediction, and management of future bleeding in those adolescents who are diagnosed with a mild BD-will be discussed. Throughout, areas of controversy and opportunities for further research are highlighted.

### Counseling in menopausal women: how to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.

### Lifelong menstrual histories are typically erratic and trending: a taxonomy [^117RsYrb]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Menstrual cycles are composites of complex events; the data describing them are correspondingly rich. We seek to quantitatively represent menstrual histories from menarche to menopause and to evaluate the clinical belief that regular and stable cycle lengths are the most normative histories.

Design

Using prospective data from the Tremin Trust, we classified the menstrual histories of 628 women as very stable (type I), stable but with greater variability in cycle lengths (type II), oscillating and erratic with a downward trend in cycle length (type III), oscillating and erratic with no downward trend in cycle length (type IV), or highly erratic and variable (type V). Classification criteria were created by examining basic summary statistics of menstrual cycle lengths. Specifically, we identified key features describing variability of median cycle length, the mean of the interquartile range, the consistency of the interquartile range, the slope of median cycle lengths, and the number of stable 5-year intervals between ages 15 and 45+.

Results

We present the first characterization of full menstrual histories. Our taxonomy captures the essential features of menstrual bleeding patterns for a heterogeneous population. Persistently stable histories (types I and II) were seen in only 28% of the women; erratic histories (types III through V) characterized 72%. When examining all participants, significant differences were seen in age at menarche (P < 0.05), age at menopause (P < 0.01), and number of births (P < 0.01) between these stable and erratic groups.

Conclusions

Although clinicians have traditionally thought of "normal" menstrual histories as being regular and stable, the distribution of women in our five categories suggest that variable histories are most common. Clinically, these results may suggest the need for a paradigm shift in what gynecologists view as normal and abnormal menstrual cycle histories.

Participants were asked the question, " At what age did you have your first menstrual period? It's okay to estimate", with the following response options: "7 years old or younger", integer options between 8 and 15 years old, "16 years old or older", "I don't know", or "I prefer not to answer". Those who indicated they did not know or preferred not to answer or did not respond were excluded. We derived the following measures: (1) age at menarche (in years) (we assigned the value of 7 to those aged ≤ 7 years [196 (0.3%)] and the value of 16 to those aged ≥ 16 years [2447 (3.4%)]); (2) early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche < 11 years); (3) very early menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche < 9 years); and (4) late menarche (yes/no) (age at menarche ≥ 16 years).

Time to Cycle Regularity

Participants were asked, "After your first menstrual cycle, how long did it take for your cycle to become regular?" with the following response options: "less than 1 year", "1–2 years", "3–4 years", "more than 5 years", "after using hormones (eg, birth control pills)", "They're not yet regular", "I don't know", or "I prefer not to answer". Those who indicated don't know or prefer not to answer or who did not respond were considered missing. We further excluded 224 individuals with potentially inaccurate time-to-regularity information (eMethods in Supplement 1). For the remaining 61 932 participants, we categorized time to regularity as 2 years or less, 3 to 4 years, more than 5 years, not yet regular, or regular after using hormones.

### Development of ovulatory menstrual cycles in adolescent girls [^112VpRXV]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Irregular menstrual cycles due to anovulation are well described in the first few years after menarche, but the normal developmental trajectory from anovulatory to mature ovulatory cycles during adolescence remains undefined. In this article we review the very limited understanding of this final stage of female reproductive axis development and discuss why additional research in this area is critical to the health of women.

### Staging reproductive aging: a comparison of proposed bleeding criteria for the menopausal transition [^115XmNvu]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

A staging system for female reproductive aging has recently been proposed. Bleeding criteria are an important component of a staging system, as bleeding patterns are readily observable. Several different bleeding criteria have been proposed, but their concordance and validity have not been evaluated. Five proposed bleeding criteria or markers for the onset of early menopausal transition and four criteria for the onset of the late transition were evaluated using data from the Menstruation and Reproductive History Study, or Tremin Trust.

Design

Correlations between time from age 35 to each marker event were assessed using Kendall's tau correlation coefficients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to examine associations between the marker events and age at final menstrual period (FMP).

Results

The first occurrence of marker events for the late menopausal transition demonstrated low to high correlation (r = 0.23 to 0.77), whereas the first occurrence of marker events for the early transition stage demonstrated no correlation to moderate correlation (r = 0.0 to 0.65). After age 40, the occurrence of the marker events distinguished a subgroup of women who were more proximate to their FMP. Differences in years to FMP between women with and without the marker events were greatest in the early to mid-40s and declined with age.

Conclusions

A 60-day cycle may be a desirable marker for entry into the late transition stage because of its reliability, proximity to the FMP, and ease of calculation. More work is needed to conceptually define the onset of the early menopausal transition before appropriate bleeding criteria can be established.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^114kU4Qa]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Premature and early menopauses

Nonsurgical mid-life cessation of menses can occur outside of the expected age range. Entering menopause before age 45 is considered "early", whereas entering menopause before age 40 is designated as "premature" and is termed Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). The prevalence of these two types is estimated at about 5% and 1% to 2%, respectively. Progress of early menopause typically follows the same stages as spontaneous menopause. A diagnosis of POI, however, requires two occasions of amenorrhea for over 4 months, accompanied by documented elevation in circulating gonadotrophins (serum FSH concentration > 40 IU/L), reduced circulating androgens, and low E 2 levels. In addition, the decline in ovarian function in POI does not compare with spontaneous menopause, as hormone levels can be extremely variable and some women have reported spontaneous return of menses or even pregnancy. There is also an inconsistent and varied symptom experience for women with POI, with additional symptoms like hair loss, dry eyes, cold intolerance, joint clicking, and hypothyroidism.

POI and early menopause are often linked to underlying factors beyond gonadal hormone levels. Cigarette smoking, high body mass index, and low socioeconomic status have all been associated with POI and early menopause. POI has been linked with genetic abnormalities, metabolic or autoimmune disorders, infections, and enzyme deficiencies, though it is often idiopathic. Recent research also suggests that women with POI do not report a reduction in menopausal symptoms with aging.

Notably, ovary-sparing hysterectomy can reduce the age of menopause by an average of 4 years through compromise of ovarian function, related to age at surgery. A prominent hypotheses for ovarian cessation after uterine removal is that the surgery affects blood flow to the ovaries, but evidence for this is mixed. Other possible causes are that the uterus itself regulates pituitary FSH secretion and thus affects follicle development. It may also be that the condition that led to hysterectomy increases the risk for ovarian failure. Thus, depending on the timing of surgery, gradual ovarian cessation before age 45 due to hysterectomy might be considered noninduced, early menopause.

### The normal menstrual cycle [^11611Ehq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The normal ovulatory menstrual cycle requires the presence of a mature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highly coordinated hormonal feedback loops. Consisting of three phases (follicular, ovulatory, and luteal), the normal menstrual cycle results in the formation of a mature follicle and release of an oocyte during each cycle, with menses occurring in the absence of fertilization. While adolescents may initially experience anovulatory cycles following menarche, the vast majority of cycles will be fairly regular, lasting 21 to 45 days in length with an average of three to seven days of bleeding. Absence of menarche by age 15, absence of menses for three consecutive months, and menses lasting eight days or longer with or without associated heavy bleeding are among the menstrual abnormalities that warrant further evaluation. Obtaining the menstrual history in adolescents with the knowledge of expected menstrual patterns allows the pediatric practitioner to provide appropriate counseling and education to adolescents and their families, and to identify menstrual abnormalities when they arise. Treating the menstrual cycle as a "vital sign" highlights the importance of normal menses as an indicator of an individual's overall health and enables timely identification of any concerning findings.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^116xD4wk]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Late menopausal transition (Stage −1) — amenorrhea of 60 days or longer marks this stage, and quantitative criteria include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw, approximating more than 40 IU/L in previously used urine-based standards. Based on menstrual calendar and hormonal changes, this stage is estimated to last, on average, 1 to 3 years, and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are likely to occur. Researchers and clinicians should carefully evaluate the appropriate FSH value depending on the assay used.

### Menopausal status, age at menopause and risk of all-cause mortality among Chinese women: findings from a 10-year prospective study [^111qptKg]. BMJ Public Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Menopause is defined as 12 months after a woman's final menstrual period, marking the end of a woman's reproductive life and permanent cessation of ovarian function. Most women typically experience menopause between their late 40s and early 50s globally. The mean age at menopause was 48 years in Chinese women, compared with over 50 years typically seen in Western populations. Menopause that occurs before the age of 40 years is defined as premature menopause, after age 40 but before age 45 years is known as early menopause. Through menopause, women experience a decline of sex hormones (eg, oestrogen and progesterone) secreted by the ovaries, and an increase in follicle stimulating hormone secreted by the pituitary and a decrease in anti-Mullerian hormone. A woman's health may be impacted by the significant hormonal changes brought on by the menopausal transition. Previous research indicated that menopause may result in a large population at risk for long-term health consequences including mortality, with considerable public health impact.

The menstrual cycle has been recognized as a vital sign that gives information about the overall health of an adolescent or young adult female. Significant deviations from monthly cycles can signal disease or dysfunction. This review highlights the evidence based parameters for normal puberty, menarche, cyclicity, and amount of bleeding. The review addresses sources of information available online, noting inaccuracies that appear in web sites, even and especially those targeting adolescents. The review includes a call to action to provide accurate information about the menstrual cycle as a VITAL SIGN.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^1117ZBmJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Amenorrhea — definitions and thresholds for evaluation — Amenorrhea is the absence or abnormal cessation of menses, with primary amenorrhea evaluated when there is failure to menstruate by the age of 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual development (2 standard deviations above the mean of 13 years), or within 5 years after breast development if that occurs before the age of 10; failure to initiate breast development by the age of 13 (2 standard deviations above the mean of 10 years) also requires investigation. In women with regular menstrual cycles, a delay of menses for as little as 1 week may require the exclusion of pregnancy. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for > 3 months in those with previously regular cycles or 6 months in those with irregular menses, and requires investigation.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^112bFyuF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most, but certainly not all, ovulatory disorders are suggested by the presence of symptoms of AUB, ranging from complete absence (amenorrhea) to infrequent or irregular onset of menstrual blood flow. Secondary amenorrhea is generally defined as the cessation of menstruation for 6 months consecutively after at least one previous spontaneous menstrual bleed. Using data from extensive epidemiological studies, FIGO has previously determined that for those aged 18–45 years, and using the 5%–95% percentiles from large‐scale population studies, the normal frequency of menses is 24–38 days. Those with a cycle length of fewer than 24 days are deemed "frequent" while those whose cycle length is more than 38 days "infrequent", a term designed to replace oligomenorrhea. Even in this category, regularity varies by age; for those aged either 18–25 or 42–45 years, the difference between the shortest and longest cycle should be 9 days or less, while for those aged 26–41 years, it is 7 days or less. Regardless, those with infrequent or irregular menstrual bleeding should be considered to have an ovulatory disorder.

Diagnosing the presence of an ovulatory disorder at the extremes of reproductive age can be challenging, depending on the perception of what is normal. For postmenarcheal girls aged under 18 years, infrequent menstrual bleeding or irregular menstrual cycles suggesting ovulatory dysfunction are common, with available evidence suggesting that the individual's "normal" cycle length may not be established until the sixth year after menarche. During this pubertal transition, ovulatory dysfunction impacts about 50% of adolescent girls in the first year after menarche with a cycle length that is typically in the range of 21–45 days, but sometimes is as short as 20 days or may even exceed 60 days. In the years after menarche, these variations change such that 6 years later, the range is similar to those of adults. These issues can be explored in detail elsewhere. However, it should be remembered that while common, and even "normal", the individual's experience with this transition can be disruptive at a vulnerable time in their social, psychological, and physical development.

### Patient information: treatment of menopause symptoms with hormone therapy… [^112EForY]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Jin J. Treatment of Menopause Symptoms With Hormone Therapy. JAMA. 2022; 327:

1716. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.5105 Menopause occurs when the ovaries naturally decrease and then stop their production of the hormone estrogen. For most individuals, natural menopause occurs between age 45 and 55 years, with an average age of around 51 years. Terms such as menopausal transition and perimenopause are also used to describe the transition from premenopause to menopause. Menstrual periods naturally stop during menopause due to the decrease in estrogen. In individuals who have surgery or procedures of the uterus prior to menopause, periods may stop before menopause. While some individuals may have few or no menopausal symptoms, many experience symptoms including hot flashes and night sweats; these are sometimes referred to as vasomotor symptoms. Hot flashes, the most common symptom, occur in an estimated three-quarters of perimenopausal individuals.

In some people, these vasomotor symptoms are severe and can greatly affect quality of life. Other symptoms include vaginal burning or dryness as well as urinary frequency or urgency, sometimes referred to as genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Estrogen, and sometimes progesterone, are the 2 hormones used to reduce many of the symptoms of menopause. It is important to add progesterone to estrogen to reduce risk of uterine cancer. However, when the uterus has been removed, estrogen alone is recommended. In general, individuals who have menopause-related hot flashes and/or night sweats that are negatively affecting their sleep and quality of life and who are not at high risk of blood clots, breast or endometrial cancer, or heart disease may be good candidates for systemic hormone therapy.

Because menopause symptoms are usually more severe during early menopause, and the risk of adverse effects of hormone therapy increases with age, many clinicians choose to prescribe systemic hormone therapy only in patients younger than 60 years who are within 10 years of menopause onset. However, for all patients, decisions about treatment of menopausal symptoms should be made on an individual basis.

### Is this woman perimenopausal? [^115z9tT1]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Perimenopause is a time of transition for women at midlife. Women want to know whether they are starting this change and physicians need to know the accuracy of a clinical examination in identifying perimenopausal women. These women should be counseled about alleviating climacteric symptoms, using contraception, and preventing diseases such as osteoporosis.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of self-assessment, symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests in diagnosing women in perimenopause.

Data Sources

English-language articles that presented data relevant to diagnosis of perimenopause were identified in a MEDLINE search from 1966 to 2001. References of these articles and other publications also were reviewed.

Study Selection

Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of women aged 40 years or older that used the definition of perimenopause as 3 to 11 months of amenorrhea or irregular periods, included a premenopausal control group, and reported a clinical examination finding. Of 1246 articles identified, 16 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed articles for quality (L. A.B. and C.M.S.). Discrepancies were resolved by a third author (K.N.).

Data Synthesis

The prior probability of perimenopause is directly related to a woman's age. After considering age, the following yielded the greatest positive likelihood ratios (LRs+): self assessment of going through the transition (LR+ range, 1.53–2.13), symptoms of hot flashes (LR+ range, 2.15–4.06), night sweats (LR+ 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.63–2.21), vaginal dryness (LR+ range, 1.48–3.79), high follicle-stimulating hormone levels (LR+ 3.06; 95% CI, 2.06–4.54), and low inhibin B levels (LR+ 2.05; 95% CI, 0.96–4.39). Self-assessment of perimenopausal status had the smallest negative LR (range, 0.18–0.36).

Conclusions

No one symptom or test is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out perimenopause. Clinicians should diagnose perimenopause based on menstrual history and age without relying on laboratory test results.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

### Shorter reproductive time span and early menopause increase the risk of ACPA-negative inflammatory arthritis in postmenopausal women with clinically suspect arthralgia [^1155sKUB]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopausal factors

Information on menopausal factors was obtained with questionnaires at baseline. The relevant questions were: 'Are you in menopause yet?' and 'Have you had a menstruation the past year?'. Postmenopausal status was defined when patients reported being in menopause and clarified that they had not had a menstruation in the year before inclusion. From 333 women from both cohorts, 12% had missing menopause data. Baseline characteristics of patients with and without missing data differed only on symptom duration (Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online).

In the postmenopausal women, we studied the association of three factors related to the lifetime exposure to oestrogens during a woman's reproductive lifespan (that is, oestrogen exposure in levels that are present during menstrual cycles) with IA development. Total reproductive years were defined as the age at menopause minus the age at menarche. The age at menarche was derived from the question 'At what age did you get your first period?'. The total number of ovulatory years was defined as the age at menopause minus the age at menarche, minus the total number of children*0.75 (9/12 months of one year when women do not ovulate during a pregnancy), as described before. Finally, early menopause was defined as the age at menopause of ≤ 45 years, derived from the question 'At what age did you get into menopause?'. Unfortunately, information on the use of oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy was not available.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^111bzBFD]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnostic investigations — HCPs should diagnose POI based on the presence of spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles and biochemical confirmation. The guideline group recommends the following diagnostic criteria: disordered menstrual cycles (spontaneous amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles) for at least 4 months, and an elevated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration ≥ 25 IU/l. FSH assessment should be repeated after 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty, and FSH testing for the diagnosis of POI does not have to be timed to a specific day of the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy should be excluded in women presenting with amenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy (including oral, injectable, or long-acting contraceptives) may conceal or cause amenorrhea or irregular menstrual cycles, and potentially lower FSH concentrations; some hormonal therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive) may need to be ceased before a diagnosis of POI can be confirmed. Women who have had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 40 have a diagnosis of POI and additional diagnostic testing is unnecessary. The guideline group does not recommend diagnosing POI based on serum estradiol concentrations; however, a low estradiol concentration indicates hypoestrogenism, and in combination with an elevated FSH concentration, provides additional confirmation of the POI diagnosis.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents [^112WyvXe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abnormal and irregular bleeding are extremely common in the adolescent period and can be looked upon as a part of normal reproductive development. It is essential to have a firm grasp on the normal, physiologic development of the menstrual cycle. Prompt recognition and treatment of the situations that may indicate underlying disorders or diseases is possible. It is important to recognize the distinct needs, goals, and developmental stages of adolescent patients. No single therapy or approach is universal in the diagnosis and treatment, but must be tailored to the needs of the individual adolescent and her situation.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112wHGMT]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the reproductive condition after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. For a majority of women, menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years, as a result of the complex hormonal changes that accompany the reduction in ovarian follicles. Along with a drop in circulating hormone levels, menopause is often associated with the experience of hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness. Despite similar symptoms and the common name of menopause, there is, however, no single pathway to the end of menses. In fact, menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different health risks.

For a small but significant number of women, menopause occurs earlier than the normative age range. Included in this spectrum of menopauses is premature (younger than 40 y), early (between 40 and 45 y), and induced (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [BSO], the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, or ovarian ablation through radiation). These different menopause types have distinct hormonal changes both leading up to and after the cessation of menses, potentially leading to different health trajectories. Although not considered an induced menopause, hysterectomy with ovarian sparing has been shown to result in decreased ovarian function. Thus, using menopause as a blanket word to describe any "cessation of menses" erases these differences in the physiology, etiology, and health outcomes of the many menopauses.

### The association between menstrual cycle characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes in later life: a retrospective matched cohort study of 704, 743 women from the UK [^114vs2eJ]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Comparison with previous literature

A summary of the study characteristics of selected existing literature are provided in Additional file: Table S 8. Overall, results from our study support and expand existing literature that have examined the association between menstrual characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes. A UK prospective cohort study of 40,896 premenopausal women aged 50 years and below at baseline examined the association between irregular menstrual cycles and risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease. During a median duration of follow-up of 6.9 years (IQR: 6.2 to 7.6), no relationship was found between irregular menstrual cycles compared to regular menstrual cycles and risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD outcomes (Additional file: Table S 8). Three United States (US) prospective cohort studies that were all conducted by Wang et al. examined the relationship between menstrual cycle characteristics and cardiometabolic outcomes (CVD and diabetes mellitus) in a cohort of female nurses. The studies by Wang et al. typically defined menstrual cycle regularity as very regular, regular, usually irregular, and always irregular or no period, while cycle length was defined as ≤ 25 days, 26–31 days, 32–39 days, and ≥ 40 days. The most recent study by Wang et al. followed up 80,630 women for a period of 24 years to examine relationship between menstrual cycle regularity and risk of CVD (fatal and non-fatal). Compared to women who had very regular cycles at ages 14 to 17 years, 18 to 22 years, and 29 to 46 years, women with always irregular cycles or no periods at ages 18 to 22 and 29–46 age groups were at an elevated risk of CVD in later life (Additional file: Table S 8). In the second prospective cohort study, Wang and colleagues followed up 79,505 premenopausal women for a period of 24 years to evaluate the association between menstrual cycle characteristics and risk of premature mortality. Always irregular cycle or no period at ages 18–46 was associated with mortality from CVD (Additional file: Table S 8.). Wang et al. followed 75,456 participants followed for a period of 24 years to investigate the association between menstrual cycle characteristics and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both irregular menstrual cycles and menstrual cycle length of ≥ 40 days were associated with an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Additional file: Table S 8). A recent Australian study of 13,714 participants investigated the relationship between irregular menstrual cycles compared to regular menstrual cycles (never, sometimes, or rarely) and risk of non-fatal heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina). During the 20-year period of follow-up, irregular menstrual cycles compared to regular menstrual cycles were linked to higher risk of heart disease and diabetes mellitus (Additional file: Table S 8). We observed a relationship between frequent (short) but not infrequent (long) menstrual cycles and CVD. This contrasted with a US cohort study which found an association between long menstrual cycles but not short menstrual cycles and CVD. In the US study, compared to women with a menstrual cycle length of 26–31 days, the adjusted HRs for cardiovascular disease were as follows: 1.00 (95% CI 0.83–1.20) for cycle lengths of ≤ 25 days, 1.05 (95% CI 0.89–1.24) for cycle lengths of 32–39 days, and 1.30 (95% CI 1.09–1.57) for cycle lengths of ≥ 40 days or too irregular to estimate (Additional file: Table S 8). In our study, menstrual cycle frequency was classified as either frequent or infrequent. Our study could not differentiate menstrual cycle frequency by cycle length in days. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution given that the relationship between infrequent (long) menstrual cycles and CVD appears to be greatest with increasing length (≥ 40 days) in menstrual cycles, as suggested by the findings from the US study. The association between frequent (short) menstrual cycles and elevated CVD risk is biologically plausible. Frequent menstrual cycles are a marker of diminished ovarian reserve. Previous studies have reported a relationship between diminished ovarian reserve and elevated CVD risk.

### Time to the final menstrual period [^111A4RmU]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine, for a woman aged > 45 years, whether selected hormonal, health status, and demographic measures are related to the time to final menstrual period (FMP) from a point where 6 weeks separate the shortest and longest cycles experienced to date.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Volunteers in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Ninety-nine menstruating women aged 46 years to 55 years on entry completed menstrual diaries, gave annual blood samples, and were interviewed annually. They were observed for a mean period of 1.5 years. Seventy-seven reached FMP during observation.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Time to reach FMP from the date of a marker event-the difference between the longest and shortest of recent cycles reaching 6 weeks.

Result(S)

Women self-rating as in the transition have a greater "hazard" or probability of FMP at any time after the marker event. Allowing for this and other covariates, the hazard is estimated to increase by 30% (confidence interval [CI]: 10%, 60%) for each year of age and 50% (CI: 7%, 118%) for each unit increase in log FSH, measured at the time of the marker event.

Conclusion(S)

For women aged > 45 years, the time remaining in the menopausal transition from the day on which ≥ 6 weeks separate the longest and shortest recent cycles is related to self-rating of menopausal status and to serum FSH level. The median number of months remaining ranges from 11 for those with FSH of > 20 IU/L and who see themselves as in transition to 21 months for those with lower FSH and who notice little evidence of being in transition.

### Age at natural menopause and risk of incident cardiovascular disease: a pooled analysis of individual patient data [^117Pk8X3]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Natural menopause, defined as absence of menstruation over a period of 12 months, typically occurs between the ages of 49 and 52 years, but varies among different ethnicities, with a median age of 51.4 years in high-income countries. Menopause between age 40 and 45 years, usually defined as early menopause, occurs in around 5% of women. Premature menopause before 40 years (also known as primary ovarian insufficiency if periods stop spontaneously)affects about 1% of women.

Although early menopause has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all-cause mortality, few studies have examined the associations between a broad range of ages at menopause and risk of incident cardiovascular disease. For example, in a 2016 review and meta-analysis, the risk of incident cardiovascular disease was compared between women with early menopause and women with menopause at 45 years or older, which included both relatively early menopause (at 45–49 years) and late menopause (at ≥ 55 years). Women with early menopause (< 45 years) had a 50% increased risk (relative risk 1.50, 95% CI 1.28–1.76) of coronary heart disease, whereas the association between age at menopause and incident stroke was inconsistent. Women now live around one-third of their life span after menopause, and this period of time might be even longer for women with earlier menopause. In this context, it is useful to investigate the association between early or premature menopause and the incidence and timing of cardiovascular disease.

We searched PubMed from database inception until March 1, 2019, for observational studies published in English, using the search terms "menopause", "final menstrual period", "cardiovascular disease", "coronary heart disease", "myocardial infarction", "angina", and "stroke". We screened papers by title and abstract to identify full-text reports that were relevant to the study aims. We also screened citation lists from these full-text reports to identify other relevant research. The papers cited in this report were selected to be representative of the existing evidence base, and are not an exhaustive list of relevant research. Our search yielded more than 90 studies. We found previous evidence showing that early menopause is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, but the associations between a broad range of ages at natural menopause (including premature menopause [< 40 years]) and incidence and timing of first non-fatal cardiovascular disease event are unclear.

Family medicine clinicians and menstrual health

Family medicine clinicians care for people of all ages and life stages. They are on the front lines of preventative medicine and can be a great resource for patients trying to improve their quality of life through medical and lifestyle means. By caring for people across their lifespans, family medicine clinicians are well poised to address menstrual health with patients who menstruate. They may see their patients who menstruate when they first begin menstruating in adolescence, when they become sexually active, when they are trying to become pregnant, when they are trying not to become pregnant, when their periods begin to slow at perimenopause, and at all other times in between. Family medicine clinicians are trained to provide comprehensive women's health services and should include menstrual history as a vital sign to be addressed at routine visits. The scope of menstruation and menstrual wellness is expansive, with connections to family planning, sexual wellness, diet and exercise habits, and mental health. Patients can feel more in control of their bodies by understanding their menstrual cycle and its full-body impacts overall.

### Defining the menopausal transition [^1121F7Lr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Menopause signifies the permanent cessation of ovarian function and the end of a woman's reproductive potential. A universal experience in women's aging, it is the culmination of some 50 years of reproductive aging — a process that unfolds as a continuum from birth through ovarian senescence to the menopausal transition and the postmenopause. The menopausal transition is known to play a major role in the etiology of many symptoms common in middle age and may contribute to chronic conditions and disorders of aging such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying ovarian senescence and the occurrence of various short- and long-term biological and psychological sequelae are poorly understood. Progress in researching reproductive aging and the menopause has been impeded by the lack of a staging system based on meaningful, reliable, and objective criteria for staging reproductive aging and specifying menopause-related status. Current nomenclature is described and its limitations are discussed. Specifically, contemporary terminology lacks the sensitivity and specificity needed to operationally define a woman's reproductive status in the continuum of reproductive aging. A number of proposed staging systems are currently being evaluated for their suitability in identifying appropriate demarcations across the span of reproductive aging. Further research and a better understanding of the menopausal transition are necessary to establish the validity, practicality, and acceptability of these proposed staging systems.

### "Extracts from "Clinical evidence": menopausal symptoms [^113H8w8J]. BMJ (2000). Excellent credibility.

Definition

Menopause begins one year after the last menstrual period. Symptoms often begin in the perimenopausal years. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE: In the United Kingdom the mean age for the menopause is 50 years 9 months. The median onset of the perimenopause is between 45.5 and 47.5 years. One Scottish survey (of 6096 women aged 45 to 54 years) found that 84% had experienced at least one of the classic menopausal symptoms, with 45% finding one or more symptoms a problem. AETIOLOGY/RISK FACTORS: Urogenital symptoms of menopause are caused by decreased oestrogen concentrations, but the cause of vasomotor symptoms and psychological effects is complex and remains unclear.

Prognosis

Menopause is a physiological event. Its timing may be genetically determined. Although endocrine changes are permanent, menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, which are experienced by about 70% of women, usually resolve with time. However, some symptoms, such as genital atrophy, may remain the same or worsen.

Aims

To reduce or prevent menopausal symptoms, and to improve quality of life with minimum adverse effects.

Outcomes

Frequency and severity of vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological symptoms; quality of life.

Methods

Clinical Evidence search and appraisal December 1999. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews that met Clinical Evidence quality criteria.

### Menstruation: choosing whether… and when [^114Cckht]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

For many women in the United States, menstruation is a major health concern because menstrual disorders and other conditions that may be aggravated during menses (e.g., migraine headaches, epilepsy) carry substantial morbidity. Women today menstruate nearly 3 times as often as in primitive societies, and evidence suggests that frequent, repetitive menstrual cycles may increase health risks. Because the conventional 21/7 combination oral contraceptive (OC) regimen provides only limited relief for women with menstrual disorders, alternative OC regimens that reduce menstrual frequency have been proposed. A new OC formulation specifically designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to 4 times per year is currently under investigation. Most women welcome less frequent menses or even amenorrhea. Women who may derive particular benefit from reduced menstrual frequency include not only those with medical conditions directly caused or aggravated by menses, but also those serving in the military, female athletes, mentally-retarded women with menstrual hygiene problems, young teens, and perimenopausal women.

### Optimising health after early menopause [^1165eqt2]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The typical age at menopause is 50–51 years in high-income countries. However, early menopause is common, with around 8% of women in high-income countries and 12% of women globally experiencing menopause between the ages of 40 years and 44 years. Menopause before age 40 years (premature ovarian insufficiency) affects an additional 2–4% of women. Both early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency can herald an increased risk of chronic disease, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who enter menopause at younger ages might also experience distress and feel less supported than those who reach menopause at the average age. Clinical practice guidelines are available for the diagnosis and management of premature ovarian insufficiency, but there is a gap in clinical guidance for early menopause. We argue that instead of distinct age thresholds being applied, early menopause should be seen on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the average age. This Series paper presents evidence for the short-term and long-term consequences of early menopause. We offer a practical framework for clinicians to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause, which considers the nature and severity of symptoms, age and medical history, and the individual's wishes and priorities to optimise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^113yFc4m]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although midlife can be defined by age, identifying and classifying the menopausal transition is complex. The transition can last for years (mean duration = 4 years; range = 2–6 years; Harlow et al.) and the hormonal and physical markers can be difficult to assess. Many physical signs overlap with general age‐related changes (e.g. weight gain) and obtaining repeated measures of hormones to assess stage is costly. Postmenopause, defined as 1 year after the last menstrual period, is often easier to assess; however, contraceptives (e.g. intrauterine devices (IUDs) — t ‐shaped devices inserted into the uterus) and surgeries (e.g. endometrial ablation) that cause the cessation of menses can significantly complicate classification.

The STRAW+10 criteria (Harlow et al.) are currently the gold standard for menopausal staging. At first glance, these criteria appear straightforward, as they focus on the regularity and duration of menstrual cycles, without costly hormone assessments. Using these criteria, women are considered premenopausal when they are having regular menstrual cycles and are not taking medications that can induce regular cycles (e.g. hormonal contraceptives). Women are considered perimenopausal when they experience inter‐cycle changes (i.e. menstrual cycle length change ≥ 7 days for ≥ 2 consecutive cycles) and/or two consecutively skipped menses that are not due to medications, medical conditions, or surgeries (Harlow et al.). Women are considered postmenopausal after 12 consecutive months without menses — again, without the influence of medications, medical conditions, or surgeries (Harlow et al.). Vasomotor (i.e. hot flashes, night sweats) and other menopausal symptoms (i.e. brain "fog", vaginal dryness) are not used in phase staging due to significant individual variation, although they are much more common during perimenopause (Harlow et al.).

### The menopausal transition [^112SogCR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

A clear understanding of the physiology of the menopausal transition, clinical symptoms, and physical changes is essential for individualized patient management, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks for the present and the future. Menopause, defined by amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months, is determined retrospectively and represents a permanent end to menses. Many physical changes occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. Knowledge of symptoms and findings experienced by women undergoing the menopausal transition allow individualized care- improving quality of life and enhancing wellbeing for years to come.

4.4 Implications and future research

This paper provides novel insights into the acute and long-term relationship between mental health and unfavorable menstrual experiences, that can guide future research and ultimately support the improvement of menstrual health experiences for girls and women worldwide. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine long-term associations between mental and menstrual health over a 25-year period. Additionally, the age-homogeneity of the sample removes any age-related differences that are typically observed in menstrual symptom prevalence. Results from this study underscore the need for further research to unravel the intricate interplay between women's reproductive stage and the emotional factors affecting women's health and strengthen support for the investment in adolescent menstrual health interventions. Targeted research and evidence-based interventions, particularly in girls' formative years, offer the potential to alleviate the burden of unpleasant menstrual symptoms and to mitigate possible long-term consequences of severe psychological distress on women's reproductive health.

### Premenstrual disorders, timing of menopause, and severity of vasomotor symptoms [^1179eC3z]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Menopause Timing

On each biennial cycle, participants reported if they had permanent cessation of menstrual periods. They were provided with 4 answer options: no, yes (no periods), yes (being postmenopausal but still having periods induced by hormones), and not sure. Individuals who answered yes further provided their age at which periods ceased and the cause of menopause. Age at menopause was defined as age after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Early, normal, and late menopause were defined as age at menopause younger than 45 years, 45 to 54 years, and 55 years or older, respectively. For few participants who reported being postmenopausal on 1 cycle but being premenopausal in a following cycle, age at menopause was defined as age at which menstrual periods ceased for at least 1 year, and this status was confirmed on 3 subsequent questionnaires.

VMS

In 2009, 2013, and 2017, participants reported if they had hot flashes or night sweats (1) during the past 4 weeks and (2) at the beginning of menopause; if so, participants were asked to assess the severity as mild, moderate, or severe. VMS was defined as either report of (1) VMS in the past 4 weeks on any survey (assessed for all women) or (2) VMS at the beginning of menopause in the first cycle postmenopausal (limited to women who reported menopause during follow-up). These women were further classified as having mild VMS or moderate to severe VMS.

In addition, individuals who reported VMS at the beginning of menopause were asked about their duration of symptoms with the following options: less than 5 years, 5 to 9 years, or 10 or more years. This information was used to classify VMS duration into less than 5 years and 5 or more years.

Menopause and perimenopause definitions — Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle and is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period; perimenopause is the few-year time period preceding the final menstrual period, characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea and often vasomotor symptoms. US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

### Menstrual disorders in the college age female [^115Vkosn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

College-age young women frequently experience a variety of menstrual-related complaints, including dysmenorrheal, menorrhagia, irregular menses, and menstrual-related mood changes. These problems deserve careful evaluation; they may reflect normal ovulatory menstrual symptoms or be suggestive of significant pathology that can have a major impact on future reproductive and general health. The menstrual cycle is a vital sign whose normalcy suggests an overall good health and whose abnormality requires evaluation. Eating disorders and the female athlete triad increase the risk of osteoporosis; polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with future cardiovascular risks. Diagnosis and management of these problems will not only improve a young woman's current health, sense of well-being, and overall quality of life but may also lower her risks for future disease and ill-health. This article addresses normal menstrual function, excessive bleeding, infrequent or absent menses, pain with menses, menstrual-related mood disorders, and recommendations about routine gynecologic examinations and evaluation.

### Age at period cessation and trajectories of cardiovascular risk factors across mid and later life [^1179EVAe]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Type and timing of menopause

Information on menstrual irregularity, month and year of last menstrual cycle or any operation to remove the uterus or ovaries and monthly hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use was obtained from annual postal questionnaires between the ages of 47 and 54 years (inclusive), with an additional one at 57 years, and from the face to face interviews with nurses at 43, 53 and 60–64 years. Age at which periods ceased naturally (defined as a period of at least 12 months without menstruation) or because of bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), or because of hysterectomy with or without unilateral oophorectomy was calculated. We excluded women whose periods stopped for other reasons, such as chemotherapy (n = 37). We also excluded 189 women starting HRT before menopause who had not ceased HRT for at least a year before giving responses about period regularity and the timing of the last period because it was not possible to assign an accurate date of menopause among these women.

Potential confounders

We considered the following as potential confounders of the association between age at period cessation and CVD risk factors: socioeconomic position, parity, HRT use throughout follow-up, age at menarche, smoking at 36 years and physical activity at age 36 years. BMI at 36 years was considered as an additional confounder for blood pressure, lipids and HbA1c. The 36 year measures were selected for BMI, smoking and physical activity because these measures represent pre-menopausal measures for most women. Further information can be found in supplementary eAppendix 1.

Sample sizes

Of the original birth cohort of females (n = 2547), 1666 women were eligible for inclusion in analyses of blood pressure and anthropometry and 1563 women were eligible for inclusion in analyses of lipids and HbA1c. Of these women, only participants with a known date of period cessation, at least one measure of the risk factor and complete data on all confounders were included in analyses. Supplementary eFigure 1 and eTable 1 provide an overview of the study design and measures available.

### Period problems: disorders of menstruation in adolescents [^1128oZqj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Adolescence is a time of great psychological and physical change. In the UK, girls enter puberty around the age of 10 years with a median age of menarche of 12.9 years; thereafter, it may be several years before regular menstrual cycles are established. Variations in the type and the frequency of periods may create anxiety regarding ill health or serious underlying disorders. With the increase in childhood obesity and subsequent polycystic ovary syndrome, there is a greater awareness and presentation of girls with disorders of menstruation. This review focuses on normal variations of menses and common pathological causes of menstrual problems, including amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia. Further consideration is given to the variations of presentation of polycystic ovary syndrome. It provides a guide to evaluate the various symptoms, investigations and management options.

### Features of menstruation and menstruation management in individuals with Rett syndrome [^116dUhyD]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To describe features of menstruation, menstrual-related symptoms, and menstrual management in females with Rett syndrome (RTT) to help develop a clinical approach to these parameters in RTT.

Design

Retrospective cross-sectional chart review and prospective survey.

Setting

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Rett Syndrome and Related Spectrum Disorders Clinic.

Participants

Females with RTT (12–55 years of age) and their caregivers.

Main Outcome Measures

Descriptive data on features of menstruation and menstrual-related symptoms in individuals with Rett syndrome; prevalence, types, reason for use/discontinuation, and efficacy of hormonal treatment in females with RTT.

Results

Age at menarche, menstrual cycle length, and menstrual period length in females with RTT are comparable to those in typically developing females and females with other neurodevelopmental disabilities. Dysmenorrhea and emotional lability are common menstrual cycle-related changes among females with RTT; 22.1% of participants also reported catamenial seizures. Oral progestin, combined oral contraceptive pill, and depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) were effectively used to suppress or regulate menstruation and to manage menstrual-related symptoms.

Conclusions

Characteristics of menstruation in females with RTT are comparable to those of typically developing females, with the exception of increase in catamenial seizure activity. Hormonal treatments are used for management of menstruation, dysmenorrhea, and seizures. Choice of hormonal treatment is influenced by bone health and immobility in females with RTT.

### The timing of the age at which natural menopause occurs [^114We16w]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The timing of natural menopause is a clinically important indicator of longevity and risk of morbidity and mortality. Demographic, menstrual, reproductive, familial, genetic, and lifestyle factors seem to be important in this timing. Smoking, lower parity and poor socioeconomic status are associated with earlier menopause. However, a number of relationships have been inconsistent; others remain largely unexplored. Much remains to be learned about factors that affect follicular atresia and the onset and duration of perimenopause and the timing of the natural menopause. Knowledge about these relationships offers women and their health care providers enhanced understanding and choices to deal with menopause.

### Associations between psychological distress in adolescence and menstrual symptoms across life: longitudinal evidence from the 1970 British cohort study [^115sL22n]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

At age 30, severe PD was weakly associated with pre-menstrual tension only. Around this age, women are typically in their childbearing years and may therefore experience disrupted menstrual cycles, due to pregnancy or hormonal contraceptives, and therefore have a poorer recollection of menstrual symptoms. This is consistent with the decrease in the prevalence of unpleasant menstrual symptoms reported (see Table 1). Furthermore, unpleasant symptoms could temporarily cease due to the reasons noted above, to stabilization of menstrual experiences, or due to being unnoticed and thus under-reported.

Considering these insights and plausible pathways, it is important to acknowledge that PD may serve as an indicator of underlying depressive conditions, potentially overlapping with menstrual-related depressive symptoms. This overlap could exacerbate the sensitivity of the association between psychological distress and menstrual symptoms. Hence, further research is needed to disentangle the complex associations between clinical depression and exacerbated menstrual-related depressive symptoms.

4.3 Strengths and limitations

Key strengths of this study include the large age-homogenous sample size, ascertainment of multiple menstrual symptoms and the longitudinal study design. The majority of previous studies are limited to samples below 500 participants and informed by a single time point, which makes it difficult to contextualize their temporal relevance throughout the reproductive period. The present findings help to fill this gap as they are informed by a cohort of over 2000 individuals with menstrual symptom data from over a 25-year period (i.e. from age 16 to 42).

Study limitations include the binary menstrual health questions that were unable to capture the severity of symptoms nor the extent to which symptoms affect the participant's ability to carry out daily life activities. This information would be of value since it could help to understand which symptoms require most attention to improve women's menstrual experiences and their quality of life. Ascertainment of menstrual symptoms was not consistent across the three time points. Although reflective of secular understandings of menstrual symptoms at data collection timepoints, these differences limit the ability to infer age-dependent patterns about specific symptoms. Finally, the sample size was reduced due to a teacher strike at age 16 which impacted overall participation rates, individual-level missing or incomplete GHQ and menstrual health data across the three ages as well as overall attrition in the study (see Fig. 1). However, compared to low sample sizes of previous research, the relatively large sample is still viewed as a major strength of the data and there were minimal differences between the analytical sample and those excluded due to missing data.

### Committee opinion no. 651 summary: menstruation in girls and adolescents: using the menstrual cycle as a vital sign [^114TNqk9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite variations worldwide and within the U.S. population, median age at menarche has remained relatively stable-between 12 years and 13 years-across well-nourished populations in developed countries. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic conditions, nutrition, and access to preventive health care, may influence the timing and progression of puberty. A number of medical conditions can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, characterized by unpredictable timing and variable amount of flow. Clinicians should educate girls and their caretakers (eg, parents or guardians) about what to expect of a first menstrual period and the range for normal cycle length of subsequent menses. Identification of abnormal menstrual patterns in adolescence may improve early identification of potential health concerns for adulthood. It is important for clinicians to have an understanding of the menstrual patterns of adolescent girls, the ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal menstruation, and the skill to know how to evaluate the adolescent girl patient. By including an evaluation of the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign, clinicians reinforce its importance in assessing overall health status for patients and caretakers.

### Real-world menstrual cycle characteristics of more than 600, 000 menstrual cycles [^111NAagR]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design

The 'normal' menstrual cycle is conventionally classified as 21–35 days in length, frequent menstrual bleeding (polymenorrheic) cycles as being under 21 (very short cycles) and infrequent menstrual bleeding (oligomenorrheic cycles) as being over 35 days (very long cycles). In this study bleed length was defined as the number of consecutive days on which bleeding — not spotting — was recorded. Spotting is defined as very light bleeding (a few drops of blood) or brown/pink fluids. Users are instructed not to log very light bleeding just before the period as bleeding but to wait until the flow increases. The follicular phase was defined as the first day of recorded menstruation to the EDO. Luteal phase length was defined as the day after the EDO to the day before the next day of recorded menstruation. The per-user cycle length variation was defined as one standard deviation of a user's cycle lengths.

We calculated mean cycle length, duration of bleeding (bleed length), follicular phase length and luteal phase length in ovulatory cycles. The following cohort splits by cycle length were defined: very short cycles (15–20 days), short cycles (21–24 days), medium cycles (25–30 days), long cycles (31–35 days) and very long cycles (36–50 days). We calculated the same statistics as well as per-user cycle length variation for cohorts of ovulatory cycles by user age at registration (18–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39 and 40–45 years) and BMI (15–18.5, 18.5–25, 25–30, 30–35 and 35–50). We also calculated the mean proportion of ovulatory cycles as a fraction of all cycles recorded by the user in each of the age and BMI cohorts.

Owing to the very large sample sizes in this study, P values were not calculated since they can be very small even if differences between cohorts are of no clinical significance. Instead, effect size between two cohorts was estimated as a mean difference with a 95% confidence interval calculated from 200 bootstrapped cohort-sized randomly selected samples with replacement. Mean differences are also given as a percentage of the mean in the combined cohorts. Where linear regression is used, we quote the coefficient of the slope with a 95% confidence interval and R 2 value.

### Neighborhood vulnerability and age of natural menopause and menopausal symptoms among midlife women [^116CaQq4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Menopausal Outcomes

At the midlife visit (median [IQR] age, 51.6 [49.2–54.8] years), participants self-reported the presence and severity of 11 different menopausal symptoms over the past year, which were assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). The MRS evaluates somatic, psychological, and urogenital domains of menopausal symptoms. Each symptom was scored from none (0 points) to very severe (4 points), which was summed for a total score of 0 to 44 points. This validated approach has been shown to have high internal consistency and high test-retest reliability. We included women who completed at least 10 of the 11 items and calculated the total and domain-specific MRS scores. Participants also reported information on menopausal status annually using questionnaires, beginning at the 13-year follow-up visit until approximately 2 years after the midlife visit and, for those who had reached this milestone, age at menopause. Specifically, participants reported whether their menstrual periods had stopped for at least 12 months and, if so, the natural or secondary reason (ie, surgical, radiation, or chemotherapy).

It provided bleeding criteria for the early and late menopausal transition, recommended modifications to criteria for the late reproductive stage (Stage −3) and the postmenopause stage (Stage +1), provided information on the duration of the late transition (Stage −1) and early postmenopause (Stage +1), and recommended application regardless of women's age, ethnicity, body size, or lifestyle characteristics. STRAW + 10 provides a more comprehensive basis for assessing reproductive aging in research and clinical contexts, and application of the STRAW + 10 staging system should improve comparability of studies of midlife women and facilitate clinical decision making, while important knowledge gaps remain and seven research priorities are identified.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^113qHJwk]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer — definition of menopause and diagnostic criteria state that menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis, and is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea; natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 years. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact or may resume over time, with the likelihood of resuming after chemotherapy higher among those aged < 40 years. Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression; FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause, and FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy; Age ≥ 60 years; Age < 60 with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range; Age < 60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments; Age < 60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range. Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Classic studies of the endocrinology of the transition postulated the existence of inhibin in women to explain the observed increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels without a significant decrease in estradiol (E2). Descriptions were provided of cycle characteristics during the transition, emphasizing the unpredictability of the endocrine changes rather than the occurrence of an orderly and progressive decline in ovarian function. Women older than the age of 45 exhibited menstrual irregularity when the average number of primordial follicles per ovary decreased to approximately 100. Inhibin B is a major regulator of FSH secretion and a product of small antral follicles. Its levels respond to the early follicular phase increase and decrease in FSH. The age-related decrease in ovarian primordial follicle numbers, which is reflected in a decrease in the numbers of small antral follicles, leads to a decrease in inhibin B, which in turn leads to an increase in FSH, hypothesized to act as a stimulus to the maintenance of circulating E2 in the follicular phase until late in the transition. Concurrently, the concentrations of testosterone do not change significantly. Early follicular phase FSH levels in women reporting menstrual irregularity fluctuate markedly, with a more uniform increase in levels when no menses have occurred for at least 3 months. Anovulatory cycles occur at increased frequency in the last 30 months before final menses or menopause. In ovulatory cycles, FSH shows little, if any, increase, but anovulatory cycles are usually characterized by low levels of inhibin B, markedly increased levels of FSH, and low levels of E2. Thus, the heterogeneity of follicular phase FSH represents a mixture of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles. Longitudinal data indicate that both ovulatory and anovulatory cycles occur after entry into both the early and late menopausal transition and that ovulatory cycles occur even after final menses. There is no endocrine marker of menopause, which may be primarily an endometrial event. Using the hormonal concentrations in ovulatory cycles observed in women in mid-reproductive age as controls and comparing such concentrations in late reproductive age women older than 45 either continuing to cycle regularly or having entered the early or late menopausal transition, a gradual increase in follicular phase FSH and E2 and a decrease in inhibin B were observed in ovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles showed markedly increased FSH with low E2 and inhibin B. No specific endocrine change was characteristic of either the early or late menopausal transition, confirming the observations of previous studies regarding the unpredictability of cycle characteristics and hormone changes with the approach of menopause. Antimüllerian hormone correlates with follicle numbers and shows a large age-related decrease to reach undetectable levels at menopause. Thus, the marked decrease in follicle numbers during late reproductive age appears to predispose to erratic and unpredictable cycle characteristics, with normal ovulatory cycles continuing to occur episodically. There is no specific endocrine marker of the early or late transition, making measurements of FSH or E2 unreliable in attempting to stage an individual with regard to approaching menopause.

### Menstrual cycle changes as women approach the final menses: what matters? [^117TpPVe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Increased variability in menstrual cycle length marks the onset of the menopausal transition, with the likelihood of long cycles increasing as women approach menopause. This article describes the STRAW+10 bleeding criteria for recognizing onset of the early and late menopausal transition, as well as the specific bleeding changes a woman may experience during this life stage, including how women's bleeding experiences differ. The high probability of episodes of excessive and prolonged bleeding as women approach their final menstrual period is documented, as is the continuing probability of ovulation as women reach their final menstrual period.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) monitoring and discontinuation — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

The menopause transition is characterized by fluctuations and subsequent reduced production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone and the cessation of a woman's menstrual cycle. Defined as 12 months after the last period, the onset of the postmenopause typically occurs in a woman's 40s or 50s, with the average age of the final menstrual period in the United States being 51 years. An estimated 6,000 women in the United States reach menopause daily. Some individuals may experience early menopause before the age of 40 years due to certain illnesses and conditions that affect ovarian function, such as primary ovarian insufficiency and surgical removal of the ovaries, or other risk factors, including family history, smoking, and chemotherapy.

For many individuals, the hormonal changes that take place during perimenopause, the years leading up to menopause, are associated with physical and psychological symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood fluctuations, sleep disruptions, and cognitive challenges. Symptoms vary widely between individuals and are commonly misdiagnosed, resulting in delays in appropriate management of symptoms and disruption of day-to-day activities. Accumulating science about the menopause transition has revealed that this period can last up to 20 years. Some postmenopausal women are also at heightened risk for serious health conditions that increase after the final menstrual period, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Furthermore, because of increases in life expectancy, a woman's postmenopause phase may comprise up to 40% of her life. If an individual is not adequately prepared and/or symptoms are not well-managed, the menopause transition has the potential to exacerbate conditions that impair quality of life and life expectancy.
