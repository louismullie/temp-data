## Question

Ariel began fencing in 2006. If she was born in 1992 and has been fencing for 16 years, how old is she now?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how old Ariel is now, given that she was born in 1992 and has been fencing for 16 years since 2006. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the starting year of fencing and the duration to anchor the calculation. Then, I should verify the arithmetic to determine the current year. Next, I will calculate her age from her birth year. Finally, I should double-check for any inconsistencies and confirm the answer with a quick sanity check.

> Let me first confirm the key inputs: Ariel began fencing in 2006 and has fenced for 16 years, and she was born in 1992. I need to ensure I'm not mixing up start year and duration, but yes, the problem states 2006 start and 16 years of fencing, which sets the current year at 2006 plus 16 years, equal to 2022.

> Wait, let me verify the arithmetic before moving on: 2006 + 16 = 2022, so the current year is 2022. I should double-check that this aligns with the fencing duration claim, and it does, since 2022 minus 2006 equals 16 years of fencing.

> Next, I should calculate her age. If she was born in 1992, then in 2022 she would be 2022 minus 1992, which is 30 years old. Hold on, I should verify that subtraction: 2022 − 1992 = 30, so she is 30 years old now.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the answer might be 29 because I briefly considered whether the fencing duration might not span full calendar years, but that would only matter if the "16 years" were partial or if the current date were before her birthday in 2022. Since the problem doesn't specify a month and assumes full years of fencing, the straightforward calculation stands, and she is 30 years old in 2022.

> Final answer: Ariel is 30 years old now.

---

Ariel is **30 years old** now. She was born in 1992 and started fencing in 2006, so 2022 − 1992 = 30 years old. The 16 years of fencing confirms the current year is 2022 (2006 + 16 = 2022), which aligns with her age calculation.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Birth year**: 1992
- **Fencing start year**: 2006
- **Years fencing**: 16
- **Current year**: 2006 + 16 = 2022
- **Current age**: 2022 − 1992 = 30 years old

---

## Verification

The calculation is verified by confirming that the current year (2022) minus the birth year (1992) equals the age (30), and that the fencing duration (16 years) correctly spans from 2006 to 2022.

---

Ariel is **30 years old**.

### Introduction and sustained high coverage of the HPV bivalent vaccine leads to a reduction in prevalence of HPV 16 / 18 and closely related HPV types [^114bZJyV]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

This analysis allowed us to examine whether there is a statistically significant reduction of HPV 16/18, potential cross-reactive types or other high-risk HPV types associated with number of doses of vaccine received. In addition, we evaluated the common pairings of HPV types detected and how these differ between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated women by birth cohort. In those with more than two high-risk types present, all possible pairings were counted. We examined the robustness of our conclusions on the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing HPV 16/18 prevalence by conducting two sensitivity analyses: (i) limiting the analysis to those born in 1991 and 1992 (this removes the temporal bias that the unvaccinated are mainly those born in 1988–1990, but induces an out-of-school bias where the unvaccinated group is likely to be mainly those who had left school) and (ii) excluding the unvaccinated in 1991 and 1992 (this limits the out-of-school bias, but has unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals compared over different time frames).

### Rewetting does not return drained fen peatlands to their old selves [^112V4FFx]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Peatlands have been drained for land use for a long time and on a large scale, turning them from carbon and nutrient sinks into respective sources, diminishing water regulation capacity, causing surface height loss and destroying biodiversity. Over the last decades, drained peatlands have been rewetted for biodiversity restoration and, as it strongly decreases greenhouse gas emissions, also for climate protection. We quantify restoration success by comparing 320 rewetted fen peatland sites to 243 near-natural peatland sites of similar origin across temperate Europe, all set into perspective by 10k additional European fen vegetation plots. Results imply that rewetting of drained fen peatlands induces the establishment of tall, graminoid wetland plants (helophytisation) and long-lasting differences to pre-drainage biodiversity (vegetation), ecosystem functioning (geochemistry, hydrology), and land cover characteristics (spectral temporal metrics). The Paris Agreement entails the rewetting of 500,000km² of drained peatlands worldwide until 2050–2070. A better understanding of the resulting locally novel ecosystems is required to improve planning and implementation of peatland rewetting and subsequent management.

### Prevention of drowning [^115sNBzj]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Drowning-prevention strategies — the Haddon Matrix is used to organize interventions targeting the environment, the individual, and the agent, and experts generally recommend multiple "layers of protection" because no single strategy is sufficient; five major interventions are evidence based, including 4-sided pool fencing and life jackets.

### Prevention of drowning [^1139xKNn]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Pool fencing — evidence summary indicates high effectiveness: pool fencing is one of the most important prevention strategies to decrease drowning risk in swimming pools where children are not supposed to access water; compared with no fencing, installation of 4-sided fencing that isolates the pool from the house and yard has been demonstrated to decrease pool immersion injuries among young children by more than 50%, and a Cochrane meta-analysis found the odds ratio for a drowning in a fenced versus an unfenced pool was 0.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16–0.47).

### Prevention of drowning [^113auBJW]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Residential pool fencing — effectiveness and implementation — reports that 4-sided fencing that isolates the pool from the house and yard was superior to 3-sided fencing, with "an odds ratio of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07–0.44)". In an Australian study, 3-sided fencing had higher drowning risk than 4-sided fencing with "(incidence rate ratio, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.40–1.79)". An Australian inspection program "raised the rate of compliance with pool fencing laws from approximately 50% to 97%", and "in the 5 years after enactment of legislation to improve the effectiveness of pool fencing, the number of private swimming pool drowning deaths halved". Design considerations note that "chain-link fences were easily scaled by children, whereas ornamental iron bar fences proved more difficult to climb", and the text states "Fences should be at least 4 feet high, and no opening under the fence should be more than 4 inches (some building codes require a 5-foot fence…)".

### Prevention of drowning [^113wKZeS]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Residential pool fencing and gates — construction and operation standards and evidence indicate that vertical members of the fence should be less than 4 inches apart, gates should be self-closing and self-latching with the latch placed at least 54 inches above the bottom of the gate, the gate should open away from the pool and be checked often to ensure good working order, and the fence should not prevent a clear view of the pool. Pool gate alarms may provide additional protection, but no research exists on their efficacy.

### Age assessment: time for progress? [^11121VuG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Care provided to unaccompanied asylum seeking minors in Britain is currently compromised by the issue of age assessment. Existing guidelines are rarely followed leading to striking defects in the protection for a high risk group of children and adolescents.

### Prevention of drowning [^116Fqpez]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Prevention of drowning — environmental assessment when visiting others: Any time a young child visits a home or business where access to water exists, parents and/or guardians should carefully assess the premises to ensure that basic barriers are in place, such as sliding door locks and pool fences with closed gates in good working order, and ensure that supervision will be consistent with the preceding recommendations.

### Informed consent in decision-making in pediatric practice [^114wfKig]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Mature-minor doctrine and adolescent refusal of life-sustaining treatment — case law cited includes In re E.G. (1989), in which the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a 17-year-old with leukemia who was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith was mature and had the right to refuse blood transfusions; the judges observed that the age of majority "is not an impenetrable barrier that magically precludes a minor from possessing and exercising certain rights normally associated with adulthood". Belcher v Charleston Area Medical Center (1992) recognized the mature-minor doctrine and directed physicians to seek input from a mature minor; in that case a do-not-resuscitate order for a 17-year-old was written without patient discussion and he died without resuscitation. In the 13-year-old Daniel Hauser case, Hodgkin lymphoma had an estimated survival of 80% to 95% after standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and a 2009 Minnesota court found parental rights and religious belief less compelling than the state's need to protect the child and to proceed with necessary medical therapy. By contrast, a 14-year-old with leukemia, Dennis Lindberg, was allowed to refuse a blood transfusion after a 2007 court ruling and died within hours of the ruling. In 2006, a 16-year-old with lymphoma, Abraham Starchild Cherrix, successfully deferred standard therapy under a Virginia court ruling that quickly resulted in Virginia's 2007 "Abraham's Law" that allows adolescents 14 years of age and older a decision-making role in life-threatening conditions.

### Prevention of drowning [^113nQ1DC]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric drowning prevention — pool barriers, life jackets, lessons, lifeguards, and CPR — states that installation of 4-sided fencing (at least 4 ft tall) with self-closing and self-latching gates that completely isolates the pool from the house and yard is the most studied and effective strategy, preventing more than 50% of swimming-pool drownings of young children; life jackets are now also well proven to prevent drowning fatalities; some data reveal that swim lessons may lower drowning rates among children, including those 1 to 4 years of age; lifeguards and CPR training also appear to be effective; and data regarding other strategies such as pool covers and pool alarms are lacking.

### Prevention of drowning [^112UnYJY]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Prevention of drowning — adult supervision is described as an essential preventive strategy that should be close, constant, competent, and attentive; supervision includes examining unfamiliar environments for hazards, the ability to recognize and respond to a swimmer in distress, may be especially important for children with conditions that increase drowning risks such as ASD or seizures, and is paramount where barrier fencing is not possible; "water watchers" programs have not been evaluated, and at intervention pools a pilot program observed improved attention, proximity, and preparedness among parents of children aged 6 to 10 years but not significant changes among parents of younger or older swimmers.

### An age-period-cohort approach to studying long-term trends in obesity and overweight in england (1992–2019) [^113NFHoT]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study uses an APC model to investigate the prevalence of overweight and obesity over time in England covering a period of 28 survey years (1992–2019), 75 years of age (5–80 years old), and 24 groups of 5‐year birth cohorts (1909–2013). Our APC analysis found that the likelihood of living with obesity increased with age but more steeply between 18 and 69 years old, displaying a skewed inverted U‐shape among the adult population; it increased throughout the entire study period but faster between 1992 and 2001, and it increased to a larger extent among those born between 1989 and 2008 compared with older birth cohorts. The likelihood of having overweight showed an inverted U‐shape among children: it decreased at the ages of 16 and 17 years old but then increased between the ages of 18 and 69 years old; it experienced a small increase until 2013 but remained fairly similar during our study period; and it increased consistently within successive birth cohorts and peaked for those born between 2009 and 2013. Therefore, increases in the risk of obesity over time and a high risk of overweight among the youngest birth cohorts pose a big threat to the health of the English population.

Our results are consistent with other APC studies on obesity in the adult population showing an inverted U‐shape age effect among the population older than 18 years old and increasing with age for those younger than 18 years old, but interestingly, we found a decrease in overweight at 16 to 17 years old. The age at which obesity peaked in our study was similar to that found in a study for Australia, but it differed from studies in Ireland, the United States, France, Estonia, and New Zealand, where the peak was at a slightly younger age. This could be because most of these studies performed an APC analysis on continuous BMI rather than categories of BMI or because they covered a period earlier than that covered in our study (most covered periods before 2010), meaning that they covered an earlier stage in terms of aging population or a worsening situation in terms of obesity.

### 'To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts': the tobacco industry and the tea party [^114CQSeG]. Tobacco Control (2014). Low credibility.

The smokers' rights groups proved ineffectual at protecting tobacco industry interests, particularly at stopping local smoke-free laws and they were phased out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In a parallel effort, the industry broadened its reach by funding and collaborating with existing third-party advocacy organisations and institutes under a unified theme of freedom, choice and less government. In 1990, Tim Hyde, RJR director of national field operations, outlined a strategy for RJR to create 'a movement' resembling what would later emerge as the Tea Party by

build[ing] broad coalitions around the issue-cluster of freedom, choice and privacy…

… coalition-building should proceed along two tracks: a) a grassroots, organizational and largely local track; b) and a national, intellectual track within the D.C.-New York corridor. Ultimately, we are talking about a "movement", a national effort to change the way people think about government's (and big business') role in our lives. Any such effort requires an intellectual foundation–a set of theoretical and ideological arguments on its behalf.

Another RJR field coordinator later described the company's motivation for involving and organising third-party organisations: 'In about the third year [of the RJR smokers' rights groups], there was an emphasis on coalition building — anti-tax groups were a natural. You didn't have to defend your position on tobacco because a tax is a tax is a tax to these guys'. n 1992, Auxier, then at Burson-Marsteller, submitted a public relations strategy proposal to the Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, an industry effort to fight tobacco and other excise taxes. It read, 'Grounded in the theme of "The New American Tax Revolution" or "The New Boston Tea Party", the campaign activity should take the form of citizens representing the widest constituency base mobilised with signage and other attention-drawing accoutrements such as lapel buttons, handouts, petitions and even costumes'.

### Prevention of drowning [^111vyeDc]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Community interventions and advocacy — pediatricians should work with legislators and serve as a voice for children to pass policy that decreases drowning risk, including fencing, boating, life jackets, safety of aquatic environments, boating under the influence, and EMS systems, and should partner with public health and policy leaders to implement effective evidence-based interventions; pediatricians should use the term "nonfatal drowning" rather than "near drowning", educate that "dry" and "secondary" drowning are not medically accurate terms, and provide reassurance that mortal or fatal drownings do not occur at a later time in patients with no previous symptoms; pediatricians should partner with community groups to increase access to life jackets through life jacket–loaner programs and work with partners to provide access to programs that develop water-competency swim skills for all children, especially those from low-income and diverse families and those with developmental disabilities, and can identify and support high-quality, culturally sensitive, affordable programs.

### Impact of a high coverage vaccination rate on human papillomavirus infection prevalence in young women: a cross-sectional study [^117UfYUJ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the rate of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes in vaccinated (Gardasil [quadrivalent]) and unvaccinated cohorts of young women.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study, consisting of the comparison of the prevalence of HPV 16, 18, and other HR genotypes in 2183 women younger than 25 years, according to their birth year (born > 1994 [mostly vaccinated < 13 years]; born 1992–1994 [vaccinated at 17 years]; born < 1992 [not vaccinated/vaccinated > 17 years]), in a private laboratory.

Results

The rates of HPV 16, 18, 16/18, and others in the cohort born before 1992 (n = 331) were 6.3%, 1.5%, 7.9%, and 31.7%. In those born 1992–1994 (n = 901), the rates were 3.3%, 0.4%, 3.6%, and 32.5%; in the ones born after 1994 (n = 951), the rates were 0.7%, 0.2%, 0.9%, and 33.2%, respectively. There were no changes in the relative risk (RR) of HR-HPV infection by genotypes other than HPV 16/18 in any cohort. The RR was significantly reduced in the cohort born after 1994 for HPV 16 (0.12 [0.050–0.270], p < .0001), HPV 18 (0.14 [0.027–0.714], p = .02), and HPV 16/18 (0.12 [0.057–0.254], p < .0001). In those born 1992–1994, there was a nearly significant reduction in the RR of HPV 18 infection (0.29 [0.079–1.09], p = .07); the reduction was significant for HPV 16 (0.52 [0.305–0.904], p = .02) and HPV 16/18 (0.45 [0.274–0.747], p = .0018).

Conclusions

Young women vaccinated before 13 years had a nearly 90% risk reduction of HPV 16/18, whereas if vaccinated at 17 years, the decrease was of 50%. There was no impact in the nonvaccine genotypes. Our data highlight the importance of vaccinating at young age and of introducing vaccines covering more HR genotypes.

### Unrealised potential of pool fencing and life jackets to prevent US drownings [^117APdqJ]. Injury Prevention (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Drowning causes more than 4500 deaths annually and is the leading cause of death among children aged 1–4 years old in the USA. Isolation pool fencing (ie, four-sided fencing to limit access from all adjoining areas including residences and yards) and use of US Coast Guard-approved life jackets while boating can prevent drowning, but preventable deaths still occur. This study aimed to estimate the annual health and economic burden of drowning likely attributable to inadequate pool fencing and not wearing life jackets while boating to highlight the unrealised value of these known prevention strategies.

Methods

A simple mathematical model used the most recent annual number of drowning deaths by decedent age in combination with previous study data to estimate the number of drowning deaths that might have been prevented through: (1) adequate isolation fencing for swimming pools among children aged < 5 years old and (2) use of life jackets while boating for people of all ages. Prevention effectiveness estimates of pool fencing and life jackets were based on previous studies. Unit costs for drowning-related medical spending and avoidable mortality using the value of statistical life were from existing sources.

Results

Proper use of swimming pool isolation fencing and always wearing a life jacket while boating could prevent an estimated 348 US drowning deaths and an economic cost of US$4.5billion per year.

Conclusions

Highlighting the effectiveness of drowning prevention strategies can help inform public attention to this issue and support cost-effective public health decision-making.

### Effects of corrective exercises in adolescent fencers… [^112JCNGV]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Continue their usual fencing training throughout the study The study will help determine whether adding corrective exercises to standard training can improve function and performance in young athletes. This randomized controlled single-blind study investigates the effects of an 8-week Functional Corrective Training program on trunk muscle endurance, jump performance, and reaction time in adolescent fencers. Background and Rationale: Fencing is a dynamic sport that demands high levels of coordination, agility, strength, and cognitive processing. Due to its asymmetric and high-intensity nature, fencing may lead to movement pattern deficiencies, postural imbalances, and a higher risk of overuse injuries, particularly during adolescence-a critical period for neuromuscular development.

Functional Movement Screen is a validated tool used to identify these deficiencies, and Functional Corrective Training exercises based on FMS results aim to improve fundamental movement patterns, mobility, and stability. Participants aged 10–19 years, with at least three years of fencing experience and no current pain or recent injury, were randomly assigned to either the FCT group or the control group. Randomization was performed using SPSS software. The intervention group received an individualized 8-week FCT program designed using the FMS Pro 360 software based on each participant's FMS results. The program progressed weekly and was applied under supervision and as a home-based program. The control group continued their standard fencing training without additional corrective exercises. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria:

- Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years
- Practicing fencing for at least 3 years
- Currently pain-free in all body regions
- Able and willing to participate in regular training and assessment sessions

### An age-period-cohort approach to studying long-term trends in obesity and overweight in england (1992–2019) [^112ezKzC]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Age trajectories by 5‐year birth cohorts

We observed birth cohorts for between 6 and 28 survey years, with the longest series obtained for birth cohorts born between 1924 and 1978 and the shortest for birth cohorts born between 2009 and 2013. Of the 21 birth cohorts, 13 had 25 or more years of survey data. Birth cohorts born between 1999 and 2013 were observed mainly while aged less than than 18 years old.

Figure 2 showed that there was a marked decrease in the prevalence of healthy weight for all birth cohorts as they aged (Figure 2A). The decrease was especially steep between the ages of 15 and 35 years old, and it continued until around the age of 65, while for the prevalence of overweight and obesity there was an increase from the age of 5 up until the age of 65 years old (Figure 2B and 2C, respectively). Interestingly, the age trajectory of overweight prevalence was very similar among birth cohorts (Figure 2B). In terms of obesity, birth cohorts born between 1944 and 1968 showed a faster increase with age in obesity prevalence compared with others. The prevalence of obesity peaked for most birth cohorts around their most recent observation, with as high as 37% of their 5‐year birth cohort population classified as living with obesity in birth cohorts 1949–1953 and 1964–1968.

FIGURE 2
Age trajectories in healthy weight, overweight, and obesity by age for each 5‐year birth cohort in England using Health Survey for England, 1992–2019

APC estimation

Figure 3 graphically displays the results of our APC analysis, while full regression results can be found in Supporting Information Table S2 and S3. Period effects and age effects followed similar patterns as those observed in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. In terms of age effects, our model showed that, compared with healthy weight, the odds of both overweight and obesity increased with age, peaked at 69 years old, and then decreased. However, there was a small decrease in overweight at 16 years old (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.70–0.89) and 17 years old (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72–0.92) before a subsequent increase again after age 18 years (reference group), whereas the odds of living with obesity consistently increased with age.

### The effects of armed conflict on children [^115dDAFr]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Child recruitment restrictions and grave violations — A UN measure was adopted to prevent children younger than 18 years old from being recruited into or participating as combatants in hostilities; the optional protocol establishes 16 years old as the absolute minimum age for voluntary recruitment and requires that 16- and 17-year-old members of the armed forces do not take part in hostilities. The optional protocol was ratified by the US Senate in 2002, US law states that 16-year-old children may not enlist and that voluntary enlistment of 17-year-old children requires the consent of a parent or guardian, and as of 2007, US policy states that 17-year-olds may not be deployed to combat zones. The UN identifies 6 categories of human rights violations against children, known as the 6 grave violations, including killing and maiming, abduction, recruitment or use as soldiers, sexual violence, attacks against schools or hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access; the first 4 are direct acts against children and the last 2 are indirect actions related to health care and health workers, and commission of any constitutes a breach of international humanitarian law.

### Prevention of drowning [^1134TnkX]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Policy makers — drowning prevention recommendations: Policy makers should pass legislation or building codes to mandate 4-sided isolation pool fencing for new and existing residential pools at the local and state level, and local governments should inspect and strictly enforce pool fencing requirements because this has been shown to be effective in reducing drowning. Policy makers should work with recreation and boating agencies to support legislation mandating that life jackets be worn by adolescents and by caregivers of children when boating, and when adults model appropriate behavior by wearing life jackets, children and adolescents are more likely to do so as well. States and communities should pass legislation and adopt regulations to establish basic safety requirements for natural swimming areas and public and private recreational facilities (eg, mandate the presence of certified lifeguards in designated swimming areas). States and communities should enforce laws that prohibit alcohol and other drug use by all watercraft occupants, not just operators. State and local EMS personnel, medical examiners, health departments, and child-death–review teams should use consistent systematic reporting of information on the circumstances of drowning events, and periodic review of these data is critical in the development of drowning-prevention strategies appropriate for the geographic area. Local governmental agencies should adopt the Model Aquatic Health Code for swimming pools, with better inspection and enforcement of swimming-pool safety standards. Because we lack a robust evidence base, a coordinated research agenda must be established to inform future policy, and federal funding should be secured to advance this research.

### Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age [^111ZH5xn]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.

### Preventing suicide by jumping: the effect of a bridge safety fence [^111KBPZo]. Injury Prevention (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of a bridge safety fence in preventing suicide.

Methods

We examined suicides from jumping off the Memorial Bridge in Augusta, Maine, from 1 April 1960 to 31 July 2005. The safety fence was installed during 1983, the mid-point of the study period.

Results

14 suicides from the bridge were identified; all occurred before installation of the safety fence. The number of suicides by jumping from other structures remained unchanged after installation of the fence.

Conclusion

The safety fence was effective in preventing suicides from the bridge. There was no evidence that suicidal individuals sought alternative sites for jumping.

### Healthy working life expectancy across birth cohorts in the United States [^1121hnk7]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design and participants

Data comes from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 2024), a longitudinal panel study representative of the older population in the United States. The HRS survey has been conducted every 2 years since its inception in 1992. This survey follows a birth cohort sampling plan, where a new cohort is added to the initial sample every 6 years. The target population HRS is individuals aged 51 and older and their spouses.

For this study, data from waves 1–15 collected between 1992 and 2020 were used. Taking advantage of the HRS cohort sampling plan, we identified three birth cohorts: the HRS cohort, the War Babies (WBs), and the Early Baby Boomers (EBBs). The initial HRS cohort consists of individuals born between 1931 and 1941 who were aged 51–61 in 1992. The WBs were added in 1998 and include individuals born between 1942 and 1947, while the EBBs were added in 2004 and contain individuals born between 1948 and 1953. Individuals from the HRS cohort born between 1931 and 1935 (inclusive) were excluded from the sample because they entered the survey at ages 56 and older, and the initial part of their work histories is thus missing. Spouses of participants under 51 years of age were also excluded until they reached age 51. Our study sample included individuals who responded to at least two waves and had valid information on gender and education.

### The effectiveness of installing trackside fencing in preventing railway suicides: a pre-post study design in victoria, Australia [^115KNgVP]. Injury Prevention (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Over the period January 2008 to June 2021, we identified 103 railway suicides that occurred within a 1000 metre radius of the mid-point of a site where fencing was installed (table 1).

Table 1
Number of railway suicides occurring within a 500 metre and 1000 metre radius of fencing sites and rate ratios (RR) comparing the pre- and post-intervention periods, Victoria, January 2008 to June 2021

When we examined all sites (regardless of the length of fencing installed), we found no evidence that the number of railway suicides within a 500 metre radius or a 1000 metre radius of a fencing site decreased after the installation of fencing (500 m RR: 0.52; CI 95% 0.14–1.44; 1000 m RR: 0.60; CI 95% 0.28–1.16) (table 1).

However, there was evidence that when the fencing was 100 metres or longer the incidence of railway suicide decreased by 57% within a 1000 metre radius of fencing sites (RR: 0.43; CI 95% 0.15–0.99).

FeNO measurement acceptability, setting, and access — The acceptability of FENO measurement to individuals with a potential diagnosis of asthma is likely to be high because the test involves minimal effort and does not incur discomfort or side effects, and publications did not report any overt harms; however, most studies conducted FENO measurements only in specialty care research settings with few data on primary care use, and the cost of FENO equipment and testing may limit broader use, with barriers to broader dissemination potentially reducing availability and leading to less equitable care for populations with limited resources.

### Prevention of drowning [^1111zyr2]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Fixed and portable aboveground pools — pediatric drowning risk and prevention are detailed with U.S. data and safety measures: From 2014 to 2016, there were, on average, 363 fatalities each year associated with pool or spa drownings involving children younger than 15 years, with aboveground pools accounting for 19% and portable pools for 5%. The CPSC recommends that all home pools, in-ground and aboveground, have a barrier, optimally 4-sided isolation fencing; the pool structure can serve as a barrier if the walls of the pool are high enough to meet the recommended 48-inch height for barrier fencing, and the CPSC also recommends that, if the pool walls are not high enough, the steps or ladder leading to the pool be secured, locked, or removed or surrounded by a barrier to prevent access when the pool is not in use. Children can enter the pool using the pool ladder (68%) or by climbing on a nearby object (20%), and in a study of aboveground pools, children between 42 and 54 months of age were shown to be able to climb into a pool with a 48-inch wall, even if the ladder was removed. It is important to stress that no single intervention is fully protective; rather, multiple layers of protection are recommended, industry is advised to develop affordable and effective products that include isolation fencing, safety covers, and alarms for portable pools, extensive public education should stress that children can drown in portable pools, and these efforts should be combined with strategies that reduce drowning risk, such as close supervision, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) education, and methods to prevent unsupervised children from gaining access to these pools; the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published a standard (F 2666–16) for aboveground pools for residential use that addresses structural integrity, sanitation, electrical safety, and safety message labeling.

### Beyond newborn survival: the world you are born into determines your risk of disability-free survival [^114By1T7]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

In low-income countries, for 40 million births in facilities, let alone the 50 million home births (the fourth and most invisible world), the vast majority of the burden of disease is attributable to deaths rather than to disability; yet here too, these are mainly preventable. More than three quarters of the world's 2.9 million neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, mainly among babies born beyond 32 wk gestational age, who are dying needlessly, e.g. due to infections and yet are not receiving antibiotics. These global numbers do not include 2.6 million third-trimester stillbirths, an estimated 1.2 million of who die during labor. Progress in reducing neonatal mortality (1.8% per year) is lagging behind that for maternal deaths (4.2% per year) and postneonatal deaths (2.3% per year). Reducing neonatal deaths is increasingly recognized as a public health priority in countries largely because of the impact that these deaths have on our potential to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4. Now, with 44% of all under-five deaths occurring in the first month of life (the neonatal period), reducing neonatal deaths is rising to the top of the child survival agenda.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^114NCrfC]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Residential swimming pools and spas — childproofing guidance from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) outlines "layers of protection", including "limiting pool access, using pool alarms, closely supervising children, and being prepared in case of an emergency". Fences and walls should be "at least 4 feet high" around the pool; the fence should be "no more than 2 inches above grade" with openings "a maximum of 4 inches". Fence gates "should be self-closing and self-latching", with the latch "out of a small child's reach"; the gate "should open away from the pool" and "the latch should face the pool". Doors with direct pool access "should have an audible alarm that sounds for 30 seconds"; the alarm control "must be a minimum of 54 inches high and reset automatically". If the house forms one side of the barrier, doors "should be protected with alarms that produce a sound when a door is opened". Young children who have taken swimming lessons "should not be considered "drown proof"; young children should always be watched carefully while swimming". A "power safety cover — a motor-powered barrier that can be placed over the water area — can be used when the pool is not in use". "Rescue equipment and a telephone should be kept by the pool; emergency numbers should be posted. Knowing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be a lifesaver". For aboveground pools, steps and ladders "should be secured and locked or removed when the pool is not in use". "Babysitters should be instructed" about hazards and the need for constant supervision, and "if a child is missing, the pool should always be checked first". Pool alarms "can be used as an added precaution", including underwater types "in conjunction with power safety covers"; CPSC "advises consumers to use remote alarm receivers".

"This role will only be performed effectively if the information provided is comprehensible. The doctor's duty is not therefore fulfilled by bombarding the patient with technical information which she cannot reasonably be expected to grasp, let alone by routinely demanding her signature on a consent form".

This article therefore reviews what is known about how doctors can best communicate evidence so that patients can make informed decisions based on them, as the Montgomery Judgement demands. At first glance, it might seem that this should be a relatively simple question to answer, but there are a couple of big underlying problems.

### High hopes: lower risk of death due to mental disorders and self-harm in a century-long US olympian cohort compared with the general population [^116K5Ytk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk of death due to prominent mental disorders, substance abuse, and self-harm among US Olympians compared with the general population.

Methods

All female (n = 2301) and male (n = 5823) US Olympians who participated in the summer or winter Games between 1912 and 2012 were followed until 2016. The National Death Index certified their vital statuses and causes of death. We performed a Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR) analysis for all causes studied and applied the years-saved (YS) method to quantify differences in the risk of death for (1) anxiety, depression and self-harm and (2) substance abuse and eating disorders. Additionally, we examined the YS across sports with greater than 100 total deaths and between medalists and non-medalists.

Results

US Olympians had a 32% (SMR = 0.68, 95%CI 0.49 to 0.91) lower risk of death compared with the general population, resulting in a longevity advantage of 0.21 YS (95%CI 0.14 to 0.29) for deaths by depression, anxiety and self-harm and 0.12 years (95%CI 0.08 to 0.15) for substance abuse and eating disorders. There were no significant differences between medalists and non-medalists, but findings varied by sports. Most sports (eg, athletics, swimming, rowing) had significantly lower risks of deaths than the general population with the exceptions of fencing and shooting. Shooting showed a trend towards a higher risk through suicide by firearm.

Conclusion

Olympians have a lower risk of death, favouring an increased longevity compared with the general population for mental disorders, substance abuse and suicides.

### Caring for a major government official: challenges and lessons learned [^115zEYzQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Analysis of the medical, organizational, and administrative issues surrounding the care of a dignitary in an intensive care unit.

The Story

On January 4, 2006, Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister was emergently admitted to the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem owing to a severe intracranial hemorrhage. Immediately following his admission, he underwent an extensive neurosurgical procedure to control the bleeding. Thereafter, he required intensive care for 5 months and underwent additional procedures. This admission presented organizational and administrative challenges.

Organization Of Medical Care

The major challenge was to provide the Prime Minister with the best medical care while avoiding the "very important person syndrome" and simultaneously continuing routine hospital activities. To coordinate his complicated medical management, a consultation forum was established composed of all the physicians directly involved in Mr. Sharon's care. Additionally, a senior intensivist was chosen to coordinate the medical care and, along with a physician from the hospital administration, assist with administrative issues.

Administrative Aspects

Among the issues that the coordinating team addressed, with the help of many other hospital services, included patient confidentiality vs. public information, security of the patient's medical chart (including laboratory data and imaging), and coordination with security personnel.

Conclusion

The acute care of a major governmental official requires the medical staff to address many administrative issues, while providing the "very important person" patient with appropriate intensive medical care. This article presents a strategy for addressing these issues.

### Born just a few weeks early: does it matter? [^111kmK5U]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Until recently, infants born at moderate preterm (32–33 weeks) and late preterm (34–36 weeks) gestations have gone largely unstudied. Since their outcomes were thought to be similar to those of infants born at 37 weeks and above, they have historically been managed in much the same way as infants born at term. However, accumulating data indicate that risks of morbidity and mortality are significantly greater in this group than previously believed. Since moderate and late preterm infants account for around 6% of all births, very large numbers of babies are potentially affected. Although their problems may be less obvious than those of extremely preterm infants, the population impact of long-term health and neurodevelopmental problems in this group will be substantial. This review summarises the current available literature, highlights gaps in knowledge and discusses the implications of late preterm birth for both clinical practice and research in the perinatal period and beyond.

### Selective internal radiation with Y-90 resin microspheres (SIRT) for liver metastases of gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy [^114iBCij]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Administration of locoregional radiation therapy using Y-90 has a history dating back to the 1950s in the setting of inoperable hepatocellular cancer (HCC) accessible by an intraarterial approach. Ariel et al. in 1950 used ceramic or glass microspheres with Y-90 sometimes in combination with intraarterial chemotherapy. The method was not much in use after the 1980s with radiofrequency or microwave ablation (RFA) offering a less sophisticated and less invasive approach, however the power of the pure high-energy β-emitter was judged to be more promising than transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for several tumor types in the decade from 1999 to 2009.

For soft tissue sarcomas (STS), only scarce data on SIRT were published. A recent study reported on 39 patients with primary (n = 2) or metastatic liver sarcoma (n = 37) treated from 2006 to 2015. GISTs were excluded from the study due to their response to imatinib and in 14 different subtypes of STS the objective response rate was 36%. Testa et al. treated two patients with liver metastases of GIST amongst 35 STS patients with liver-dominating progression resulting in a median OS of 20 months (95% CI: 13.9–26.1 months), while median H-PFS was 9 months (95% CI: 6.2–11.8 months). The objective response rate was 56.7%, and the disease control rate assessed by mRECIST at 3 months was 80.0%. No details were mentioned about the GIST patients and different response assessment criteria were used which complicates a comparison of treatment results.

### Frailty: understanding the difference between age and ageing [^1133PFi3]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

In the past, illness and dependence were viewed as inevitable consequences of old age. Now, we understand that there is a difference between age (the passing of chronological time) and ageing (the increased risk of adverse outcomes over time). Over the last 50 years, 'frailty' research has established that ageing is heterogeneous, variable and malleable. Significant advances have been made in frailty measurement (description of clinical features and development of clinical models), mechanisms (insights into pathogenesis) and management (development of interventions to reduce and/or prevent progression). Subsequently, the concept of frailty has informed health policy and clinical practice and started to change perceptions of older age held by the general public and the health sector. Here, we overview key achievements in frailty research and clinical practice and highlight the considerable number of known unknowns that may be addressed in the future.

### Interventions associated with drowning prevention in children and adolescents: systematic literature review [^114U6UKD]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Drowning remains a leading cause of preventable death in children across the world. This systematic review identifies and critically analyses studies of interventions designed to reduce fatal and non-fatal drowning events among children and adolescents or reduce the injury severity incurred by such incidents.

Methods

A systematic search was undertaken on literature published between 1980 and 2010 relating to interventions around fatal and non-fatal drowning prevention in children and adolescents 0-19years of age. Search methods and protocols developed and used by the WHO Global Burden of Disease Injury Expert Group were applied.

Results

Seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Interventions were categorised into three themes of Education, Swimming Lessons and Water Safety, and Pool Fencing. All are possible effective strategies to prevent children from drowning, particularly young children aged 2-4years, but very little evidence exists for interventions to reduce drowning in older children and adolescents. There were methodological limitations associated with all studies, so results need to be interpreted in the context of these.

Conclusions

Relatively few studies employ rigorous methods and high levels of evidence to assess the impact of interventions designed to reduce drowning. Studies are also limited by lack of consistency in measured outcomes and drowning terminology. Further work is required to establish efficacy of interventions for older children and adolescents. There is a need for rigorous, well-designed studies that use consistent terminology to demonstrate effective prevention solutions.

### Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among women born in the 1990s vs the 1980s and association with HPV vaccination in the US [^116gAJJA]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Results

The study sample comprised 2698 women 18 to 26 years old (mean [SD] age, 21.5 [2.7] years; 879 [32.6%] White individuals). The prevalence of HPV-16/18 among participants born in the 1990s was statistically significantly lower (5.6%; 95% CI, 4.0%-7.2%) than those born in the 1980s (12.5%; 95% CI, 10.2%-14.7%; Figure, A). During the 2015−2016 cycle, 55% of women 18 to 20 years old, 52% of those 21 to 23 years old, and 50% of those 24 to 26 years old had received 1 or more doses of HPV vaccine. Among women 18 to 26 years old, HPV-16/18 prevalence before vaccination introduction (2005–2006 cycle) was 15.2% (95% CI, 11.2%-19.1%). In the recent (2015–2016) period, this percentage had declined to 3.3% (95% CI, 1.3%-5.3%) overall — 5.1% (95% CI, 1.2%-9.1%) among unvaccinated and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.0%-2.5%) among vaccinated groups (Figure, B and C). Prevalence of HPV-16/18 infection in the recent (2015–2016) period was 0% among unvaccinated and vaccinated women 18 to 20 years old.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^116rAyhR]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — fertility, aging, and timing of evaluation: Fertility is defined as the capacity to produce a child and declines with age in both women and men, but the effects of age are much more pronounced in women; fertility is decreased by about half at age 40 compared with women in their late 20s and early 30s, and there is an age-related decline in the chances of pregnancy and live birth with increased risk of aneuploidy and miscarriage with maternal aging. In Hutterites, pregnancies occurred rarely during the 40s, with the average age at last pregnancy just before turning 41 years old. Markers of ovarian reserve decline with increasing age but are poor predictors of fecundity in noninfertile women. Although semen parameters decline detectably after 35 years of age, male fertility does not appear to be appreciably affected before the age of approximately 50. Infertility is a disease defined as the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected vaginal intercourse, and earlier evaluation and treatment is warranted after 6 months without conception for women aged 35 years and older due to the age-related decline in fertility.

### The enhancer RNAactivates the oncogenic transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^113wKQa9]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-ALL. ARID5B is one of the critical downstream targets of TAL1, which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the noncoding RNA, ARID5B-inducing enhancer associated long noncoding RNA (ARIEL), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that ARIEL is specifically activated in TAL1 + T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with ARID5B enhancer activity. ARIEL recruits mediator proteins to the ARID5B enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of ARID5B, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the MYC oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of ARIEL Knockdown of ARIEL inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that ARIEL plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.

### Quality of life and socioeconomic and educational status in patients with congenital hypothyroidism [^1177Ezhy]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 1987 and 2017, 1,843,502 children were born alive in Finland. We identified 566 patients with CH of whom 250 turned 16 by the end of the study. Characteristics of these patients and their matched controls are described in Table 1. Forty of them turned 25 years old (i.e. were born between 1987 and 1992) by the end of the year 2017. There were no differences in the socioeconomic or marital status between CH patients and their matched controls (Table 2) at the age of 25 years. Three CH patients (8.6%) and 14 controls (21%) had a higher tertiary level education, whereas secondary education was the highest level of education for 60% of CH patients and 47% of controls. These differences were not statistically significant. Both groups received social security benefits similarly. The need for special education was studied in subjects aged 16 years or older (born between 1987 and 2002) resulting in a population of 250 CH patients and 499 controls. 14% of CH patients and 10% of controls needed special education. This difference was not statistically significant either (Table 3).

### An age-period-cohort approach to studying long-term trends in obesity and overweight in england (1992–2019) [^117MymVq]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

This study aims to understand long‐term trends in obesity and overweight in England by estimating life‐course transitions as well as historical and birth cohort trends for both children and adults.

Methods

Data on individuals aged 5 to 85 years old from the Health Survey for England were used, covering the period 1992 to 2019 and birth cohorts born between 1909 and 2013. Individual BMI values were classified as healthy weight, overweight, or obesity. Trends were compared, and an age‐period‐cohort model was estimated using logistic regression and categorical age, period, and cohort groups.

Results

There was significant variation in age trajectories by birth cohorts for healthy weight and obesity prevalence. The odds of having obesity compared with a healthy weight increased consistently with age, increased throughout the study period (but faster between 1992 and 2001), and were higher for birth cohorts born between 1989 and 2008. The odds of having overweight showed an inverted U‐shape among children, increased through adulthood, have been stable since 2012, and were considerably higher for the youngest birth cohort (2009–2013).

Conclusions

Younger generations with higher overweight prevalence coupled with increasing obesity prevalence with age suggest that obesity should remain a high priority for public health policy makers in England.

### Temporal trends in impairments of physical function among older adults during 2001–16 in Sweden: towards a healthier ageing [^112Jezof]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our results suggest a trend towards less functional impairment in older adults, in the most recent 6 years. The improvements appear to be driven by improved prognosis among those without impairments rather than any substantial changes in prognosis for those with impairments.

Our findings are consistent with a few other studies that have also reported improvements in physical functioning of older adults. For instance, a Swedish study found a stable trend in walking speed limitation, with a tendency towards improvement, when comparing two cohorts of Swedish 75-year olds born 18 years apart. However, this study used only one objective measure of physical performance, one age cohort and two time points, the most recent of which was more than 10 years ago. A German study found steady levels in physical functioning from 2006 to 2012 for adults aged 65–90, with a tendency towards improvement in functioning for those aged 75–90. This study examined a range of ages, however again only two time points were assessed, and the measure of physical functioning was self-reported. Furthermore, a Swedish study examining temporal trends from 1992 to 2011 found a tendency towards a decline in impaired mobility and impaired physical function from 2002 to 2011. However, although a range of ages were included in the study population, there were no stratified analyses based on age. Also, physical function was assessed by self-report.

### Epidemiology of time-loss injuries in international fencing: a prospective, 5-year analysis of FéDération internationale D' escrime competitions [^111xxWvT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The study aimed to determine the risk of time-loss injuries in international fencing and to characterise their type, location, severity and mechanism. Variations in risk associated with sex and discipline categories are also examined.

Methods

Data on participation and withdrawal due to injury from 809 competitions comprising the major events of the 2010–2014 seasons (inclusive) for the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime were compiled from official results. Athletes who withdrew due to injury sustained in each competition were contacted individually to obtain follow-up information including time lost from fencing participation (practice/competition) and sequelae.

Results

A total of 176 injuries were recorded from 637776 athlete exposures (AEs) in 85686 participants (men = 47869; women = 37817) over the study period, for an overall incidence of 0.28/1000 AEs (95%CI 0.24 to 0.32). Men had significantly greater risk than women (RR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.94); épée had a significantly lower risk than foil or sabre (RR = 0.52, 95%CI 0.35 to 0.76; RR = 0.47, 95%CI 0.32 to 0.69, respectively). The majority of injuries were sprains (40.8%) and strains (20.1%), which occurred in the lower extremities (72.4%); ankle sprains were the most common specific injury (25.3%). Intrinsic effort of the fencer (non-contact injury) was the most common mechanism related to a time-loss injury (47.1% of cases). The overall median time loss was 4 weeks; 32.1% of the injuries involved 2 weeks or less away from fencing participation.

Conclusion

The data indicate that the risk of time-loss injury in international fencing is very low and primarily involves sprains and strains in the lower extremity.

The first of this pair of papers outlined what a clinical decision rule is and how one should be created. This section examines how to use a rule, by checking that it is likely to work (examining how it has been validated), understanding what the various numbers that tell us about "accuracy" mean, and considers some practical aspects of how clinicians think and work in order to make that information usable on the front lines.

### Short-term and long-term mortality risk after preterm birth [^116TKB5T]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do individuals born preterm have a higher risk of short-term and long-term mortality compared with those born at term?

Findings

In this cohort study of 4 998 560 births, individuals born preterm had a higher risk of mortality from birth to age 36 years, with the highest risk observed from birth through early childhood. The risk of mortality varied by gestational age at birth and was more pronounced at lower gestational ages.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that preterm birth is associated with increased risk of death from infancy to adulthood.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111jDgh2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) monitoring evidence summary — In the Expert Panel's judgment, the benefit of FENO monitoring is moderate, with FENO testing associated with a meaningful decrease in exacerbations, whereas the average benefit for asthma control and quality of life did not achieve the minimal clinically important difference and the certainty of evidence for these measures is low; for exacerbations defined as a composite end point, the certainty of evidence is high and the composite end point was defined as any of the following: unscheduled visits to the provider's office, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, oral corticosteroid use, reductions in FEV1 or peak expiratory flow, symptom-associated lung function decline, or Global Initiative for Asthma guideline definitions; studies comparing management strategies that include FENO monitoring with those that do not include 6 RCTs in 1536 adults (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.86) and 7 RCTs in 733 children (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.82), with adults showing an absolute risk reduction of 71 exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 108 to 25 fewer exacerbations) and children showing 116 fewer exacerbations per 1000; when exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids are used, based on 10 RCTs in 1664 adults and children the certainty of evidence is moderate with OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90 and an absolute risk difference of 67 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 104 to 19 fewer exacerbations); for exacerbations resulting in hospitalization, 9 RCTs in 1598 adults and children show OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32–1.55 and an absolute risk difference of 11 fewer exacerbations per 1000 individuals with asthma (range of 25 fewer to 19 more exacerbations); no evidence-based FENO cutoff points are available and the Expert Panel has not provided an algorithm to use for this purpose.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^114GXxRQ]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) terminology — origin, definition, and current status — SIDS was first coined and defined by Dr Bruce Beckwith in 1969, who defined SIDS as "the sudden death of any infant or young child, which is unexpected by history, and in which a thorough post-mortem examination fails to demonstrate an adequate cause for death". Sudden refers to the fact that death comes without warning, and unexpected means that there was no preexisting condition known that could have reasonably predicted it. The term SIDS and its definition were subsequently adopted internationally, allowing researchers and policymakers to establish a scientific research agenda to explore its epidemiology and etiology, but even with wide acceptance, SIDS remains a diagnosis of exclusion without clearly defined objective criteria.

### Is the increase in childhood asthma coming to an end? Findings from three surveys of schoolchildren in Rome, Italy [^115ZMajA]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Time trends in the prevalence of asthma, family history of asthma and atopy in Roman schoolchildren were assessed. The study population consisted of all children (aged 6–14 yrs) attending two primary schools in Rome, situated in urban areas that differed markedly in socioeconomic conditions and environmental pollution. Three questionnaire-based surveys were conducted in 1974, 1992 and 1998 in 2,259, 1,229 and 1,139 children. The prevalence of asthma in males and females increased significantly during 1974–1992 and remained stable from 1992–1998. In age groups born in the subsequent 4-yr periods it increased almost linearly, for children born from 1962–1965 to 1982–1985 (4.4%-12.5%), and remained remarkably stable in children born after 1985. Because the prevalence of asthma had a steeper trend in males than in females (approximately 0.55% x yr(-1) versus 0.25% x yr(-1)), the male:female asthma ratio increased (1:38 in 1974; 1:84 in 1992 and 1:62 in 1998). No single environmental factor, including area of residence, seemed to influence the prevalence of asthma. Family history of asthma and atopy also increased steadily (0.72% x yr(-1) and 0.30% x yr(-1) respectively) more than doubling during the 24-yr study period. The strong relationship between asthma and a family history of atopy not only persisted but also strengthened over time (23.3% of asthmatic children belonged to families with atopic illnesses in 1974 but 44.2% in 1998). The environmental factors that might explain the almost three-fold rise in childhood asthma between 1974 and 1992 remain unknown but the genetic background of the disease has presumably remained unchanged since the early 1970s. The fact that the prevalence of asthma increased no further during the past 6 yrs suggests that the progressive induction of asthma symptoms in genetically predisposed subjects is a self-limiting process that has probably come to an end in the authors' study area.

### Your baby has down syndrome: a reflexive thematic analysis of breaking the news to parents [^1157jcuo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

About when the news was delivered

Several mothers mentioned that " something happened " during the ultrasound scan appointment, but that they did not receive clear information at that time. In the case of mothers who received the diagnosis prenatally, all of them recall having experienced situations that caught their attention. They mentioned things like: ' everyone in the room went silent and looked at each other', ' the doctor appeared uncomfortable', ' suddenly, they stopped talking to me', ' they asked my companion to step out with the doctor for a moment', among many others.

Some said, " the doctor saw something, but didn't want to tell me even when I asked ", while others mentioned inappropriate comments from the doctor, such as " he told me the baby was going to die ". In several cases, mothers reported that during the ultrasound, they were warned about physical characteristics like "he will be small" or "he will be short-legged ", but no further information was provided.

Contrary, some mothers indicated being informed of signs suggestive of Down syndrome during a regular ultrasound check, but decided not to proceed with confirmatory tests. For example, one mother recounts:

After the 16-week Doppler, they saw signs [suggestive of Down syndrome], and I decided not to take the test [amniocentesis] and wait until birth" (36 years old, received care both in a private clinic and public hospital).

A prenatal confirmation was not always well received:

When we found out, we felt horrible. It was hard to accept the news. We decided not to seek information or help until the baby was born" (35 years old, received care in public hospital).

Conversely, other mothers appreciated having learned about it prenatally, stating that it " allowed them to arrive at the birth prepared and calm " (39 years old, received care in a private clinic).

### The balancing act of urban conservation [^115HnPUr]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Post-industrial cities such as Cleveland, Ohio, USA face the significant challenge of managing thousands of vacant lots (i.e. parcels where pre-existing structures have been torn down and replaced by minimally-managed vegetation) (a). Although typically viewed as blight, these sites do offer opportunities to conserve urban biodiversity. In 2014, the Gardiner Laboratory established 64 conservation habits on vacant land across the city of Cleveland, including 32 sites seeded with native perennial wildflowers (b). Our cost to establish the 32 pocket prairies was approximately $2500 per site and included soil preparation, seeding, invasive plant management, and installing 'cues to care'such as fencing and mulching. Maintaining cues to care required substantial time and financial investment. Trash, furniture, appliances, and other refuse are frequently dumped into urban lots and must be removed (c). Vandalism to signs, fencing, and vegetation is also common, especially in the springtime when native plantings have not bloomed yet and sites can appear weedy and unkempt (d). Similar aesthetic concerns can happen during the winter. Thus, it is imperative to work with local stakeholders to identify what design modifications can indicate year-round investment into a conservation site. For instance, greenspace managers at the Sunflower+Project: STL, in St. Louis, Missouri, partnered with local elementary schools to paint sustainability flags which hung above their over-wintering sunflower fields (e). However, even with substantial investment, vacant lot ecosystem management can remain a controversial endeavor. Although many residents view rain gardens established though a multi-million USD investment by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District as valuable storm water management, others see a poor use of funds that raises health and safety concerns(f). Thus, we must work with urban residents and municipal governance as community developers to meet the needs of the diverse human ecosystem. Photograph E courtesy Richard Reilly.

### Adult retrospective report of child abuse and prospective indicators of childhood harm: a population birth cohort study [^113LoCTk]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Prospective indicators of harmful environments in childhood and adolescence

Based on the literature, we selected several prospective reports from health visitors, parents and study participants to indicate harmful environments (ages 7, 11 and 16 years), including (i) impoverished upbringing, (ii) hazardous conditions, (iii) anti-social behaviours and (iv) poor parent-child relationships. Indicators selected to represent these four child-to-adolescence domains are listed in Table 2. For example, impoverished upbringing was represented by family contact with various welfare agencies (e.g. social services). Hazardous conditions were represented by hospital admissions and occurrence of injuries (e.g. fractures and burns). Anti-social behaviours were represented by indicators of dysfunction or distress (e.g. contact with probation officers). Poor parent-child relationships were represented by the participant's response at 16 years on how well s/he got on with their parent(s). The latter is notable in being the only self-assessment by participants. Most individual items within the domains of harmful environments were uncommon, e.g. prevalence of family contact with each identified welfare agency was < 4%, suggesting severe circumstances for affected individuals. Participants were classified at 7 years, 11 years and 16 years as having impoverished upbringing, hazardous conditions or antisocial behaviours if they had ≥ 1 item; parent-child relationships were represented only at 16 years (Table 2).

Villages with a population of at least 1000 people at the 2006 census, present on the 2000 map from the Institut Géographique du Burkina and separated from another participating village by at least 5 km, were eligible for inclusion. Villages that were located on a national or provincial road or within 20 km of Ouagadougou or that were the regional or provincial capital were excluded. Only one village was eligible in the department of Zamo (Sanguié). Therefore, an eligible village from Pouni, located on the border with Zamo, was selected. If a village was found to be ineligible during the first visit, it was replaced by another randomly selected eligible village in the same department.

One individual was sampled per concession (compound). A concession is a group of households living in a residential development, often fenced, where the authority of a concession chief is recognised. Detailed descriptions of the sampling approach in each village are provided elsewhere. Briefly, 80 concessions were randomly selected and stratified by the presence of reproductive sows, piglets, and others as strata. This approach resulted in the inclusion of ten concessions raising sows, 30 concessions raising piglets, and 40 concessions with or without pig raising. One concession whose chief refused participation was replaced by another concession in the village. The chief of one randomly selected household per concession was asked for his consent. One household chief refused participation and asked that his father's household be sampled.

Foreign-born persons — risk designation, program criteria, origin countries, incidence range, and entry screening: Recent guidelines have designated immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB who have resided in the United States fewer than 5 years as foreign-born persons at high risk, although criteria for characterizing countries as having a high prevalence of TB have not been developed. In rank order, the 14 countries most frequently the country of origin of foreign-born persons who reported TB in the United States accounted for 76% of cases among foreign-born persons during 1992–2002, and estimated incidence rates in 2002 ranged from 33/100,000 population (Mexico) to 406/100,000 population (Somalia). State and local TB control programs should develop their own criteria for TB among foreign-born persons as part of the jurisdiction's overall epidemiologic analysis of TB, using data sources that include World Health Organization estimates and other epidemiologic and surveillance data. Foreign-born persons enter the United States legally through different official channels, and as a condition of entry, persons entering as immigrants, refugees, and asylees are required to be screened for diseases of public health significance, including TB; persons entering in the nonimmigrant category do not require preentry screening. During 1992–2002, an estimated 380,000 to 536,000 persons entered annually as immigrants, refugees, or asylees, and in 2002, among the estimated 916,000 persons in those categories, 86.6% were from countries with high incidence of TB; more than 75% of the immigrant flow now comes from high-incidence countries, with an estimated 80 to 86% of immigrants admitted during 1994–2003 from high-incidence countries.

### Outcomes of infants born near term [^115UuxGc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Most research on outcomes of preterm birth has centred on babies born at < 32weeks gestation and at highest risk of mortality and serious morbidity. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in studies focusing on late preterm infants (34-36weeks gestation). Early epidemiological studies demonstrated increased risks of mortality and adverse neonatal outcomes in this group, prompting further investigations. These increased risks have been confirmed and more recent studies have also included babies born at 37-38weeks, now defined as 'early-term' births. It now seems that it is inappropriate to consider term and preterm as a dichotomy; gestational age rather represents a continuum in which risk and severity of adverse outcomes increase with decreasing gestational age, but where measurable effects can be detected even very close to full term. In this review, we summarise current evidence for the outcomes of infants born at late preterm and early-term gestations.

### Elephant-to-human transmission of tuberculosis, 2009 [^114HbyKH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Setting

The elephant refuge was established in 1995 with the mission of caring for sick, old, or abused elephants transferred from private owners, zoos, and circuses. It operates on 2,700 acres divided by fences into 3 distinct areas, each having its own barn. Elephants graze outdoors during the day and might be enclosed in barns at night, particularly during cold or inclement weather. At the time of the outbreak, 1 area housed 2 African elephants; 1 area housed 6 Asian elephants; and a third area housed 7 Asian elephants in a large quarantine barn connected to a 2-story administrative support building. The refuge is accredited by the Association of Sanctuaries and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA); it is closed to the public.

In 2004, the refuge received, from an exotic animal farm in Illinois, 2 female Asian elephants with a history of active TB. The transfer of M. tuberculosis culture–positive elephants into Tennessee was contingent upon adherence to the USDA-endorsed Guidelines for the Control of Tuberculosis in Elephants and an infection control plan set forth by TWRA in consultation with the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH). One elephant died of TB in 2005; the other was treated with antituberculous medications for 1 year and was released from isolation in accordance with the guidelines.

In 2006, the refuge accepted 8 additional elephants from the same exotic animal farm in Illinois. Although none were known to have active TB, they were considered exposed and at high risk for latent M. tuberculosis infection because they had been housed with M. tuberculosis culture–positive elephants. In accordance with the guidelines, all 8 were quarantined when they arrived in Tennessee, and respiratory secretions obtained by trunk wash were tested annually for M. tuberculosis. In 2008, one died of causes unrelated to TB.

Clinical report 2

A 14-year-old boy born in Canada presented in late 1997, at seven years of age, with staring spells, diagnosed as absence epilepsy but over the next year developed atonic seizures consisting of head drops, myoclonic seizures, and then generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting approximately two minutes. Approximately one year after the onset of his seizures he was losing skills such as tying his shoelaces, and dressing himself and needed to be transferred out of a regular classroom.

His past medical history was significant for being born at 26 weeks gestation, and having mild respiratory distress syndrome and then bronchopulmonary dysplasia. No intracranial pathology was detected clinically or by head ultrasound at that time. Since infancy there had been no significant illnesses. There was no history of measles disease or contact in the first year of life. His immunization record confirmed that all immunizations had been appropriately given including MMR in June 1992 at the age of 21 months and measles booster at 6 years of age.

### Mortality among young adults born preterm and early term in 4 nordic nations [^114h7cbt]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The current findings add evidence of higher risk of young adult death from all causes and from chronic diseases in individuals born before full gestation. Importantly, the altered risk included the late preterm and early-term groups, who were born close to ideal birth timing. This may have implications not only for tailoring chronic disease risk assessments in individuals born before full term but also for the interpretation of the rich literature regarding the association between birth weight and mortality, in which gestational age has not been taken into account.

### Prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among women born in the 1990s vs the 1980s and association with HPV vaccination in the US [^1113FF9B]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Figure.
Prevalence Estimates of HPV-16/18 Infection Among Women Born in the 1980s and 1990s and During the Prevaccination Period (2005–2006) vs the Recent Vaccination Period (2015–2016), Overall and by HPV Vaccination Status

Error bars indicate 95% CI. Nationally representative estimates for prevalence and the representative population counts were computed using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey sampling weights. HPV-16/18 indicates human papillomavirus, type 16 or 18.

a The final analytical sample for panel A consisted of women 18–32 years old born in the 1980s (n = 2458) and 1990s (n = 1280).

b The analytic sample for 2005–2006 and 2015–2016 comprised 832 and 693 women, respectively.

c The HPV vaccination rate in 2015–2016 was 52% among women 18–26 years old (18–20 y, 55%; 21–23 y, 52%; 24–26 y, 50%; 27–29 y, 24%; 30–32 y, 18%).

d Survey weight-adjusted Wald F test was used to compare prevalence estimates.

The estimated probability of HPV-16/18 infection was 54% lower for women born in the 1990s (6.3%; 95% CI, 5.7%-6.9%) than in the 1980s (13.6%; 95% CI, 12.7%-14.4%; Table). Similarly, the estimated probability was 78% lower overall during the 2015−2016 cycle (3.5%; 95% CI, 2.9%-4.1%) compared with the 2005−2006 cycle (15.7%; 95% CI, 14.0%-17.4%); more specifically, 60% lower for the unvaccinated (6.3%; 95% CI, 5.0%-7.4%) and 92% lower for the vaccinated (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.0%-1.3%). The estimated probabilities were lower for the 1990s (vs 1980s) birth cohort and for the recent (2015–2016) vs the prevaccination (2005–2006) period across race and ethnicity, lifetime number of sex partners, and country of birth categories.

### Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests [^114KdE6B]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fenced wildlife-exclosure experiment

We constructed eight 49 m² (7 m × 7 m) open-top exclosures in 1996 that each contained a 25 m² (5 m × 5 m) vegetation plot, such that there was a 1 m buffer between vegetation plots and fenced areas. Exclosures consisted of 1.5 m tall heavy gauge 4 cm² mesh metal chain-link fencing anchored by solid wood posts. To ensure that boars did not root under the fence, up to four rows of barbed wire encircled each fence, from ground level to 60 cm in height. This design excluded large (> 1 kg) terrestrial animals (e.g. wild boars, tapirs, porcupines, and deer species) but allowed continued access for smaller and arboreal animals (e.g. rodents, civets, primates, birds, and maybe even sun bears). In addition, the open-top design and the wide mesh size minimized changes in microclimate conditions (e.g. altered light, wind speed) within the exclosures. Each exclosure had two paired control plots (25 m²) in a block design. Control plots were established 1 m outside of the exclosures on the two sides that most closely resembled the vegetation structure within the paired experimental plot in 1996.

Woody vegetation in the exclosures and controls was monitored as follows. All trees > 30 cm height were tagged, identified and measured between August and September 1996 in all exclosures (n = 8, 25 m² each) and two paired adjacent control plots (n = 16, 25 m² each). The exclosures and control plots were censused a second time in 1998. Seven of the eight exclosures and control plots were recensused a third time in August 2014 (there was severe damage to one exclosure and it was no longer deemed effective at excluding large animals). During the 2014 census, half of each of the both control plots per block were recensused (12.5 m²), totaling 25 m² per sampling block. A more detailed description of the exclosures experiment design is provided in ref.

### Injuries in elite Korean fencers: an epidemiological study [^115FB8V1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to assess the risk of injury associated with training activities in a population of elite Korean fencers training for the Olympic games.

Methods

We analysed the incidence of sports injuries, based on data prospectively collected over an 8-year period (January 2008 to December 2015) at the National Training Center in Seoul, Korea. The population of elite fencing athletes was stratified according to fencing category (sabre, epee and foil), sex, injury location (body region and site) and injury severity (mild or level I injury, requiring treatment for 1-3days; moderate or level II injury, requiring treatment for 4-7days; and severe or level III injury, requiring treatment for ≥ 8days).

Results

A total of 1176 injuries were recorded during the study period, with an average of 3.3 injuries per athlete annually. Of these, over half (52.6%) were mild injuries, with most injuries occurring in the lower extremity (47.2%), followed by injuries to the upper extremity (26.4%), trunk (21.4%), and head and neck area (5.0%). For all weapon categories, there was a significant difference between male and female athletes in terms of injury location and severity (p ≤ 0.005).

Conclusions

We hope that our data describing injury location and severity according to weapon category and sex can help one understand the circumstances that lead to injuries in elite Korean fencers and can be used in the development of programmes to reduce the incidence of sports injuries and enhance athletic performance.

Infants who do not survive the first year of life are more likely to be born at earlier gestational ages. In 2014, 66% of infants who survived to age 1 year were delivered at full term or later (≥ 39 completed weeks) compared with 16% of infants who died before reaching age 1 year. Fifty-eight percent of infants who died before age 1 year were delivered at < 32 weeks gestation compared with only 1% of infants who survived to age 1 year.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in fatal unintentional drowning among persons aged ≤ 29 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^116bzEPm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

In the United States, almost 4,000 persons die from drowning each year. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children aged 1–4 years than any other cause except congenital anomalies. For persons aged ≤ 29 years, drowning is one of the top three causes of unintentional injury death (2). Previous research has identified racial/ethnic disparities in drowning rates. To describe these differences by age of decedent and drowning setting, CDC analyzed 12 years of combined mortality data from 1999–2010 for those aged ≤ 29 years. Among non-Hispanics, the overall drowning rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was twice the rate for whites, and the rate for blacks was 1.4 times the rate for whites. Disparities were greatest in swimming pools, with swimming pool drowning rates among blacks aged 5–19 years 5.5 times higher than those among whites in the same age group. This disparity was greatest at ages 11–12 years; at these ages, blacks drown in swimming pools at 10 times the rate of whites. Drowning prevention strategies include using barriers (e.g., fencing) and life jackets, actively supervising or lifeguarding, teaching basic swimming skills and performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The practicality and effectiveness of these strategies varies by setting; however, basic swimming skills can be beneficial across all settings.

### Tuberculosis in new zealand, 1992–2001: a resurgence [^1134H7Pu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the recent epidemiology and clinical features of paediatric tuberculosis (TB) in New Zealand (NZ).

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of clinical, laboratory, and radiology records of children < 16 years old diagnosed with TB between January 1992 and June 2001 in nine NZ health districts.

Results

A total of 274 patients < 16 years old were identified; the average annual TB rate was 4.8 per 100,000. Rates rose over time reaching a peak of 10.1 in 1999. Rates were highest in under-5 year olds, at 6.2 per 100,000, and varied by ethnicity: African 575.2, Pacific Island 15.2, Maori 6.4, Asian 5.6, and European 0.6. Seventy two cases (26%) were foreign born. Thirty six per cent of cases were not detected until they presented with symptoms and of these 44% had no known TB contact. Most cases were identified by contact tracing (48%) or immigrant screening (11%); 43% were part of outbreaks. Miliary TB or meningitis occurred in 8% of patients, two of whom died. Drug resistance was found in 7% of culture positive cases and no HIV co-infection was found.

Conclusions

A resurgence of TB occurred among children in NZ between 1992 and 2001 predominantly involving non-European and immigrant groups. Despite established contact tracing and immigrant screening programmes, many cases were part of outbreaks, remained unidentified until symptoms arose, or had no known TB contact. These findings point to an unrecognised burden of adult disease, ongoing community transmission, and missed opportunities for prevention. Further study is required to confirm these hypotheses.

### Temporal trends in survival to adulthood among patients born with congenital heart disease from 1970 to 1992 in Belgium [^111pfWWk]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decades, the life expectancy of individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD) has increased significantly. However, precise estimates for survival to adulthood are scarce for patients with CHD. We investigated the proportion of CHD patients born between 1990 and 1992 who survived into adulthood. We also compared their survival with that of CHD patients born in earlier eras and evaluated survival as a function of the type of heart defect.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the CHD program administrative and clinical database at the University Hospitals Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) and analyzed the records of 7497 CHD patients born from 1970 to 1992. Survival to 18 years of age in patients born between 1990 and 1992 was 88.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.3% to 90.5%), which was significantly greater than that of patients born in previous decades (P < 0.0001). For patients born between 1990 and 1992, survival into adulthood for those with mild heart defects was 98.0% (95% CI, 95.8% to 99.1%), whereas survival for those with moderate- and severe-complexity heart defects was 90.0% (95% CI, 86.8% to 92.5%) and 56.4% (95% CI, 47.4% to 64.5%), respectively. Analysis per heart defect confirmed these findings, demonstrating that patients with univentricular heart (49.1% [95% CI, 30.8% to 65.1%]) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (7.5% [95% CI, 0.6% to 26.6%]) had the poorest survival rate.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that almost 90% of children with CHD have the prospect of surviving into adulthood.
