## Question

Long term management guidelines for autonomic dysregulation in the setting of wernicke encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long-term management guidelines for autonomic dysregulation in the setting of Wernicke encephalopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical problem and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the evidence base and acknowledge gaps. Next, I will structure a practical long-term management framework across domains like neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sudomotor and thermoregulatory issues, and cardiovascular autonomic instability. After that, I need to integrate thiamine repletion and risk-factor modification. Finally, I should define monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and special-population considerations, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with available guidance and safety principles.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and pathophysiology. Autonomic dysregulation after Wernicke encephalopathy reflects central autonomic network injury from diencephalic and brainstem lesions, compounded by peripheral autonomic neuropathy and chronic alcohol-related autonomic dysfunction; this mixed pattern explains both neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and hyperadrenergic surges during withdrawal or stress, so I need to keep both mechanisms in mind when choosing therapies and safety netting [^111dyqnE] [^116LCPDs] [^111y61U4].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base before proposing a plan. There are no disease-specific long-term guidelines for autonomic sequelae after WE; therefore, I should extrapolate from high-quality guidance for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, Parkinson disease autonomic dysfunction, and syncope, while integrating addiction-medicine principles for alcohol use disorder and thiamine safety, and I will flag where evidence is low or consensus-based so we do not overstate certainty [^114Ttoqa] [^1175WD3D] [^116f8DdB].

> I will now examine neurogenic orthostatic hypotension management, starting with nonpharmacologic measures. I should confirm that patients receive education on slow positional changes, liberal salt and fluid intake if not contraindicated, head-up tilt sleeping, and compression garments, and I should screen carefully for supine hypertension because treating nOH can worsen it; these are core recommendations in PD and syncope guidance and are reasonable to adapt post-WE given shared autonomic failure physiology [^112rSTnM] [^113sfH2Y].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic options for persistent nOH. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, and fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, are first-line agents in PD autonomic guidance and can be considered here with monitoring for supine hypertension and edema; droxidopa has durable benefits in nOH including reduced falls and improved quality of life in open-label extensions, so it is a reasonable alternative or adjunct when available, again with attention to supine BP and drug interactions [^114Ttoqa] [^112CSSCk].

> Let me consider bladder dysfunction next. For urgency and frequency, I should confirm that anticholinergics or beta-3 agonists are used cautiously with attention to cognitive adverse effects, and for nocturia, I should optimize evening fluid restriction and head-up tilt; for retention or incomplete emptying, intermittent catheterization is the standard approach, and I need to ensure we exclude reversible contributors like UTI or medication effects before labeling this as neurogenic.

> I need to check bowel management. Constipation is common in autonomic failure; I should prioritize fluids, fiber, physical activity, osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol, and short-term stimulant laxatives as needed, while minimizing anticholinergic drugs that worsen motility; this mirrors PD autonomic care and is appropriate to adapt post-WE [^116banNr].

> Next, I should review sudomotor and thermoregulatory dysfunction. For heat intolerance and anhidrosis, I need to ensure environmental risk mitigation, hydration strategies, and cooling garments in hot weather; for hyperhidrosis, topical glycopyrrolate or botulinum toxin can be considered, and for sialorrhea, botulinum toxin to salivary glands is endorsed in PD and can be extrapolated when drooling is problematic, with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^113ec3Er].

> I will now examine cardiovascular autonomic instability, especially hyperadrenergic surges. Initially, I thought clonidine might be contraindicated due to bradycardia risk; wait, let me verify that. The alcohol withdrawal literature supports alpha-2 agonists like clonidine or dexmedetomidine as adjuncts to benzodiazepines for autonomic hyperactivity, and they are not listed as contraindicated for bradycardia in that context, though I should still monitor heart rate and blood pressure closely and avoid monotherapy for seizure or delirium risk; beta-blockers can be added for persistent tachycardia or hypertension not controlled by benzodiazepines, again as adjuncts rather than substitutes [^115HHknT] [^115otxuv] [^116P41k6].

> But wait, what if the patient has prolonged hypotension or dysautonomia after WE. Case reports describe sustained hypotension requiring vasopressors despite thiamine, suggesting a direct dysautonomia component; I should maintain a low threshold to evaluate for other causes of shock, yet recognize that autonomic failure may necessitate short-term vasoactive support while definitive thiamine repletion and rehabilitation proceed, with careful de-escalation as autonomic tone recovers [^114WfmPS].

> Next, I should review thiamine repletion and prevention of recurrence. I need to ensure that after acute IV therapy, patients transition to oral thiamine maintenance, commonly 10–50 mg daily, and continue for at least 3–6 months, often longer in those with ongoing risk factors; in high-risk groups like post-bariatric patients, some guidance supports follow-up of thiamine status for at least 6 months, and in alcohol use disorder, sustained supplementation is part of standard care to mitigate recurrence risk and ongoing neurotoxicity [^112i6Mi3] [^1174rSGQ] [^116f8DdB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of alcohol withdrawal management in autonomic symptoms. Autonomic hyperarousal in AWS is driven by a hyperglutamatergic state and can be modulated by benzodiazepines with adjunctive alpha-2 agonists or beta-blockers for refractory adrenergic signs; magnesium deficiency should be corrected given its cofactor role and potential neuroprotective properties, and this integrated approach can reduce autonomic burden and may indirectly lessen autonomic injury severity over time [^116LCPDs] [^116P41k6].

> I need to ensure we address modifiable contributors to autonomic dysfunction. Nutritional rehabilitation with adequate calories, protein, fluids, and electrolytes, plus exercise conditioning, are foundational; orthostatic rehabilitation can be considered for deconditioning-related orthostatic intolerance, and falls-prevention strategies should be implemented given the high risk of injury in neurogenic OH and dysautonomia [^113ze6DC] [^1173kqJG].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Autonomic symptoms and orthostatic vitals should be reassessed every 3–6 months initially, then annually if stable; supine and standing blood pressures, heart rate responses, and symptom diaries guide therapy titration; in complex or refractory cases, referral for comprehensive autonomic testing can refine diagnosis and prognosis, consistent with syncope and neurogenic OH guidance [^notfound].

> Let me consider multidisciplinary care. Coordination among neurology, cardiology, urology, gastroenterology, physical and occupational therapy, and addiction medicine ensures comprehensive management; this is especially critical in alcohol-associated WE, where relapse prevention, nutritional counseling, and cognitive rehabilitation intersect with autonomic care to optimize outcomes.

> I should double-check special populations. After bariatric surgery, thiamine surveillance and supplementation are essential given malabsorption and vomiting risk; in pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum, parenteral thiamine is prioritized; in older adults, I need to balance supine hypertension risk when treating nOH and consider frailty and fall risk in every decision [^115krgME] [^112oeHF8] [^1174rSGQ] [^113sfH2Y].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical long-term algorithm. Continue thiamine maintenance and treat alcohol use disorder; implement nonpharmacologic orthostatic strategies; add midodrine or fludrocortisone for persistent nOH, consider droxidopa when available; manage bladder with behavioral and pharmacologic options and catheterization as needed; treat constipation with fluids, fiber, and osmotic agents; mitigate thermoregulatory risk; use clonidine or beta-blockers judiciously for hyperadrenergic symptoms as adjuncts to benzodiazepines in AWS; monitor orthostatic vitals and symptoms regularly; and escalate to autonomic testing or specialist referral when the course is atypical or refractory, documenting shared decision-making and safety checks throughout [^114Ttoqa] [^112rSTnM] [^112CSSCk] [^116f8DdB].

---

Long-term management of autonomic dysregulation in Wernicke encephalopathy centers on **thiamine maintenance** and **multidisciplinary rehabilitation**. Continue **oral thiamine 50–100 mg daily** indefinitely to prevent recurrence and support autonomic recovery [^notfound]. Address orthostatic hypotension with **nonpharmacologic measures** (increased salt/fluid intake, compression garments, head-up tilt sleeping) [^112rSTnM] and consider midodrine or fludrocortisone if needed [^114Ttoqa]. Manage autonomic hyperactivity with clonidine or beta-blockers as adjuncts to benzodiazepines during withdrawal [^115HHknT], and treat gastrointestinal dysmotility with dietary changes, osmotic laxatives, and domperidone [^116banNr]. Regular follow-up should monitor autonomic function, nutrition, and alcohol use, with patient education on symptom recognition and adherence to therapy [^notfound].

---

## Thiamine supplementation and nutritional management

- **Thiamine maintenance**: Oral thiamine 50–100 mg daily indefinitely to prevent recurrence and support autonomic recovery [^112mdndf].

- **Nutritional rehabilitation**: Balanced diet with adequate calories, protein, and micronutrients; consider multivitamins with emphasis on B-complex vitamins [^116P41k6].

- **Alcohol abstinence**: Essential to prevent relapse and ongoing thiamine deficiency; integrate addiction treatment and counseling [^113tnM38].

---

## Management of orthostatic hypotension

- **Nonpharmacologic measures**: First-line strategies include increased salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and head-up tilt sleeping [^112rSTnM].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Midodrine or fludrocortisone if nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient; monitor for supine hypertension and adjust dosing accordingly [^114Ttoqa].

- **Patient education**: Teach slow positional changes, hydration, and recognition of prodromal symptoms to prevent falls and injuries [^notfound].

---

## Management of autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety

- **Alpha-2 agonists**: Clonidine or dexmedetomidine can reduce sympathetic hyperactivity and anxiety; use as adjuncts to benzodiazepines during withdrawal [^115otxuv].

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol or labetalol may be used for persistent tachycardia or hypertension not controlled by benzodiazepines alone [^115otxuv].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Mainstay for alcohol withdrawal; taper gradually to prevent rebound autonomic symptoms [^116LCPDs].

---

## Management of gastrointestinal dysmotility

Constipation should be managed with **increased fluid and fiber intake**, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol), and short-term stimulant laxatives as needed [^116banNr]. Domperidone can be used for **gastroparesis** to improve gastric emptying without significant central nervous system penetration [^notfound]. Small, frequent meals and dietary modifications can help manage **nausea, vomiting, and early satiety**.

---

## Management of thermoregulatory dysfunction

Thermoregulatory dysfunction warrants **patient education** on avoiding extreme temperatures, dressing appropriately, and maintaining hydration. Environmental modifications — such as air conditioning, fans, and appropriate clothing — help maintain a stable body temperature. For severe hyperhidrosis, topical antiperspirants or botulinum toxin injections may be considered [^notfound].

---

## Regular follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should include periodic autonomic function assessments — such as tilt-table testing, heart rate variability, and blood pressure monitoring — and ongoing nutritional status evaluation with thiamine level checks and dietary reviews. Alcohol use should be monitored with regular screening and support for abstinence, including counseling and support groups [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education should emphasize **recognizing autonomic symptoms**, adhering to thiamine therapy, and maintaining nutrition and hydration. Support groups and counseling provide psychological support and help address alcohol use and improve adherence. Family involvement in education and support improves adherence and outcomes.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **neurologist** should lead long-term neurological and autonomic management, while a **cardiologist** manages cardiovascular autonomic symptoms, including orthostatic hypotension and arrhythmias. A **gastroenterologist** handles gastrointestinal dysmotility and nutritional rehabilitation, and a **psychiatrist/addiction specialist** addresses alcohol use disorder and provides psychological support. Physical and occupational therapists improve mobility, balance, and daily functioning.

---

Long-term management of autonomic dysregulation in Wernicke encephalopathy requires a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** centered on thiamine maintenance, nutritional rehabilitation, and targeted management of autonomic symptoms. Regular follow-up, patient education, and support are essential to optimize outcomes and prevent recurrence.

Glutamate receptor modulation

The role of glutamate receptor blockade through pharmacological antagonism has demonstrated significant promise with respect to both reducing the excitotoxic burden to neuronal tissues in AWS but also long-term drinking behaviours and outcomes. For example, acamprosate treatment leads to improved abstinence rates at 6 months, treatment completion and favourable improvements in gamma-glutamyl transferase. In addition, the role that magnesium may play by acting as a naturally occurring N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, its actions more generally as a neuroprotective agent and as a co-factor for thiamine-dependent enzymes in alcohol withdrawal and alcohol dependence has been highlighted.

Autonomic hyperarousal

The hyperglutamatergic state of AWS may also contribute to the increased autonomic symptoms observed. However, a degree of peripheral alcohol-related vagal neuropathy and blunted responsiveness to adrenoreceptor modulation, also likely underpin this. Indeed, pharmacological interventions targeting alpha-adrenergic receptors and pre-synaptic beta-adrenergic receptors for example are efficacious in mediating some of the symptoms of AWS. However, the neuroprotective effects of clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, remain to be conclusively evaluated. Of note, demonstrate a lack of impairment on new memory formation in those receiving clonidine compared with temazepam despite the disproportionate impact of clonidine on alcohol-related drunkenness and sedation. In addition, neurohormonal responses associated with autonomic hyperarousal also represent potential future avenues for addressing modulating alcohol-use disorder phenotypes.

Thiamine

Whilst already part of most AWS treatment guidelines, the literature relating to the role that thiamine may play in neuroprotection and its potentially preventative role in the development of alcohol-related neurocognitive impairment is growing. As such the impact of thiamine provision not only during the acute phases of Wernicke's encephalopathy and alcohol withdrawal but also long-term, on prevention of the cellular mechanisms underpinning cognitive impairment and the cognitive and functional phenotypes of individuals with Alcohol Usw Disorder (AUD) warrants review.

Introduction

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome

Alcohol withdrawal syndromes (AWS) result when the balance between γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptor adaptation through escalating ethanol use leads to unopposed upregulated glutamate activity. This leads to hyperexcitability throughout a range of central and peripheral physiological systems and the plethora of symptoms observed clinically. AWS may present with autonomic dysregulation, confusion, motor disturbances and complex behavioural and psychological alterations. These symptoms can range in severity from mild agitation or tachycardia, to complete disorientation, tremulousness, hypertensive crisis, delirium and seizures. Those living with significant levels of physical dependence on alcohol are more likely to experience more severe AWS. As such, in addition to factors such as co-morbidity with a mental health diagnosis and various psychosocial characteristics that are associated with relapse and continued consumption, for example availability, consumption may also be driven by a need to avoid, and fear of, AWS, rather than the desire to feel pleasure associated with consumption. Furthermore, those who experience repeated episodes of AWS are more likely to undergo more severe AWS episodes and have worse long-term outcomes.

Management of AWS

Current guidance on the management of AWS recommends holistic assessment by a healthcare professional trained in the assessment and management of alcohol-related conditions, high-dose thiamine provision for prevention (and management) of Wernicke's encephalopathy and symptom control with benzodiazepines. Where benzodiazepines are not suitable, or symptoms are refractory to escalating doses of benzodiazepines, anti-convulsants such as sodium valproate or carbamazepine may be employed. Furthermore, an emerging body of evidence surrounding adjuncts or alternatives to traditional management strategies is developing. For example, modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA B) receptor using baclofen, or the α2-adrenergic receptor through dexmedetomidine or clonidine.

Sleep

What methods and interventions help most in addressing a good sleeping routine?

It is important to inquire about sleep as it often has a major impact on quality of life of the individual with PLAN and those who care for and live with that person. However, if the sleep issue is not causing problems (eg, the child wakes up overnight but does not wake family members and is rested during the day), then no intervention may be required. The approach is to address behavioral components of insomnia, evaluate the sleep environment, investigate medical factors impacting sleep, and consider medications (see Table 1).

Table 1.
Sleep Difficulties, Testing, and Interventions in PLAN.

Autonomic

Are there specific interventions for the autonomic dysfunction seen in PLAN? (temperature dysregulation, discoloration of hands and feet)

Autonomic dysfunction may take the form of decreased circulation, constipation, urinary retention, decreased gastric motility, and temperature dysregulation. Treatment is supportive. Reassurance can be given that the discoloration in the extremities is not dangerous. In the later stages of infantile PLAN, caregivers may need to be cautious in hot or cold environments, which may lead to vital sign changes. Individuals with adult PLAN may also have orthostatic hypotension like adults with classic Parkinson disease, and it is reasonable to take a similar approach.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) Wernicke's Task Force issues the following guidelines to enhance the quality of care in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and for other populations at risk of thiamine deficiency and Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). This paper examines the current literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of WE. These guidelines intend to provide an objective summary of current peer-reviewed literature and provide clinical practice recommendations based on this literature and expert opinions. The goal is to enhance awareness and reduce the incidence of WE and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This statement is not intended to establish a local, regional, or national standard of care and may be revised in the future as additional evidence becomes available.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116f8DdB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Box 5: Wernicke encephalopathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome — Wernicke encephalopathy is a severe complication resulting from insufficient thiamine in the body, and patients consuming large amounts of alcohol are at an increased risk of developing Wernicke encephalopathy due to inadequate nutrition as well as biological interactions between cellular functioning and alcohol. Thiamine is required for carbohydrate metabolism and plays a key role in normal body functioning, and because the body does not synthesize thiamine, daily ingestion through food or supplements is required to maintain adequate metabolic functioning. Patients with thiamine deficiency often present with signs and symptoms such as confusion, abnormal gaze patterns or nystagmus, ataxia, and possibly delirium, and patients who experience alcohol withdrawal syndrome are at risk of developing Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, standard practice includes providing patients with thiamine supplements as a preventative measure. If left untreated, Wernicke encephalopathy can progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome, and unfortunately, once Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome occurs, the effects are not reversible and are often progressive.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome resulting from thiamine deficiency, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. According to autopsy-based studies, the disorder is still greatly underdiagnosed in both adults and children. In this review, we provide an update on the factors and clinical settings that predispose to Wernicke's encephalopathy, and discuss the most recent insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis, and treatment. To facilitate the diagnosis, we classify the common and rare symptoms at presentation and the late-stage symptoms. We emphasise the optimum dose of parenteral thiamine required for prophylaxis and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy and prevention of Korsakoff's syndrome associated with alcohol misuse. A systematic approach helps to ensure that patients receive a prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment.

Background

Although Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a preventable and treatable disease it still often remains undiagnosed during life.

Objectives

To create practical guidelines for diagnosis, management and prevention of the disease.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane Library.

Conclusions and Recommendations

1 The clinical diagnosis of WE should take into account the different presentations of clinical signs between alcoholics and non alcoholics (Recommendation Level C); although prevalence is higher in alcoholics, WE should be suspected in all clinical conditions which could lead to thiamine deficiency (good practice point - GPP). 2 The clinical diagnosis of WE in alcoholics requires two of the following four signs; (i) dietary deficiencies (ii) eye signs, (iii) cerebellar dysfunction, and (iv) either an altered mental state or mild memory impairment (Level B). 3 Total thiamine in blood sample should be measured immediately before its administration (GPP). 4 MRI should be used to support the diagnosis of acute WE both in alcoholics and non alcoholics (Level B). 5 Thiamine is indicated for the treatment of suspected or manifest WE. It should be given, before any carbohydrate, 200 mg thrice daily, preferably intravenously (Level C). 6 The overall safety of thiamine is very good (Level B). 7 After bariatric surgery we recommend follow-up of thiamine status for at least 6 months (Level B) and parenteral thiamine supplementation (GPP). 8 Parenteral thiamine should be given to all at-risk subjects admitted to the Emergency Room (GPP). 9 Patients dying from symptoms suggesting WE should have an autopsy (GPP).

### Long-COVID: neurological manifestations and management [^1167G6aU]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Comment: It has been hypothesised that autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic intolerance and sudomotor dysfunction, could contribute to various Long-COVID symptoms, such as fatigue and other neurocognitive features. Furthermore, up to 25% of patients with postural orthostatic hypotension syndrome can be found to have raised ANA titres. Whilst a vital part of managing those with Long-COVID includes a multi-disciplinary team approach including physiotherapy and occupational therapy, it may also be relevant to assess for autonomic dysfunction in addition and manage accordingly. There is a significant reduction in quality of life for those affected by Long-COVID, emphasising the importance of planning for effective rehabilitation services. Guidelines for service referral will be imperative to prevent overwhelming services and this is likely to become even more important as the effect of the emerging variants on Long-COVID is yet to be determined.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management guideline — scope and PICOTS criteria — the target population was adults 18 years or older in the context of alcohol withdrawal, with co-occurring medical or psychiatric conditions within the context of alcohol withdrawal (e.g., alcoholic liver disease and Wernicke encephalopathy) not included. Interventions included pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches; pharmacotherapies not widely available in the United States were excluded (examples: sodium oxybate (GHB), cannabinoids, clomethiazole), off-label medications for alcohol withdrawal management were included, and non-pharmacological interventions included supportive care, nutritional correction, and symptom monitoring and assessment frequency. All comparative interventions were included if they met criteria for an included intervention. Outcomes focused on immediate withdrawal-related clinical outcomes including severity of withdrawal syndrome; treatment completion; transfer to more intensive level of care; incidence of seizure, delirium, death and adverse events; and linkage to long-term AUD treatment. The duration of time of interest was 5 days from the start of withdrawal, and settings included all clinical settings except for home management of withdrawal unless it took place in the United States.

Methods

Aims

This guideline results from review of the literature and the consensus of clinicians with experience treating individuals with PLAN, with input from caregivers of individuals with PLAN. The guideline includes all phenotypic presentations of PLAN. We looked broadly at interventions, therapies, or other management tools for treating different aspects of PLAN, including the primary disease process and the secondary manifestations (motor disorders, vision loss, developmental delay/regression, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, communication disorders, feeding and gastrointestinal disorders, psychosocial features and family support, end-of-life care). The guideline is intended for physicians, practitioners, therapists, and other professionals caring for individuals with PLAN.

Process Overview

As there are limited data on management of PLAN, expert opinion was sought in an approach similar to that used in the development of the pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegenerationand β-propeller protein–associated neurodegenerationguidelines and following the AGREE-II framework. Specifically, a Guideline Development Group was formed including clinical experts in PLAN, a methodologic expert, and family members/caregivers of individuals with PLAN. The Guideline Development Group included 8 clinician members (MK, AS, NN, GZ, SH, PH, AG, JW), 1 methodology expert (AH), and 11 family members (MR, AH, DD, MT, SB, NS, PW, HM, AD, AS, LP). A modified Delphi method was used to develop the guidelines in the following steps:

Clinical Question Development

Members of the Guideline Development Group (clinician and family experts) independently proposed clinical questions important to the management of PLAN. PLAN clinician expert members of the Guideline Development Group then individually prioritized the questions as (1) less important, (2) moderately important, and (3) very important. The scores were averaged for each question. The members of the Guideline Development Group (clinician experts) met virtually to discuss question selection. The Guideline Development Group noted that many questions that had lower scores were still deemed valuable. For example, questions relating to parkinsonism and deep brain stimulation for adult PLAN were not in the top 15, yet the Guideline Development Group felt that these were very important topics for the adult PLAN subtype. Ultimately, the group decided to include all the questions except for 3 that were either too vague or outside of the scope of the guideline. Each clinical question is posed in bold starting in part 2 below, then answered accordingly.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^116Y5Hs6]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP Clinical Practice Guideline — glossary terms define complicated withdrawal as severe withdrawal symptoms involving seizures, hallucinations, delirium, or psychosis that require more frequent monitoring and may require hospital-level care. Delirium is described as a mental state in which a patient is confused, disoriented, and not able to think or remember clearly, which usually starts suddenly and is often temporary and treatable. Differential diagnosis is the consideration of possible disorders causing symptoms and often involves several tests to rule out conditions and/or determine if a patient needs more testing, used to differentiate physical or mental health disorders that cause similar symptoms. Two dosing approaches are outlined: fixed dosing, where a predetermined dose is administered at fixed intervals according to a schedule with doses usually decreasing in a gradual taper over several days and additional medication possibly provided if the fixed-dose does not adequately control symptoms; and front loading, where moderate to high doses of a long-acting medication are given frequently at the start of treatment to achieve rapid control of withdrawal signs and symptoms and can be followed by a symptom-triggered or fixed-dose regimen. Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is defined as sodium oxybate prescribed for daytime sleepiness and muscle weakness associated with sleep disorders and is also produced illegally for illicit use, commonly known as "liquid ecstasy" and the "date rape drug" for its enhanced effect and undetectable presence when mixed with alcohol. Intoxication is a clinical state marked by dysfunctional changes in physiological or psychological functioning, mood state, cognitive process, or all of these, due to consumption of a psychoactive substance. Korsakoff syndrome is chronic changes in mental status and memory that often follow Wernicke encephalopathy, occurring primarily in severe, chronic alcoholism and caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and damage to the mammillary bodies. Level of care refers to distinct clinical and environmental support services of various intensities available in a variety of settings.

### Bariatric surgery: an IDF statement for obese type 2 diabetes [^117Dx63d]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Longer-term surgical complications and need for surgical revisions are not uncommon and expected problems are usually specific to the surgical intervention.

Early detection and appropriate management of complications is very important. All those managing post-bariatric surgical patients should have a low threshold for surgical referral should a complication be suspected. Longer-term concerns, especially with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and bilio-pancreatic diversion, include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, osteoporosis and, rarely, Wernicke's encephalopathy and severe hypoglycaemia from insulin hypersecretion. Clinical guidelines developed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, The Obesity Society and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery address these important issues. A summary of nutritional risk with each procedure is shown in Table 8. This does not reflect all nutritional risks. Long-term dietary advice, evaluation and supplementation are required for all procedures.

Table 8
A summary of more common nutritional concerns for each procedure

The risks of each procedure need to be considered in the light of potential reductions in mortality, morbidity or co-morbidity, quality of life and productivity. Realistic expectations are important and the risk–benefit ratio assessed individually for each patient, accounting for both peri-operative risk and possible long-term complications.

Continuing efforts are required to monitor the safety, efficacy and long-term effects of bariatric surgery. There is a range of national bariatric surgery registries and continuing long-term longitudinal studies. We encourage the expansion of national registries and acknowledge that these must be well resourced to function appropriately. Severe obesity and Type 2 diabetes are chronic conditions needing a chronic-disease approach to care.

Components of successful bariatric surgery

There is a range of comprehensive guidelines for the use of bariatric procedures for obesity, including the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2006), the combined American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, The Obesity Society and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery guidelines (2008) and European clinical guidelines (2007).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113tLkPD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Supportive care in ICU — thiamine and Wernicke encephalopathy — Clinicians should administer thiamine to ICU patients with signs or symptoms that mimic or mask Wernicke encephalopathy, and due to risks associated with thiamine deficiency among patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal, it is common practice to provide thiamine to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy; patients who consume large amounts of alcohol are particularly susceptible to thiamine deficiencies due to inadequate dietary intake as well as biological interactions between cellular enzymes and alcohol.

### Inadequate practices for hepatic encephalopathy management in the inpatient setting [^112638PS]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of HE — At times not so simple

Although HE remains a common complication of CLD prompting thousands of hospitalizations per year, the consistent management of these patients can present a challenge for even the experienced hospitalist. When it comes to gathering history, any grade of HE can compromise the accuracy of the history of the present illness. Collateral information from families, friends, and other health‐care contacts is often needed. Similarly, an accurate medication reconciliation, crucial to any admission, can present a significant challenge. Patients with even mild cases of HE may suffer from issues with short‐term memory or have recently experienced changes in sleep–wake dysregulation, both factors that can contribute to missed doses of home medications, a common precipitant of HE. Again, collateral information from caretakers and pharmacy fill records may prove to be crucial tools when it comes to determining home medications.

As there are no specific signs on physical examination findings, the diagnosis of HE should be made only after exclusion of other causes of neurologic dysfunction. However, a range of signs, including extrapyramidal findings, motor system abnormalities, and cerebellar signs can be seen. The most commonly cited motor symptom of HE is flapping tremor (asterixis), although the findings from other physical examinations, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and dysarthria, may also be present. Structural factors affecting neurologic function should be considered, especially in the presence of focal neurologic findings on examination. Exogenous toxin‐mediated encephalopathy should remain on the differential and a urine toxicology screen on admission is prudent. For the undifferentiated encephalopathic patient, nutritional deficiencies such as thiamine deficiency (and associated Wernicke's encephalopathy) should be considered.

- increase salt intake in symptomatic orthostatic hypotension

- ensure head-up tilt of the bed at night

- wear elastic stockings

- recognize that in some patients hypotension occurs only postprandially; warn patients about this effect and advise taking frequent small meals.

Endocrine Practice (2019). High credibility.

Thiamine status and Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) after bariatric surgery — screening and dosing guidance are provided: there is increased urinary thiamine excretion with both T1D (76% decreased thiamine levels) and T2D (75% decreased thiamine levels), thiamine levels after RYGB were relatively constant up to 5 years postoperatively, and elevated thiamine levels were found in 43% of patients up to 12 months after BPD/DS. WE has been reported after purely restrictive procedures, and routine assessment of thiamine status in any patient after bariatric surgery with any early or suggestive features of WE is recommended; funduscopic exam findings include retinal hemorrhage, optic disc edema, and peripapillary telangiectasia, and if IV access is not available in the acute setting, then intramuscular thiamine dosing may be considered.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^112bXSq4]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — effect of liver disease etiology on brain function: Data on the impact of underlying liver disease are sparse except for alcoholism and hepatitis C; even patients with alcohol disorder and no clinical disease show deficits across episodic memory, working memory and executive functions, visuoconstruction abilities, and upper- and lower-limb motor skills, with more pronounced dysfunction in those at risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy; it remains unclear whether brain dysfunction in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) reflects HE, alcohol toxicity, or thiamine deficiency; there is mounting evidence that HCV is present and replicates within the brain, and approximately half of HCV patients have chronic fatigue irrespective of liver disease grade, with even mild liver disease showing cognitive dysfunction involving verbal learning, attention, executive function, and memory; patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis may have severe fatigue and impairments irrespective of liver disease grade.

### Prolonged hypotension associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy [^114WfmPS]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is difficult. Transient hypotension has been reported as a rare complication of WE. We herein report a case of prolonged hypotension and dysuautonomia associated with WE in a 69-year-old man with underlying alcohol abuse. Without apparent etiology of shock, this patient remained hypotensive for 9 days, requiring a vasopressor, despite daily administration of thiamine 600mg. Fluctuation of blood pressure caused by postural change and bradycardia in the presence of shock indicated that this patient had dysautonomia. This case hereby proposes a possible association between hypotension, dysautonomia and Wernicke's encephalopathy.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^116P41k6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — supportive care and supplementation includes adherence to safety measures and protocols, and existing institutional/hospital-associated delirium protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with severe alcohol withdrawal. Thiamine should be provided to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy; intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of thiamine is preferred, in particular for patients with poor nutritional status, malabsorption, or who are known to have severe complications of alcohol withdrawal, with typical dosing 100 mg IV/IM per day for 3–5 days, and patients also receiving glucose can be administered thiamine and glucose in any order or concurrently. Clinicians should administer thiamine to patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to treat alcohol withdrawal. For patients with hypomagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, or a previous history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, magnesium should be administered. If phosphorus is < 1 mg/dL, phosphorus should be repleted; in all other patients with severe alcohol withdrawal and continued refusal of food intake, temporary nutrition is recommended. In patients who are critically ill, folate supplementation may be considered since chronic alcohol use is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy [^1166ngzT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

### Association between vitamin deficiencies and ophthalmological conditions [^112i6Mi3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Workup for Vitamin Deficiency

Patients in high-risk groups, those presenting with early symptoms of thiamine deficiency, and those presenting with long-term thiamine deficiency symptoms such as heart-failure and numbness in the extremities should have a targeted history and physical examination. Wernicke's encephalopathy has been described as a triad of symptoms: nystagmus, confusion and ataxia. With a high-index of suspicion, routine investigations such as electrolytes, urea and creatinine, blood alcohol content, B12, thiamine pyrophosphate levels, erythrocyte transketolase activity or a computed tomography can be ordered to support diagnosis.

Management

Management for thiamine deficiencies with evidence of neurological and cardiovascular manifestations should include thiamine supplementation of 200 mg intravenous (IV) or orally 3 times a day until symptoms resolve. A maintenance dose of 10 mg daily should be continued after symptoms have resolved. In an acute crisis, 50 mg of thiamine should be administered intramuscularly (IM) for approximately 2 to 4 days, followed by an oral maintenance period.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113sfH2Y]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Supine hypertension associated with nOH

It is critical for clinicians to understand the physiology underlying both nOH and supine hypertension and the associated risks of each when they manage patients with nOH. Neurogenic OH is associated with loss of baroreflex function that normally buffers changes in blood pressure in both directions. Therefore, patients with autonomic nervous system dysfunction typically have nOH and supine hypertension. In addition to supine hypertension being common in patients with nOH, many of the medications used to treat nOH can cause or exacerbate supine hypertension. Because OH/nOH and supine hypertension are hemodynamic opposites, improving one can worsen the other. Thus, all patients with nOH should be evaluated for supine hypertension. There are differences in clinical practice among clinicians who treat nOH. Some clinicians may not treat nOH for fear of exacerbating supine hypertension, while others may aggressively treat nOH while accepting the resulting supine hypertension. Unlike the potential long-term consequences of hypertension in non-PD patients, the risks of nOH are immediate and represent potential major health threats. By extrapolation, similar recommendations can be made in multiple system atrophy. In contrast, the data is less clear in individuals with pure autonomic failure.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^115T6DuK]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy management strategy — Patients with higher grades of HE who are at risk or unable to protect their airway need more intensive monitoring and are ideally managed in an intensive care setting, and alternative causes of encephalopathy are not infrequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Controlling precipitating factors in the management of OHE is of paramount importance, because nearly 90% of patients can be treated with just correction of the precipitating factor, and careful attention to this issue is still the cornerstone of HE management.

### Preventing wernicke encephalopathy after bariatric surgery [^111UvZvU]. Obesity Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Non-compliance

Of interest, in 10.3% of the case descriptions (12 cases), non-compliance to the medication and follow-up medical regimen was reported. A lack of insight into a given situation is a relatively common sign of the acute and chronic phase of WE. The patients did not follow their follow-up, did not take prescribed drugs, or discharged themselves from the hospital against advice, leading to adverse outcomes. Because of the severity of the syndrome, this aspect requires specific attention in the treatment of WE patients, and at risk bariatric patients.

### Autonomic dysfunctions in idiopathic Parkinson's disease [^113QTtMW]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with Parkinson's disease experience autonomic dysfunction at some point in the course of their disease. In contrast to autonomic dysregulation in multisystem atrophy, they are less severe, and they frequently cause troublesome symptoms only in advanced stages of the disease. The quality of life is nevertheless substantially restricted. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and urogenital autonomic dysfunction is predominant. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can greatly benefit the patient. An interdisciplinary approach is desirable in most cases.

### Canadian guideline for parkinson disease [^116cfC2q]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, more specifically with respect to management of autonomic dysfunction, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend to advise patients avoiding coffee before bedtime and limiting water ingestion for the treatment of urinary urgency and incontinence, and exclude UTI when symptoms appear suddenly. Offer the following:

- reduce intake of fluid after 6 pm and sleep with head-up tilt of bed to reduce urine production to control nocturia

- optimize nighttime dopaminergic therapy

- administer anticholinergic or antispasmodic drugs for urinary urgency (overactive bladder), taking care regarding central adverse effects

- administer botulinum toxin type A injection in the detrusor muscle.

### Cardiac dysfunction in neurocritical care: an autonomic perspective [^115a71zR]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A number of neurologic disorders can cause cardiac dysfunction by involving the conductive system and contractile apparatus of the heart. This is especially prominent in the neurocritical care setting where the spectrum of cardiac dysfunction due to acute neurologic injury ranges from trivial and isolated electrocardiographic changes to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death (Table 1). The mechanism of these cardiac complications is complex and not fully understood. An understanding of the neuroanatomical structures and pathways is of immense importance to comprehend the underlying pathophysiology that culminates as cardiac damage and dysregulation. Once the process is initiated, it can complicate and adversely affect the outcome of primary neurologic conditions commonly seen in the neurocritical care setting. Not only are these cardiac disorders under-recognized, there is a paucity of data to formulate evidence-based guidelines regarding early detection, acute management, and preventive strategies. However, certain details of clinical features and their course combined with location of primary neurologic lesion on neuroimaging and data obtained from laboratory investigations can be of great value to develop a strategy to appropriately manage these patients and to prevent adverse outcome from these cardiac complications. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction due to catastrophic neurologic conditions or due to stress of critical illness. We also address various clinical syndromes of cardiac dysfunction that occur as a result of the neurologic illness and in turn may complicate the course of the primary neurologic condition.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113yqfDP]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Autonomic evaluation — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension notes that syncope due to neurogenic OH is common in patients with central or peripheral autonomic nervous system damage or dysfunction, and its causes should be sought so as to provide efficient, accurate, and effective management. Symptoms that may distinguish neurogenic OH include persistent and often progressive generalized weakness, fatigue, visual blurring, cognitive slowing, leg buckling, and the coat hanger headache, and these symptoms may be provoked or exacerbated by exertion, prolonged standing, meals, or increased ambient temperature. Confirmation of specific neurogenic OH conditions causing syncope often requires additional autonomic evaluation.

### Fedratinib, a newly approved treatment for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis [^114i5ac9]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Off-target inhibition of FLT3 may be implicated in the occurrence of gastrointestinal events, which are the most common TEAEs seen with fedratinib. These events, the majority of which are grades 1–2 severity, occur mainly during early treatment and decrease over time, so appropriate patient education and expectation setting is important to ensure drug adherence. Gastrointestinal events can be managed with prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting (e.g. with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) or prompt treatment of diarrhea at first onset of symptoms. Though food does not meaningfully alter the bioavailability of fedratinib, taking fedratinib with a high-fat meal may help reduce nausea and vomiting.

Patients with MF may have more risk factors for developing Wernicke's encephalopathy than persons without MF, regardless of treatment. Nevertheless, Wernicke's encephalopathy can be caused by thiamine deficiency secondary to persistent vomiting, especially in an already malnourished individual. Preclinical studies of fedratinib at clinically relevant concentrations have shown fedratinib does not have an effect on the thiamine receptor function in the gastrointestinal tract or the brain. However, because gastrointestinal events are common, proactive management of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may help prevent thiamine deficiency during fedratinib treatment and risk-mitigation strategies for Wernicke's encephalopathy, including routine monitoring of thiamine as appropriate, are recommended for patients with MF receiving fedratinib.

Because of the clinical hold, long-term data for fedratinib are limited. Two phase III clinical trials, FREEDOM (NCT03755518) and FREEDOM2 (NCT03952039), are currently underway to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and effect on overall survival of fedratinib 400 mg/day in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF previously treated with ruxolitinib. FREEDOM is a single-arm trial and FREEDOM2 is a randomized trial that compares fedratinib with best available therapy (BAT). Both studies employ risk-mitigation strategies for Wernicke's encephalopathy and proactive management of gastrointestinal events to prevent thiamine deficiency.

Fedratinib is a promising new therapy for patients with advanced MF who until recently have had limited treatment options. More extensive clinical experience with fedratinib is needed to determine the duration of spleen response during treatment, the potential to develop secondary resistance, and whether biomarkers may identify a subset of patients with MF most likely to respond to the drug.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^116ZwtdH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thiamine (vitamin B1) in liver disease — deficiency risks and manifestations: Decreased dietary micronutrient intake or absorption and increased excretion can lead to suboptimal nutritional status and cause a variety of complications in liver disease. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin that participates in the initiation of nerve propagation and is an important cofactor for enzymes in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Patients with chronic alcohol misuse or cirrhosis have been found to be thiamine deficient, and thiamine deficiency is especially prevalent in patients with alcohol-related chronic disease due to inadequate dietary intake and through the direct effect of ethanol on thiamine uptake from the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical consequences include peripheral neuropathy or cardiac disease (beriberi) and neurologic impairment characterized by nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion (Wernicke encephalopathy), and Korsakoff syndrome can also develop and is characterized by impaired short-term memory.

Disease Monitoring

Which examinations are most suitable for monitoring the evolution of the disease?

Monitoring the progression of disease includes a combination of clinical evaluations by a multidisciplinary team including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy and various investigations.

Clinical assessment

Regular and detailed clinical evaluations by a neurologist or similar specialist are essential for monitoring the overall progression of disease. They may assess motor function, cognitive abilities, speech and language skills, and other neurologic symptoms such as movement disorders. Scales such as the infantile PLAN rating scalemay be used to quantify and monitor the severity of motor symptoms over time. As a general rule, only those studies that will change management are recommended.
MRI: Brain MRI can provide valuable information about the structural changes occurring in the brain over time. However, periodic MRIs are not recommended in individuals with a genetic diagnosis and a consistent clinical picture without a specific indication.
Genetic testing: Re-evaluation of genetic testing is not necessary unless there are clinical reasons to suspect additional genetic changes.
Electroencephalography (EEG): Periodic re-evaluation and timing of this investigation must be based on age and clinical symptomatology (see the Seizure section).
Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS): Although denervation on EMG and distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy on NCS may support the diagnosis, periodic re-evaluation is not recommended.
Ophthalmologic examination: Regular ophthalmologic examinations, including visual acuity tests and visual field testing, can help monitor changes in vision over time.
Neuropsychological testing: Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments can evaluate cognitive abilities, memory, attention, executive function, and language skills. These tests provide a baseline measurement and can be repeated periodically to monitor changes in cognitive abilities, especially in adult PLAN.
Quality of life assessment: Assessing the impact of the disease on daily functioning, activities of daily living, and overall quality of life is important. This can be done through patient-reported outcome measures or quality of life questionnaires to gain insight into the individual's well-being and guide interventions.

The frequency and specific assessments may vary depending on the individual's symptoms, age, and clinical presentation. Close collaboration between the individual, caregivers, and their health care team are crucial to ensure optimal monitoring and management.

### Use of droxidopa for the long-term treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^112CSSCk]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

This commentary refers to '2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis of syncope', by M. Brignole et al. pages.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) can cause serious and potentially disabling symptoms and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly because of hazards from falls. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope provide clinicians with important updates regarding the recognition and treatment of OH. These guidelines outline the utility of droxidopa as a treatment for symptomatic OH due to autonomic failure [neurogenic OH (nOH)] based on data from short-term Phase 3 clinical trials.

Recent data from a 12-month open-label extension study of droxidopa in patients with symptomatic nOH suggest the durability of benefits with long-term droxidopa treatment, including sustained increases in standing blood pressure and, more importantly, sustained improvements in patient-reported assessments of nOH symptom severity, in symptom effect on daily activities, and in the Clinical Global Impressions scale.

The long-term efficacy of droxidopa treatment was also evaluated in a 6-month prospective study of patients with nOH initiating droxidopa treatment. This patient cohort reported improvements in falls, functionality, depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with droxidopa treatment. Specifically, fewer patients reported a fall in the 1 month after initiating droxidopa treatment vs. the month before treatment (43% vs. 53%; P = 0.004); this reduced rate of falls was maintained at 6 months (40%; P = 0.034 vs. baseline). Other patient-reported assessments also showed significant improvements, including better functionality (Sheehan Disability Scale global scores, P ≤ 0.001), fewer depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores, P < 0.01), and improved HRQoL (Short Form-8 scores, P ≤ 0.01).

Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that long-term treatment with droxidopa provides sustained benefits to patients with nOH, although there are limitations due to the lack of parallel control groups and the self-reported nature of the data. As noted in the ESC guidelines, further research into treatment options for OH and the clinical effects of droxidopa is warranted to better guide effective management of patients with this challenging clinical condition.

Orthostatic hypotension — pathophysiology and presentation are summarized as excessive venous pooling with impaired compensatory responses and characteristic upright-position syncope. OH involves excessive pooling of blood volume in the splanchnic and leg circulations, causing decreased venous return and cardiac output on standing. In neurogenic OH, vasoconstrictor mechanisms may be inadequate due to neurodegenerative disorders or autonomic peripheral neuropathies. Neurogenic OH may present clinically as classic or delayed OH, and most commonly OH is due to dehydration or medications such as diuretics and vasodilators, with syncope from OH occurring in the upright position.

Conclusion

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can seriously impair patients' quality of life and is associated with increased morbidity, especially in the elderly. In several neurological diseases associated with autonomic failure, NOH is a major contributor to disease burden and reduced quality of life. A structured approach is important in the management of patients with NOH. Non-pharmacological interventions should be the first line of therapy. If the symptoms persist and the patients are severely affected, pharmacological interventions are required.

### Glucose before thiamine for wernicke encephalopathy: a literature review [^114LTTvV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The prevailing teaching in medical school curricula and in medical textbooks is that if thiamine deficiency is suspected, thiamine supplementation should be given before administering glucose.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the published evidence describing the commonly held belief that thiamine supplementation must be given before glucose in hypoglycemic patients to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.

Methods

Articles were identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE and other online sources. Pertinent references were traced back to their sources and also included in the literature review. The quality and content of each article was evaluated by the authors using the American Academy of Emergency Medicine literature review guidelines.

Results

Nineteen papers were ultimately identified and evaluated. No evidence rose above the level of case report/series. There were 13 case reports/series, 4 animal studies, and 2 expert opinion articles. True clinical research about the question of whether or not a glucose load can precipitate acute onset of Wernicke encephalopathy is lacking.

Conclusions

Mounting case report evidence suggests that prolonged glucose supplementation without the addition of thiamine can be a risk factor for the development of Wernicke encephalopathy. Based on our findings, a delay in giving glucose to hypoglycemic patients cannot be recommended at this time, although prompt thiamine supplementation after or concurrent with a return to normoglycemia is recommended.

### Wernicke encephalopathy: a future problem even after sleeve gastrectomy? A systematic literature review [^113uuVe3]. Obesity Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a serious complication of bariatric surgery with significant morbidity and mortality. A few cases have been reported in the literature, mainly in patients after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Since sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become a more established and popular bariatric procedure, WE is expected to appear more frequently after SG. We performed a literature review on WE after SG, and 13 cases have been found to be sufficiently documented. The risk of WE needs to be considered in patients with a prolonged vomiting episode and any type of neurological symptoms, independent of the presence of any surgical complications.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^112asAtg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Treatment of syncope — general principles: The principal goals of treatment for patients with syncope are to prolong survival, limit physical injuries, and prevent recurrences. The importance and priority of these different goals are dependent on the cause of syncope; for example, in patients with VT causing syncope, the mortality risk is clearly predominant, while in patients with reflex syncope the prevention of recurrences and/or limitation of injuries. Knowledge of the cause of syncope has a key role in selection of treatment, and once the cause has been ascertained, the second goal is to assess the mechanism leading to syncope.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^1173kqJG]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

Recurrent unexplained falls are most likely associated with a cardiovascular cause.
The commonest cardiovascular causes of falls in rank order are orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syndrome, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, bradyarrhythmias and atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
The investigation (and subsequent management and specialist referral criteria) of syncope, and therefore, recurrent unexplained falls can be performed according to locally applicable guidelines such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope.
If orthostatic hypotension is suspected but not detected using traditional methods — oscillometer or sphygmomanometer, referral for beat-to-beat orthostatic measurement is recommended as the association of falls with orthostatic hypotension measured using beat-to-beat methods is more consistent.
If vasovagal syncope or delayed orthostatic hypotension is suspected and diagnostic uncertainty remains, older adults should be referred for head up tilt tests.
If arrhythmias are suspected after clinical assessment, based on locally applicable guidelines individuals should be referred for external or internal cardiac monitoring.
For assessment for orthostatic hypotension, individuals should be supine for at least 5 minutes before baseline blood pressure is recorded; on standing, blood pressure should be taken as soon as possible (40–60 seconds), followed by measurements at 1-minute intervals up to 3 minutes, or up to 5 minutes if symptoms suggested a delayed orthostatic hypotension response.
Orthostatic hypotension most commonly occurs as a result of dehydration, concomitant medications, autonomic dysfunction and with alpha synucleopathy diseases (such as PD, dementia with Lewy Bodies or multisystem atrophy). It is also common in older adults with hypertension.
Short-term 24–48 hours cardiac rhythm monitoring is not indicated unless events occur daily. Prolonged external or internal ambulatory cardiac monitoring is indicated if arrhythmias are suspected as a cause of falls or syncope, after clinical assessment.
Older adults with unexplained syncope, suspected syncope or unexplained falls who require carotid sinus massage or head up tilt tests should be referred to an appropriate specialist, according to locally applicable guidelines.

### Wernicke's encephalopathy after laparoscopic cardiomyotomy for achalasia [^116R7G9d]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Achalasia is an incurable neuromuscular disorder of the esophagus, resulting from destruction of the esophageal myenteric plexus. This leads to aperistalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax after swallowing. Symptoms of achalasia are gradual in onset and include dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Severe malnutrition can ensue. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a serious, potentially fatal, neurologic disorder caused by thiamine deficiency (vitamin B(1)), classically described as presenting with a triad of ocular abnormalities, ataxia, and confusion. The incidence is uncertain, and many cases likely go unrecognized. It is usually diagnosed in the alcoholic population. We describe its onset after the successful surgical treatment of achalasia.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^114yNmUA]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic

Table 3 lists the management of common pain etiologies seen through various stages of leukodystrophies. Chronic nociceptive pain management that is resistant to treatment should follow the 2-step strategy established by the World Health Organization. Key elements include dosing at regular intervals, using appropriate routes of administration, and adapting treatment to the individual child. Pain management according to the 2-step approach is dependent on the assessed level of pain severity. The first step is intended for children reporting mild pain, requiring nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) for adequate management. Of note, acetaminophen should be used only in cases where the underlying leukodystrophy does not involve liver impairment. The second step should be applied in patients experiencing moderate to severe pain, requiring morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, or methadone. For persistent distress in patients with neurologic impairments, pain management should target neuropathic pain, visceral hyperalgia, and autonomic dysfunction.

Neuropathic pain may be attributed to peripheral nerve dysfunction and increased responsiveness to pain (peripheral neuropathic pain) or related to central nervous system involvement in the thalamus or spinothalamic tracts (central neuropathic pain). Neuropathic pain is typically described as burning, shooting, or needle-like pain. For the management of neuropathic pain, gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used. Gabapentin appears to be an effective treatment, as suggested by a retrospective analysis performed with data from 22 children with symptoms similar to those seen in the leukodystrophies: severe impairment of the central nervous system and recurrent pain behaviors, including intermittent changes in muscle tone. In cases where muscle spasms or heightened spasticity are eliciting pain, the prudent use of benzodiazepines and other antispasmodics is indicated.

Visceral hyperalgesia refers to an altered threshold for pain in response to gastrointestinal stimulus, believed to be related to injury or inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Information that suggests visceral hyperalgesia includes pain associated with gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube feeds, bowel gas, or pain associated with a bowel movement. Pharmacologic treatment of visceral hyperalgia includes medications used for neuropathic pain, including gabapentin.

Children with leukodystrophies may also experience autonomic dysfunction. Features suggesting autonomic dysfunction may include diaphoresis, elevated heart rate or temperature, pallor or flushing, and increased salivation. Medications for the treatment of autonomic dysfunction include clonidine and benzodiazepines, although none have been specifically studied in children with leukodystrophies.

Methods

On the basis of the results of the Needs Assessment survey and follow on discussions, a PubMed search was undertaken to identify additional management guidelines and recommendations for management of HE. The MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' combined with the subheadings 'therapy', 'rehabilitation', 'diet therapy', or 'drug therapy' was used as an initial search. This was then supplemented by a search combining the MESH term 'hepatic encephalopathy' and the article types 'consensus development conference', 'consensus development conference, NIH', or 'guideline'. A total of 1146 possible publications were identified and a manual search of this list was then undertaken to identify publications that could inform the development of draft statements. Because of the paucity of suitable papers, a free text search ('hepatic encephalopathy' AND (guideline* OR algorithm)) and a MESH search ('cognition disorders' AND cirrhosis) were also undertaken. These did not retrieve any additional suitable citations.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^11547idc]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is common in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and peripheral neuropathies including amyloid or diabetic neuropathy. Due to the frequency of nOH in the aging population, clinicians need to be well informed about its diagnosis and management. To date, studies of nOH have used different outcome measures and various methods of diagnosis, thereby preventing the generation of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practices' when treating patients with nOH and associated supine hypertension. To address these issues, the American Autonomic Society and the National Parkinson Foundation initiated a project to develop a statement of recommendations beginning with a consensus panel meeting in Boston on November 7, 2015, with continued communications and contributions to the recommendations through October of 2016. This paper summarizes the panel members' discussions held during the initial meeting along with continued deliberations among the panel members and provides essential recommendations based upon best available evidence as well as expert opinion for the (1) screening, (2) diagnosis, (3) treatment of nOH, and (4) diagnosis and treatment of associated supine hypertension.

### Reversible acute axonal polyneuropathy associated with wernicke-korsakoff syndrome: impaired physiological nerve conduction due to thiamine deficiency? [^112mdndf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Acute axonal polyneuropathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy developed simultaneously in three patients. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) detected markedly decreased compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) with minimal conduction slowing; sympathetic skin responses (SSRs) were also notably decreased. Sural nerve biopsies showed only mild axonal degeneration with scattered myelin ovoid formation. The symptoms of neuropathy lessened within two weeks after an intravenous thiamine infusion. CMAPs, SNAPs, and SSRs also increased considerably. We suggest that this is a new type of peripheral nerve impairment: physiological conduction failure with minimal conduction delay due to thiamine deficiency.

Risk assessment — Evaluation of the cause and assessment for the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality risk of syncope are recommended; short-term adverse events and deaths are determined largely by the cause of syncope and treatment effectiveness, and in patients without a presumptive cause, risk stratification for potential short-term outcomes is necessary for immediate decision making, while long-term adverse events and deaths are more likely driven by underlying medical comorbidities and evaluation should include a full assessment of long-term risk factors.

### Treatment of autonomic dysfunction in parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies [^111Y9Xyp]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system afflicts most patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure, reducing quality of life and increasing mortality. For example, gastrointestinal dysfunction can lead to impaired drug pharmacodynamics causing a worsening in motor symptoms, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension can cause syncope, falls, and fractures. When recognized, autonomic problems can be treated, sometimes successfully. Discontinuation of potentially causative/aggravating drugs, patient education, and nonpharmacological approaches are useful and should be tried first. Pathophysiology-based pharmacological treatments that have shown efficacy in controlled trials of patients with synucleinopathies have been approved in many countries and are key to an effective management. Here, we review the treatment of autonomic dysfunction in patients with Parkinson disease and other synucleinopathies, summarize the nonpharmacological and current pharmacological therapeutic strategies including recently approved drugs, and provide practical advice and management algorithms for clinicians, with focus on neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, dysphagia, sialorrhea, gastroparesis, constipation, neurogenic overactive bladder, underactive bladder, and sexual dysfunction. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: a focussed literature review [^113tnM38]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

There is an increasing awareness of the link between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of cognitive, behavioural and functional deficits. Currently, preventative strategies are limited and require engagement in dedicated long-term rehabilitation and sobriety services, the availability of which is low. The acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome is an episode of neurochemical imbalance leading to autonomic dysregulation, increased seizure risk and cognitive disorientation. In addition to harm from symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (e.g. seizures), the underpinning neurochemical changes may also lead to cytotoxicity through various cellular mechanisms, which long-term, may translate to some of the cognitive impairments observed in Alcohol-Related Brain Damage (ARBD). Here we review some of the pharmacological and neurochemical mechanisms underpinning alcohol withdrawal. We discuss the cellular and pharmacological basis of various potential neuroprotective strategies that warrant further exploration in clinical populations with a view to preventing the development of ARBD. Such strategies, when integrated into the clinical management of acute alcohol withdrawal, may impact large populations of individuals, who currently face limited dedicated service delivery and healthcare resource.

### Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver [^111a3N7q]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendations and case description framework — Every case and bout of HE should be described and classified according to four factors (type of underlying disease, severity of manifestations, time course, precipitating factors). Recommendations specify evaluation according to the type of underlying disease, severity of manifestations, time course, and precipitating factors (GRADE III, A, 1), and state that a diagnostic workup is required, considering other disorders that can alter brain function and mimic HE (GRADE II-2, A, 1).

### Promising strategies for the prevention of alcohol-related brain damage through optimised management of acute alcohol withdrawal: a focussed literature review [^113MCCXy]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prodromal symptoms of thiamine depletion include paraesthesia, fatigue and abdominal pain. The extremis of thiamine deficiency resulting from a marked derangement in cellular homeostasis presents as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Whilst typically associated with alcohol-dependence, non-alcohol-related causes include severe hyperemesis gravidarum, or anorexia nervosa, and post-bowel resection syndromes. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterised by cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor disturbances, such as nystagmus or other ophthalmoplegias, and cognitive disturbances including altered mental state or memory impairment. Post-mortem examination of individuals with Wernicke's encephalopathy demonstrate cerebellar vermis atrophy, ventricular dilation and mammillary body atrophy as common features. Interestingly, of the 51 cases reviewed by Harper, only 7 were diagnosed with Wernicke's encephalopathy pre-morbidly. Cerebellar lesions, and mammillary body and thalamic lesions, have been proposed to represent the chronic and acute phases of thiamine depletion, respectively. Imaging studies support this finding, adding that initial vasogenic and cytogenic oedema is seen in T2-FLAIR sequence MRI in acute Wernicke's encephalopathy. Following, the initial oedematous stage, a process of atrophy and cerebral shrinkage is observed, with cortical involvement being associated with a poorer prognosis. Various studies have related mammillary body vasogenic oedema or atrophy to functional deficits during acute Wernicke's encephalopathy. For example deficits of mammilo-thalamic functional connectivity in Wernicke's encephalopathy patients is related to impairments in verbal memory test performance. This altered functional connectivity and the associated cognitive impairments are partially reversible following thiamine provision.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the Evaluation and management of Patients with syncope: executive Summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^117YNBLU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Syncope additional evaluation and diagnosis — after the initial evaluation with history, physical exam, and ECG, no additional evaluation is needed when the initial evaluation is clear; if the initial evaluation suggests neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, targeted blood testing and referral for autonomic evaluation are listed; if the initial evaluation suggests reflex syncope, tilt-table testing is listed.

### Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia after brain injury… [^112pT5uz]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

We reviewed reports of autonomic dysregulation after brain injury and extracted essential features. From the clinical features, consistent themes emerge regarding signs and symptoms, differential diagnosis, and pharmacological therapies. We used these findings to make recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment. Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia appears to be a distinctive syndrome after brain injury that can mimic other life-threatening conditions. Early recognition may lead to fewer diagnostic tests and a rational approach to management. Prospective trials of specific drugs are needed to determine optimal efficacy.

Because excitation of the sympathetic nervous system appears to be a major feature of PAID, the uses of β-adrenergic blockade, such as propranolol or labetalol hydrochloride, are logical choices and have proven clinically useful in the amelioration of some of the most important clinical signs, but not cholinergic signs of PAID. In the experience of Do et al, 9 β1-adrenergic selective antagonists are not effective, as in mitigating autonomic dysregulation. Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, reduces blood pressure, has a behavior-stabilizing effect, and causes sedation. These features treat the sympathetic signs and may interrupt feedback into the system that otherwise would perpetuate the cycle of autonomic dysregulation. Apart from discontinuing the triggering agent, if known, the use of dantrolene is the only effective treatment for MH.

Dantrolene blocks calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing muscle relaxation, and has reduced mortality due to MH dramatically. As sedation and analgesia are withdrawn, more typical cycles of PAID may become evident. Typically, the next sign of concern is elevated blood pressure, leading to the initiation of antihypertensive therapy. Gradually, the cyclical nature of the PAID signs becomes evident with episodes daily or several times daily and with the return of vital signs to normal between episodes. A logical approach is to choose target signs, consider safety of particular drugs for the individual, and set a time frame for determination of efficacy before a drug is changed or a second drug is added. In our center, we try to devise a regimen that will prevent or ameliorate rather than rely on as-required drugs that may overtreat the condition.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities in wernicke encephalopathy… [^115ukiDE]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Results T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRIs showed high SIs in the bilateral paramedian thalamus, mamillary bodies, and periaqueductal gray matter. The DWIs showed bright high SI in the corresponding lesions, and ADC values were decreased. The ADC decrease and the DWI high SI were normalized in 2 weeks with administration of thiamine hydrochloride. With the help of MRI findings, WE was strongly suspected, and 200 mg of thiamine was given daily via intravenous and oral routes. On the fourth hospital day she regained consciousness, and the ophthalmoplegia started to improve. On the seventh hospital day she became alert and could communicate with her family. On hospital day 10, the ophthalmoplegia completely resolved, and mild confabulation was noted. On hospital day 14, follow-up MRI showed complete resolution of the previous high SIs.

However, moderate confabulation, attentional deficit, and gait ataxia remained on hospital day 60. Magnetic resonance imaging, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images, was performed with DWI on the first hospital day. The diagnosis of WE was made using the typical clinical manifestations and MRI findings, and 200 mg of thiamine was given intravenously daily. The ataxia and ophthalmoplegia started to resolve on hospital day 2, and on the fifth hospital day, confused mentality and the previously described symptoms completely resolved. However, mild confabulation developed on the seventh hospital day, and the symptoms persisted on hospital day 30. Comment Our patients had WE. The triad of WE symptoms — confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and gait ataxia — and the typical MRI findings developed during the prolonged fasting and recurrent vomiting. The neurologic deficits with MRI abnormalities were improved by administration of thiamine.

Findings from DWI in our patients include reversible high SI in the bilateral paramedian thalamus and periaqueductal gray matter with decreased ADC values. The findings suggest that the MRI abnormalities of WE are caused by the cytotoxic edema and can be reversed with adequate treatment.
