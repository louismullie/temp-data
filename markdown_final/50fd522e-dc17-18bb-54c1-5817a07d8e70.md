## Question

what is the term used if a patient is biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic? Is this still thyrotoxicosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the correct term is for a patient who is biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic, and whether this still qualifies as thyrotoxicosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of thyrotoxicosis versus hyperthyroidism. Then, I should verify the biochemical criteria that distinguish overt from subclinical disease. Next, I will consider whether symptoms are required for the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. After that, I should review guideline and review-level sources to confirm the accepted terminology. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note any nuances that could change management even if the label is correct.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't mislabel the condition. Thyrotoxicosis is a clinical state of excess thyroid hormone action in tissues due to elevated circulating thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes increased synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland; importantly, thyrotoxicosis can occur without hyperthyroidism, such as in thyroiditis or exogenous hormone intake, so these terms are related but not interchangeable [^c6d1fff2] [^0393f7fc] [^d08bafee].

> Wait, let me verify the biochemical criteria that separate overt from subclinical disease. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined by a subnormal TSH with elevated free T4 and/or free T3, whereas subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3; symptoms are not part of the diagnostic criteria for either category, which means asymptomatic patients can still meet biochemical definitions of hyperthyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism [^75cb90d1] [^8f7b1e36] [^22fb1b8f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about whether "biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic" equals thyrotoxicosis. I need to check whether tissue-level excess hormone action is implied by the biochemistry alone. The answer is yes: if free T4 and/or free T3 are elevated with suppressed TSH, that meets the definition of thyrotoxicosis regardless of symptoms, because thyrotoxicosis reflects excess circulating hormone and tissue effects rather than a symptom threshold; if free T4 and free T3 are normal with suppressed TSH, that is subclinical hyperthyroidism, which is a biochemical state that may still carry physiologic consequences even when patients are asymptomatic [^c6d1fff2] [^75cb90d1] [^22fb1b8f].

> I should confirm the exact terminology so I don't overgeneralize. The correct term for a patient who is biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic is overt hyperthyroidism when free T4 and/or free T3 are elevated with suppressed TSH, and subclinical hyperthyroidism when free T4 and free T3 are normal with suppressed TSH; neither label requires symptoms for diagnosis, and both fall under the broader umbrella of thyrotoxicosis because they reflect excess thyroid hormone action at the tissue level [^75cb90d1] [^8f7b1e36] [^c6d1fff2].

> But wait, what if the suppressed TSH is transient or due to non-thyroidal illness or medications? I need to ensure persistence before applying these labels. Guidelines advise repeating TSH (and free hormones) in 3–6 months to confirm persistence before committing to a diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism, and to evaluate etiology with TRAb and, when needed, radioactive iodine uptake or thyroid scintigraphy to distinguish endogenous causes from thyroiditis or exogenous sources; this step helps avoid misclassification of transient biochemical abnormalities as thyrotoxicosis [^a5dd77cd] [^3babb464] [^11633fac].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications briefly, even though the question is terminological. Management differs by severity and risk: overt hyperthyroidism generally warrants definitive therapy or antithyroid drugs depending on etiology, whereas subclinical hyperthyroidism is often observed in lower-risk patients and treated when TSH is persistently less than 0.1 mU/L, particularly in older adults or those with cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis; this reinforces that the biochemical category matters for prognosis and treatment decisions even when patients are asymptomatic [^450abe1e] [^f8a3436f] [^8b75398b].

> In summary, I should double-check that my final phrasing is precise. If the patient has elevated free T4 and/or free T3 with suppressed TSH, the correct term is overt hyperthyroidism, and yes, this is thyrotoxicosis even if asymptomatic; if free T4 and free T3 are normal with suppressed TSH, the correct term is subclinical hyperthyroidism, which is also a form of thyrotoxicosis at the tissue level despite the absence of classic symptoms [^75cb90d1] [^8f7b1e36] [^c6d1fff2].

---

The correct term for a patient who is biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic is **subclinical hyperthyroidism** [^75cb90d1], defined by a low or undetectable TSH with normal free T4 and T3 [^8f7b1e36]. This is a form of **thyrotoxicosis** [^c6d1fff2] because it reflects excess thyroid hormone action, even without overt symptoms. Management is guided by TSH level, age, and comorbidities [^450abe1e]; observation is reasonable in low-risk patients, while treatment is considered for TSH < 0.1 mU/L or in older adults with cardiovascular or bone risks [^f8a3436f].

---

## Definitions and distinctions

- **Thyrotoxicosis**: A clinical state of excess thyroid hormone action in tissues, regardless of source [^c6d1fff2] (increased synthesis, release, or exogenous intake) [^0393f7fc].
- **Hyperthyroidism**: A subset of thyrotoxicosis due to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion by the thyroid gland [^0393f7fc] (e.g. Graves' disease, toxic nodular disease) [^d08bafee].
- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: A biochemical state with low or undetectable TSH and normal free T4 and T3, typically without overt symptoms [^75cb90d1] [^22fb1b8f].

Thus, subclinical hyperthyroidism is a **form of thyrotoxicosis** [^c6d1fff2] because it reflects excess thyroid hormone action, even if symptoms are minimal or absent.

---

## Clinical significance and risks

Although asymptomatic, subclinical hyperthyroidism carries **clinically relevant risks**, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation [^2f6bc912], other arrhythmias, and heart failure, especially in older adults [^f42194bd].
- **Bone health**: Accelerated bone loss and increased fracture risk in postmenopausal women [^2f6bc912] [^f42194bd].
- **Progression**: Annual progression to overt hyperthyroidism is about 1–2% when TSH is < 0.1 mU/L, and lower when TSH is 0.1–0.4 mU/L [^1d2a5271] [^bf690847].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism **requires**:

| **Laboratory test** | **Result** |
|-|-|
| TSH | Low or undetectable (< 0.4 mU/L) |
| Free T4 | Normal |
| Total T3 or free T3 | Normal |

---

Persistence of the abnormal TSH on **repeat testing** over 3–6 months is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and exclude transient causes [^a5dd77cd] [^f42194bd].

---

## Etiology

Common causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism include:

- **Endogenous causes**: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, solitary autonomous nodules [^3babb464].
- **Exogenous causes**: Excessive thyroid hormone replacement, accidental overdose, or factitious intake [^2f6bc912].
- **Transient causes**: Thyroiditis or non-thyroidal illness can cause transient TSH suppression and should be excluded [^967640df].

---

## Management guidelines

Management depends on **TSH level, age, comorbidities, and etiology**:

- **Observation**: Appropriate for asymptomatic patients < 65 years without cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis, with TSH 0.1–0.4 mU/L [^8b75398b].
- **Treatment**: Considered for TSH < 0.1 mU/L, patients ≥ 65 years, or those with cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptoms [^450abe1e] [^f8a3436f].
- **Therapy**: Antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery based on etiology and patient preference [^3846a9f5] [^3685936f].
- **Monitoring**: Repeat TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months in stable patients [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The correct term for a biochemically hyperthyroid but asymptomatic patient is **subclinical hyperthyroidism**, which is a form of thyrotoxicosis [^c6d1fff2]. It carries risks of cardiovascular and skeletal complications, particularly in older adults or those with comorbidities [^2f6bc912]. Management is individualized based on TSH level, age, and comorbidities, with observation for low-risk patients and treatment for high-risk patients or those with persistently suppressed TSH [^450abe1e].

Background

Thyrotoxicosis has multiple etiologies, manifestations, and potential therapies. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions and patient preference. This document describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition.

Methods

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) previously cosponsored guidelines for the management of thyrotoxicosis that were published in 2011. Considerable new literature has been published since then, and the ATA felt updated evidence-based guidelines were needed. The association assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this report. They examined relevant literature using a systematic PubMed search supplemented with additional published materials. An evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated the knowledge and experience of the panel was used to update the 2011 text and recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them were rated according to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Group.

Results

Clinical topics addressed include the initial evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis; management of Graves' hyperthyroidism using radioactive iodine, antithyroid drugs, or surgery; management of toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma using radioactive iodine or surgery; Graves' disease in children, adolescents, or pregnant patients; subclinical hyperthyroidism; hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' orbitopathy; and management of other miscellaneous causes of thyrotoxicosis. New paradigms since publication of the 2011 guidelines are presented for the evaluation of the etiology of thyrotoxicosis, the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism with antithyroid drugs, the management of pregnant hyperthyroid patients, and the preparation of patients for thyroid surgery. The sections on less common causes of thyrotoxicosis have been expanded.

Conclusions

One hundred twenty-four evidence-based recommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with thyrotoxicosis and to share what the task force believes is current, rational, and optimal medical practice.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — observation is acceptable for asymptomatic patients under age 65 without cardiac disease or osteoporosis, who can be observed without further investigation of the etiology of the subnormal TSH or treatment (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In this range, treatment should be considered for older subjects, but it is not recommended for subjects < 65 years of age; younger subjects should be monitored at regular 6- to 12-month intervals, and treatment should be considered if the TSH persistently decreases to < 0.1 mU/L. In patients with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a trial of β-adrenergic blocking agents may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

Graves' disease after 131I therapy — follow-up and monitoring should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3 within the first 1–2 months, with biochemical monitoring continued at 4–6 week intervals if the patient remains thyrotoxic; most patients normalize thyroid function and symptoms within 4–8 weeks, hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks on but more commonly between 2 and 6 months, once euthyroidism is achieved lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended, and since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves they should be interpreted cautiously and only in concert with free T4 and T3 estimates.

### Hyperthyroidism [^438539da]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis is a general term for excess circulating and tissue thyroid hormone levels, whereas hyperthyroidism specifically denotes disorders involving a hyperactive thyroid gland (Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, toxic adenoma). Diagnosis and determination of the cause rely on clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, or thyroidectomy. Other types of thyrotoxicosis are monitored and treated with β-blockers to control symptoms given that most of these conditions resolve spontaneously.

### Hyperthyroidism [^d08bafee]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Thyrotoxicosis causes a variety of symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Hyperthyroidism refers to increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, most commonly from Graves' disease or toxic nodular goitre, whereas thyroiditis (typically autoimmune, viral, or drug induced) causes thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is based on suppressed serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), accompanied by free thyroxine and total or free tri-iodothyronine concentrations, which are raised (overt hyperthyroidism) or within range (subclinical hyperthyroidism). The underlying cause is determined by clinical assessment, detection of TSH-receptor antibodies and, if necessary, radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment options for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, and thyroidectomy, whereas thyroiditis is managed symptomatically or with glucocorticoid therapy. In Graves' disease, first-line treatment is a 12-18-month course of antithyroid drugs, whereas for goitre, radioactive iodine or surgery are preferred for toxic nodules or goitres. Evidence also supports long-term treatment with antithyroid drugs as an option for patients with Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) with TSH persistently below the lower limit of normal but ≥ 0.1 mU/L — treatment of SH should be considered in individuals ≥ 65 years of age and in patients with cardiac disease or symptoms of hyperthyroidism (2/+00). Persistence in this range is defined as a TSH level between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L on repeated measurement over a 3–6-month period; the thyroid disorder underlying SH should be diagnosed to avoid treating transient, functional disorders related to acute illness, drugs, and other causes of low TSH. In symptomatic patients, a trial of beta-adrenergic blockers may be useful to determine whether symptomatic therapy might suffice.

### Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis [^60c2a9e8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are hypermetabolic conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis can be difficult because symptoms can mimic many other disease states leading to inaccurate or untimely diagnoses and management. Thyroid storm is the most severe form of thyrotoxicosis, hallmarked by altered sensorium, and, if untreated, is associated with significant mortality. Thyroid storm should be considered in the differential of any patient presenting with altered mental status. The emergency medicine physician who can rapidly recognize thyrotoxicosis, identify the precipitating event, appropriately and comprehensively begin medical management, and facilitate disposition will undoubtedly save a life.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^f742aa6e]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^2d92ae99]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment… [^5194736d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

In a 20-year follow-up study, clinical or biochemical hypothyroidism developed in 55% of the women who initially had positive thyroid antibodies and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level but a normal serum free thyroxine level.
15. 1 Some patients may present with self-limited transient thyrotoxicosis or a hyperthyroid phase caused by destructive inflammation attributed to HT damaging the thyroid follicles, releasing excess thyroid hormone. 18 The thyroid gland is often diffusely enlarged and firm with an irregular surface on examination. 15 Some patients have a small thyroid volume if underlying atrophy of the thyroid gland has occurred. 2 Patients with goiter may have compressive symptoms such as dysphonia, dyspnea, and dysphagia.

1. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Postpartum thyroiditis is a painless condition.

A total of 40% of patients with postpartum thyroiditis present with isolated hypothyroidism, whereas 25% to 40% experience a triphasic pattern of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism and then euthyroidism. During the thyrotoxic phase, symptoms are usually mild and begin two to six months postpartum. This phase typically lasts two to three months. The hypothyroid phase occurs three to 12 months postpartum and is often symptomatic.
12. About 50% of patients present with the thyrotoxic phase, which typically lasts for three to six weeks. Symptoms are often mild and may include diaphoresis, heat intolerance, tremors, palpitations, and weight loss. Following the thyrotoxic phase, one-third of patients develop hypothyroidism, which can last up to six months. There is no thyroid pain during this phase. Most patients return to euthyroidism within 12 months of the onset of disease. Between 5% and 15% of patients develop permanent hypothyroidism.
12.

DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is mainly clinical. During the initial thyrotoxic phase, the patient presents with anterior neck pain, tenderness to palpation of the thyroid gland, and signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are elevated. In the thyrotoxic phase, TSH is usually suppressed with elevated or normal T.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^4df44fa0]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — treatment selection principles for hyperthyroidism emphasize shared decision-making, practicality, and surgical expertise: The long-term quality of life (QoL) following treatment for Graves' disease was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to one of the three treatment options, and no scientific evidence exists to support the recommendation of alternative therapies for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options and the selection should also take into account the local availability and the associated costs; when surgery is selected one should consider use of expert high-volume thyroid surgeons who on average have low rates of complications, and lack of that expertise should be considered against the known risk of alternative choices. Long-term continuous treatment of hyperthyroidism with ATDs may be considered in selected cases.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^2482b1d4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: when to consider treatment [^2f6bc912]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodinedeficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) — prevalence and natural history show that in a representative U.S. sample without known thyroid disease, 0.7% had suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/L) and 1.8% had low TSH (< 0.4 mU/L). The natural history is variable, with annualized rates of 0.5%–7% progression to overt hyperthyroidism and 5%–12% reversion to normal TSH levels. Progression to overt hyperthyroidism appears more likely when TSH is suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/L) rather than low but detectable (0.01–0.4 mIU/L).

Graves' disease persistent hyperthyroidism after radioactive iodine (RAI) — When hyperthyroidism due to GD persists after 6 months following RAI therapy, retreatment with RAI is suggested, and in selected patients with minimal response 3 months after therapy additional RAI may be considered (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Response to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, thyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms; the goal of retreatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid, patients with persistent, suppressed TSH with normal total T3 and free T4 may not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely, and in the small percentage refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be considered.

Introduction — thyrotoxicosis definitions, treatment scope, and U.S. epidemiology: Thyrotoxicosis refers to a clinical state that results from inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues generally due to inappropriately high tissue thyroid hormone levels, and hyperthyroidism is a form of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone(s) by the thyroid. β-blockers may be used in almost all forms of thyrotoxicosis, whereas antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are useful only in some. In the United States, the prevalence of hyperthyroidism is approximately 1.2% (0.5% overt and 0.7% subclinical); the most common causes include Graves' disease (GD), toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG), and toxic adenoma (TA).

Gestational hyperthyroidism is described as a generally asymptomatic, mild, and self-limiting biochemical hyperthyroidism in the first trimester and is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Technical remarks state there is no evidence that treating gestational hyperthyroidism with ATDs is beneficial and that ATD use in early pregnancy has been associated with an increase in risk of birth defects; for these patients, physical examination and repeat thyroid function tests at intervals of 3–4 weeks is recommended, and for very symptomatic disease a trial of β-blocker therapy [propranolol or metoprolol, but not atenolol] may be considered.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^5c15f5fa]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^d4cafc0d]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^22fb1b8f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^e93ad3f6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid resulting in release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake. Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and the skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

Graves' disease (GD) hyperthyroidism — initial treatment modalities and patient-centered decision-making: Patients with overt Graves' hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the following modalities: 131I therapy; antithyroid medication, or thyroidectomy. Once it has been established that the patient is hyperthyroid and the cause is GD, the patient and physician must choose between three effective and relatively safe initial treatment options: 131I therapy (radioactive iodine), anti-thyroid drugs (ATD), or thyroidectomy. In the United States, radioactive iodine has been the therapy most preferred by physicians, whereas in Europe and Japan there has been a greater physician preference for ATDs and/or surgery, and the long-term quality of life (QoL) following treatment for GD was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to one of the three treatment options. Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, benefits, expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, potential side effects, and cost.

### Update on subclinical hyperthyroidism [^8a233701]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.

### Approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism [^ea0f81d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined by normal circulating levels of free T4 and T3 and low levels of TSH, is a common clinical entity and is typically caused by the same conditions that account for the majority of cases of overt hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and mortality, decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, and mild hyperthyroid symptoms. Treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism remains controversial, given the lack of prospective randomized controlled trials showing clinical benefit with restoration of the euthyroid state. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to treat older individuals whose serum TSH levels are less than 0.1 mU/liter and certain high-risk patients, even when the serum TSH is between 0.1 and the lower limit of the normal range.

### Scintigraphic manifestations of thyrotoxicosis [^8a9ae4fa]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

The term thyrotoxicosis refers to the clinical syndrome of increased systemic metabolism that results when the serum concentrations of free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, or both are elevated. The term hyperthyroidism refers to overactivity of the thyroid gland with a resultant increase in thyroid hormone synthesis and release into the systemic circulation. These terms are not interchangeable, since thyrotoxicosis can develop in thyroid conditions that are not associated with increased thyroid function, such as thyroiditis, or in so-called factitious hyperthyroidism. The clinical signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis are virtually identical regardless of the cause. However, in a given patient, every attempt should be made to determine the exact cause of the thyrotoxicosis, as this in turn determines the prognosis and treatment. Since thyroid scintigraphy demonstrates the functional state of the thyroid gland, it should be used, in conjunction with determination of radioactive iodine uptake, as the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Although the scintigraphic features of several of the thyroid disorders that cause thyrotoxicosis may overlap, their recognition helps narrow the differential diagnosis, thereby guiding the referring physician in the work-up and management of this disorder.

Post–radioactive iodine follow-up for toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) or TA — monitoring and expected outcomes specify that follow-up within the first 1–2 months should include free T4, total T3, and TSH, repeated at 1–2 month intervals until stable, then at least annually (1/+00). For TMNG, resolution of hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 55% at 3 months and 80% at 6 months, with an average failure rate of 15%; goiter volume decreases by 3 months with further reduction over 24 months for a total 40% size reduction. For TA, 75% are no longer hyperthyroid at 3 months, with nodule volume decreased by 35% at 3 months and 45% at 2 years; persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism ranges from 0% to 30%. Long-term risk of clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism is about 8% by 1 year and 60% by 20 years for TA, and an average of 3% by 1 year and 64% by 24 years for TMNG. If thyroid hormone therapy is necessary, the dose required may be less than full replacement due to persistent autonomous thyroid function.

For monitoring, in patients at high risk of complications from SH, TSH and free T4 should be repeated within 2–6 weeks, and for all other patients the serum TSH should be repeated at 3–6 months prior to initiating therapy.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation and assay pitfalls state that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test used in the evaluation of suspected thyrotoxicosis and should be used as an initial screening test; when thyrotoxicosis is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when a serum TSH, free T4, and total T3 are assessed at the initial evaluation. In overt hyperthyroidism, serum free T4, T3, or both are elevated, and serum TSH is subnormal (usually < 0.01 mU/L in a third-generation assay); in mild hyperthyroidism, serum T4 and free T4 can be normal with only serum T3 elevated and serum TSH low or undetectable; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a normal serum free T4 and normal total T3 or free T3, with subnormal serum TSH concentration, and a normal serum TSH level precludes the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis in the absence of a TSH-producing pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance or spurious interfering antibodies. Assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated and less robust than those for free T4; therefore, measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred over free T3 in clinical practice. The term euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia refers to elevated T4 (and frequently elevated total serum T3) without hyperthyroidism from protein-binding abnormalities such as elevations in T4 binding globulin or transthyretin, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and rarely immunoglobulins that directly bind T4 or T3; spurious results may arise from heterophilic antibodies causing high TSH, which should be ruled out by repeat testing, serial dilution, or anti-mouse antibody measurement, and ingestion of high doses of biotin may cause spuriously low results in assays that utilize a streptavidin–biotin separation technique.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^75cb90d1]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis — definitions, causes, and selected epidemiology — are detailed as follows: Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal (usually undetectable) serum thyrotropin (TSH) with elevated free thyroxine (T4) and/or free triiodothyronine (T3), and subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable TSH with T3 and free T4 within normal ranges. Thyrotoxicosis can result from four pathways: excessive trophic stimulation, constitutive activation of synthesis/secretion with autonomous release, passive release of preformed hormone from thyroid injury, or exposure to extrathyroidal sources. Endogenous hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to Graves' disease (GD) or nodular thyroid disease, and GD is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States; toxic nodular goiter may actually be more common than GD in older patients in regions of iodine deficiency, and remission of mild GD has been reported in up to 30% of patients without treatment. Less common causes include painless and subacute thyroiditis; population frequencies for painless thyroiditis vary, accounting for 0.5% of thyrotoxic patients in Denmark, 6% in Toronto, and 22% in Wisconsin. Painless thyroiditis may occur during lithium, cytokine (e.g., interferon-α), or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and is termed postpartum thyroiditis in the postpartum period; a painless destructive thyroiditis occurs in 5%–10% of amiodarone-treated patients, and subacute thyroiditis is thought to be caused by viral infection and is characterized by fever and thyroid pain.

Thyrotoxicosis background and etiologies — In general, thyrotoxicosis can occur if (i) the thyroid is inappropriately stimulated by trophic factors; (ii) there is constitutive activation of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion leading to autonomous release of excess thyroid hormone; (iii) thyroid stores of preformed hormone are passively released in excessive amounts owing to autoimmune, infectious, chemical, or mechanical insult; or (iv) there is exposure to extra-thyroidal sources of thyroid hormone, which may be either endogenous (struma ovarii, metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer) or exogenous (factitious thyrotoxicosis). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined as a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with values within the normal reference range for both triiodothyronine (T3) and free thyroxine (T4) estimates and is most often caused by release of excess thyroid hormone by the gland. GD is an autoimmune disorder in which thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs) stimulate the TSH receptor, increasing thyroid hormone production. The natural history of nodular thyroid disease includes growth of established nodules, new nodule formation, and development of autonomy over time, and in TAs autonomous hormone production can be caused by somatic activating mutations of genes regulating thyroid hormone synthesis; germline mutations in the gene encoding the TSH receptor can cause sporadic or familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^2e1d0674]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^3685936f]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism — management options, monitoring, and goals: The treatment of SH is similar to the treatment of overt hyperthyroidism, with radioactive iodine appropriate for most patients, especially in older patients when TMNG is a frequent cause of SH, while long-term antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy is a reasonable alternative in patients with GD and SH, especially in younger patients. Some patients with SH due to GD may remit spontaneously so observation without therapy is reasonable for younger patients; a small subset of elderly patients with persistently low TSH and no evidence of true thyroid dysfunction can be followed without intervention, particularly when serum FT4 estimate and T3 are in the lower half of normal. Treatment with beta-adrenergic blockade may be sufficient to control cardiovascular-related morbidity, especially atrial fibrillation. Technical remarks state that some patients with SH due to mild GD may be followed without therapy with frequent (every 3 months) monitoring of thyroid function; in select SH due to TMNG with compressive symptoms or concern for malignancy, surgery is also an option; and the goal of therapy for SH is to render the patient euthyroid with a normal TSH. Data cited note stabilization or improvement in bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with SH treated, and reports of improvement in hyperthyroid symptoms with antithyroid drug therapy and after beta-adrenergic blockade.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hyperthyroidism, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to determine the etiology of thyrotoxicosis. If the diagnosis is not apparent based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, perform diagnostic testing including:

- measurement of thyrotropin receptor antibodies

- determination of the radioactive iodine uptake, or

- measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasound.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: current concepts and scintigraphic imaging [^7237f4b0]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine and a free triiodothyronine level, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and is usually undetectable. Although patients with this diagnosis have no or few signs and symptoms of overt thyrotoxicosis, there is sufficient evidence that it is associated with a relatively higher risk of supraventricular arrhythmias as well as the acceleration or the development of osteoporosis. Consequently, the approach to the patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism is controversial, that is, therapeutic intervention versus watchful waiting. Regardless, it is imperative for the referring physician to identify the causative thyroid disorder. This is optimally accomplished by a functional study, namely scintigraphy. Recognition of the scan findings of the various causes of subclinical hyperthyroidism enables the imaging specialist to help in diagnosing the underlying condition causing thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression thereby facilitating the workup and management of this thyroid disorder.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^5f51abf5]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) frequency and causes — SH has a prevalence of about 1% in the general population; in older persons TMNG is probably the most common cause, with other etiologies including GD, solitary autonomously functioning nodules, and various forms of thyroiditis. Other causes of a suppressed TSH with normal estimated free T4 and T3 include corticosteroid therapy, central hypothyroidism, and nonthyroidal illness. Once SH has been detected, it is important to document persistence by repeating the serum TSH at 3 or 6 months, and scintigraphic studies suggesting autonomous thyroid function would favor SH.

### Hyperthyroidism [^0393f7fc]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Hyperthyroidism is characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland, whereas thyrotoxicosis refers to the clinical syndrome of excess circulating thyroid hormones, irrespective of the source. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, followed by toxic nodular goitre. Other important causes of thyrotoxicosis include thyroiditis, iodine-induced and drug-induced thyroid dysfunction, and factitious ingestion of excess thyroid hormones. Treatment options for Graves' disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine therapy, and surgery, whereas antithyroid drugs are not generally used long term in toxic nodular goitre, because of the high relapse rate of thyrotoxicosis after discontinuation. β blockers are used in symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, and might be the only treatment needed for thyrotoxicosis not caused by excessive production and release of the thyroid hormones. Thyroid storm and hyperthyroidism in pregnancy and during the post-partum period are special circumstances that need careful assessment and treatment.

In addition to β-adrenergic blockade, pretreatment with MMI prior to RAI therapy for GD should be considered in such higher-risk patients, and MMI should be discontinued 2–3 days prior to RAI; the evidence ratings are "Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence" for β-blockade and "Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" for MMI pretreatment.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^f42194bd]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

Radioactive iodine dosing, pregnancy testing, safety, and follow-up in GD — Sufficient radiation should be administered in a single dose (typically 10–15 mCi) to render the patient with GD hypothyroid (1/++0). A pregnancy test should be obtained within 48 hours prior to treatment in any female with childbearing potential who is to be treated with radioactive iodine, and the treating physician should obtain this test and verify a negative result prior to administering radioactive iodine (1/+00). The physician administering the radioactive iodine should provide written advice concerning radiation safety precautions following treatment, and if the precautions cannot be followed, alternative therapy should be selected (1/+00). Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after radioactive iodine therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4 and total T3, and if the patient remains thyrotoxic, biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4–6 week intervals (1/+00).

Recommendation 95 — TRAb re-testing late in pregnancy when mid-gestation levels are elevated: Patients with elevated TRAb levels at 18–22 weeks of gestation should have TRAb measured in late pregnancy (weeks 30–34) to guide decisions regarding neonatal monitoring. An exception to this recommendation is a woman with an intact thyroid who is no longer in need of ATD therapy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. TRAb measurement in late pregnancy can be used to assess the risk of delayed neonatal hyperthyroidism when the mother continues to need ATD up to term; after delivery, ATD is rapidly metabolized by the neonate, whereas maternal TRAb has a half-life of around 3 weeks. In a study of 47 newborns to TRAb-positive mothers, nine had neonatal biochemical hyperthyroidism and five of these (9% of all) needed ATD therapy; all hyperthyroid neonates were born to mothers with TRAb ≥ 5 IU/L in the second trimester (sensitivity 100%, specificity 43%), and all mothers who gave birth to hyperthyroid newborns required ATD therapy in late pregnancy.

### Laboratory testing in hyperthyroidism [^c0954134]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is difficult (full text available online: http://education.amjmed.com/pp1/272). Clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and there is incomplete correlation between structural and functional thyroid gland changes. Laboratory testing is therefore indispensible in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Similar considerations apply to treatment monitoring. Laboratory testing also plays a crucial role in establishing the most likely cause for a patient's hyperthyroidism. Finally, during pregnancy, when isotopic scanning is relatively contraindicated and ultrasound is more difficult to interpret, laboratory testing becomes even more important.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^b5a169cb]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^07e23679]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.
