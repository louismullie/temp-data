## Question

clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis of congenital penile curvature

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical course, risk factors, and prognosis of congenital penile curvature. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions, epidemiology, and pathophysiology to anchor the condition. Then, I should verify the natural history and clinical course, including severity thresholds and functional impact. Next, I will examine associated risk factors and etiologies. After that, I need to assess prognosis with and without treatment, including psychosexual outcomes. Finally, I will integrate management implications and surgical considerations that influence outcomes, making sure to distinguish congenital curvature from Peyronie's disease throughout [^116pRtNu] [^112oG9YH].

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't conflate entities. Congenital penile curvature is a fixed, non-progressive ventral, dorsal, or lateral bend present from birth, typically appreciated only on erection, and it is relatively uncommon as an isolated anomaly, with diagnosis often delayed into late childhood or adolescence, which can compound psychosocial impact [^112C9hSL] [^116mkt81] [^1146Y1LR]. Hold on, I should verify the severity thresholds that guide management: curvature greater than 30 degrees is considered clinically significant, and curvature exceeding 60 degrees is strongly associated with interference with satisfactory intercourse and sexual disability, which aligns with adult Peyronie's data extrapolated to curvature severity, though I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize across etiologies [^1164jAxH] [^111LpoUe].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology and associated anomalies to anticipate risk. The core mechanisms include corporal disproportion, dysgenic ventral fascial bands, and skin chordee, and congenital curvature frequently coexists with hypospadias, which itself reflects abnormal urethral development and ventral tethering; I need to ensure I screen for associated genital anomalies during evaluation [^113Hm4Uw] [^111cQZ6X]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: the presence of hypospadias, especially proximal phenotypes with greater curvature, correlates with more complex reconstructions and higher complication risk, reinforcing the need for meticulous preoperative planning and counseling [^116iXaCv].

> I will now examine the clinical course and natural history. Unlike Peyronie's disease, which is acquired, progressive, and often painful, congenital curvature is typically stable from birth, non-progressive, and painless, becoming clinically apparent with erections during adolescence; I should double-check that I'm not attributing Peyronie's features to congenital cases, as that would mislead counseling and timing of surgery [^112oG9YH] [^116pRtNu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while congenital curvature is stable, untreated significant bends can worsen quality of life and sexual function over time due to mechanical and psychosocial factors, even if the curvature itself does not progress, which is a critical distinction for prognosis discussions [^115DEwSa].

> Let me consider the functional and psychosexual impact because prognosis is not purely anatomical. Significant curvature is associated with difficulty with penetration, partner discomfort, and substantial distress, and men with untreated ventral curvature report worse penile self-perception, more mentally unhealthy days, and greater intercourse difficulty; I should confirm that these data, though survey-based, align with clinical experience and are consistent with guideline emphasis on patient-reported outcomes [^115DEwSa] [^113gre11]. But wait, what if the curvature is mild? Even mild to moderate deformities can impair sexual confidence and function, and the threshold for "disability" varies with patient values, which is why shared decision-making and objective documentation are essential [^112aDkwQ].

> Next, I should review risk factors and etiologic contributors. I need to ensure I separate modifiable from non-modifiable risks: severity of curvature itself is the most consistent predictor of functional impairment, with > 60 degrees independently associated with sexual disability in curvature syndromes; associated hypospadias, especially proximal phenotypes, increases surgical complexity and complication risk; and tissue quality factors such as a narrow glans width and longer urethral reconstruction length independently predict complications after hypospadias-style repairs, which often accompany curvature [^111LpoUe] [^116iXaCv] [^1179UMQ5]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought age at repair might be a major independent risk for complications, but I should verify; while younger age can reflect more severe anatomy and may correlate with complications in observational series, contemporary analyses emphasize anatomical severity and tissue factors over age per se, so I should avoid overattributing risk to age alone [^113S5hWS].

> I will now examine prognosis with and without treatment. Without surgery, significant congenital curvature is associated with persistent sexual dysfunction, reduced quality of life, and measurable psychosocial morbidity, and the deformity does not typically improve spontaneously; I should confirm that these observations are consistent across lower-quality but directionally consistent studies and patient-reported surveys [^113gre11] [^116Fh9pD]. With surgical correction, both tunical plication and corporoplasty achieve high rates of straightening and patient satisfaction, though techniques differ in trade-offs: plication is simpler with potential shortening, while ventral lengthening with grafting preserves length in severe curvatures; I need to ensure I communicate these trade-offs during counseling [^113jynug] [^116MVQR5] [^116ypjEK]. Hold on, I should verify long-term outcomes: dorsal plication series report approximately 96% satisfaction with low complication rates, and broader systematic reviews show success rates for straightening generally between 75–100%, acknowledging heterogeneity and variable outcome definitions [^111fBR4v] [^116ypjEK].

> Let me integrate management implications that shape prognosis. Preoperative documentation with erect photography or pharmacologic erection is recommended to quantify deformity and guide procedure selection; artificial erection intraoperatively ensures accurate correction and verification; and shared decision-making should incorporate patient goals regarding length, sensation, and invasiveness, as these influence both technique choice and satisfaction with outcomes [^111T6eqC] [^111USdqd] [^112aDkwQ]. I should confirm that guidelines support intervening when curvature is functionally significant, typically > 30 degrees, and that both plication and ventral lengthening approaches are acceptable depending on severity and patient priorities, with ventral grafting favored in severe curvatures to mitigate shortening [^112dtZ7A] [^116MVQR5] [^113jynug].

> Finally, I need to ensure the differential diagnosis is explicit to avoid misclassification. Lifelong, painless curvature without palpable plaque supports congenital curvature, whereas subacute onset with pain and a palpable dorsal plaque indicates Peyronie's disease; this distinction is crucial because natural history, timing of surgery, and counseling differ substantially between the two conditions [^112oG9YH] [^111Jo6Tm]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating PD progression data with congenital curvature; PD can worsen, stabilize, or rarely improve over time, whereas congenital curvature is typically stable, so extrapolating PD natural history to congenital cases would be inappropriate [^111NND1q] [^1173jzZ9].

> In summary, congenital penile curvature is a stable, non-progressive anatomical deformity that becomes clinically evident with erections, often coexists with hypospadias, and carries meaningful functional and psychosocial burdens when untreated; prognosis is excellent with appropriately selected surgical correction, with high straightening success and patient satisfaction, though technique selection must balance correction, length preservation, and complication risk, and preoperative objective assessment is essential to optimize outcomes and counseling [^116mkt81] [^113Hm4Uw] [^116ypjEK].

Congenital penile curvature (CPC) is a **stable, non-progressive ventral or lateral bend** [^116pRtNu] present from birth, typically becoming apparent at puberty [^notfound]. It is often associated with hypospadias [^113Hm4Uw] and other genital anomalies, and can cause **esthetic and functional sexual problems** [^115DEwSa]. Curvature > 30° is clinically significant [^1164jAxH], and > 60° may **impair intercourse** [^111LpoUe]. Risk factors include **associated hypospadias** [^113Hm4Uw], corporal disproportion, and ventral skin or fascial tethering [^1111FXZK]; isolated CPC is uncommon [^112C9hSL]. Prognosis is **excellent with surgery** [^116ypjEK], which corrects curvature in 75–100% [^116ypjEK] with high satisfaction [^111fBR4v], though mild shortening or sensory changes can occur [^116ypjEK]. Untreated CPC can cause **psychosexual distress** [^113gre11] and sexual dysfunction [^116Fh9pD].

---

## Clinical course

- **Presentation**: CPC is a stable, non-progressive ventral or lateral curvature present from birth, typically becoming apparent at puberty [^112HaaSK] [^112oG9YH].

- **Associated anomalies**: CPC is often associated with hypospadias [^113Hm4Uw] and other genital anomalies, but can occur in isolation [^112C9hSL].

- **Functional impact**: CPC can cause esthetic and functional sexual problems, including difficulty with intercourse and psychological distress [^115DEwSa] [^113gre11].

---

## Risk factors

- **Associated anomalies**: Hypospadias [^notfound] and other genital anomalies significantly increase the risk of CPC.

- **Corporal disproportion**: Asymmetric development of corporal bodies is a key risk factor [^1111FXZK].

- **Ventral skin or fascial tethering**: Short ventral skin or fascial bands can contribute to curvature [^1111FXZK].

- **Isolated CPC**: Isolated CPC without associated anomalies is relatively uncommon [^112C9hSL].

---

## Prognosis

- **Surgical correction**: Surgical intervention (plication, corporoplasty, or grafting) effectively corrects curvature in 75–100% of cases [^116ypjEK], with high patient satisfaction [^111fBR4v].

- **Complications**: Mild penile shortening, sensory changes, or recurrent curvature can occur, but major complications are rare [^116ypjEK] [^112HaaSK].

- **Untreated CPC**: Persistent curvature can cause significant psychosexual distress [^113gre11] and sexual dysfunction [^116Fh9pD].

---

Overall, CPC is a **stable congenital anomaly** with excellent prognosis following surgical correction [^116ypjEK], but **untreated cases may experience significant psychosexual and functional consequences** [^113gre11].

Context

Penile curvature can be congenital or acquired. Acquired curvature is secondary due to La Peyronie (Peyronie's) disease.

Objective

To provide clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of penile curvature.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic literature search on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of penile curvature was performed. Articles with the highest evidence available were selected and formed the basis for assigning levels of evidence and grades of recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

The pathogenesis of congenital penile curvature is unknown. Peyronie's disease is a poorly understood connective tissue disorder most commonly attributed to repetitive microvascular injury or trauma during intercourse. Diagnosis is based on medical and sexual histories, which are sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Physical examination includes assessment of palpable nodules and penile length. Curvature is best documented by a self-photograph or pharmacologically induced erection. The only treatment option for congenital penile curvature is surgery based on plication techniques. Conservative treatment for Peyronie's disease is associated with poor outcomes. Pharmacotherapy includes oral potassium para-aminobenzoate, intralesional treatment with verapamil, clostridial collagenase or interferon, topical verapamil gel, and iontophoresis with verapamil and dexamethasone. They can be efficacious in some patients, but none of these options carry a grade A recommendation. Steroids, vitamin E, and tamoxifen cannot be recommended. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment and penile traction devices may only be used to treat penile pain and reduce penile deformity, respectively. Surgery is indicated when Peyronie's disease is stable for at least 3 mo. Tunical shortening procedures, especially plication techniques, are the first treatment options. Tunical lengthening procedures are preferred in more severe curvatures or in complex deformities. Penile prosthesis implantation is recommended in patients with erectile dysfunction not responding to pharmacotherapy.

Conclusions

These European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines summarise the present information on penile curvature. The extended version of the guidelines is available on the EAU Web site (www.uroweb.org/guidelines/).

### Congenital penile curvature treatments in adults: a systematic review of techniques and outcomes [^112HaaSK]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital penile curvature is a rare condition identified by an abnormal penile curvature present from birth. Surgical intervention is currently the most effective treatment and is generally deferred until after puberty; however, early correction is recommended by some due to its impact on psychosexual development. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature on surgical techniques for congenital penile curvature correction, focusing on their efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. Conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024526737), the review includes 59 studies meeting inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that numerous surgical techniques have been documented over the past decades, predominantly focusing on shortening procedures such as Nesbit, Yachia, tunica albuginea plication, and Essed-Schröder. These historically utilized methods remain effective for correcting congenital penile curvature, but they may result in side effects like penile shortening and erectile dysfunction. The review emphasizes the necessity for well-designed studies to better compare the benefits of various surgical techniques.

Peyronie's disease — differential diagnosis highlights that lifelong ventral penile curvature without pain or plaque is consistent with congenital penile curvature and should not be mistaken for PD, while acute conditions such as a thrombosed dorsal penile vein or penile fracture can cause abrupt ecchymosis, pain, and swelling; these two conditions are very acute with presentation within hours or days, whereas PD presents over a subacute time frame of weeks to months.

### Current trends in the surgical treatment of congenital penile curvature [^1127kiVu]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital penile curvature (CPC) is a relatively uncommon condition, characterized by congenital angulation of the erect penis. Surgical correction of CPC is the gold standard therapy with a variety of proposed surgical techniques and modifications. This review summarizes the contemporary literature on the surgical management of CPC, trying to address the current trends, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of available methods. We performed a non-systematic narrative and interpretative literature review until December 2018. We included articles with isolated CPC in human adults. We excluded original research articles regarding the surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD). In total, we identified 34 studies including 2155 patients with CPC that met our inclusion criteria. Nine studies included patients with both CPC and PD, but reported sufficient data regarding the CPC cohort. Excisional corporoplasty and incisionless plication seemed to be the preferred surgical methods (10 and 12 studies, respectively), followed by incisional corporoplasty (5) and grafting (3). Four studies reported results of more than one method. Overall, patients with CPC can expect excellent outcomes with surgical repair and minimal side effects. No definite conclusions can be made regarding which technique is superior. The widely varied outcomes highlight the need for standardized outcomes measures in future research.

### Hypospadias in toddlers: a multivariable study of prognostic factors in distal to mid-shaft hypospadias and review of literature [^112RT1RW]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Approximately 1 out of every 10–20 distal hypospadias surgeries develop a complication. Surgeons attempt to identify risk factors for complications to make modifications in techniques to improve their results. In the present study, we evaluated the results of the mid-shaft and distal hypospadias surgery in terms of potential factors predictive of complications. The persistent complications were noticed in 15.8% of our patients, which were within the range of previous studies (figure 6).

Figure 6
Meta-chart of complicated and uncomplicated percentages in distal and mid-shaft hypospadias.

Fistula and surgical site infection

Fistula developed in six cases and wound infection in eight cases (figure 5). We found a significant association between fistula formation and surgical site infection (p < 0.001). None of the fistula cases had meatal or urethral stenosis. Infection along with relatively low vascularity may result in poor wound healing and resultant fistula. Consequently, interventions that would reduce the infection rates can result in better outcomes.

Chordee

In terms of the presence of mild chordee, no significant differences were found between complicated and uncomplicated cohorts. Severe chordee cases were excluded from our study. Severe chordee (or penile curvature) can be indicative of underlying severe hypoplasia of corpus spongiosum, dartos, or Buck's fascia in the urethral area, which suggests that the severity of hypospadias defect is more profound and blood supply is more limited to the area. For this reason, the existence of severe chordee per se may be a major risk factor for complications particularly fistulas, and more importantly may affect other variables in the study, which, similar to proximal hypospadias, may lead to undervaluing or obscuring the role of other prognostic factors.

Glans

Smaller glans can be accompanied by technical difficulties at the surgery. However, no significant differences in glans diameters or groove shapes (complete cleft, incomplete cleft, flat) were found between the two cohorts in our studies. This finding is consistent with a study by da Silva et al contrary to some others. One possible explanation for these discrepancies can be the variations in glansplasty techniques.

### European Association of Urology-European society of paediatric urology guidelines on paediatric urology: summary of 2024 updates. part II [^115W97Lf]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

We present a summary of part II of the 2024 update of the European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society of Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines on paediatric urology. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of a number of urological conditions in the paediatric population. The aim is to provide practical recommendations for clinical management of these conditions with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

Methods

For the guidelines update, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations in the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with the conditions outlines. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and the importance of shared decision-making with patients and their guardians/caregivers. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of undescended testes, testicular tumours in prepubertal boys, acute scrotum, hypospadias, congenital penile curvature, urinary tract infections, daytime lower urinary tract conditions, urachal remnants, and transitional urology.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

Part II of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of a number of paediatric urological conditions, with recommendations designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

### Predictors of surgical complications in boys with hypospadias: data from an internationa registry [^116iXaCv]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias, a congenital defect of the male external genitalia, occurs in 1 in 300 live births. Surgical correction is the only treatment option, with postoperative complication rates reported to range from 8% to 56%. These disparities are largely explained by variability in hypospadias phenotypes. A urethral opening at the distal end of the penis is classed as a mild hypospadias and accounts for 70% of all hypospadias cases, while an opening at the mid or proximal end of the penis is classed as severe hypospadias and accounts for the remaining 30% of cases. Severe forms are often found in combination with a smaller glans, less penile skin, greater curvature, and poor urethral plate quality, which are associated with more challenging surgeries and with poorer postsurgical outcomes. In addition, severe hypospadias may represent differences/disorders of sex development (DSD), a term used to describe a wide range of complex congenital disorders in which genetic, chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical sex is abnormal, resulting in atypical formation of the reproductive system. These boys often present with additional genital defects (cryptorchidism, bifid scrotum and/or micropenis) and non-genital defects.

Postsurgical complications can negatively impact long-term functional, cosmetic, and psychological outcomes. Although various clinical factors, such as phenotype, age at operation, the surgeon's experience, surgical technique and length of follow-up have all been associated with postoperative complications, they do not fully explain complication rates. It has been hypothesized that novel clinical factors may be associated with postsurgical complications and could therefore be used as predictive tools. Previous studies have indicated that boys with a genetically confirmed androgen receptor (AR) mutation or a co-occurring extragenital congenital malformation, are at increased risk of postsurgical complications. However, further investigation is required to confirm these associations. By characterizing this population and identifying novel predictive factors of postsurgical outcomes, alterations in both diagnosis and management can be made to optimize patient care and minimize the chances of complications occurring, thus improving short-term and long-term outcomes. As such, the aim of this study was to assess complication rate in an international cohort and identify if any clinical factors can predict surgical outcomes for boys with hypospadias.

### How curved is too curved? The severity of penile deformity may predict sexual disability among men with Peyronie's disease [^111LpoUe]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2013). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease (PD) is caused by progressive fibrotic scarring of the tunica albuginea resulting in curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. The severity of penile curvature or other deformity may contribute to a man's inability to have intercourse (sexual disability), due to difficulty with penetration, partner pain or emotional stress. To determine whether the degree of curvature or type of penile deformity predicts sexual disability among men with PD. This cross-sectional analysis of consecutive men evaluated for PD at a single tertiary referral center used a PD-specific questionnaire to evaluate risk factors for sexual disability in men with PD, who did not have erectile dysfunction (ED). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the clinical predictors of sexual disability. Sexual disability as defined by the inability to have penetrative intercourse. A total of 202 men were evaluated and 88 men with ED were excluded. Sexual disability was associated with relationship problems, penile curvature and penile length loss in bivariate, but not multivariate analysis. We found that although many of the demographic, medical and sexual function domains were significant predictors of inability to have sex, the only significant predictor of sexual disability in multivariate analysis was curvature > 60° (odds ratio 3.23 95%CI 1.08–9.67). PD can be sexually disabling in many men without ED. Severe penile curvature is a robust independent predictor of the ability to have intercourse. Other penile deformities fail to predict sexual disability. This is important for counseling patients with newly diagnosed PD and those who are considering medical or surgical intervention.

### Hypospadias in toddlers: a multivariable study of prognostic factors in distal to mid-shaft hypospadias and review of literature [^114x7Uw8]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As a common congenital anomaly, hypospadias typically requires surgical repair during the early years of life. Hypospadias is a consequence of defective closure of the urethral fold and can be accompanied by chordee. Despite the fact that numerous procedures have been described, today the most common repair method for distal hypospadias is the tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU).

Fistula, meatal and urethral stenosis, and dehiscence are among the most common complications following the primary repair of hypospadias. A central question in this field is to determine what preoperative or intraoperative factors are able to predict future complications. Identifying these parameters would allow the surgeon to assess the risks before surgery and can potentially lead to the development of new techniques to circumvent the adverse outcomes.

In the current literature, the prognostic factors useful in the management of hypospadias remain poorly defined, and a wide discrepancy exists regarding prognostic factors related to the urethral plate (UP) and other anatomical features. In the present study, we assess several possible prognostic factors for complications in a rigorous, homogenous series of toddlers with distal to mid-penile hypospadias cases, aged 1–3 years, and undergoing the first-time TIPU. Thereafter, we will briefly review the studies on the prognostic factors of this subgroup regarding the pertaining study methodologies.

### A retrospective review of 307 men with Peyronie's disease [^113cJeB4]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We discuss the clinical appearance and natural outcome of Peyronie's disease.

Materials and Methods

During an 8-year period 307 men with Peyronie's disease were evaluated, and clinical characteristics, risk (factors), penile deformities, erectile status and outcome were analyzed.

Results

Mean patient age plus or minus standard deviation was 52.8 ± 9.3 years (range 23 to 76). Penile deformity, pain on erection and palpable nodule were the most common (85%) presenting symptoms, usually in different combinations. The remaining 15% of men (mean age 59.4 ± 6.5 years) were not aware of the penile deformity and were diagnosed during standard evaluation for erectile dysfunction. Dorsal (45.6%) and lateral (29.3%) were the most common curvatures. The degree of deformity was less than 30 degrees in 42.7% of patients, 31 to 60 degrees in 38.8% and greater than 60 degrees in 18.6%. At least 1 risk factor for systemic vascular disease was identified in 67.5% of patients, and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes were the most common. Patients with at least 1 risk factor had a significantly higher risk for severe penile deformity. Of the men 54.4% complained of erectile dysfunction and the probability of diminished erectile capacity was 86.7% in patients older than 60 years, with Peyronie's disease for more than 12 months and at least 1 risk factor. Of 63 patients presenting with the acute phase of disease penile deformity deteriorated in 30.2%, did not change in 66.7% and resolved spontaneously in 3.2% without any treatment after a mean followup of 8.4 months.

Conclusions

Our data show that penile deformities are disabling (greater than 30 degrees) in 62.5% of cases. Risk factors, such as serum lipid abnormalities, diabetes and hypertension, seem to have significant impact on the severity of symptoms and outcome. Patients must be informed that Peyronie's disease is progressive in 30.2% without treatment and spontaneous resolution is rare.

### Hypospadias in toddlers: a multivariable study of prognostic factors in distal to mid-shaft hypospadias and review of literature [^1119af25]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This Institutional Review Board-approved study was performed prospectively on a cohort of children undergoing primary hypospadias repair using TIPU in a referral hospital within 12 months of the study. From a total of 420 consecutive patients of all ages with hypospadias, 101 cases were finally enrolled in the observational study according to the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included the first-time TIPU cases of distal to mid-shaft hypospadias with an age between 1 and 3 years. The meatal location was determined visually, meaning that the orifice located in the proximal one-third of the penis was considered as proximal hypospadias. Based on Hadidi's classification, we did not include glanular or coronal hypospadias in the study.

The exclusion criteria were the coexistence of moderate to severe chordee, micropenis, or a history of hypospadias surgery or circumcision. Micropenis was defined as a dorsal length of a stretched penis less than 1.9 cm in length for a term infant or if the length was less than 2.5 SD below the mean. Chordee or ventral curvature (VC) was recorded visually with parents' cell camera photos while erection or micturition at the first or second visit and most reliably and quantitively after performing the erection test before making skin incisions. Chordee was defined as a penile shaft curvature and is categorized based on its degree measured by a goniometer: mild (< 30), moderate (30–45), and severe (> 45) curvature.

The variables were measured and the operations were performed by a single surgeon to remove potential interobserver variations in the measurements and observations and surgical outcomes. The largest point of UP was recorded as the width.

The evaluation was performed in terms of characteristics of the UP dimensions in erect and flaccid states, penile stretched length, glans characteristics, and chordee (figure 1). Subsequent acute events and postoperative complications during the follow-up period were carefully monitored and were recorded by collecting the data with the help of a survey based on Hadidi's classification form. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology cohort reporting guidelines were used to report the study results.

### Long-term outcomes and risk factors for erectile dysfunction and penile curvature after surgical penile fracture repair [^114SP2Wh]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-term outcomes of penile fracture (PF) include erectile dysfunction (ED) and penile curvature. In this study, we aimed to present the functional and anatomical results of 182 patients who underwent PF repair surgery and to reveal the risk factors for ED and penile curvature in a relatively long follow-up period. Thirty (16.5%) patients suffered from ED and 18 (9.9%) patients had penile curvature, respectively in a median follow-up period of 66 (39–111) months. Presence of bilateral fractures (OR = 7.806; 95% CI = 2.083–29.261; p = 0.002), larger tunical defect size (OR = 1.099; 95% CI = 1.036–1.164; p = 0.002) and longer time between fracture and surgery (OR = 1.095; 95% CI = 1.036–1.157; p = 0.001) were stated as the independent risk factors for ED. Only larger tunical defect size was found as an independent risk factor for penile curvature (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.063–1.221; p < 0.001). The cut-off values for predicting ED were 18.5mm for tunical defect size, 14.5h for time between fracture and surgery, and 41 years for age. The cut-off value for tunical defect size was 18.5mm for penile curvature. Risk of ED increases among patients with extended tunical rupture and delayed surgical repair. Penile curvature manifests less frequently and seems to be associated with the size of the tunical defect.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^112aDkwQ]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease (PD) treatment considerations — baseline curvature and patient-centered factors are outlined as follows: PD may compromise sexual function and quality of life (QoL) but does not appear to affect survival; there is no agreed-upon minimum curvature necessary prior to intervention; in published studies that reported average baseline curvature, the range is 10 to 90 degrees and the median is approximately 48 degrees; approximately half of studies evaluated patients with mean curvature < 48 degrees and many with mean curvature < 30 degrees; distress over symptoms, penile appearance, and penile function is important, and the patient's level of concern and willingness to undergo treatment should be fully considered alongside objective measures in decision-making.

### Risk factors for postoperative complications following one-stage proximal hypospadias repair involving the disconnection of the urethral plate: a retrospective study [^1179UMQ5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with hypospadias are at risk of serious physical and mental health problems, including abnormal urination, sexual dysfunction, and infertility. The sole available treatment is the surgical restoration of genital appearance and function. Proximal hypospadias (PH) correction is more challenging and carries a higher risk of complications than does distal hypospadias correction, with a higher likelihood of postoperative complications requiring additional surgery, resulting in considerable economic and psychological strain for families. Herein, we aimed to identify factors associated with complications following one-stage PH repair with urethral plate disconnection.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data from 236 children who underwent PH repair at our center between December 2020 and December 2022. We collected information on age, surgical procedure, length of the reconstructed urethra (LRU), glans width (GW), ventral curvature, surgical approach, preoperative androgen use, suture type, presence of prostatic utricle, body mass index, season of surgery, anesthesia type, low birth weight, preterm birth, follow-up period, and complications. Surgical complications included urethral fistulas, urethral diverticula, anastomotic strictures, urethral strictures, glans dehiscence, and penile curvature recurrences. The study population was divided into complication and no-complication groups, and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted.

Results

Of the 236 patients with PH who had a median follow-up of 10.0 (8.0, 14.0) months, 79 were included (33.5%) in the complication group and 157 were included (66.5%) in the no-complication group. In the univariate analysis, age (P < 0.001), LRU (P < 0.001), degree of penile curvature (P = 0.049), and PH with prostatic utricle (P = 0.014) were significantly associated with complications after PH repair. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, LRU (P < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 3.396, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.229–5.174) and GW (P = 0.004, OR = 0.755, 95%CI: 0.625–0.912) were independent factors influencing postoperative complications. The optimal LRU threshold was 4.45 cm (area under the curve, 0.833; sensitivity, 0.873; specificity, 0.873; P < 0.001, OR = 3.396, 95% CI: 2.229–5.174).

Conclusions

LRU and GW are independent factors affecting PH complications. An LRU of < 4.45 cm and an increased GW can reduce the risk of complications.

### A systematic review of non-surgical management in Peyronie's disease [^1173xoAm]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was performed following guidelines defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was prospectively registered, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017064618. Utilising the PICO (population, intervention, control, and outcome) framework, the target population for this review was patients with acute and stable PD, the main interventions looked at were any non-surgical treatments, these were compared to control groups who had not received the relevant non-surgical treatment option and outcomes looked at included improvement in penile curvature, plaque size, pain, sexual function, and penile length. Only randomised controlled trials with more than 10 participants per cohort of intervention were included.

Study eligibility criteria

All English randomised controlled trials analysing any non-surgical treatment option for PD in the acute and chronic phase were included. Conference abstracts were included if sufficient information was available in the abstract to conduct a thorough risk of bias evaluation of the article. The exclusion criteria consisted of review articles, all observational studies, non-randomised interventional studies and studies including less than 10 participants per cohort of intervention. Additionally, studies describing treatment options in congenital penile curvature, children under the age of 18 and animal studies were also excluded.

Information sources and search

A systematic literature search utilising the Medline (Pubmed), Embase, global health and Cochrane library databases was conducted up to 26th May 2021 via a broad search strategy with no start date exclusion criteria. A broad search was conducted combining key words and MeSH terms for PD, management options and outcomes of interest (Supplementary Information: Appendix A). Subsequently, once individual treatment modalities were identified each was combined with the search strategy keywords, ensuring a comprehensive search of each. A reference review of articles and reviews was also subsequently conducted and grey literature was evaluated through conference abstracts searched via Embase.

Study selection

Two reviewers (SH and OB) independently identified potentially relevant articles that arose from the search strategy once duplicates were removed, this process was managed using the online Covidence platform. The full text of each potentially relevant article was subsequently obtained and reviewed against the inclusion criteria.

### Hypospadias: clinical approach, surgical technique and long-term outcome [^112jrZGA]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias is one of the commonest congenital malformations affecting the penis, with a reported incidence of 1/250 newborns, and yet unknown etiology. Three typical anatomical features define hypospadias: ectopic location of the urethral meatus, irregular distribution of the foreskin and abnormal ventral curvature of the penis. It appears that a universal approach to hypospadias surgical repair is missing, with more than 300 corrective procedures described in the current literature. The reoperation rate, within 6–12 months since the initial surgery, is most frequently used as an outcome measure. The complication rate, generally estimated within the short term, has been reported as 5–10% for mild forms and 15–56% for severe forms of hypospadias. These short-term outcome measures are inadequate and may not reflect the experience of boys in puberty and beyond. A reliable final outcome of the repair could not be predicted within a 12-month follow-up of surgery, as psychosexual development is not complete and pubertal physical changes may affect the final cosmetic appearance and function of the corrected penis. Unfortunately, longitudinal studies following hypospadias repair are still rare and the real impact in adolescence and adult life remains uncertain. This may be due to lack of condition specific validated patient-related outcome (PRO) measures and objective tools to evaluate young people and families. Reported outcomes in literature to date have been contradictory with comparison between reports complicated by the lack of consensus on the optimal surgical approach and follow-up.

The aim of our study was to identify the long-term cosmetic, functional and psychosexual outcomes in boys who have previously undergone surgical repair for hypospadias from a single center.

### Risk factors for postoperative complications following one-stage proximal hypospadias repair involving the disconnection of the urethral plate: a retrospective study [^114jMvqb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypospadias is a common malformation among male children, with an incidence of approximately 9.03 per 10,000 in China. It can be classified as distal, and proximal hypospadias (PH). In PH, the urethral orifice is located at the penile-scrotal junction, scrotum, or perineum, and PH accounts for approximately 20% of all hypospadias. Children with hypospadias and their families are at risk of serious physical and mental health problems. The only available treatment for hypospadias is surgical restoration of genital appearance and function. The treatment objective is to restore normal urination, help patients achieve a healthy sexual life and fertility, and eliminate patients' psychological burden. Compared to distal hypospadias correction, PH correction is more challenging and is associated with a higher risk of complications, including postoperative complications such as urethral fistulas, anastomotic strictures, urethral strictures, urethral diverticula, glans dehiscence, and recurrence of penile curvature. Such postoperative complications may necessitate additional surgery, resulting in considerable economic and psychological strain for the patients' families and society at large.

The existing surgical approaches for PH are controversial, with the most important debates being over preserving versus disconnecting the urethral plate and one- versus two-stage surgery. For PH treatment, Arshadi et al. used the tubularized incised plate technique; in their study, all participants had mild penile curvatures. However, if the penile curvature exceeds 30° after foreskin removal, urethral plate retention is not appropriate. Most PH cases in China are associated with higher-grade penile curvature. In the study by Snodgrass et al. the complication rate for PH repair was 37%, and the recurrence rate of penile curvature was 26%. Braga et al. compared two groups who underwent dorsal plication or urethral plate disconnection for PH correction. Penile curvature recurrence rates after surgery were 27.9% and 7.4%, respectively, with a high recurrence rate after urethral plate preservation. As PH is typically associated with penile curvature, urethral plate disconnection is necessary in PH treatment. In terms of surgical stages, two-stage surgery requires higher surgical costs, anesthesia use, and number of operations, and the second surgery may increase the psychological burden on the child. Upon gaining experience and surgical skills, surgeons are able to perform one-stage hypospadias repair more effectively, and our center recommends a one-stage repair for PH.

### Do adult men with untreated ventral penile curvature have adverse outcomes? [^113gre11]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Congenital ventral penile curvature without hypospadias is often treated surgically in childhood. The history of untreated ventral curvature is unknown.

Objective

This study's aim was to examine the association of untreated ventral penile curvature with various sexual and psychosexual outcomes.

Study Design

An electronic survey was advertised to men older than 18 years on Facebook. Men with possible ventral penile curvature identified themselves by choosing sketches that most closely represented their anatomy. Outcomes assessed included: Sexual Health Inventory for Men, difficulty of intercourse because of curvature, International Prostate Symptom Score, Penile Perception Score, psychosexual milestones, paternity, infertility, sitting to urinate, and the CDC HRQOL-4 module.

Results

Among participants, 81 out of 684 men (11.8%) reported untreated ventral penile curvature. Participants with self-reported curvature noted more difficulty with intercourse because of curvature (4.5 vs 4.9, p < 0.001), more unhealthy mental days (8.6 vs 6.2, p = 0.02), and increased dissatisfaction with penile self-perception compared with men without reported curvature (8.6 vs 9.5, p < 0.001).

Discussion

Men with possible untreated ventral curvature reported worse penile perception scores, more mentally unhealthy days, and increased difficulty with intercourse secondary to curvature compared with men without curvature. A limitation to this study is selection bias; responses collected were self-reported from survey volunteers. Additionally, the question identifying ventral penile curvature is not validated but performed well in pretesting. Most questions were from validated surveys, but some were modeled after validated surveys and/or contained high face validity types of questions.

Conclusion

Men with possible untreated ventral penile curvature reported more dissatisfaction with penile appearance, increased difficulty with intercourse, and more unhealthy mental days. Given high success rates, low complications, and improved outcomes after surgical correction of penile curvature reported in the literature, our results support correction of congenital penile curvature in childhood.

### Evaluation of the treatment of congenital penile curvature including psychosexual assessment [^116Fh9pD]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile corporoplasty is a well-established treatment method of congenital penile deviation (CPD). Anatomical results are good with only slight differences between surgical procedures used. The disease however has huge influence on young male quality of life. This issue is not well analyzed in the literature.

Aim

The aim of the study was to evaluate quality of life of the patients affected with CPD before and after the surgical treatment

Methods

Study population consisted of 107 patients with CPD referred for surgical management. Patients were evaluated with not only clinical assessment, but also by four questionnaires measuring various aspects of quality of life. They were: Short-Form Medical Outcomes, Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire for Man, Beck Depression Inventory, and International Index of Erectile Function.

Results

Quality of life measurements showed deep decrease in the general quality of life, sexual performance, depression scale, as well as in physical and mental health in men with CPD. All these parameters were restored to normal after the successful surgical treatment with any method.

Conclusion

CPD deeply decreases the quality of life of the affected men in many aspects. Surgical treatment is able to repair the anatomical deformity and as well as significantly restore the patients' psychosocial well-being.

### Peyronie's disease [^1179t4AL]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease remains one of the most perplexing diseases in urology. With continued basic research in wound healing and scarring, the understanding and management of this frustrating disease will improve. Initial treatment of Peyronie's disease should be conservative, with expectant therapy and medical management. Once the penile curvature and plaque have stabilized, patients with severe deformity can be offered surgery depending on their symptoms and complaints. Patient selection is the key to proper treatment. Less experienced surgeons should limit themselves to medical management or simple surgical management of the disease, including plication or Nesbit procedures. Penile-lengthening procedures or the placement of complicated penile prosthesis should be reserved for surgeons with familiarity and expertise in this type of reconstruction. Education on the pathogenesis and natural history of the disease will allow the patient and his partner to make an informed decision in regards to treatment options and expected outcomes.

### Comparative study of modified koyanagi and staged duckett for proximal hypospadias [^112uGTgj]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital malformations of the male urinary system, with an incidence of about 1/250–1/300. The main clinical manifestations of hypospadias are ectopic ventral urethral opening, ventral curvature (VC), and ventral prepuce absent. Proximal hypospadias refers to the bifurcation point of the cavernous urethra or the starting point of the reconstructed urethra at or below the junction of the penile scrotum after degloving the penile. Up to now, there are more than 300 methods of surgery for hypospadias and an overall surgical success rate of about 50–80%. Proximal type of hypospadias is a risk factor affecting the success rate of surgery.

In the 1980s, a series of surgical reports by Duckett set a milestone for the one-stage repair of the proximal hypospadias. However, with the widespread development of one-stage surgery and the emergence of long-term follow-up results, the early and long-term adverse prognosis and influence of one-stage repair on children and their families have led clinicians to re-examine the limitations of one-stage repair and the feasibility of staged repair. This study analyzed the efficacy of modified Koyanagi and staged Ducket for proximal hypospadias, and further explored the advantages and disadvantages of one-stage and staged surgery of proximal hypospadias.

### Surgical correction of adult congenital penile curvature: a systematic review [^116ypjEK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital penile curvature (CPC) is corrected surgically by various corporoplasty or tunica albuginea plication techniques, but the optimal surgical approach is not well-defined.

Aim

To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the published literature pertaining to outcomes with penile plication and corporoplasty techniques for surgical management of CPC. To determine if plication or corporoplasty offers superior outcomes in surgical correction of CPC.

Methods

A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Checklist. The following databases were queried from inception to March 18, 2020 to search for studies describing surgical treatment of CPC: Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus.

Outcomes

Objective and subjective postoperative outcomes including penile straightening, shortening, penile sensory changes, and reoperation rates for both corporoplasty and tunica albuginea plication were summarized.

Results

Fifty-five articles comprising 2,956 patients with CPC who underwent a plication procedure (n = 1,375) or corporoplasty (n = 1,580) were included. The definition of "treatment success" varied widely and most often involved subjective patient reporting (22 studies; 40%) or objective assessment (15 studies; 27%). We considered curvature correction to be satisfactory if there was self-reported patient satisfaction or residual curvature after correction of < 20˚. Reported rates of successful straightening ranged from 75 to 100% and 73 to 100% for plication and corporoplasty, respectively. A comprehensive and accurate assessment of surgical outcomes for CPC correction, such as satisfactory penile straightening, reoperation rates, glans sensory changes, and other complications was limited by significant inter-study heterogeneity with respect to the reporting of treatment outcomes.

Clinical Implications

While both plication and corporoplasty appear to be safe and effective options in the treatment of CPC, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn with respect to treatment superiority due to low-quality study design, methodology flaws, and significant heterogeneity in reporting.

Strength & Limitations

This report represents the most comprehensive review of CPC surgical management. However, there is a significant lack of standardization in the reporting of treatment outcomes for CPC, thereby limiting the reliability of the published data summarization encompassed by our review.

Conclusion

Both plication and corporoplasty demonstrate high success rates and relatively low complication rates in the treatment of CPC, albeit with low-level evidence available in most research publications. Robust comparison of the surgical techniques used to correct CPC is limited by significant variation in reporting methods used in the literature. C. J. Britton, F. A. Jefferson, B. L. Findlay, et al.

### Risk factors for postoperative urethral diverticulum following hypospadias repair with disconnection of the urethral plate [^115ogDkq]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias is the most common congenital malformation of the pediatric reproductive system. Between 1980 and 2010, there was a continuous global increase in the incidence of hypospadias. Surgical intervention remains the sole effective treatment for this condition. However, postoperative complication rates range from 8 to 56%. These complications include urethral fistula, urethral stricture, urethral diverticulum (UD), residual curvature, distal rupture, inadequate exposure during surgery, and scrotal transposition. Numerous studies have explored risk factors associated with postoperative complications following hypospadias repair surgery, mainly focusing on surgical age, hypospadias type, anesthesia technique employed, urethral length reconstruction, and postoperative constipation. Nevertheless, studies focusing on the risk factors and management strategies that influence the occurrence of UD are still relatively scarce. Urethral diverticula can cause stone formation, incomplete voiding, infection, postvoid dribbling, hematuria and other complications. The factors that increase the risk of diverticulum include proximal defects, the use of inadequately supported tissue for transplant insertion, and distal stenosis that leads to relative obstruction or elevated outlet pressure.

Herein, we conducted a review over the past three years regarding complications associated with hypospadias repair by identifying patients who developed diverticula while analyzing related factors as well as examining management approaches and outcomes.

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111uhApb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Penile cancer additional risk modifiers and prognostic factors note that, due to rarity, the number of neonatal circumcisions required to prevent one case is relatively high, and a small study suggests circumcision may reduce invasive penile cancer but not carcinoma in situ (CIS, also called TIS, or penile intraepithelial neoplasia [PeIN]). Tobacco exposure increases risk, with people who smoke cigarettes 3 to 4.5 times more likely to develop penile cancer, and lichen sclerosus confers a 2% to 9% risk of developing penile carcinoma. Among psoriasis patients treated with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), penile cancer incidence is reported as 286 times the general population; they should be shielded during treatment and any penile lesion should be closely monitored. In advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) receiving systemic therapy, visceral metastases and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score ≥ 1 were identified as poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).

### Penile cancer: clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112XZY38]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Medium credibility.

Penile cancer risk factors and HPV/HIV associations indicate that in the United States the median age at diagnosis is 68 years with increased risk in individuals > 50 years, and phimosis is associated with markedly higher risk (25% to 60%). An anatomic review of penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) localized 34.5% of primary lesions to the glans, 13.2% to the prepuce, and 5.3% to the shaft, with 4.5% overlapping and 42.5% unspecified. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in approximately 45% to 80% of cases with strong correlation to types 16, 6, and 18, while HPV- or p16-positivity have been reported as favorable prognostic factors for disease-specific survival (DSS). Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk of HPV infection and associated disease; in females with HIV one study reported higher HPV acquisition (relative risk, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.04–3.42) and lower HPV clearance (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.84) versus HIV-negative females, and oral HPV is common in males with HIV (17.6%; 95% CI, 13.5–22.8%). Neonatal circumcision is associated with a lower rate of penile cancer, although the protective effect is not seen in adults who have the foreskin removed.

### The efficacy of congenital penile curvature repair in preadolescent males: early outcomes [^1111FXZK]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the spectrum of congenital penile curvature without hypospadias evaluated at our institution, and to assess the efficacy of surgical repair in prepubescent boys.

Methods

The study group included 82 boys with a diagnosis of congenital penile curvature without hypospadias who elected for surgical repair from 2008 to 2010. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and operative characteristics and recorded surgical outcomes during the length of patients' follow-up at our institution.

Results

Of the patients electing surgery, 32 of 82 (39%) underwent penile degloving alone for class I (skin) chordee. Ten of 82 patients (12.2%) required further excision of class II (dysgenic fascial) chordee, and 40 of 82 (48.8%) patients required some combination of techniques to correct varying degrees of class III (dysgenic fascial) chordee. A total of 22.2% of patients returning for follow-up with corporal disproportion had persistent penile curvature compared with 14.3% of boys with fascial chordee and 11.5% of boys with skin chordee. Those children treated with tunical plications and incisions alone fared worse than those children treated with some combination of the Nesbit or modified Nesbit procedure.

Conclusion

Our study shows not only that the proportion of patients with a hyposplastic urethra may be smaller than previously reported but also that corporal disproportion may be more prevalent. Attention should be paid to this later group as plication without the use of Nesbit techniques may not be enough to ensure an appropriate repair.

Regarding surgical interventions for hypospadias, more specifically with respect to surgical repair (penile curvature correction and urethroplasty), EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend to correct the penile curvature and form a neo-urethra of adequate size with an opening on the glans with proper skin coverage of the penile shaft to achieve an overall acceptable functional and cosmetic outcome.

### Risk factors for postoperative urethral diverticulum following hypospadias repair with disconnection of the urethral plate [^117WcYuA]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Tang et al. suggested that surgical intervention is not necessary for stable mild UD. However, significant UD that adversely affects quality of life or leads to reduced expected ejaculation should be considered for surgical treatment. During surgery, it is essential to account for distal obstruction and the presence of urethral fistulae. Wang et al. recommended that in patients with UD complicated by distal urethral stricture, longitudinal resection of the external urethral orifice may be performed concurrently to minimize postoperative residual UD. Ru et al. noted that severe penile curvature, urethral stricture, and dehiscence are critical factors demanding reoperation after hypospadias repair. For patients with UD who do not exhibit significant dysuria or symptoms indicative of urinary tract infection and have low family willingness for reoperation, we continue with conservative observation and follow-up treatment. Conservative management remains appropriate when there is minimal change in UD status. In situations where secondary UD emerges due to thinning urine streams and distal urethral strictures, active options encompassing urethral dilation or reoperation are advocated. Notably, because of the poor cooperation among most young patients, only one patient has undergone multiple urethral dilations. The patient received treatment once a week three times, and the UD vanished completely. After the disappearance of UD, the patient continued to undergo three dilation surgeries. There was no recurrence during the long-term follow-up period. Among all patients with UD treated through dilation methods, none subsequently required indwelling urinary catheters. This can be attributed to both the poor compliance of patients and their families as well as concerns regarding potential recurrence following urethral catheter removal after one month of catheterization. Surgical intervention is advocated for those presenting with large UDs accompanied by dysuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, or the presence of urethral stones. In this study, six patients achieved complete resolution following surgical intervention for UD, whereas two others demonstrated significant improvement. Only one patient experienced complications related to a postoperative urethral fistula and infection, which subsequently necessitated further surgical management. These findings suggest that surgical treatment for UD yields favorable outcomes.

However, multifactorial analysis in this study found that the elasticity (P = 0.195) and flatness of the skin island flap (P = 0.187), and ventral curvature(P = 0.594), were not independent risk factors for complications after Duckett operation, while the length of the prepuce island flap (OR = 3.506, 95% CI: 2.258–5.442) was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications after Duckett operation (P < 0.001). That is, the risk of postoperative complications increases 3.506× for each 1 cm increase in the length of the skin island flap. In conclusion, the length of skin island flap is considered to be a risk factor for postoperative complications after Duckett operation.

This multi-center clinical study has the advantage of analyzing a large number of cases. A total of 1011 cases of hypospadias with complete clinical and follow-up data were included in this study. However, the following problems still exist: due to regional environmental differences and unbalanced economic development in China, medical resources are not evenly distributed. This multi-center study only contains clinical data from provincial children's hospitals, which do not cover all children with hypospadias. It is difficult to control the quality of data from various units in a multi-center study, thus, it is necessary to further unify the measurement standards of various penis parameters and establish a standardized quality control system to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data.

Research needs and future directions — knowledge gaps and priorities: Given its prevalence and its significant psychosocial impact, better understanding of the pathophysiology of Peyronie's disease is greatly needed; the absence of knowledge regarding what causes PD means it is not possible to advise men regarding risk factors and how the disease may be prevented and treatments remain focused on symptom alleviation rather than causal mechanisms; research endeavors in this field should continue to address multiple disciplinary areas including epidemiology, risk associations, pathophysiology, psychosocial assessment, diagnostics, clinical pharmacology and therapeutics, and health-related outcomes, and basic scientific investigation effort should be geared toward elucidating the biologic mechanisms of PD including inflammatory factors, cytokines, growth factors and other molecular factors involved in tissue injury, fibrosis and abnormal wound healing, with ongoing scientific investigation expected to suggest molecular sites that can be targeted therapeutically.

Regarding surgical interventions for hypospadias, more specifically with respect to surgical repair (penile curvature correction and urethroplasty), EAU/ESPU 2025 guidelines recommend to perform ventral penile lengthening - ventral transverse incision of the tunica albuginea extending from the 3 to 9 o'clock position patched with tunica vaginalis flap or graft, or in several short ventral corporotomies without grafting - to prevent shortening of the penis in patients with more severe penile curvature (> 45 degrees) which is often combined with a short urethral plate requiring transection. Recognize that ventral corporeal grafting in patients with severe penile curvature provides good long-term results and safety profiles for erectile function.

### Strategies and current practices for penile lengthening in severe Peyronie's disease cases: a systematic review [^116zSXbw]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Several strategies to optimize penile length in the presence of Peyronie's Disease (PD) have been described so far. In case of severe curvature and preserved erectile function, plaque incision/excision (PIG/PEG) are advisable in order to maximize penile length, despite the risk of postoperative erectile dysfunction (ED), recurrent curvature, or penile shortening. For men with PD deformities associated to a certain degree of ED several lengthening techniques associated to penile prosthesis (PPI) implantation can be considered. Because of the potential postoperative complications, the indication must be balanced between patient's risk factors and surgeon's experience. Furthermore, adjuvant surgeries, such as prepubic V-Y plasty, suspensory ligament release, suprapubic lipectomy, and ventral phalloplasty, can be performed simultaneously or in a staged fashion to maximize the outcomes. Restoration a decent penile length in the case of a severe PD represents a real challenge for reconstructive surgeons. We present a systematic review of the literature on the current practices for penile lengthening in severe PD, providing the reader with a practical overview on the existing surgical strategies and their surgical and functional outcomes.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^111oAZ6A]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Penile fracture — management recommendations and operative considerations are as follows: Perform surgical exploration within 7 days of injury for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of penile fracture or positive imaging findings. Earlier intervention, near the time of presentation, may improve long-term patient outcomes, including reduced pain, faster convalescence, and lower risk of penile curvature. For patients presenting with penile fracture to a lower-level trauma center, consider early transfer to a trauma center with urology expertise once the patient is stabilized. Surgical repair is performed through a circumcising or ventral midline penile incision, based on the suspected location of injury. The penile skin is then mobilized to allow for exposure of the bilateral corpora cavernosa and the suspected tunica albuginea disruption. An artificial erection (injection of saline with or without dye directly into the corporal body) may facilitate identification of the corporal injury.

3.2 Clinical features

In girls with LS, 94.6% present with anogenital lesions. The remaining 5.4% either have extragenital lesions only or have genital and extragenital involvement. The most common symptoms in girls are pruritus, pain, dysuria, and a burning sensation in the anogenital area. In 58–89% of the cases, constipation and gastrointestinal complaints are reported. Clinical signs are hypopigmentation, erythema, fissures, hyperpigmentation, atrophy, ecchymosis, and/or keratotic papules. Often a "figure‐of‐8" pattern is reported affecting the labia minora, clitoris, and perianal region. Erosions and can be present, often due to scratching. Vascular lesions such as angiokeratomas and telangiectasias are occasionally described and are usually asymptomatic. In a later stage, anatomic changes can be seen, such as labial fusion. Genital LS may be mistaken for sexual abuse. However, LS and sexual abuse are not mutually exclusive and, if suspected, abuse should be investigated.

The referral diagnoses for boys with LS are mostly clinical features such as phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%), or buried penis (10%), regardless of whether or not the LS has been recognized. The incidence of LS in non‐circumcised boys with phimosis ranges from 2 to 95%, the largest cohort studies reporting 10–50%. Boys with an acquired phimosis may have a greater risk of having LS than boys with congenital phimosis. Frequent symptoms subsequent to phimosis include urine retention, ballooning of the foreskin, dysuria, other urinary tract symptoms, and erectile pain. Hypopigmentation of the distal portion of the prepuce, seen as a white (sclerotic) ring, mostly results in progressive phimosis. Furthermore, erythema, pigmentary changes, telangiectasia, purpura, and scarring may be present. We found no mention of scrotal skin being affected. The perianal region of boys is rarely affected. Therefore, secondary constipation is uncommon. Extragenital LS is present in 0.4–6% of boys with LS.

### Dry gangrene of the foreskin after second attempt at prepuce-sparing surgery for congenital penile curvature: case report and literature review [^116pTvZe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dry gangrene of the foreskin following corrective surgery for congenital penile curvature (CPC) or Peyronie's disease is extremely rare. It is noted as a consequence of intraoperative penile degloving.

Aim

We report one such case with its natural history presented by serial clinical pictures, discuss the management dilemmas, and review a rather scant relevant literature.

Methods

A 32-year-old man with CPC underwent prepuce-sparing corrective surgery for penile curvature on two occasions resulting in dry gangrene of the foreskin following the second attempt.

Results

It was managed conservatively with a satisfactory result.

Conclusion

Gangrene of the foreskin is most likely to occur as a complication after a second attempt at prepuce-sparing surgery. It can be managed nonsurgically with a satisfactory outcome.

Univariate and multivariate analysis of postoperative complications of TIP operation

In TIP group, 336 patients were 7–180 months old at the time of operation, with a median age of 29 months and an average age of 42 months. Penile length 2.0–10.0 cm, mean 4.1 cm; glans length 5–22 mm, mean 12.1 mm; glans width 7–25 mm, mean 14.5 mm; length of urethral defect 0.4–4.5 cm, average 1.8 cm. There were 124 cases of mild ventral curvature (< 15°), 191 cases of moderate ventral curvature (15–35°), and 21 cases of severe ventral curvature (> 35°). The flatness of UP was smooth in 268 cases, moderate in 59 cases, and uneven in 9 cases. The UP had good elasticity in 266 cases, moderate elasticity in 60 cases, and poor elasticity in 10 cases. The width of UP was 3–12 mm, average 5 mm, and the width of the UP after longitudinal incision was 6–18 mm, average 11 mm. There were 84 complications (25%, 84/336), as shown in Table 1.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^114MMjvC]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — clinical research methodology and outcome measurement should address natural history, control groups, placebo effects, sample size/replication, and validated metrics. Studies should recognize that 'PD is characterized by symptoms that change over time and that some symptoms will resolve in the absence of treatment', and that 'In the absence of a control for the natural history of PD, findings from observational studies are of limited value'. For pain, placebo control is crucial because 'some PD symptoms – such as pain — are highly susceptible to placebo effects' and 'It is not possible to know with certainty whether a new therapy reliably decreases pain in the absence of a placebo control group'. Given variability, 'findings from studies that have small sample sizes – even well-designed studies – potentially lack generalizability because of the inherent instability of findings derived from small numbers of patients', and 'Replication of findings is critical before new therapies can be offered with confidence'. For measurement, 'PD studies must use validated measures of objective and subjective outcomes', and 'Objectively measured outcomes, such as degree of curvature or plaque characteristics or penile dimensions or ED, are critically important to establish that a therapy is effective in reducing these manifestations of PD'. Symptom quantification is supported, as 'Pain can be measured validly using visual analog scales'. At the time of guideline development, 'measures of patient symptomatology and distress (i.e., the PDQ) were not fully validated for use in clinical settings', therefore 'the Panel emphasizes the need to query patients regarding distress as part of baseline evaluation and follow-up'. Because patient estimates can be inaccurate, 'patient perceptions of changes in deformity and penile dimensions are not reliable indicators of objective changes', and 'documentation of objective outcomes is critical to provide patients with information regarding actual changes in curvature and penile dimensions'. Finally, 'the assessment of benefit for a proposed therapy should be based on establishing clinically meaningful change measures, whether they are objectively or subjectively measured'.

### Effectiveness of penile ventral curvature correction and the trend of hypospadias repair: a prospective study of the national center in China [^114KZpdu]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital urethral abnormalities in 1 of 250–300 live births, and the incidence is rising. Hypospadias repair encompasses various surgical procedures, including ventral curvature (VC) correction, urethral reconstruction, glans reconstruction and penile skin reconstruction. 2 Achieving adequate VC correction is a crucial step in ensuring successful hypospadias repair. The selection of strategies for VC correction depends on factors such as the underlying cause of the curvature, surgeon preferences and the desired treatment goals. In previous decades, surgical procedures followed a stepwise sequence, typically involving initial dissection of the skin and subcutaneous dartos (commonly referred to as degloving), followed by urethral plate mobilisation or transection, and finally addressing any issues related to corporal disproportion. However, the latest modified stepwise approach, as suggested by Castagnetti and El-Ghoneimi, has eliminated urethral plate mobilisation due to an increased risk of curvature recurrence. Despite the importance of VC correction, limited reporting exists on the effectiveness of different strategies employed for this purpose. The strategies used for VC correction also influence the subsequent choice of techniques for urethroplasty, particularly when urethral plate transection (UPT) is performed, as it necessitates substitution urethroplasty. Despite the numerous surgical techniques and their modifications available for hypospadias repair, no technique has been universally accepted as the gold standard due to a lack of conclusive evidence demonstrating the superiority of one technique over another.

In this prospective study, we collected clinical data from patients and assessed the effectiveness of various strategies for VC correction. Our analysis aimed to reflect the underlying causes of VC in the Chinese population and examine the selection of surgical techniques for different types of hypospadias repair at the National Center for Children's Health in China. We hypothesised that there would be variations in the effectiveness of VC correction depending on the strategy employed, and that the specific type of hypospadias would influence the choice of surgical techniques. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide evidence-based insights that can inform the future management of hypospadias.

### A multicenter study on surgical procedure selection and risk factor analysis of postoperative complications after TIP and duckett hypospadias repair [^114qvSAW]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Snodgrass et al. reported 58 cases of proximal hypospadias treated by TIP in 2021, 26% (15 cases) of which had recurrence of penis curvature during the average follow-up of 55 months after surgery. Among the cases, only dorsal plication was used in seven to correct penis curvature, and was done during the re-correction procedure. The ventral intact urethral plate leads to an increase in the tension of the ventral tissue of the penis, which ultimately leads to the recurrence of hypospadias. Therefore, for the surgical treatment of proximal hypospadias, Snodgrass suggests to only perform proximal TIP when there is little (< 30°) or no ventral curvature. In this study, only 9.5% of the children with proximal hypospadias were treated with TIP. The average penile curvature in the TIP group was 37.1°, and 44.2% had severe penile curvature. During the average follow-up of 26 months, no penile recurrence curvature occurred, which may be related to the strict understanding of the indications for TIP. Therefore, TIP should be used with caution for proximal hypospadias with severe penile curvature. Above all, for proximal hypospadias, when the flatness and elasticity of the UP are poor or when the penis is severely curved, TIP operation should be used with caution, and transverse urethral plate or staged operation should be selected.

Risk factors of short-term complications after Duckett operation

Duckett operation is difficult and requires high surgical skills, with a high complication rate of 37.9–59.3%. Long et al. reported that the incidence of complications in 167 cases of proximal hypospadias was 56% during the average follow-up of 31.7 months. Lucas et al. found that postoperative complications of distal, intermediate, and proximal hypospadias were 10.7%, 18.8%, and 53.8%, respectively. In this multicenter study, the overall postoperative complication rate of distal hypospadias was 23.4%, that of middle hypospadias 29.0%, and that of proximal hypospadias 43.7%. Therefore, the postoperative complications of proximal hypospadias are high, which may be due to the length of urethral defect and the length of urethra to be formed.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^116L2LsG]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — minimum diagnostic evaluation: The clinician should engage in a diagnostic process to document the signs and symptoms that characterize Peyronie's disease, with the minimum requirements being a careful history to assess penile deformity, interference with intercourse, penile pain, and/or distress, and a physical exam of the genitalia to assess for palpable abnormalities of the penis. Assessment of sexual function is of particular importance and penile sensation, ejaculatory function, erectile function, difficulty/pain with penile penetration, and concerns regarding penile length and girth should be assessed; the goal of the examination is to provide baseline values that document the presence of deformity, the point of maximum curvature, presence/location/size of penile plaque(s), penile length, and areas of tenderness. For patients and/or partners with significant distress, consideration should be given for referral to a mental health professional with expertise in sexuality.

### Peyronie's disease: a critical appraisal of current diagnosis and treatment [^112z75QB]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

Peyronie's disease is a fibrotic disorder of the tunica albuginea of the penis resulting in varying degrees of penile curvature and sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of the disorder is made by detailed sexual history and focused physical examination. A wide range of medical treatments has been employed to treat the disorder. Verapamil treatment administered by intraplaque injection is supported by generally consistent randomized controlled trials (RCT). Some RCT evidence exists to support the use of colchicine, potaba, L-carnitine and liposomal superoxide dismutase. Future studies of medical efficacy should focus on improving RCT design, implementation and results reporting to improve the quality of evidence generated by each study. The surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease is a viable and recommended alternative for men with compromised sexual function due to severe curvature or lesions causing penile instability. The choice of corrective procedure should be tailored to each patient after a detailed evaluation of disease severity and sexual function.

### Management of penile curvature in children [^116iAt7J]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ventral penile curvature occurs in both hypospadias and so-called 'chordee without hypospadias', and so its correction is a topic of relevance to pediatric urologists.

Recent Findings

Dorsal plication and ventral corporal incision with grafting are the two most commonly used methods to straighten ventral penile curvature. Urethral plate elevation from the corpora has previously been reported to reduce bending, and in the past year this maneuver has been combined with ventral corporal grafting or with dissection of the formed urethra to the bulb to achieve straightening while conserving the plate for urethroplasty.

Summary

Continuing innovation in hypospadias surgery offers additional options for straightening the congenitally bent penis.

Univariate and multivariate analysis of postoperative complications of Duckett operation

In the Duckett group, 375 patients were 8–134 months old, with a median age of 26 months and a mean age of 30 months. Penile length 2.0–6.8 cm, mean 3.7 cm; glans length 6–22 mm, average 11.2 mm; glans width 7–25 mm, mean 13.3 mm; length of urethral defect 1.7–6.0 cm, average 3.31 cm. There were 8 cases of mild ventral curvature (< 15°), 42 cases of moderate ventral curvature (15–35°), and 325 cases of severe ventral curvature (> 35°). Prepuce was monocular in 52 cases, binocular in 300 cases, and irregular in 23 cases. The prepuce superficial vascular distribution was one blood vessel type in 146 cases (38.9%), two blood vessel type in 140 cases (37.3%), H-type in 9 cases (2.4%), reticular type in 44 cases (11.7%), and no obvious type in 36 cases (9.6%). There were 188 cases of smooth prepuce island flaps, 144 cases of normal prepuce flaps, and 43 cases of uneven prepuce flaps. Good elasticity of prepuce island flaps in 193 cases, moderate elasticity in 162 cases, poor elasticity in 20 cases. The complication rate was 51.2% (192/375), as shown in Table 1.

Urethral defect length, prepuce island flap length, and ventral curvature (all P < 0.001) were risk factors for complications after Duckett operation. There were no statistically significant differences in age, penis length, glans length and width, prepuce morphology, and prepuce superficial vascular distribution between groups with and without complications (P > 0.05). Complications in the smooth flap group were less than those in moderate and uneven flap group (42.0% and 71.1%, respectively), and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The complications in the group with good elasticity were less than those in the group with general elasticity and poor elasticity (40.9% and 62.1%, respectively), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001), indicating that the elasticity and flatness of the prepuce flap were risk factors for postoperative complications after Duckett operation.

### Congenital penile curvature: dermal grafting procedure to prevent penile shortening in adults [^112tvWS8]. European Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report the results of a derma graft corporoplasty in a selected group of patients with congenital penile curvature (CPC) who refused a simple plication technique for the risk of penile shortening, even if minimal.

Methods

Between January 1995 and January 2004, 15 potent patients with CPC underwent corporoplasty with inguinal derma graft, with or without tunica albuginea plication. Mean age was 26.6 years (range 19–36). Six patients had a simple lateral left curvature, three had a simple lateral right curvature, four had a ventro-lateral left curvature, one patient had a ventro-lateral right curvature, and one patient had ventral curvature. In nine patients the preoperative mean IIEF-5 score was 22.55 (range 21–24). All the patients were evaluated after three, six and 12 months.

Results

One graft was placed in one patient (6.6%), seven (46.6%) received one graft and underwent a tunica albuginea plication, four (26.6%) received two grafts, three (20%) received two grafts and underwent tunica albuginea plication. A residual curvature after three, six and 12 months was present respectively in all (100%), seven (46.6%) and one (6.6%) patients. No patients had a decrease of penile length. The mean difference in the IIEF-5 score before and after the surgical procedure was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Surgical correction of CPC with derma grafts in potent patients restores penile straightening with no postoperative shortening and preserves normal erectile capacity. Patient satisfaction indicates that the proposed technique may be used in selected cases.

Results

Study population

Between December 2020 and December 2022, 236 children with PH were treated at our hospital, with an average age of 3.0 (2.0, 4.4) years and a median follow-up period of 10.0 (8.0, 14.0) months. In total, 124 PH cases were treated using the Duckett procedure, 62 using the Duckett + Duplay procedure, and 50 using the modified Koyanagi procedure. Postoperative complications occurred in 79 cases (33.5%), including 35 cases (44.3%) of urethral fistulas, 5 cases (6.3%) of anastomotic strictures, 20 cases (25.3%) of urethral strictures with diverticula, 10 cases (12.7%) of urethral diverticula, 6 cases (7.6%) of urethral strictures with urethral fistulas, and 3 cases (3.8%) of anastomotic strictures with urethral diverticula. Recurrences of glans dehiscence or penile curvature were not recorded.

Univariate analysis

Significant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative complications in the univariate analyses for age (P < 0.001), LRU (P < 0.001), degree of penile curvature (P = 0.049), and PH with prostatic utricle (P = 0.014) (Table 1).

### Risk factors for postoperative urethral diverticulum following hypospadias repair with disconnection of the urethral plate [^114mMyit]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Hypospadias is a prevalent malformation in pediatric urology. For hypospadias patients where the penile curvature exceeds 30 degrees after penile degloving, DUP is often employed as the surgical method. For hypospadias with a penile curvature ranging from 20 to 30 degrees, DUP surgery is selectively utilized. The DUP methods reported in the literature mainly consist of TPIF (also termed Duckett) and Koyanagi. On the Basis of whether the operation can be staged, it can be divided into one-stage and two-stage operations. The main two-stage methods include Byars' flap operation, Bracka operation and partial reconstruction of proximal urethrostomy. The two-stage methods employed in this study were all the latter. The incidence of complications following DUP is high, and the main complications include urethral fistula, urethral stenosis and UD. DUP surgery presents a challenge for every pediatric urologist.

### Clinical characteristics, complications and satisfaction of megameatus intact prepuce (MIP) hypospadias variant: a 15 year retrospective study [^115qBrrA]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications and treatment

Post-operative complications were observed in 6 children (19.4%), though none required reoperation. The complications included 2 cases of adherent prepuce, 2 instances of urethral strictures, 1 case of a small urethral diverticulum that did not require surgical intervention, and 1 case of glans dehiscence caused by accidental catheter removal with excessive force by the patient. Among the urethral strictures, one case was identified after catheter removal and successfully treated by reinserting the catheter, followed by a delayed removal 2 months post-surgery. In the other urethral stricture case, parents reported a thin stream of urine, but the child did not face any difficulty in urination, and the stream's thickness remained stable up to the writing of this manuscript. The patient is currently under continuous observation, and surgical intervention has been deemed unnecessary at this time.

As shown in Table 2, we divided patients into no complication group (N = 25) and complication group (N = 6). The only statistical difference between the two groups was the position of the urethral opening and satisfaction rate (p < 0.05).

Table 2
Risk factors for postoperative complications

Regarding satisfaction with surgical outcomes, 85.7% of parents and patients with penile curvature expressed satisfaction, compared to 90.0% in those without curvature. As illustrated in Fig. 2, of the 21 children identified with curvature, 13 underwent urethroplasty, achieving a satisfaction rate of 76.9%, while the 8 who did not undergo the procedure reported 100% satisfaction. No significant statistical difference was observed between them (P = 0.26). Twenty-three cases of abnormal urethral openings were identified intraoperatively, while 8 cases were detected preoperatively. Among the intraoperatively diagnosed cases, 87% were satisfied with the outcomes, compared to 87.5% in the preoperatively diagnosed group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 1.00).

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^111g3Qd4]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — patient presentation notes that most often penile erection is still firm enough for sexual intercourse, and recent onset of penile curvature and varying degrees of penile pain without a palpable abnormality in the non-erect state may be considered diagnostic; less common presentations include younger men in their 20s or 30s who may have a palpable plaque in the non-erect state, middle-aged patients with more advanced curvature or mid-shaft indentation, and some patients may present with erectile dysfunction (ED) as the primary problem or have plaque/curvature detected only during pharmacologic testing or penile prosthesis surgery.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^115ZvZmt]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — surgical reconstruction candidate assessment (Guideline Statement 17): Clinicians should assess patients as candidates for surgical reconstruction based on the presence of stable disease. Patients considering surgical reconstruction should be in the stable phase; lesions typically become stable at 12 to 18 months after symptom onset, and common study criteria require PD symptoms for at least 12 months with stable curvature for 3 to 6 months. The pre-surgical evaluation should determine symptom onset and establish that symptoms have been clinically unchanged for at least three months, and in the Panel's expert opinion, distinguishing features of stable disease are deformity and plaque(s) that are unchanging and non-progressive. The evaluation should establish erectile assessment, document location, direction, and degree of curvature; identify narrowing, hourglass, or shortening; characterize plaque(s) including whether any are calcified; assess presence and degree of ED; determine whether deformity and/or pain interferes with intercourse; and record the presence and degree of distress. Surgical therapies other than prosthesis implant generally do not restore erectile function when ED is unresponsive to pharmacotherapy or vacuum devices, and patients prioritizing full sexual function with ED refractory to pharmacotherapy should be counseled to consider prosthesis implantation.

### DORSAL plication technique for the treatment of congenital ventral penile curvature: long-term outcomes of 72 cases [^111fBR4v]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A total of 78 patients aged 11 to 17 years were diagnosed with congenital ventral penile curvature and underwent surgery with the dorsal plication technique between 2005 and 2014.

Aim

To investigate the long-term outcomes of 72 patients who underwent dorsal penile plication for the treatment of congenital ventral penile curvature without hypospadias.

Methods

In all cases, the intervascular space between the deep dorsal vein and dorsal artery was dissected, and tunical plication was carried out with non-absorbable 3–0 polyamide sutures and the complication and satisfaction rates of the patients were determined in the postoperative seventh year.

Outcomes

At the final postoperative follow-up, the patients' satisfaction with the operation was found to be 95.8%.

Results

Shortening of the penis (0.5–1 cm) in five cases, recurrence with less than a 20-degree curvature in two cases, palpable sutures in two cases was observed and no patients reported erectile dysfunction.

Strengths & Limitations

The limitations of our study can be considered as the absence of pharmacological erection in the preoperative evaluation, failure to evaluate penile length at the last postoperative follow-up due to the continued development of the penis, inability to evaluate erectile function at the beginning, postoperative erectile capacity being assessed in only some of the operated cases, all operations being performed by a single surgeon in the same center, and the absence of standardized questionnaires for postoperative satisfaction or adverse events.

Conclusion

According to the results of this study, dorsal plication is a relatively simple method with a low risk and high success rate for the treatment of congenital ventral penile curvatures.

### Clinical characteristics, complications and satisfaction of megameatus intact prepuce (MIP) hypospadias variant: a 15 year retrospective study [^114o4F4h]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Snodgrass et al. in their study of 63 MIP patients treated with TIP, noted only one case of postoperative urethral fistula. They concluded that neonatal circumcision does not increase complications in later MIP treatments. They recommend routine circumcision in newborns with a normal-appearing foreskin, dismissing medical and legal concerns regarding hidden urethral anomalies. Similarly, Pieretti et al. found no adverse impact of prior circumcision on the outcomes of MIP variant hypospadias surgeries. Contrarily, in our patient cohort, one case necessitated urethral plate transection due to severe curvature, employing the Duckett technique. We believe that the risk is inherent, thus suggesting that circumcision should be performed with caution for children with potential penile anomalies.

During the telephone follow-up, we limited our questions to satisfaction with penile function and appearance. This streamlined approach facilitated greater willingness among patients and parents to participate in the satisfaction surveys. Our findings revealed that the precise correction of the urethral position was not a pivotal factor influencing satisfaction. Instead, concerns centered around postoperative complications, residual penile curvature, and skin appearance. Over the 15 years covered in this study, MIP represented a mere 0.4% (31/7782) of all hypospadias cases treated in our hospital. The low incidence indirectly validates the satisfaction survey outcomes, indicating that many MIP patients, in the absence of curvature, opt against surgical intervention, preferring to retain a megameatus.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^115QcNf3]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Penile prosthesis surgery — Guideline Statement 20 and outcomes in Peyronie's disease indicate clinicians may offer this option for refractory dysfunction or deformity, with high rates of curvature improvement and variable penile length and sensation changes. Clinicians may offer penile prosthesis surgery to patients with Peyronie's disease with erectile dysfunction (ED) and/or penile deformity sufficient to impair coitus despite pharmacotherapy and/or vacuum device therapy. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C). Forty-three observational studies reported on outcomes for 2,216 PD patients who had penile prosthesis surgery, and the most commonly-reported outcome was curvature improvement: twenty-six studies reported this information, all studies reported rates of > 80%, and twenty studies reported improvement rates of 100%. Seven studies reported complete penile straightening with a range from 85 to 100%. Although several studies reported penile shortening based on perception, only three studies actually measured SPL; among measured cohorts, 6.4% and 30% experienced shortening in specific series, while six studies reported length increases ranging from 1.3 to 3.6 cm. Persistent changes in penile sensation were reported by fourteen studies ranging from 0 to 50%, with seven studies reporting 5% or less, three studies reporting 70% or 80%, and individual series reporting 28.6% and 40%.

### Risk factors for postoperative complications following one-stage proximal hypospadias repair involving the disconnection of the urethral plate: a retrospective study [^114QYibu]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

An important feature of PH is penile curvature, which is difficult to treat. Nearly three-quarters of our patients had curvatures of > 45°, with severe penile curvatures requiring longer LRUs after urethral plate disconnection. This affects the blood flow to the flaps, and necessitates the creation of more flaps to form the new urethra. For surgery of moderate-to-severe curvatures, Shahin et al. proposed measuring the urethra and flap accurately to mark the surgical site and avoiding cutting the flap too long or too short to prevent unnecessary trauma.

PH with prostatic utricle is highly prevalent in PH. Devine et al. found that 14% of hypospadias involved the prostatic utricle. Only a few studies have examined whether the prostatic utricle affects the complication frequency following hypospadias repair. Preoperatively, PH with prostatic utricle may be asymptomatic but likely increases the urethral curvature, flow resistance, and residual leakage of the prostatic utricle postoperatively, causing urinary tract infections, urinary retention, epididymitis, and difficulties urinating, which adversely affect surgical wound healing.

In patients with a short penis, small glans, and small urethral plate, androgens may be used preoperatively to increase the GW and support penile development. GW is an independent factor of complications following hypospadias repair. One study reported a 14.9% reduction in complications after androgen therapy for every 1-mm increase in GW. Bush et al. found that a GW of < 14 mm is an independent risk factor for hypospadias reoperation. Our study confirms that GW is an independent influencing factor for complications after PH repair.

Likewise, LRU is also an independent risk factor of complications of PH. According to Zhou et al. disconnection of a urethral plate < 4.55 cm is significantly associated with PH complications, which is similar to the 4.45-cm LRU threshold determined in our study. Reconstruction of long urethras require greater blood supply and higher levels of surgical skills. Moreover, insufficient tissue covering material can result in higher complication rates.

### Aphallia-congenital absence of the penis: a systematic review [^117XMGm7]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Search strategy

We included case reports/ series involving patients with aphallia. This review follows the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses — Protocol (PRISMA-P) to increase comprehensiveness and transparency of reporting. We searched two electronic databases, Medline and Sciencedirect, until March 2023. The following keywords and medical subject headings were used: Aphallia, penile agenesis, absence of penile shaft, absence of penis, clitoral absence, absence of phallus, and absence of corpora cavernosa.

Study selection

The database search was conducted by two authors (P.Y. and E.T). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review was a specific focus on aphallia in all age of patients. Operation technique focus and non-English articles were excluded.

All articles reporting one or more cases of aphallia were obtained in full-text. Two authors (P.Y. and E.T) independently extracted data from all studies into data summary tables. The articles which fulfilled the eligibility criteria were included in this review. The following data were collected: age, clinical findings, supporting investigations, laboratory findings and management. The final selected papers were reviewed by three authors (P.E.Y. Y.Z. J. A.T.)

Data extraction and synthesis

The information that was extracted included the following: author and year of study; demographics of the patient, including age, proportion of males and female, weight and country, presenting signs and symptoms with percentage distribution; laboratory data and imaging findings with percentage distribution; and management with percentage distribution. Due to the qualitative, summative nature of this review and significant variations in participants, presentation, laboratory data, imaging and treatments, a meta-analysis could not be conducted and effect sizes could not be calculated.

### Congenital muscular torticollis [^112VTr7F]. Annals of Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on congenital muscular torticollis:

- **Definition**: Congenital muscular torticollis is a benign congenital musculoskeletal disorder characterized by unilateral shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle leading to ipsilateral head tilt and contralateral rotation of the face and chin.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of congenital muscular torticollis is unknown. Several theories have been proposed including intrauterine crowding, muscle trauma during a difficult delivery, soft tissue compression leading to compartment syndrome, and congenital abnormalities of soft tissue differentiation within the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of congenital muscular torticollis ranges from 0.3% and 2%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include breech presentation, prolonged labor, and difficult birth. Associated conditions may include developmental dysplasia of hip and plagiocephaly.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include ipsilateral head tilt and contralateral rotation of the face and chin, plagiocephaly, palpable pseudotumor, and tightness of the muscle. Untreated congenital muscular torticollis in infancy may lead to craniofacial growth deformity in adults.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Congenital muscular torticollis is not associated with increased mortality.

### Clinical characteristics, complications and satisfaction of megameatus intact prepuce (MIP) hypospadias variant: a 15 year retrospective study [^113avgQ9]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

MIP hypospadias variants can present with severe ventral curvature, requiring surgical correction. Surgery generally yields good outcomes with minimal complications, though achieving sufficient curvature correction and a cosmetically acceptable appearance are key concerns for both patients and parents. While complication rates are low, attention to detail in surgical technique is crucial for ensuring long-term functional and aesthetic success. Close follow-up is needed to monitor growth and detect any late complications.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^1117rpDY]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — plaque incision or excision and/or grafting is presented with a conditional recommendation and observed outcomes. Clinicians may offer plaque incision or excision and/or grafting to patients with deformities whose rigidity is adequate for coitus (with or without pharmacotherapy and/or vacuum device therapy) to improve penile curvature (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Strength Grade C). Observational studies reported outcomes for 2,585 patients, and this set of techniques is described as the second most common surgical strategy used to treat PD patients, used in approximately 44% of the 5,818 PD patients who underwent surgical reconstruction other than prosthesis surgery. Thirty-six studies validly measured erectile function before and after surgery; nineteen studies reported rates of persistent change in penile sensation ranging from 0% to 25%; eleven studies measured stretched penile length (SPL) before and after surgery and reported rates of penile shortening from 0% to 63%, with reported mean degrees of shortening of 0.2 cm, 0.5 cm, 0.7 cm, and 1.0 cm; several studies reported penile lengthening in 21% to 100% of patients with average increases ranging from 1.0 cm to 2.2 cm.

### Clinical characteristics, complications and satisfaction of megameatus intact prepuce (MIP) hypospadias variant: a 15 year retrospective study [^112gtF5s]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In 1983, Juskiewenski et al. described MIP as "anterior hypospadias", defining it as a condition in which the meatus is positioned at the base of the glans, near or at the balano-preputial groove, usually without significant curvature. Despite existing studies on MIP, unresolved questions remain, such as the prevalence of curvature in MIP, variations in complications relative to conventional hypospadias, and factors influencing post-surgical patient satisfaction. To address these uncertainties, we reviewed clinical data from MIP surgeries performed in our hospital over the last 15 years, aiming at furnish comprehensive and reliable reference material for our readers.

Ben-David et al. conducted a retrospective examination of 118 MIP hypospadias variant cases, observing a median repair age of 1.1 years. They discovered penile curvature in 29 children (24%); of these, 23 exhibited dorsal curvature (19%) and 6 ventral curvature (5%). In contrast, our study identified no instances of dorsal curvature, with ventral curvature present in 67.7% (21/31) of the patients. This notable disparity may be attributable to the following factors:
Neonatal Male Circumcision and Age at Surgery: In Ben-David's study, all MIP patients underwent neonatal circumcision, leaving the presence of curvature before the procedure uncertain. They postulated that either ventral or dorsal curvature might arise as a consequence of skin deficiency from circumcision and subsequent secondary healing. Conversely, in our cultural context, neonatal circumcision is uncommon. Thus, the penile development was not influenced by skin deficiency, and MIP repair occurred later in life, allowing for more accurate observation of penile curvature during surgery. This suggests that dorsal curvature may be linked to a deficiency of skin.
Undiagnosed MIP: In our study, patients with curvature underwent surgery at a younger age and lighter weight compared to those without curvature (mean age 80.4 ± 41.6 months vs. 117.0 ± 26.0 months, P < 0.01; median weights 22.7 [15.8–35.0] kg vs. 45.0 [32.0–46.0] kg, P = 0.02). For children not circumcised, the meatus's position may often go unnoticed by both parents and the children themselves. Consequently, pronounced ventral curvature, leading to observable issues like urinating on one's shoes, tends to prompt medical consultation more readily. On the other hand, dorsal curvature, typically more apparent during erection, poses a diagnostic challenge in older children due to embarrassment to disclose such issues to parents.
Ligamentous Structural Forces Between the Corporal Bodies and the Glans: Ozbey sug'gested that in MIP patients, dorsal curvature of the glans may result from the absence of the lower median septum, combined with the dominant tensile force of the distal ligament. He underscored the importance of examining and exploring the ligamentous framework and the intricate fibrous layers within the glans penis.

### A multicenter study on surgical procedure selection and risk factor analysis of postoperative complications after TIP and duckett hypospadias repair [^112GHUM7]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

As for the glans width, some studies suggest that a penile head width of 14 mm in TIP represents the critical value, and the incidence of complications will be reduced by 20% when the glans size increases by 1 mm. In this multicenter study, glans width was measured at the point of maximum width. Glans width was found to range from 7 to 25 mm with an average of 14.5 mm. Multivariate analysis indicated that glans width (OR = 0.851, 95% CI: 0.749–0.965) was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications after TIP surgery (P = 0.012), showing that the risk of postoperative complications was reduced by 14.9% for each 1 mm increase in glans width.

Bhat et al. reported 14 cases of proximal hypospadias with well-developed UP and spongiform body accompanied by moderate penile curvature undergoing TIP operation. During the average follow-up of 30 months after surgery, two cases of urethral fistula and one case of urethral stricture occurred. Therefore, the characteristics of UP, such as flatness and elasticity, affect the therapeutic effect of TIP. In this study, the complications of the smooth UP group were less than those of the uneven UP groups (23.1% and 32.4%, respectively), and complications of the good UP elasticity group were less than those of the poor elasticity groups (23.3% and 31.4%, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant. Among the children with proximal hypospadias treated with TIP, 88.5% had good UP elasticity, 84.6% had smooth UP, and the incidence of postoperative complications was 30.8%. Therefore, we suggest that when the elasticity and flatness of the UP are poor, TIP operation is not recommended, and transverse UP operation should be performed.

### Risk factors and molecular characterization of penile cancer: impact on prognosis and potential targets for systemic therapy [^114TMQEB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a comprehensive summary of risk factors, molecular machinery as well as potential therapeutic targets with a particular focus on literature published in the last 2 years on prognosis and treatment of penile cancer (PeCa).

Recent Findings

E2F, LAMC2, MAML2, ID1 and IGFBP2 proteins were demonstrated to play a critical role for aggressive tumor behavior and might predict poor survival in PeCa. PD-L1 axis was confirmed as a promising pathway to serve as a therapeutic target. A number of genetic alterations were illuminated. In clinical testing, pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib provided promising results in chemo-naïve and EGFR monoantibody nimotuzumab in chemotherapy-failed PeCa patients.

Summary

Knowledge of prognosis-relevant altered molecular pathways in PeCa is expanding paving the way for identification of potential therapeutic targets. Multicenter clinical trials in the setting of centralized PeCa care are warranted to foster effective marker-based individualized treatment strategies.

### Congenital prepubic sinus with dorsal penile curvature: a case report and literature review [^1158gYr5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urethral duplication is an infrequent congenital lower urinary tract anomaly and generally classified into three types, including incomplete (type 1), complete (type 2) and coronal (type 3). Congenital prepubic sinus (CPS) is suggested as a variant of incomplete dorsal urethral duplication by immunohistochemical analysis. CPS represents a blind-ending duplicated urethra located in front of the pubic symphysis, which stretches to, but not communicates with urinary bladder. Patients often complain of intermittent mucous or purulent discharge from the meatus. Here, we present an interesting case of CPS companied by dorsal penile curvature, with the chief complaint of the pain in the dorsal base of the penis.

### A multicenter study on surgical procedure selection and risk factor analysis of postoperative complications after TIP and duckett hypospadias repair [^116QYLKA]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Beijing Children's Hospital reported that urethral defect length (OR = 1.858, 95% CI: 1.053–3.277) was an independent risk factor for postoperative complications of Duckett surgery (P = 0.032). In this multicentrer study, the complication rate of Duckett operation was 51.2% (192/375), including 130 cases of urethral fistula (34.7%), 52 cases of urethral stricture (13.9%), and 54 cases of diverticular dilation (14.4%). Univariate analysis showed that there were no significant differences in age, penis length, glans length and width, and prepuce shape between the complication groups (P > 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that the length of urethral defect, length of prepuce island flap, and ventral curvature were the risk factors for complications after Duckett operation. Combined with clinical findings, we found that the above mentioned three factors are related to the severity of hypospadias. The more severe the degree of hypospadias, the longer the length of urethral defect after the correction, the longer the length of prepuce flap, and the greater the postoperative complications. At present, there are few studies on the effect of characteristics of prepuce island flaps on postoperative complications after Duckett procedure. The complications of smooth prepuce flaps were less than those of moderate and uneven flaps (42.0% < 71.1%), and those of good flap elasticity were less than those of general and poor flap elasticity (40.9% < 62.1%), and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Combined with clinical practice, we believe that when the skin island flap is smooth and elastic, the incidence of postoperative complications may be relatively low. When the prepuce condition is poor, that is, when it is of uneven, and of poor elasticity, the inner wall of the newly formed urethra will not be smooth and will have poor elasticity, leading to a local vortex that forms during urination, resulting in the formation of urethral diverticulum.

### Predictors of surgical complications in boys with hypospadias: data from an internationa registry [^116q1Dpm]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The complication rate of 64% observed in this cohort is high and exceeds that of 56% previously reported in boys with proximal hypospadias. Prior to the former study by Long et al, lower complication rates for proximal repairs were often reported, ranging from 13% to 23%. As nearly half of complications seen in this cohort arose 2 years after first hypospadias repair, it is possible that past studies lacked adequate follow-up periods, partially accounting for the comparatively high rates seen in the current study. Long-term prospective studies regarding complications in hypospadias are required to truly determine complication rates over time.

As previously described, additional genital malformations may be associated with poor surgical outcomes, likely secondary to smaller glans, less penile skin, greater degrees of chordee, and poor urethral plate quality. In this study, 87% of boys presented with chordee, which has been associated with a 55% increase in complication rates. Additionally, as 63% of the boys presented with micropenis, tissue availability and glans quality would likely be suboptimal in many cases, requiring the utilization of more complex surgical methods during hypospadias correction. Indeed, as the data for this study were obtained from the I-DSD Registry, inherently, this cohort may be at a greater risk of complications due to the suboptimal anatomy associated with severe undermasculinization and DSD. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, however, it was not possible to collect detailed information on the quality of the urethral plate, angle of penile curvature or glans width. We would recommend that these should be introduced as aspects of standard data collection during hypospadias repairs. In addition, more detailed standard data collection regarding the precise type of surgical procedure would be useful for any future studies into complication rates.

### Is there a place for conservative treatment in Peyronie's disease? [^1163oYaW]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Peyronie's disease (PD) is a relatively common disorder affecting middle aged men. Conservative nonsurgical treatments include oral, topical, and intra-lesional pharmacotherapies, vacuum stretching, and mechanical traction.

Methods

Four people with expertise and/or interest in the area of PD were asked to contribute their opinions with regard to the safety and efficacy of nonsurgical conservative treatments.

Main Outcome Measure

To provide food for thought, discussion, and possible further research in a poorly discussed area of sexual medicine.

Results

Of the four experts writing on the topic, one believes a combination of medical therapy and penile traction has positive potential for curvature. Another feels that although medical therapies have potential to alleviate pain, there is little evidence to show that they help with curvature or that penile traction helps. A third expert proposes dividing the disease into phases, where patients in the acute phase may benefit from conservative therapy, whereas patients whose disease is stable require surgical intervention. The last expert agrees that the therapy should depend on the stage of the disease, but believes like the first expert that there is a role for traction therapy for patients with stable disease.

Conclusion

There is a need for guidelines for nonsurgical therapies for patients with PD, but there is a paucity of evidence as to their efficacy.

### Fertility and sexual dysfunction issues in adults with genitourinary congenital anomalies [^112hu9HT]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As growing numbers of adolescents with a history of congenital genitourinary anomalies successfully enter adulthood, their spectrum of urologic concerns broadens to include sexual function and reproduction.

Recent Findings

In hypospadias repair, preoperative testosterone was found to reduce rates of postoperative complications of urethrocutaneous fistula formation and meatal stenosis. Following hypospadias correction, dissatisfaction with surgical outcomes has been observed to correlate with psychological outcomes, rather than objective measurements such as location of meatus degree of curvature. In women with a congenital absence of a vagina, sigmoid vaginoplasty and dilation yield similar sexual outcomes, however, vaginoplasty was associated with a 20% rate of reoperation. Ilioinguinal-to-dorsal neurorrhaphy for restoration of penile sensation in myelomeningocele has shown success in a small pilot study. Both sexual activity and paternity rates are higher in women, compared with men who are born with bladder exstrophy.

Summary

The extent and complexity of issues related to sexual function and fertility in the population of patients with a history of genitourinary malformation requires a thoughtful approach to timely surgical management and consistent care through their transition from childhood to adulthood.

### 4.8 congenital malformations of genital organs hypospadias (Q54… [^115G5Nv5]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

The shortening of the ventral side of the penis found in hypospadias can result in a curvature of the penis, known as chordee. Chordee is common in severe cases of hypospadias, but it can also occur independently. Chordee by itself is considered a minor anomaly. Photograph source: 1, 2, 4, 5: Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. Suggested non-genetic risk factors for hypospadias include advanced maternal age and environmental exposure to certain chemicals. The birth prevalence of hypospadias varies widely, between 2 and 39 per 10 000 births. RENAL AGENESIS/HYPOPLASIA Renal agenesis is a complete absence of one or both kidneys. If bilateral, renal agenesis is a lethal condition: the fetus will be stillborn or die shortly after delivery.

In utero, bilateral renal agenesis leads to oligohydramnios, which causes Potter sequence – abnormal facies, talipes and other contractures, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Clinical and epidemiologic notes At least half of cases of bilateral renal agenesis are estimated to be associated with other structural anomalies or syndromes. The non-syndromic multiple anomaly patterns include the VATER/ VACTERL association.
