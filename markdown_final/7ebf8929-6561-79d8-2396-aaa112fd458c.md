## Question

What is the normal level of b12

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what constitutes a normal vitamin B12 level and how to interpret results near the lower end of the reference range. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guideline thresholds. Then, I should verify unit conversions and ensure I'm quoting the correct numbers. Next, I will consider the gray zone and when to use confirmatory tests like MMA. After that, I should review special populations and assay limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented answer with caveats and next steps for borderline results.

> Let me first confirm the primary diagnostic threshold. The British Society for Haematology guideline defines vitamin B12 deficiency as serum cobalamin less than 148 pmol/L, which is equivalent to less than 200 ng/L, and this is the most consistently cited diagnostic cut point across BSH documents and summaries of BSH guidance [^1cec0493] [^b837ca21].

> Wait, let me verify the unit conversion so I don't misstate it. 148 pmol/L equals 200 ng/L, and many labs report in pg/mL, so 200 ng/L is the same as 200 pg/mL; I initially thought 148 pmol/L might be 180 pg/mL, but that would be incorrect, and I should correct that now to 200 pg/mL to avoid confusion in interpretation and counseling [^1cec0493] [^b837ca21].

> Next, I should review the lower limit of normal and the indeterminate range. Many laboratories list a lower limit around 170–250 pg/mL, and values in this band warrant clinical correlation and, when suspicion is high, second-line testing such as methylmalonic acid or holotranscobalamin to clarify functional status, especially if symptoms or risk factors are present [^8e412f37] [^d7dcc34d] [^ff16b9a6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single number. I need to check the concept of functional deficiency. Even with serum B12 in the low-normal range, MMA and/or homocysteine may be elevated, indicating clinically meaningful deficiency at the tissue level; this is particularly relevant in older adults and those with comorbidities or malabsorption, so discordant results should prompt treatment rather than waiting for levels to fall further [^d7dcc34d] [^72944797] [^61b3fa7c].

> I should confirm special population nuances. In pregnancy, total serum B12 naturally declines and becomes less reliable, so if deficiency is suspected, holotranscobalamin is preferred to assess active B12 status; similarly, in older adults, age-related malabsorption and atrophic gastritis are common, so a lower threshold for confirmatory testing and treatment is reasonable even with borderline serum values [^96f3243e] [^c8902d81].

> Let me consider assay limitations so I don't overinterpret a single result. Serum B12 assays measure total cobalamin, including inactive haptocorrin-bound fractions, and can be falsely normal in some contexts or falsely low with certain binders; therefore, combining markers or using a composite index improves diagnostic reliability when individual results are equivocal, which is why guidelines emphasize integrating clinical features and, when needed, MMA or holotranscobalamin [^b837ca21] [^060ea156] [^38f4f96c].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my synthesis. Normal vitamin B12 is generally considered to be above about 200 pg/mL, deficiency is less than 200 pg/mL, and the 200–300 pg/mL range is a gray zone where confirmatory testing with MMA and clinical correlation is advised, particularly in the presence of anemia, neuropathy, risk factors, or high-risk populations; treatment should not be delayed if clinical suspicion is strong despite a normal-range B12 [^1cec0493] [^d7dcc34d] [^72944797].

---

The normal range for serum vitamin B12 is **148–443 pmol/L** (200–600 pg/mL) [^1cec0493] [^8e412f37]. Levels below 148 pmol/L (200 pg/mL) indicate deficiency, while levels in the 148–221 pmol/L (200–300 pg/mL) range are considered borderline and may warrant further testing with methylmalonic acid (MMA) or holotranscobalamin if clinical suspicion persists [^d7dcc34d] [^72944797]. Assay variability and clinical context can affect interpretation, so results should always be considered alongside symptoms and risk factors [^38f4f96c].

---

## Normal reference range for vitamin B12

The **normal reference range** for serum vitamin B12 is typically **148–443 pmol/L** (200–600 pg/mL) [^1cec0493] [^8e412f37]. This range may vary slightly depending on the laboratory and the assay method used, but it is widely accepted in clinical practice [^38f4f96c].

## Clinical significance of vitamin B12 levels

Vitamin B12 levels are categorized into **three main ranges**:

| **Category** | **Serum b12 level (pmol/l)** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Deficient | < 148 | Indicates vitamin B12 deficiency, requiring treatment [^1cec0493] |
| Borderline | 148–221 | Suggests possible deficiency; further testing (e.g. MMA) may be needed [^d7dcc34d] [^72944797] |
| Normal | 222–443 | Generally considered adequate |

---

## Factors influencing vitamin B12 levels

Several factors can influence **measured vitamin B12 levels**, including:

- **Age**: Older adults may have lower levels due to reduced absorption [^c8902d81].
- **Diet**: Strict vegetarians or vegans may have lower levels due to limited dietary intake [^5294ccdc].
- **Medications**: Proton pump inhibitors, metformin, and H2 receptor antagonists can reduce absorption [^9a3e684a].
- **Medical conditions**: Pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal disorders, and chronic kidney disease can affect levels [^5294ccdc] [^46f44c9b].

---

## Clinical symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a range of **symptoms**, including:

- **Hematological**: Macrocytic anemia, fatigue, pallor [^22e1aea6].
- **Neurological**: Numbness, tingling, balance problems, cognitive impairment, memory loss [^22e1aea6].
- **Psychiatric**: Depression, irritability, psychosis [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic tests for vitamin B12 deficiency

In addition to serum vitamin B12 levels, **additional tests** may be used to confirm deficiency:

- **Methylmalonic acid (MMA)**: Elevated levels indicate functional deficiency [^d7dcc34d] [^72944797].
- **Homocysteine**: Elevated levels suggest deficiency, but less specific than MMA [^d7dcc34d].
- **Holotranscobalamin**: Active B12 fraction, useful in borderline cases [^db999b0c] [^28082c2e].

---

## Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency

Treatment depends on the **cause and severity** of deficiency:

- **Dietary deficiency**: Oral supplementation (50–150 mcg daily) [^7691b9e8].
- **Malabsorption or pernicious anemia**: Intramuscular injections (1000 mcg) or high-dose oral therapy (1000–2000 mcg daily) [^cc4dc07a] [^9a3e684a].
- **Lifelong therapy**: Required for pernicious anemia or irreversible malabsorption [^cc4dc07a] [^31a93cdd].

---

## Conclusion

The normal range for serum vitamin B12 is **148–443 pmol/L** (200–600 pg/mL) [^1cec0493] [^8e412f37]. Levels below 148 pmol/L indicate deficiency, while borderline levels (148–221 pmol/L) may require further testing. Clinical context, symptoms, and risk factors should guide interpretation and management.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^2912c432]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor and that most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated. Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown. Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Comparing the efficacy and tolerability of a new daily oral vitamin B12 formulation and intermittent intramuscular vitamin B12 in normalizing low cobalamin levels: a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study [^3183a3dc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is routinely treated with parenteral dosing and less often with high-dose oral vitamin B(12). Oral vitamin B(12) formulations have low bioavailability in patients with malabsorption and are considered less reliable than parenteral treatments.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of a new proprietary oral vitamin B(12) formulation (oral B(12)) with intramuscular (IM) vitamin B(12) (IM B(12)) in restoring normal serum B(12) concentrations in patients with low cobalamin levels (< 350 pg/mL).

Methods

Patients were recruited from 5 centers and randomly assigned to receive oral B(12) 1000 μg, taken daily for 90 days, or IM B(12) 1000 μg, given on study days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90. The patients were aged ≥ 60 years or aged ≥ 18 years and had gastrointestinal abnormalities or were on a restricted diet. The primary efficacy outcome compared the proportion of patients in each treatment arm in whom cobalamin levels were normalized (≥ 350 ng/mL) following 60 days of treatment. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of the 2 formulations after 90 days of treatment, assessing time to normalization of B(12) levels, and evaluating the changes in the levels of biomarkers methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HC). The effect on holotranscobalamin II (active B(12)) levels was assessed as an exploratory end point and correlated to serum cobalamin levels in both treatment groups. Blood samples were collected at baseline (day 1) and on days 15, 31, 61, and 91.

Results

Fifty patients were recruited. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) completed the study (22 patients [91.7%] in the oral B(12) group and 26 patients [100%] in the IM B(12) group). All patients (100%) in both treatment groups and in both populations had a cobalamin level ≥ 350 pg/mL on day 61 and maintained it on day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) for mean percent change from baseline (PCFB) in serum cobalamin levels on day 61 and day 91. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 61. There was a statistical difference between the IM and oral treatment groups for mean PCFB in serum MMA levels on day 91 (P = 0.033), with lower values in the oral B(12) group. The difference between the IM and oral treatment groups did not reach the planned level of statistical significance for mean PCFB in plasma HC levels on day 61 and day 91. All patients in each treatment group achieved normalization of serum cobalamin levels by day 15. All patients in both treatment groups and in both populations had plasma holotranscobalamin levels ≥ 40 pmol/L on day 61 and on day 91. No statistical analysis was planned or performed for safety end points, which were reported only descriptively. Most observed adverse effects were considered mild or moderate in intensity. All adverse effects that were considered severe in intensity were also considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug.

Conclusions

In this selected study population comprising individuals with low cobalamin levels but who otherwise were in good health, patients received oral B(12) (1000 μg/d) or IM B(12) (1000 μg in 9 injections over 3 months) for a total of 3 months. Both the oral and IM formulations were effective in restoring normal levels of serum cobalamin in all patients studied (100%). Both formulations used in this study were well tolerated at the dose studied. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01312831.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^17026fc1]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency system) [^f9ab06ef]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients

Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

Laboratory Tests

During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^321b8f03]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations but no other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin 10 microg and 50 microg daily for 1 month.

Setting

Two geriatric hospitals in the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Thirty-one inpatients with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L, without PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illness. The mean age was 81.4 years.

Intervention

After informed consent, a medical and drug history was taken and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) completed. A dietitian made assessment of oral cobalamin intake. Blood was taken for serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate assay, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine. Patients were then randomized to receive 10 microg oral cyanocobalamin, 50 microg oral cyanocobalamin, or placebo treatment for 1 month, after which the investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

Measurements

Percentage change in the level of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters and absolute changes in MMSE were calculated and compared between groups. The groups were compared on the number of responders who improved their level of B12 by 20%. Chi-square calculations on changes in serum vitamin B12 concentration were also performed.

Results

Mean serum vitamin B12 ± standard deviation improved by 51.7 ± 47.1% in the 50-microg group, 40.2 ± 34.4% in the 10-microg group, and 11.7 ± 24.5% in the placebo group. The change in the 50-microg cyanocobalamin group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.044). The change in the 10-microg cyanocobalamin group was not significantly different from that in the placebo group (P = 0.186). Eight of 10 subjects in each treatment group were classified as responders, compared with two of 11 in the placebo group (P = 0.004). Homocysteine levels fell in patients receiving cyanocobalamin, but this fall failed to reach statistical significance. There were no significant changes in the other parameters measured.

Conclusion

Cyanocobalamin supplementation of 50 microg but not 10 microg daily produced a significant increase in serum vitamin B12. This result has implications for the management of patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations and for food fortification with vitamin B12.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin Deficiency: importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^52d97c62]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

Methods

A retrospective record-review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and concurrent measurement of MMA.

Results

When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < .01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

Conclusion

In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when 3 or more oxidant risks are present. Thus, defining a low serum cobalamin level to screen for cobalamin deficiency may be a "moving target" due to the variable presence and severity of often subtle, confounding clinical conditions in individual subjects.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^38f4f96c]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results assessing cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test, but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited. Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues, and local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^61b3fa7c]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B 12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic haematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear. B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency. Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This Primer describes the current knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency, and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Functional cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency: role of advanced age and disorders associated with increased oxidative stress [^d3677a0e]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Functional cobalamin (Cbl; vitamin B12) deficiency (that is, high levels of the Cbl-dependent metabolites, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), despite normal serum Cbl values) is common in the elderly and is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities, but its cause is unknown. As only reduced Cbls are metabolically active, the possibility that functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders having biomarkers indicative of increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) was considered.

Subjects/Methods

A retrospective record review of community-dwelling adults evaluated over a 12-year period for Cbl deficiency in a primary care setting who had serum Cbl values ⩾400pg/ml (n = 170).

Results

When no oxidant risks were present, older subjects (⩾70 years) had higher metabolite values than younger individuals (< 70 years). MMA values were even higher in the elderly when one oxidant risk was present and in younger subjects when two or more oxidant risks were present. Even at Cbl levels ⩾800pg/ml, MMA values were increased in 73% of elderly subjects with at least one oxidant risk. HCys values were also higher in both age groups when at least two oxidant risks were present. Cyanocobalamin therapy decreased MMA and HCys values in 86 and 76% of subjects, respectively, with nonresponders more likely to have two or more oxidant risks.

Conclusion

Functional Cbl deficiency is associated with disorders marked by increased oxidative stress particularly in the elderly; it occurs even when Cbl levels are high and is not consistently corrected with high-dose cyanocobalamin therapy. Thus, current approaches to recognizing and managing this disorder may be inadequate.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^22e1aea6]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Vitamin B [^7691b9e8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Does vitamin B12 influence clinical pregnancy outcome in the follicular-phase GnRH agonist protocol? [^5666296b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings support that within a specific range (≤ 358.7 pg/mL), serum vitamin B12 levels may make a modest contribution to improved clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing in IVF-ET with the follicular-phase GnRHa protocol. Specifically, serum vitamin B12 measurement could be integrated into pre-IVF screening for women at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency or those with unexplained infertility. For individuals with serum vitamin B12 levels below approximately 358.7 pg/mL, targeted vitamin B12 supplementation may help optimize pregnancy outcomes by regulating one-carbon metabolism and mitigating homocysteine-associated toxicity. Conversely, women with serum vitamin B12 levels exceeding this threshold are unlikely to derive benefits from additional supplementation. Thus, routine evaluation of serum vitamin B12 could facilitate the development of personalized nutritional strategies in reproductive medicine, thereby enhancing the efficacy and precision of IVF treatments.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^45f98319]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The studies included in this systematic review indicate that evidence of an association between a subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration and anaemia in older people is limited and inconclusive. If anything, given the high clinical relevance of our research question, we recommend more well-designed longitudinal observational studies, in younger age groups (60–85 years) especially, and intervention studies of appropriate size and duration with timely follow-up periods to determine whether a subnormal vitamin B12 is a risk factor for anaemia in older people.

### Cyanocobalamin (vitamin deficiency injectable system-B12) [^5294ccdc]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Vitamin B12is essential to growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis.

Cyanocobalamin is quantitatively and rapidly absorbed from intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of injection; the plasma level of the compound reaches its peak within 1 hour after intramuscular injection. Absorbed vitamin B12is transported via specific B12binding proteins, transcobalamin I and II to the various tissues. The liver is the main organ for vitamin B12storage.

Within 48 hours after injection of 100 or 1000 mcg of vitamin B12, 50 to 98% of the injected dose may appear in the urine. The major portion is excreted within the first eight hours. Intravenous administration results in even more rapid excretion with little opportunity for liver storage.

Gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B12depends on the presence of sufficient intrinsic factor and calcium ions. Intrinsic factor deficiency causes pernicious anemia, which may be associated with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Prompt parenteral administration of vitamin B12prevents progression of neurologic damage.

The average diet supplies about 5 to 15 mcg/day of vitamin B12in a protein-bound form that is available for absorption after normal digestion. Vitamin B12is not present in foods of plant origin, but is abundant in foods of animal origin. In people with normal absorption, deficiencies have been reported only in strict vegetarians who consume no products of animal origin (including no milk products or eggs).

Vitamin B12is bound to intrinsic factor during transit through the stomach; separation occurs in the terminal ileum in the presence of calcium, and vitamin B12enters the mucosal cell for absorption. It is then transported by the transcobalamin binding proteins. A small amount (approximately 1% of the total amount ingested) is absorbed by simple diffusion, but this mechanism is adequate only with very large doses. Oral absorption is considered too undependable to rely on in patients with pernicious anemia or other conditions resulting in malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Cyanocobalamin is the most widely used form of vitamin B12, and has hematopoietic activity apparently identical to that of the antianemia factor in purified liver extract. Hydroxycobalamin is equally as effective as cyanocobalamin, and they share the cobalamin molecular structure.

### Laboratory testing for cobalamin deficiency in megaloblastic anemia [^bbbe09e0]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia in Western populations. Laboratory evaluation of megaloblastic anemia frequently includes the assessment of patient cobalamin and folate status. Current total serum cobalamin measurements are performed in the clinical laboratory with competitive binding luminescence assays, whose results may not always accurately reflect actual cobalamin stores. Surrogate markers of cobalamin deficiency such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine have been utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, the specificity of these tests by themselves is rather low. Measurement of the biologically active fraction of cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, has been proposed as a replacement for current total cobalamin assays. Although holotranscobalamin measurements appear to have slighter better sensitivity, the specificity of this assay remains to be determined. The relative merits and demerits of commonly available methods to assess cobalamin deficiency in patients with suspected megaloblastic anemia are discussed.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^9a3e684a]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation with a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. As a result, many patients lack classic features of advanced severe deficiency. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in order to prevent the irreversible damage to the nervous system. We describe a 25-year-old man, who presented with predominant sensory symptoms without any signs on clinical evaluation. His serum vitamin B12 levels were low and neuroimaging revealed myelopathy. The patient was treated promptly with cyanocobalamin injections, which lead to a rapid resolution of symptoms and radiological abnormalities.

Laboratory Tests: During the initial treatment of patients with pernicious anemia, serum potassium must be observed closely the first 48 hours and potassium replaced if necessary.

Hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate and iron levels should be obtained prior to treatment. Hematocrit and reticulocyte counts should be repeated daily from the fifth to seventh days of therapy and then frequently until the hematocrit is normal. If folate levels are low, folic acid should also be administered. If reticulocytes have not increased after treatment or if reticulocyte counts do not continue at least twice normal as long as the hematocrit is less than 35%, diagnosis or treatment should be reevaluated. Repeat determinations of iron and folic acid may reveal a complicating illness that might inhibit the response of the marrow.

Patients with pernicious anemia have about 3 times the incidence of carcinoma of the stomach as the general population, so appropriate tests for this condition should be carried out when indicated.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Persons taking most antibiotics, methotrexate and pyrimethamine invalidate folic acid and vitamin B12diagnostic blood assays.

Colchicine para-aminosalicylic acid and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been done. There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that cyanocobalamin is carcinogenic.

Pernicious anemia is associated with an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach, but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with cyanocobalamin.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been done in pregnant women. However, vitamin B12is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council for pregnant women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during pregnancy.

Nursing Mothers: Vitamin B12is known to be excreted in human milk. Amounts of vitamin B12that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science National Research Council for lactating women (4 mcg daily) should be consumed during lactation.

Pediatric Use: Intake in children should be in the amount (0.5 to 3 mcg daily) recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science-National Research Council.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^263c3408]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty‐ and amino‐acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well‐known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

Methods

We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

Results

Low (log‐transformed) B12, especially decreased holo‐transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = −0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age‐dependent manner; standardized β = −2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = −0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo‐haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, p = 0.015).

Interpretation

Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1190–1204

We describe a case of functional vitamin B12 deficiency where the repeated measurement of a serum B12 level within the normal range led to delay in the diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, and possibly permanent neurological damage as a result. Failure of intracellular transport of B12 by transcobalamin-2 can lead to functional B12 deficiency but with apparently normal serum levels, and is suggested by raised levels of either serum methylmalonic acid or homocysteine, associated with low levels of transcobalamin-2. Such patients may respond to repeated high-dose injections of B12.

### Plasma vitamin B12 levels, high-dose vitamin B12 treatment, and risk of dementia [^ae895b41]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

A particular strength of our study is the good comparability of P-B12 measurements. Hence, misclassification of P-B12 levels due to changes in analytical methods is unlikely. Further, we included two different data sources to identify persons treated with high-dose B12 drugs. Although high-dose B12 is available over-the-counter, we consider it likely that patients with P-B12 measurements were prescribed B12 drugs if B12 deficiency was diagnosed. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis on non-reimbursed B12 prescriptions showed robust results. We observed a small difference between patients with low and normal P-B12 in the proportion of deaths during follow-up in the secondary B12-treatment cohort. This could introduce survivor bias. However, we consider the risk of selection bias due to loss to follow-up minimal since all Danish citizens are registered in the Danish Civil Registration System, including date of death or emigration, allowing for censoring in the Cox regression analysis. Another strength is the high positive predictive value of dementia (86%) and Alzheimer's disease (81%) in the DNPR, although less so for other dementia subtypes. The robustness of the results in subanalyses and sensitivity analyses also strengthens our findings. Although hydroxo-B12 is more readily converted to biologically important forms of B12 (methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin) than cyano-B12, our results did not show any specific benefit of any formulation.

In conclusion, these robust results in a large patient population suggest that B12 deficiency does not contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia types, and that high-dose B12 treatment does not prevent these diseases regardless of P-B12 or P-MMA levels. Our findings from hospital inpatients, hospital outpatients, and general practitioner patients are highly representative of all Danish patients. These findings have high external validity at least for high-income countries. They have public health implications for the assessment of dementia and imply that guidelines suggesting routine screening for B12 deficiency in patients with suspected dementia should be reconsidered.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^9d3c2c86]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, but the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people.

Methods

Clinical queries for aetiology and treatment in bibliographic databases (PubMed [01/1949–10/2009]; EMBASE [01/1980–10/2009]) were used. Reference lists were checked for additional relevant studies. Observational studies (≥ 50 participants) and randomized placebo-controlled intervention trials (RCTs) were considered.

Results

25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one observational cross-sectional studies (total number of participants n = 16185) showed inconsistent results. In one longitudinal observational study, low vitamin B12 concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of anaemia (total n = 423). The 3 RCTs (total n = 210) were well-designed and showed no effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on haemoglobin concentrations during follow-up in subjects with subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations at the start of the study. Due to large clinical and methodological heterogeneity, statistical pooling of data was not performed.

Conclusions

Evidence of a positive association between a subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration and anaemia in older people is limited and inconclusive. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine whether subnormal vitamin B12 is a risk factor for anaemia in older people.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^3de298ec]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the current normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

Methods

We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2years old) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8pmol/L (as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay). We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

Results

Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = -0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = -2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = -0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, p = 0.015).

Interpretation

Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum. These findings challenge our current understanding of optimal serum B12 levels and suggest revisiting how we establish appropriate nutritional recommendations. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1190–1204.

Vitamin B12 requirements in parenteral nutrition — adult dose and rationale: Adult parenteral multivitamin products provide 5 mcg/d of crystalline cyanocobalamin. Serum B12 tends to be elevated in chronic parenteral nutrition, usually in the 700- to 900-pg/mL range, but there are several good reasons to continue this generous 5 mcg/d dose. Reasons include that although this dose yields serum B12 at the upper limits of normal there is no evidence for a B12 toxicity syndrome, high serum levels may reflect daily parenteral infusion rather than elevated tissue levels, parenteral B12 enters the systemic rather than portal circulation with first-pass uptake of 50% by the liver and 25% of systemic blood first passing the kidneys leading to probable urinary loss, B12 secreted into bile may not be recaptured due to loss of ileal receptors, and smokers have increased urinary B12 losses as thiocyanate.

### Reduction of plasma homocysteine and serum methylmalonate concentrations in apparently healthy elderly subjects after treatment with folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6: a randomised trial [^0aed4e8a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate, in an elderly population: (1) the effects of oral B-vitamin therapy on P-tHcys, S-MMA and Hb/MCV, (2) the appropriate decision limit for 'high' metabolite concentrations and (3) the estimated prevalence of vitamin B(12)/folate deficiency on the basis of different decision limits.

Design

Double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study.

Setting

Outpatient clinic.

Subjects

A total of 209 community-dwelling subjects, median age 76 y (range 70–93) y.

Intervention

Four months of oral daily supplementation with 0.5 mg cyanocobalamin, 0.8 mg folic acid and 3 mg vitamin B(6).

Results

High P- tHcys was found in 64% of men and 45% of women, high S-MMA in 11% of both. Vitamin B(12) deficiency was observed in 7.2% and folate deficiency in 11% of all subjects. Health-related upper reference limits for the metabolites at the start were higher than the laboratory's upper reference limits. The latter were, however, similar to those of the vitamin replete group. There was a significant decrease in P-tHcys (P < 0.001) and S-MMA (P = 0.009) after 4 months of vitamin treatment. In a multivariate analysis, the P-Hcys change correlated positively with baseline P-tHcys and inversely with baseline P-folate and transferrin saturation (Fe/TIBC ratio). The S-MMA change correlated with baseline S-MMA and inversely with baseline vitamin B(12) and age.

Conclusions

Suboptimal vitamin status is an important cause of elevated P-tHcys and S-MMA in apparently healthy elderly subjects. Oral B-vitamin therapy is an effective and convenient way to normalise P-tHcys and S-MMA.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^e5544328]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population‐based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained. Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the current threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often‐reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo‐TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo‐TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system, and then the bone marrow. Revisiting the definition for healthy B12 levels could promote earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline, especially in the elderly carrying increased risk for B12 malabsorption and insufficiency. A study on an aging population previously argued for a broadening of the reference range for B12 levels in elder people, and our results further support such a shift to account for age. The elderly population may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of declining B12 availability and may benefit from a change in guidelines for what is currently defined as healthy levels of vitamin B12.

The theoretical model we are proposing with this work is that inadequate amounts of vitamin B12 could induce neurological deficits at a threshold that is higher than the one in current use (Graphical abstract). Moreover, we should work on defining a cutoff for higher B12 and study how haptocorrin might be associated with or could induce neuro‐axonal damage. Accordingly, our current understanding of optimal serum B12 may have to be revisited to account for the clinical manifestations of B12 inadequacy at both ends of the spectrum.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^c1800516]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the current diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials). Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all current biomarkers make the combination of ≥ 2 test result abnormalities, such as cobalamin and MMA, the most reliable approach to diagnosing deficiency in the research setting; reliance on one test alone courts frequent misdiagnosis. Much work remains to be done.

### Elevated serum S-adenosylhomocysteine in cobalamin-deficient elderly and response to treatment [^99951eb5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methylation reactions produce S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the precursor of homocysteine, which has been associated with adverse events when it is elevated.

Objective

We studied a cohort of elderly with a high prevalence of cobalamin deficiency to determine whether SAH, SAM, or their ratio was abnormal; whether they correlated with other markers of vitamin deficiency; and whether they changed with cobalamin therapy.

Design

A convenience sample of elderly attending nutrition centers was enrolled for baseline demographic, biochemical, and nutritional assessments. Methylmalonic acid (MMA), total homocysteine, and other metabolites were measured by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum SAM and SAH were measured by using stable-isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Subjects found to have elevated serum MMA were treated with oral cyanocobalamin tablets (1000 microg/d) for 3 mo. Subjects with normal MMA were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dosage groups: 0, 25, or 100 microg cyanocobalamin/d.

Results

The 149 elderly subjects had a mean age of 76.3 y; 81% were female, and 30% were African American. Serum MMA concentrations were elevated in 30% and SAH concentrations were elevated in 64% of the cohort. Those with elevated MMA concentrations had higher SAH and SAM concentrations. High-dose oral cobalamin lowered SAH, MMA, and total homocysteine concentrations significantly, although subjects with creatinine concentrations > 109 umol/L had higher posttreatment SAH than did those with lower creatinine.

Conclusions

Elevated serum SAH concentrations are common in elderly and are strongly influenced by both renal status and cobalamin deficiency. These elevated concentrations can be lowered with high-dose oral cobalamin therapy.

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^8e412f37]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Reliable assessment methods — vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency and parenteral nutrition: Serum B12 interpretation is limited because plasma or serum values can be normal despite tissue deficiency and, in parenteral patients receiving daily B12 infusions, serum B12 levels are hard to interpret. For adults, the lower limit is 120–180 pmol/L or 170–250 pg/mL, with normal serum values 300–900 pg/mL. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) is the most sensitive and specific test; in established B12 deficiency or inadequate supplementation, MMA rises in 95%, whereas serum B12 is low (< 200 pg/mL) in only 69%. Elevated homocysteine and the FIGLU test occur in both B12 and folic acid deficiency and are not as specific as MMA for pinpointing B12 depletion.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

See Patient Counseling Information.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

The limited available data on NASCOBAL in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy.

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vitamin B12.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Vitamin B12is present in the milk of lactating women in concentrations which approximate the mother's vitamin B12blood level. Vitamin B12does not appear to pose more than a minimal risk to breastfeeding children.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of NASCOBAL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Avoid using the intravenous route. Use of this product intravenously will result in almost all of the vitamin being lost in the urine.

Pernicious Anemia

Parenteral vitamin B12is the recommended treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient's life. The oral form is not dependable. A dose of 100 mcg daily for 6 or 7 days should be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injection. If there is clinical improvement and if a reticulocyte response is observed, the same amount may be given on alternate days for seven doses, then every 3 to 4 days for another 2 to 3 weeks. By this time hematologic values should have become normal. This regimen should be followed by 100 mcg monthly for life. Folic acid should be administered concomitantly if needed.

Patients with Normal Intestinal Absorption

Where the oral route is not deemed adequate, initial treatment similar to that for patients with pernicious anemia may be indicated depending on the severity of the deficiency. Chronic treatment should be with an oral B12preparation. If other vitamin deficiencies are present, they should be treated.

Schilling Test

The flushing dose is 1000 mcg.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^1da91f1e]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is a form of anaemia that is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Finding the cure for pernicious anaemia even led to the discovery of vitamin B12. Nowadays, vitamin B12 deficiency is not only associated with (pernicious) anaemia, but is also linked with other conditions such as dementia, neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, individuals with low serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are frequently given vitamin B12 supplements. Also, since low serum vitamin B12 concentrations are very common in older individuals, screening older people for vitamin B12 deficiency has often been recommended.

Although the biological role of vitamin B12 in haematopoiesis is well-defined, the outcomes of some studies cast doubt on the relationship between low vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals. The association between low vitamin B12 and anaemia has become even more difficult to study because various cut-off values for serum vitamin B12 are used and serum concentrations of vitamin B12 appear not to be an accurate reflection of vitamin B12 status at the tissue level.

Therefore, in order to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older subjects, we performed a systematic review of relevant observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials that have been published in the medical literature to date.

### Age-related hearing loss, vitamin B12, and folate in the elderly [^6a508bb4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Determine the correlation between the hearing threshold and the serum levels of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folic acid among elderly subjects (> 60 years) with age-related hearing loss (ARHL).

Study Design

Cross-sectional.

Setting

Community.

Subjects and Methods

Subjects included elderly who were found apparently healthy following repeated examination by physicians. The pure tone average (PTA) for the speech and high frequencies, and the serum folate and cobalamin were determined and the correlation found.

Results

The mean ± SD values of serum folate among the subjects with normal PTA in the speech frequencies (0–30 dB) was 412.3 nmol/L ± 17.6 nmol/L, while among those with hearing loss (HL), it was 279.1 nmol/L ± 17.2 nmol/L (P = 0.01). In the high frequencies, the mean ± SD values among the subjects with normal PTA was 426.3 nmol/L ± 17.6 nmol/L, while among those with HL, it was 279.14 nmol/L ± 171.2 nmol/L. The serum cobalamin among the subjects with normal PTA within the speech frequencies was 49.7 pmol/L ± 9.4 pmol/L, while among those with speech-frequency HL, it was 42.6 pmol/L ± 10.2 pmol/L. However, for high frequencies, the mean ± SD values among the subjects with normal PTA was 47.4 pmol/L ± 7.3 pmol/L, while among those with HL, it was 41.3 pmol/L ± 9.2 pmol/L. Spearman's correlation revealed that low folate (correlation coefficient = -0.27, P = 0.01) and cyanocobalamin (correlation coefficient = -0.35, P = 0.02) were significantly associated with increasing hearing threshold in the high frequencies. After adjusting for age, serum folate (correlation coefficient = -0.01, P = 0.01) was significant, while vitamin B12 (correlation coefficient = -0.01, P = 0.74) was not.

Conclusion

Serum folate was significantly lower among elderly with ARHL. Trials on nutritional supplementation may substantiate the role of serum folate in ARHL.

Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) and weight loss: Vitamin B-12 has a very limited role in promoting weight loss, and there are no studies evaluating weight loss with vitamin B-12 injections, tablets, sublingual pills, or drinks. Conversely, B-12 deficiency has been associated with weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgical procedures, and can lead to permanent nerve damage if left untreated; no weight loss should be anticipated as a result of the use of exogenous vitamin B-12, injection site reaction might be anticipated if that route is chosen, and in patients with normal renal function a hypervitaminosis state is unlikely.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^46f44c9b]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Potential mechanisms

B12 in the blood is primarily protein-bound. Approximately 20% of circulating B12 is bound to holotranscobalamin (TC2) with the remainder to haptocorrin. TC2-bound B12 is the biologically active form as B12 bound to haptocorrin cannot be taken up into cells. A congenital form of megaloblastic anemia has been described in infants lacking TC2 despite normal total B12 levels. The kidney plays an important role in TC2 metabolism. TC2 is filtered at the glomerulus and is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by megalin. B12 is then returned to the blood bound to newly synthesized TC2. Thus, defects in protein reabsorption in the proximal tubule could lead to a loss of biologically active TC2 in the urine.

Increased TC2 and haptocorrin levels have been noted in patients with CKD. Despite this, there is decreased uptake of TC2 into cells. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in cellular homocysteine levels despite normal total B12. Thus, a functional B12 deficiency can occur in patients with CKD in the setting of increased TC2 losses in the urine, decreased TC2 absorption in the proximal tubule and decreased cellular uptake of TC2.

Another important consideration is the possibility that elevated B12 levels and B12 supplementation may be harmful in individuals with CKD. Cyanide metabolism is abnormal in individuals with CKD due to decreased clearance. Cyanocobalamin, the most commonly used form of B12 replacement is metabolized to active methylcobalamin releasing small amounts of cyanide. Under normal circumstances, methylcobalamin acts as a means of removing cyanide from the circulation through conversion to cyanocobalamin. However, in patients with CKD the reduced cyanide clearance prevents conversion of cyanocobalamin to the active form and therefore supplementation in this form is less effective at reducing homocysteine levels.

In fact, a recent randomized trial of cyanocobalamin administration found more rapid GFR decline and cardiovascular morbidity in the treatment arm. It was suggested that this may be related to increased synthesis of assymetric dimethylarginine which is known to inhibit nitric oxide. However, the data above suggest that in fact this finding may result from the use of cyanocobalamin rather than methylcobalamin in this population and that methylcobalamin should be preferred in individuals with CKD. Unfortunately, as we do not have data on vitamin supplementation, this is speculative and would warrant further investigation.

PRECAUTIONS:

General Precautions: Vitamin B12deficiency that is allowed to progress for longer than 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord. Doses of folic acid greater than 0.1 mg per day may result in hematologic remission in patients with vitamin B12deficiency. Neurologic manifestations will not be prevented with folic acid, and if not treated with vitamin B12, irreversible damage will result.

Doses of cyanocobalamin exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency. Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis.

Information for Patients: Patients with pernicious anemia should be informed that they will require monthly injections of vitamin B12for the remainder of their lives. Failure to do so will result in return of the anemia and in development of incapacitating and irreversible damage to the nerves of the spinal cord. Also, patients should be warned about the danger of taking folic acid in place of vitamin B12, because the former may prevent anemia but allow progression of subacute combined degeneration.

A vegetarian diet which contains no animal products (including milk products or eggs) does not supply any vitamin B12. Patients following such a diet, should be advised to take oral vitamin B12regularly. The need for vitamin B12is increased by pregnancy and lactation. Deficiency has been recognized in infants of vegetarian mothers who were breast fed, even though the mothers had no symptoms of deficiency at the time.

### Laboratory assessment of vitamin B12 status [^b837ca21]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and correction of vitamin B 12 (B 12) deficiency prevents megaloblastic anaemia and potentially irreversible neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. B 12 status is commonly estimated using the abundance of the vitamin in serum, with ∼148pmol/L (200ng/L) typically set as the threshold for diagnosing deficiency. Serum B 12 assays measure the sum of haptocorrin-bound and transcobalamin-bound (known as holotranscobalamin) B 12 It is only holotranscobalamin that is taken up by cells to meet metabolic demand. Although receiver operator characteristic curves show holotranscobalamin measurement to be a moderately more reliable marker of B 12 status than serum B 12, both assays have an indeterminate range. Biochemical evidence of metabolic abnormalities consistent with B 12 insufficiency is frequently detected despite an apparently sufficient abundance of the vitamin. Laboratory B 12 status markers that reflect cellular utilisation rather than abundance are available. Two forms of B 12 act as coenzymes for two different reactions. Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin for the remethylation of methionine from homocysteine. A homocysteine concentration > 20µmol/L may suggest B 12 deficiency in folate-replete patients. In the second B 12 -dependent reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase uses adenosylcobalamin to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In B 12 deficiency excess methylmalonyl-CoA is hydrolysed to methylmalonic acid. A serum concentration > 280nmol/L may suggest suboptimal status in young patients with normal renal function. No single laboratory marker is suitable for the assessment of B 12 status in all patients. Sequential assay selection algorithms or the combination of multiple markers into a single diagnostic indicator are both approaches that can be used to mitigate inherent limitations of each marker when used independently.

### The limited value of methylmalonic acid, homocysteine and holotranscobalamin in the diagnosis of early B12 deficiency [^040554e2]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of B12 deficiency is important to prevent progressive neurological and/or hematologic disease but requires a secure diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate second line tests of B12 status as prognostic indicators of a hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy. Forty-nine patients referred with low, serum vitamin B12 concentrations were treated with intramuscular B12 and re-assessed after 3 months. Methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, holotranscobalamin and neutrophil hypersegmentation index were measured before and after treatment. Before treatment 27/49 patients were anemic or macrocytic of whom 15 had a clear hematologic response. All the tests had a similar prognostic accuracy. Symptomatic improvement did not correlate with hematologic response. Supplementary tests of vitamin B12 status were not significantly better than total serum B12 concentration as predictors of a hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy.

PRECAUTIONS

General

The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.

Vitamin B12is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12could mask the true diagnosis.

Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.

Vitamin B12deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12may unmask this condition.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility have not been performed with hydroxocobalamin.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hydroxocobalamin. It is also not known whether hydroxocobalamin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hydroxocobalamin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Fewer US adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status based on the novel combined indicator of vitamin B12 status compared with individual, conventional markers, NHANES 1999–2004 [^060ea156]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) and/or total homocysteine (tHcy), as well as low serum vitamin B12 and/or holotranscobalamin (holoTC) are indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency. Combined indicators (cB12), which pool some or all 4 markers into an index, may be a more reliable diagnostic tool to overcome inconclusive diagnoses with individual markers.

Objectives

We aimed to describe different cB12 score combinations and estimate the prevalence of low or transitional vitamin B12 status compared with individual markers.

Design

Using cross-sectional data for B12, MMA, and tHcy in persons ≥ 20 y participating in NHANES 1999–2004 (n = 12,335), we examined raw and covariate-adjusted regression models to assess determinants of 3cB12 (all 3 markers) and combinations of 2cB12 (2 markers).

Results

3cB12 was significantly associated with B12 (Spearman r = 0.75), MMA (r = -0.70), and tHcy (r = -0.59). The 3cB12 reference interval (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) was -0.538 to 1.60. In covariate-adjusted models, we found no association of 3cB12 with age; adult females and users of B12 supplements had higher, while adults with advanced chronic kidney disease had lower 3cB12 levels regardless of race-Hispanic origin group (self-reported). Only 2.7% of adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status using the proposed cB12 cutoff of ≤ -0.5, while the prevalence of low (or low-normal) status depended on the selected individual marker and its cutoff: 2.2% and 13% for B12 < 148 and 148–222 pmol/L, respectively; 6.0% for MMA exceeding an age-specific cutoff (250–320 nmol/L); and 8.4% for tHcy > 13 µmol/L. The reference intervals for B12, MMA, and tHcy overlapped from the low (< -2.5) to the transitional (-2.5 to -0.5) and to the adequate (> -0.5) cB12 categories.

Conclusions

Vitamin B12 deficiency may be overestimated among US adults when individual, conventional markers are used. When only 2 markers are available, the combination of B12 and MMA provides results comparable to 3cB12.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^be9a16e6]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the United States, the cutoff value for B12 "deficiency" state is currently defined as below 148 pmol/L. This value was simply calculated as 3 standard deviations below the U.S. population average, independent of clinical observations. The American Society for Nutrition criticized this approach in 2010, arguing that more than 5% of patients who have a syndrome consistent with B12 deficiency and who respond to B12 supplementation have blood levels above that threshold. Other studies demonstrated that B‐vitamins supplementation was beneficial in people with clinical features of cobalamin deficiency, regardless of the measured levels in the blood. Selecting a cutoff value based on clinical observations would better reduce disparities in B12 deficiency diagnosis and management.

Cases of biochemical B12 deficiency wherein suboptimal B12 levels have been reported without overt clinical manifestation have been reported as subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD).SCCD is most prevalent in the elderly and is associated with greater WMH burden and cognitive decline over time. In this context of B12 insufficiency, age might act as a vulnerability factor, accentuating the deleterious effects of low B12. While defining a threshold for optimal B12 levels based on clinical findings is crucial to prevent SCCD, sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological changes have not yet been used. The recording of visual evoked potentials (VEP) is a validated and non‐invasive tool to assess myelin function in the visual pathway, but at the commencement of our study it had not yet been applied to a cohort of participants to study the effects of low B12.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^c8902d81]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Implementation considerations for folate and vitamin B12 in CKD — states that because absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor and normal gut function and the latter is often at least partially impaired in older individuals, assessment of serum vitamin B12 may be necessary if folate supplementation is considered, and that Vitamin B deficiencies may be identified by clinical signs and symptoms and assessment of serum vitamin B12 should be considered if folate supplementation is administered. The guideline notes that high folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurologic disease, and thus folate and vitamin B12 levels should be monitored if folate is being supplemented, and that suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (eg, RDA) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, including supplementation of folate, should be based on monitoring of severity of nutrient depletion, and individualization should include patient age because adults older than 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in this population. For monitoring and evaluation, serum/plasma/RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels should be assessed as appropriate.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^48d074a4]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although we did not find an association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people, this does not imply that patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption (with tissue depletion of vitamin B12 and very low vitamin B12 concentrations) will not benefit from vitamin B12 administration, especially since non-placebo-controlled studies showed (large) increases in haemoglobin concentrations or haematocrit after intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 administration in patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption. However, apart from the undisputed reality of pernicious anaemia, the clinical impact of a subnormal vitamin B12 level in older people is unclear, especially since several observational studies and randomized controlled trials also showed no effect of vitamin B12 administration on cognitive function.
