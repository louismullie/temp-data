## Question

Elevated tropinion suspect acs getting echo ok

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome who has an elevated troponin and a "normal" transthoracic echocardiogram, and what that echo result does and does not tell us about ACS risk and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the troponin kinetics and dynamic change. Next, I will review the ECG and symptom trajectory. After that, I need to interpret what a normal echo means in this setting. Then, I should risk stratify and decide on disposition and testing. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like type 2 MI, MINOCA, and myocarditis, and close with a practical decision framework and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because troponin alone is insufficient to diagnose ACS and must be interpreted with symptoms, risk factors, and the ECG. Importantly, troponin elevation is common outside ACS, so I need to ensure we are not overcalling MI in a low-pretest-probability patient [^115GygnK] [^114RSPeW]. I should double-check that the ECG was obtained within 10 minutes and that serial ECGs have been performed when suspicion persists, since early ischemic changes can be subtle or evolving and automated interpretations are imperfect [^112bG2YX] [^113ntLHp].

> Next, I should review the troponin kinetics carefully. A dynamic rise and/or fall strengthens the case for acute myocardial injury, whereas a stable, chronic elevation suggests non-ACS etiologies, and I need to ensure the assay-specific delta criteria are applied correctly to distinguish acute from chronic injury [^1165zqTu] [^115GygnK]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of elevation too; very high hs-cTn values at presentation, for example hs-cTnT above about 52 ng/L in some algorithms, push toward rule-in and urgent invasive evaluation, whereas small, nondynamic elevations are less specific for ACS and warrant caution before labeling type 1 MI [^1115aVg1] [^111zuiV9].

> I will now examine the ECG and symptom course. New ischemic ST-T changes or persistent, high-risk symptoms increase the likelihood of ACS even with a normal echo, and I should confirm whether there are dynamic ECG changes over time because that meaningfully ups risk and may mandate urgent angiography regardless of echo findings [^112bG2YX]. Hold on, I should verify that posterior leads were considered if the initial ECG is nondiagnostic but posterior MI is suspected, as missing posterior ischemia would be a key error here [^112bG2YX].

> Now, what does a "normal" transthoracic echocardiogram actually tell me in suspected ACS with elevated troponin? Let me think about this carefully, because I do not want to overstate its negative predictive value. A normal echo reduces the likelihood of a large, transmural infarction and mechanical complications, but it cannot exclude ACS, especially early NSTEMI or small-vessel ischemia, and it does not replace the need for serial troponins, ECGs, and risk-based decisions about angiography [^115dMu4T] [^115CEdFm]. Wait, I should double-check the data; in hospitalized patients with elevated troponin, the combination of peak troponin less than 2 ng/mL, no prior CAD, and no new wall motion abnormality yielded a 98% negative predictive value for ACS, but that triad is more restrictive than "echo normal" alone and should not be extrapolated to all-comers in the ED [^112JGd58]. I need to ensure I do not anchor on a normal echo and miss evolving ischemia or a type 2 MI pattern that would change management [^115GygnK].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and disposition. If the patient is high risk by clinical decision pathway or has dynamic ECG changes, ongoing pain, hemodynamic instability, or very high hs-cTn, I should not delay invasive coronary angiography despite a normal echo, because guidelines support urgent angiography in high-risk NSTE-ACS and echo is not a gatekeeper in that scenario [^112bG2YX] [^113fb6dS]. For intermediate-risk patients with elevated troponin and nondiagnostic ECG, I should confirm that cardiology consultation and inpatient observation with serial troponins and ECGs are appropriate, with angiography typically within 24 hours if the clinical picture remains concerning, again recognizing that a normal echo does not downgrade this risk category [^113fb6dS]. For low-risk patients in whom MI has been excluded, I should verify that routine stress testing prior to discharge is not recommended, and if used selectively, functional imaging has better diagnostic yield than exercise ECG in this group [^114tvaFc] [^115dMu4T].

> But wait, what if the troponin elevation reflects type 2 MI or non-ACS myocardial injury? I need to check for supply–demand mismatch drivers such as tachyarrhythmia, anemia, sepsis, hypotension, or hypertensive crisis, because in those cases the priority is to treat the precipitant rather than pursue antithrombotic therapy for type 1 MI, and a normal echo does not exclude type 2 MI when the clinical context fits [^115GygnK] [^116mRtBn]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not reflexively starting dual antiplatelet therapy and heparin in a type 2 MI without a thrombotic culprit, as that would be inappropriate and potentially harmful [^112W1ABT].

> I should also consider MINOCA if the angiogram is clean despite elevated troponin and ischemic symptoms. In that scenario, cardiac MRI becomes pivotal to distinguish myocarditis, takotsubo, or coronary microvascular dysfunction, and a normal echo does not obviate the need for CMR when the diagnosis remains unclear after angiography [^116EiDrY]. Let me reconsider whether we should escalate to CMR now; if the patient is stable and ACS has been reasonably excluded invasively, CMR is the next logical step to clarify etiology and guide therapy [^116EiDrY].

> For myocarditis mimics, I need to ensure we do not jump to conclusions with a normal echo. If there is a compatible viral prodrome, arrhythmia, or immunotherapy exposure, I should double-check for evolving ECG changes and rising troponin, and if suspicion is moderate to high, proceed with cardiology consultation and CMR rather than relying on a nondiagnostic echo [^113hZ4nV] [^112cJE1M]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said echo could exclude myocarditis; that would be incorrect, as early myocarditis can have preserved wall motion and CMR is far more sensitive for tissue-level inflammation [^113hZ4nV].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure nothing is missing. If echo is normal but there is a dynamic hs-cTn rise/fall, ischemic ECG evolution, or high-risk features, I should proceed to urgent invasive angiography because echo cannot exclude clinically significant ACS in this context; conversely, if echo is normal, troponin is only mildly elevated without dynamic change, ECG is nondiagnostic, and the patient is low to intermediate risk clinically, I should continue observation with serial biomarkers and ECGs, consider early cardiology input, and avoid premature discharge or overtesting, recognizing that a normal echo modestly lowers risk but is not definitive [^112bG2YX] [^113fb6dS]. I should double-check that any decision to defer angiography is justified by low-risk clinical features and nonischemic testing rather than by echo alone, to avoid a false sense of security [^115dMu4T].

> Finally, I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and secondary prevention are addressed. If ACS is excluded and the patient is discharged, I should confirm timely outpatient cardiology follow-up and risk factor modification. If type 2 MI or myocardial injury is diagnosed, I should treat the underlying precipitant and arrange close follow-up given the adverse prognosis of myocardial injury even without obstructive CAD, and I should document the diagnosis clearly to align expectations and care pathways [^116mRtBn] [^115GygnK]. Hold on, I should verify that the patient receives clear return precautions and that the plan for further testing, such as stress imaging or CMR, is explicit if the etiology remains uncertain after discharge [^115dMu4T].

A normal echocardiogram in a patient with elevated troponin and suspected ACS **does not exclude ACS** [^115dMu4T] because early or small infarcts may not cause detectable wall motion abnormalities [^notfound]. It does, however, reduce the likelihood of large infarction or mechanical complications and helps identify alternative diagnoses (e.g. pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure) [^115dMu4T]. Management should still follow ACS protocols: **serial high-sensitivity troponins, ECGs, and risk stratification** [^113ntLHp]; if ACS remains suspected, proceed to coronary angiography regardless of echo findings [^114uP7HV].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated troponin in suspected ACS

Elevated troponin indicates myocardial injury but **does not specify the cause** [^114grbem]; it is highly sensitive for ACS but not specific, as it can rise in non-ACS conditions (e.g. myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, renal dysfunction) [^114RtLDP] [^112W1ABT]. Thus, troponin elevation alone is insufficient to diagnose ACS; clinical context, ECG, and imaging are required [^115GV5Re].

---

## Role of echocardiography in suspected ACS

Echocardiography is a cornerstone in suspected ACS: it assesses ventricular function, wall motion, valvular disease, and pericardial effusion, and can reveal regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) that suggest ischemia or infarction [^115CEdFm]. However, **early or small infarcts may not cause detectable RWMA**, so a normal echo does not exclude ACS [^112JGd58].

---

## Limitations of echocardiography in ACS diagnosis

- **Temporal resolution**: RWMA may take hours to develop after infarction; early echoes can be falsely reassuring [^notfound].
- **Spatial resolution**: Small or subendocardial infarcts may be below detection limits.
- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with expertise and image quality [^115CEdFm].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, COPD, and poor acoustic windows limit visualization [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of a normal echocardiogram with elevated troponin

A normal echo with elevated troponin **does not exclude ACS**; it may indicate early or small infarction, or non-ACS myocardial injury (e.g. myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure) [^112JGd58]. It does, however, reduce the likelihood of large infarction or mechanical complications and may guide alternative diagnoses [^115dMu4T].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

1. **Serial high-sensitivity troponin measurements**: Confirm dynamic rise/fall consistent with acute myocardial injury [^113ntLHp]
2. **Serial 12-lead ECGs**: Detect evolving ischemia or infarction [^112bG2YX]
3. **Clinical risk stratification (e.g. TIMI, GRACE)**: Assess ACS risk and guide management [^114uP7HV]
4. **Coronary angiography**: Definitive assessment of coronary anatomy if ACS is suspected [^1175NKij]
5. **Additional imaging (e.g. cardiac MRI)**: Differentiate ACS from myocarditis or other non-ACS causes if angiography is normal [^116EiDrY]

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **ESC 2023 guidelines**: Recommend emergency TTE in suspected ACS with cardiogenic shock or mechanical complications, but not to exclude ACS in stable patients [^113uhbrQ].
- **ACC/AHA 2022**: Emphasize serial troponins, ECGs, and risk stratification; TTE is adjunctive, not definitive [^112bG2YX].
- **AHA/ACC/ASE 2021**: Use clinical decision pathways integrating troponin, ECG, and risk scores to guide testing and disposition [^114uP7HV].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Patients with elevated troponin and normal echo still have **increased risk of adverse events** compared with those with normal troponin, though lower than patients with RWMA. Prognosis depends on infarct size, coronary anatomy, and comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

A normal echocardiogram in suspected ACS with elevated troponin **does not exclude ACS** and should not delay appropriate management. Continue with serial troponins, ECGs, and risk stratification; if ACS remains suspected, proceed to coronary angiography. Use echo to assess complications and alternative diagnoses, but do not rely on it to exclude ACS [^115dMu4T].

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^115GV5Re]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The expanded ability to detect myocardial injury using very sensitive and specific biomarker assays has been a major factor in the evolution of the definition of acute myocardial infarction (MI). This is clearly evident in the 'Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction' recently developed by a joint task force of experts on behalf of the ESC, ACCF, AHA, and WHF (European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation). In a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischaemia, criteria are presented for defining acute MI that include a rise and/or fall in cardiac biomarkers together with symptoms of ischaemia, and/or appropriate ECG changes, and/or imaging evidence of a new regional wall motion abnormality or loss of myocardium. The task force developed a clinical classification of different types of MI that can be briefly summarized as:
TYPE 1: MI due to a spontaneous coronary atherosclerotic event.
TYPE 2: MI secondary to ischaemia, but not related to coronary atherosclerosis.
TYPE 3: Sudden death with symptoms or signs of ischaemia (not requiring elevated biomarker confirmation).
TYPE 4: MI associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (Subtype 4a), or stent thrombosis (Subtype 4b).
TYPE 5: MI associated with coronary bypass surgery.

This multi-component scheme appears to add complexity in an area that can be quite confounding because of the multiple terms used to describe myocardial ischaemia/infarction in all of its various manifestations. This includes differentiating myocardial damage associated with ST elevation (STEMI) from that occurring without ST elevation (non-STEMI). Patients with a sudden change in cardiac status are often admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but ACS is not included in the ICD-9-CM codes. Intermediate coronary syndrome (code 411.1), which includes impending infarction, preinfarction angina, or unstable angina, can be used as a substitute for ACS.

How the new definitions of MI become incorporated into future revisions of the ICD codes remains to be determined. Meanwhile, understanding the basis for this classification can help physicians struggling to assess clinical data and develop appropriate diagnoses for cardiac patients. A key concept incorporated into this scheme is that cardiac biomarkers must be interpreted in clinical context. This can be illustrated by considering a case example involving the common problem of interpreting cardiac biomarkers in patients hospitalized for serious non-cardiac diseases.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^114RT5Ut]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

In keeping with this reasoning, interventional cardiologists have opted to use the less sensitive CK-MB to define MI post-PCI. They define an MI as a complication of PCI when CK-MB increases three or more times normal. The task force has recommended (by arbitrary convention) that PCI-related MI (TYPE 4a) be defined by a biomarker elevation greater than three times its 99th URL, assuming a normal baseline value going into the procedure. They do not say which biomarker need be used to meet these criteria.

In either the case of PCI or CABG, the important differentiation is to distinguish an event severe enough to be considered as a complication, from relatively minor (expected) injury related to the procedure. If criteria appropriate for the clinical setting do not qualify for diagnosing MI, small abnormalities in cardiac biomarkers can be ignored. However, if criteria for MI are exceeded it could simply be termed 'PCI complicated by MI, or 'CABG complicated by MI' without the need for using specific subtype letters or numbers. If the problems of diagnosing patients who have suffered sudden death are considered a separate issue, this would greatly simplify incorporation of the new diagnostic scheme into ICD-9 codes.

The preferred terminology may require further debate, but the new scheme for the definition of MI provides an improved framework for assessing and documenting coronary ischaemia/infarct. No matter how the ICD-9 codes evolve, it makes clinical sense to clearly differentiate between troponin elevations that are chronic, vs. transient elevations associated with acute coronary events, vs. transient elevations associated with other myocardial stresses.

Making these distinctions clear may also help in our quest for ever improving therapy. Troponin elevations are quite common in intensive care unit patients such as the one presented above. –, The in-hospital complication rates for patients hospitalized for ACS are high, and patients who suffer acute MI during hospitalization for other problems differ substantially in their clinical course and outcomes compared with those who present initially with an acute coronary syndrome. The ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MIpromote an aggressive approach for treatment of non-ST elevation MI, but no recommendations are made for assessment and treatment of TYPE2 MI. This leaves the optimal treatment strategy for such patients quite uncertain. By providing a specific new diagnosis, it may be possible to encourage further research on how best to manage these patients, and perhaps help determine whether a troponin level should be measured in the first place.

### Acute coronary syndrome vs nonspecific troponin elevation… [^115UXhDD]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The aims of this study were to better characterize the differences between patients presenting with ACS and NTTE in terms of clinical predictors and outcome and to define the predictive value of a positive troponin result in various settings. These predictors can help the clinician to better estimate the posttest probability of ACS in patients with a positive troponin result and guide the appropriate treatment for these patients. Diagnostic criteria for thrombotic ACS were in accordance with the ESC/ACC guidelines and included a typical rise and fall of cardiac-specific enzyme levels and one of the following: typical ischemic symptoms; electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia; and evidence of significant coronary lesion on coronary angiography.

In cases of disagreement concerning the diagnosis, an opinion of 1 physician favoring the diagnosis of thrombotic ACS was sufficient to make this diagnosis. Cases with insufficient information, in which neither of the investigators could determine the diagnosis, were excluded from the final analysis. Our findings support the evidence that a slight elevation in troponin level is common in hospitalized patients within a large spectrum of clinical settings, especially in the critically ill patients. According to our assessment, over 40% of the patients in whom we found an elevated troponin T level did not have ACS. The PPV of an elevated troponin T level for the diagnosis of ACS was only 56%, and in patients with a level of 1. 0 ng/mL or lower, it was as low as 48%, which is undoubtedly not enough to rule in the diagnosis of MI. The high level of agreement on the diagnosis between the physicians reflects this adherence.

Our suggested algorithm for the diagnosis of ACS in the presence of a positive troponin test result obviously needs to be validated prospectively. In conclusion, an elevated troponin level is a relatively common finding in hospitalized patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of a coronary event. Although troponin elevation is an essential requirement for the diagnosis of MI, it is not a sufficient one. Our results can help rule out or rule in the diagnosis of ACS in the presence of an elevated troponin level after considering the suggested predictors, mainly age, renal function, and maximal troponin value. These predictors can increase diagnostic accuracy and guide the appropriate treatment.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^1165zqTu]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several strengths and limitations of our study. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial, enrolling consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome across 10 hospitals irrespective of age, sex, time of presentation and severity of illness. As such, we believe our results are generalizable and reflective of real-world clinical practice. Using all available clinical information, we reviewed and classified all patients according to the latest recommendations from the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction to ensure our findings are relevant to current practice. Where there was consensus amongst the adjudication panel that there was insufficient clinical information to make a definitive diagnosis, because of missing admission or discharge letters, we did not attempt to adjudicate the diagnosis (1245/10 360, 12%). We had access to all other information including past medical history, clinical investigations, management and outcomes, and provide data for all primary and secondary outcomes in this group within the data supplement. Our trial population was restricted to patients who had cardiac troponin measured for suspected acute coronary syndrome, and we acknowledge that the prevalence of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury may differ in consecutive patients where cardiac troponin was measured for any reason. Whilst we implemented the recommendations of the Third Universal Definition in our trial, as the Fourth Universal Definition provides no additional guidance on the investigation or treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, we think it is unlikely that outcomes would differ had this guideline been in place at the start of the trial. Whilst there was substantial overall agreement between adjudicators for the classification of myocardial injury and infarction, we recognize that agreement was only moderate for the classification of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury. In addition, we acknowledge that investigations and treatments were undertaken at the discretion of the treating clinician there is a risk of diagnostic misclassification. A formal comparison of the adjudicated diagnosis and ICD-10 coded clinical diagnosis is planned. Serial cardiac troponin measurements were only undertaken in 77% (6983/9115) of patients, which has particular relevance to the distinction between acute and chronic myocardial injury. Consequently, we considered both diagnoses as a single entity when comparing outcomes by study phase to avoid selection bias.

In conclusion, implementation of the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction identified patients at high risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular events, but was not associated with consistent increases in treatment or improved outcomes. Effective strategies for the investigation and treatment of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are required if we are to improve outcomes.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^115B1QtG]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Troponin testing in suspected myocardial ischemia — assay definition and variability states that elevated or abnormal troponin levels are defined as exceeding the 99th percentile cutoff point for each specific assay and highlights substantial variability across studies in troponin I versus T, high sensitivity versus standard conventional troponin, and bedside point-of-care versus lab-based testing.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) — initial emergency department (ED) evaluation of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should include an ECG that is "performed and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival at the ED", with review of any pre-hospital ECG; the initial ED ECG "should be examined for signs of ischemia… particularly for STEMI or a STEMI equivalent", which "identifies patients who should undergo immediate reperfusion therapy"; automated ECG algorithms may assist but accuracy "varies… with up to a 2-fold variation", and physician accuracy is also variable with "lower sensitivity for smaller degrees of ST-segment elevation"; if there is no ischemic ST-segment elevation, the ECG "should be examined for other changes… and, when present, these should prompt evaluation for emergent coronary angiography"; when new ST-segment or T-wave changes are suspected, "comparison with previous ECGs can be helpful", and "emergent consultation for expert over-read should be obtained" if criteria are unclear; "serial ECGs performed over short time intervals" and "ECGs performed later, even the next day", may reveal evolving ischemia; "a posterior ECG should be performed" when initial ECG is nondiagnostic but posterior MI is suspected; and "emergent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)… should be considered" when ECGs are concerning but not diagnostic of ischemia and infarction.

### Troponin: think before you request one [^111GQEke]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

Measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) has revolutionised the evaluation and management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Recent consensus statements endorse the use of cTnI or cTnT as the biomarker of choice for such application.

Elevated cTn values outside of ACS are not uncommon and reflect cardiomyocyte necrosis from a wide array of cardiac, pulmonary, and systemic diseases. A clinician must be familiar with the broad differential diagnosis of an elevated cTn to avoid false attribution of "acute myocardial infarction" (MI) in a patient without an ACS, thus reducing the burden of unnecessary work and admission rates for the hospital.

Another aspect of the problem is the financial impact of haphazardly testing in hospitals that are part of an NHS which is already struggling to keep up with its demands and supplies at present. Under observation it was noted that in most cases a troponin request was just a routine "tick box" practice that led to a lot of unnecessary processing. This then led to requesting these tests even before patient was assessed by a clinician.

It was also identified that troponin was often being used as a differentiating tool with the aim of providing a conclusion in the absence of an appropriate clinical history or examination that should be the mainstay in any clinical scenario. An improvement project specifically focusing on such potentially avoidable and otherwise quite useful investigations can be of great value for the hospital trust, as well as allowing the NHS to keep up with its aim of better quality with low costs.

### Hazards with ordering troponin in patients with low pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome [^114y1sHy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical practice, we progressively rely on biomarkers, without estimating the pretest probability. There is not enough support for the use of cardiac troponin (cTn) I in the management of noncardiac patients. We studied the rate at which this test was ordered, the prevalence of detection of a positive result in noncardiac patients, and the impact of this incidental finding on clinical management.

Methodology

Patients admitted from December 2011 to 2013 to our community hospital with diagnosis of noncardiac disease who had positive cTn were included. Data collected included final diagnosis, patient disposition, cardiac monitoring, cardiology consult, and cardiac biomarker testing.

Results

Cardiac troponin I was ordered for 1700 patients in our emergency department. Seven hundred fifty patients had a positive cTn. Of the 750 patients, 412 had a positive cTn without any clinical suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome. An incidental finding of a positive cTn leads to ordering of cTn on average 4 times during admission, cardiac monitoring of 379 (91.99%) patients for at least 1 day, and a cardiac consultation for 268 (63.65%) of these patients. None of these patients was candidates for an invasive cardiac intervention. Seventy-eight (19.17%) patients were admitted to the cardiac care unit and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit.

Conclusions

A positive cTn in patients diagnosed with a nonacute coronary syndrome was associated with increased cardiac biomarker testing, telemetry monitoring, and cardiology consults. This study supports adherence to national guidelines for the use of cTn, to reduce hospital cost and resource utilization.

### Role of multimodality imaging in evaluation of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 [^11343Atu]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The management of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be difficult due to the need for dedicated in-hospital pathways, protective measures for healthcare professionals and isolated beds of intensive care, particularly in areas overwhelmed by wide viral spread. Although pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a variety of cardiovascular complications have been reported. An integrated diagnostic algorithm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with suspected cardiac involvement (laboratory findings of myocardial injury and electrocardiographic changes) may help to avoid unnecessary examinations and minimize the risk of operator infection. Due to its mobility and bedside feasibility, echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique in this clinical setting. It quickly provides information on ventricular functions, pulmonary hypertension, valve disease and pericardial effusion. In case of ST-segment elevation (STE), urgent coronary angiography should be performed. Cardiac ultrasound helps distinguish between ischemic and non-ischemic myocardial disease and may detect pericardial disease. Transmural ischemic electrocardiographic changes, with or without early elevated troponin levels or echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, will determine the need for early invasive coronary angiography. Computed tomography (CT) through its multiple applications (chest CT; CT pulmonary angiography and coronary CT angiography; late iodine enhancement CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance might be helpful in reinforcing or redirecting diagnostic hypothesis emerged by other clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The current pandemic makes it challenging to perform serial invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing in COVID-19 patients and high serum troponin level. Nevertheless, thoughtful and systematic use of an appropriate multimodality imaging strategy is clinically relevant to detect cardiac injury and distinguish myocardial infarction from, myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome and pulmonary embolism.

### Acute coronary syndrome: biochemical strategies in the troponin era [^116y28cc]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

New biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins, have a major role to play for cost-effective management of individuals with acute chest pain and suspected coronary syndrome, and the laboratory is now poised to assume a vital role in assessing damage and determining prognosis. The redefined biochemical criterion proposed to classify acute coronary syndrome patients presenting with ischemic symptoms as patients with myocardial infarction is heavily predicated on an increased troponin concentration in blood. In an era of evidence-based medicine, we can no longer overlook the diagnostic and prognostic benefits provided by the measurement of these highly sensitive and specific proteins.

### Troponin: think before you request one [^113jCDgJ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Troponin is a very useful clinical marker to diagnose Acute myocardial infarction. However, it becomes positive in a number of non cardiac conditions. A positive result is only significant in the presence of an appropriate clinical history. A troponin should only be requested when a patient is suspected to have an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

It is a test that can easily be added on to the same routine sample of biochemistry if suspected later during clinical assessment. If this practice is followed appropriately for not only troponin requesting but also for other investigations then a good proportion of hospital admission workload can be reduced and valuable NHS money can be used alternatively.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^1168ajx7]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Algorithm for the initial investigation of patients with acute myocardial injury

We propose a simple decision framework for the initial investigation strategy to determine the aetiology of myocardial injury and identify those with coronary artery disease who may benefit from secondary prevention (figure 3).

Figure 3
Algorithm for the investigation of patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in the context of an alternative acute illness. Change in cardiac troponin concentration on serial measurement is used to identify patients with acute and chronic myocardial injury. The definition of change in cardiac troponin will be dependent on the assay and should be consistent with the local pathway for the assessment of patients with an isolated presentation with suspected acute coronary syndrome. CAD, coronary artery disease.

Patients presenting with isolated symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia should be assessed using established pathways for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (figure 4). Appropriate diagnostic and risk stratification thresholds will differ depending on the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay in use.

Figure 4
Pathway for the investigation of patients with isolated suspected acute coronary syndrome optimised for the ARCHITECT STAT high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay. Reproduced from Shah et al.

Those who develop symptoms and signs of myocardial ischaemia in the context of another acute illness should undergo serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing. Patients should be classified with either acute or chronic myocardial injury based on a change in cardiac troponin concentration, ideally using assay-specific absolute delta criteria. In the absence of these criteria, those with troponin concentrations ≤ 99th centile at presentation with an increase of > 50% of the 99th centile upper reference limit on serial testing (and at least one value > 99th centile) are considered to have acute myocardial injury. Where troponin concentrations are > 99th centile at presentation, a relative change of > 20% is consistent with acute injury. In patients who meet these criteria, careful clinical assessment is required to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease. There are no dedicated risk assessment tools for use in this setting, and therefore this assessment relies on clinical judgement, review of the presenting symptoms, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors and serial 12-lead electrocardiographic findings. There is an unmet need for novel risk prediction scores or validation of existing tools, such as the GRACE score, to guide clinicians when assessing patients with acute myocardial injury.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 in adults: myocarditis and other myocardial involvement, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and return to play: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113hZ4nV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and management of vaccine-associated myocarditis — diagnostics, triage, and initial therapy: Initial testing should include an electrocardiogram (ECG), measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn), and an echocardiogram; if myocarditis is suspected, cardiology consultation and further testing with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) should be performed, and evaluation for current (and potentially prior) SARS-CoV-2 infection is also recommended. Coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsy are rarely indicated unless a significant level of concern exists for flow-limiting coronary artery disease or specific forms of myocarditis. Patients with chest pain, an elevated cTn, abnormal electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and/or CMR findings, concerning arrhythmias, and/or hemodynamic instability should be hospitalized for close monitoring. For those with rapidly improving symptoms, a normal or improving cTn level, and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), anti-inflammatory medications may not be needed; however, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and corticosteroids should be considered in those with ongoing symptoms. In presentations analogous to fulminant myocarditis, intravenous corticosteroids, along with other forms of circulatory support, may be considered in those with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, worsening heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or hemodynamic instability; once clinically stable, guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure should be initiated with continuation at discharge, and strenuous physical activity should be avoided for 3–6 months.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a cohort study [^113jyGg7]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Suspected acute coronary syndrome is the commonest reason for emergency admission to hospital and is a large burden on health-care resources. Strategies to identify low-risk patients suitable for immediate discharge would have major benefits.

Methods

We did a prospective cohort study of 6304 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting to four secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland. We measured plasma troponin concentrations at presentation using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay. In derivation and validation cohorts, we evaluated the negative predictive value of a range of troponin concentrations for the primary outcome of index myocardial infarction, or subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01852123).

Findings

782 (16%) of 4870 patients in the derivation cohort had index myocardial infarction, with a further 32 (1%) re-presenting with myocardial infarction and 75 (2%) cardiac deaths at 30 days. In patients without myocardial infarction at presentation, troponin concentrations were less than 5 ng/L in 2311 (61%) of 3799 patients, with a negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI 99.3–99.8) for the primary outcome. The negative predictive value was consistent across groups stratified by age, sex, risk factors, and previous cardiovascular disease. In two independent validation cohorts, troponin concentrations were less than 5 ng/L in 594 (56%) of 1061 patients, with an overall negative predictive value of 99.4% (98.8–99.9). At 1 year, these patients had a lower risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac death than did those with a troponin concentration of 5 ng/L or more (0.6% vs 3.3%; adjusted hazard ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.21–0.80; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Low plasma troponin concentrations identify two-thirds of patients at very low risk of cardiac events who could be discharged from hospital. Implementation of this approach could substantially reduce hospital admissions and have major benefits for both patients and health-care providers.

### Incidence and 1-year prognostic of unstable angina after high-sensitivity troponin assessment [^112f6i97]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Unstable angina (UA) is defined as myocardial ischaemia at rest or with minimal effort in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury and necrosis. UA is usually considered as a separate entity with distinct characteristics from non‐ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and a different pathophysiology, with platelet thrombus predominating and no detectable myonecrosis. UA is diagnosed when there are new or worsening symptoms of ischaemia or when there is a change in symptoms, with or without ischaemic changes on the ECG and a non‐elevated (below the 99th percentile) high‐sensitive troponin (hs‐cTn) concentrations with cut‐off concentrations which are assay specifics. When hs‐cTn is negative, a third measurement at 3 h and an echocardiogram are proposed if there is a strong clinical suspicion of coronary pathology. UA may also be considered when hs‐cTn ≥ 99th percentile but mildly elevated and without significant rise between 2 dosages performed within 1 and 3 h after the first one. Among unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the introduction of ultrasensitive troponin measurement in place of standard troponin assays resulted in an increase in the sensitivity of detection of myocardial necrosis and a consequent decrease in the diagnosis of UA in favour to NSTEMI. The 2017 and the updated 2023 European guidelines for the management of NSTE‐ACS recommend an invasive strategy during hospital admission for NSTEMI whereas individual assessment is proposed for UA including delayed coronary angiography or a non‐invasive functional test depending on the clinical suspicion, without a precise strategy proposed. In terms of prognosis, numerous studies or registries showed lower 1‐year mortality, but a similar rate of non‐fatal infarction compared with NSTEMI, whereas numerous studies were performed before the use of hs‐cTn as a screening test and/or with absence of objective criteria for the diagnosis of UA. Indeed, previous studies showed heterogeneity of patients with the diagnostic of UA and those with normal angiography or non‐significant coronary stenosis may include patients with misdiagnosis.

This study aimed to prospectively evaluate clinical characteristics and 1 year prognostic of a contemporary population of patients with UA defined according to guidelines and associated with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) within a non‐selected population of patients admitted in the emergency department of cardiology for ACS.

### Pre-hospital transthoracic echocardiography for early identification of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^114gLrBN]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chest pain is in general the leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic measures and therapeutic interventions in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is caused by unstable angina pectoris, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The correct treatment of myocardial infarction requires early detection and prompt transport to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facility. Standard 12-lead echocardiography (ECG) can unequivocally detect only myocardial infarction with de novo left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ST-segment elevation, which account for approximately 35% of ACS cases. Other rather unspecific ECG changes like persistent or transient ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion can only be suggestive of NSTEMI. Patients with ACS without ST-segment elevation (NSTE-ACS) are routinely treated in a general emergency facility, and the diagnosis of NSTEMI is often delayed. The extent of the ischemic area may be the same, but the long-term prognosis of NSTEMI is worse than that of STEMI. Since patients with chest pain but without evidence of ST-segment elevation or de novo LBBB present such a heterogeneous group in terms of the etiology of the pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericardial effusions, etc.), a risk assessment and definitive diagnosis is required before initiating any more invasive therapy. Monitoring plasma levels of high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin as recommended in the 2011 and 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines has reduced the time to confirmation of NSTEMI to 1 hour. But high-risk or hemodynamically unstable NSTEMI patients would profit from an even more expedited diagnosis and consequent PCI, since this reduces mortality. In the 2011 ESC guidelines the echocardiographic examination of all patients with ACS has already been recommended to detect regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) or identify differential diagnosis. According to the fact that 12-lead ECG cannot confirm the diagnosis of NSTEMI, using pre-hospital TTE can help to detect NSTEMI on scene and thereby accelerate transportation of the patient to a primary PCI center.

### Evaluation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^111ta1ck]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Low concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I determined on presentation to the emergency department (ED) have been shown to have an excellent negative predictive value (NPV) for the identification of acute myocardial infarction. The sensitivity, and therefore clinical applicability, of such testing strategies is unknown.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic performance of low concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in patients with suspected cardiac chest pain and an electrocardiogram showing no ischemia as an indicator of acute myocardial infarction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A pooled analysis of 5 international (Australia, New Zealand, and England) prospective, observational cohort studies with blinded outcome assessment and 30-day follow-up was conducted. A total of 3155 patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia were included in the analysis. Eligible patients had a nonischemic electrocardiogram determined and high-sensitivity troponin I measured at presentation. The lower limit of detection (1.2 ng/L) as well as cutoff concentrations rounded to the nearest integer for a high-sensitivity troponin I assay were used in the analysis. Recruitment was undertaken from November 1, 2007, to August 10, 2013.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction occurring within 30 days of ED presentation, adjudicated with serial troponin testing. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients potentially suitable for early discharge at each cutoff concentration.

Results

Of the 3155 eligible patients, 1771 were male (56.1%), and mean (SD) age was 57.4 (13.3) years. Acute myocardial infarction developed in 291 individuals (9.2%). The 1.2-ng/L limit of detection gave a sensitivity of 99.0% (95% CI, 96.8%-99.7%) and an NPV of 99.5% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.9%). This cutoff level would allow for early discharge of 594 patients (18.8%). All higher rounded cutoff values had sensitivities less than 98.0%. Diagnostic performance of the limit of detection was maintained when patients were stratified by age, sex, risk factors, presence of coronary artery disease, and early presentation.

Conclusions and Relevance

High-sensitivity troponin I concentrations determined at presentation to the ED that were below the limit of detection identified 18.8% of patients potentially suitable for discharge, with a high sensitivity for acute myocardial infarction. Rounded cutoff values above the limit of detection may not have the required sensitivity for clinical implementation.

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponin measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. Use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and these assays provide strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure. However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity, and serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, is likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.

### Non-invasive imaging in coronary syndromes: recommendations of the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^115dMu4T]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Clinical role of imaging and current guidelines for acute coronary syndromes — Transthoracic echocardiography, using either fully equipped units or point-of-care ultrasound systems, should be available to all emergency rooms and should be performed and interpreted by trained expert operators, in all patients referred for chest pain, except in limited situations such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) where imaging would delay reperfusion. Bedside echocardiography is beneficial when complications are suspected or when an alternative diagnosis is considered, and alternative diagnoses include aortic dissection, pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, or right ventricular dilatation suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism. In patients with acute chest pain, European guidelines and American appropriate use criteria recognize the value of coronary CTA or functional testing as an alternative to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for those at very low or low risk for ACS, including patients with indeterminate ECG changes, negative troponins, and no recent chest pain; functional imaging in this situation has higher accuracy and is clearly favored over a stress ECG. This strategy is, however, not recommended in STEMI or NSTE-ACS with high-risk features, where prompt ICA should be pursued, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI and within 24 h for NSTE-ACS.

### Troponin elevation in coronary vs. non-coronary disease [^114af43e]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction is defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged myocardial ischaemia. Cardiac troponins (cTn) are the most sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury and with the new high-sensitivity troponin methods very minor damages on the heart muscle can be detected. However, elevated cTn levels indicate cardiac injury, but do not define the cause of the injury. Thus, cTn elevations are common in many disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the clinical work it may be difficult to interpret dynamic changes of troponin in conditions such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute perimyocarditis, Tako-tsubo, acute heart failure, and tachycardia. There are no guidelines to treat patients with elevated cTn levels and no coronary disease. The current strategy of treatment of patients with elevated troponin and non-acute coronary syndrome involves treating the underlying causes. The aim of this paper is to review data from studies of non-ACS patients with acutely elevated troponin who in clinical practice may be difficult to discriminate from ACS patients.

### The troponin complex: discriminating the signal from the noise [^116vWgTn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department with consideration of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are risk-stratified with sensitive troponin assays. Among many patients who present with symptoms other than chest pain, they are admitted for observation if the troponin assay is above the upper reference limit of that specific assay. With the advent of high-sensitivity troponin assays, it is estimated that the prevalence of admissions for secondary myocardial infarctions, termed type 2 myocardial infarctions and myocardial injury, will increase by 100%. This is a heterogeneous population, and although adverse outcomes such as readmission and death are high, outcome-based therapies with guideline-directed treatments have not been advanced in this subset. As such, the clinician is often confused about the optimal treatment at hospital discharge. More studies should address the value of specific known therapies in this cohort that have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with an acute coronary syndrome or type 1 myocardial infarction.

### Risk scores and coronary artery disease in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and intermediate cardiac troponin concentrations [^112MXexj]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current strategies to assess patients with the suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department primarily use high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and the ECG to rule in and rule out myocardial infarction. Early rule-out pathways have been developed to identify patients with low cardiac troponin concentrations who can be safely discharged from the emergency department without further testing and those with elevated concentrations who require admission for further assessment. However, one in four patients have intermediate cardiac troponin concentrations and while an acute coronary syndrome can be ruled out or ruled in with a second troponin measurement, they remain at higher risk of future adverse cardiac events. Similarly, serial testing pathways with cardiac troponin measurement at 0/1 and 0/2 hours stratify patients into three groups, including an observe zone group with intermediate concentrations. Guidelines recommend further investigation should be considered in these patients but the optimal approach to select these patients for cardiac imaging is unknown.

Clinical risk scores are widely used in the emergency department to risk stratify patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. However, the utility of these risk scores is uncertain, particularly following the widespread adoption of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin as a risk stratification tool. Derived from historical cohorts, risk scores may lack external validity when applied to contemporary practice, and some include elements of the history or clinician gestalt that may be subjective or vulnerable to bias. Nevertheless, recent guidelines continue to recommend the use of clinical risk scores to select patients with intermediate cardiac troponin concentrations for further testing.

In a secondary analysis of the PRECISE-CTCA study, we evaluate the performance of clinical risk scores to identify coronary artery disease in patients with intermediate cardiac troponin concentrations in whom myocardial infarction has been ruled out.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

High-risk or abnormal classification by clinical decision pathway (CDP) — the majority of patients classified as abnormal or high risk by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)-based CDPs will require hospital admission and/or cardiology consultation before discharge; patients should be classified per the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction (MI) as type 1 or 2 MI or acute or chronic myocardial injury, with type 1 MI patients admitted and managed per ACC/AHA STEMI and NSTEMI-ACS guidelines and close outpatient cardiology follow-up and referral to cardiac rehabilitation recommended on discharge; patients with type 2 MI or acute myocardial injury should be admitted by the most appropriate hospital team for treatment of the underlying precipitant, with outpatient cardiology follow-up recommended; for chronic myocardial injury, disposition should be individualized, these patients do not routinely require admission or cardiology consultation unless another indication exists, and additional outpatient transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with subsequent cardiology follow-up is recommended if no recent TTE.

False-positive burden and limited diagnostic yield of routine stress testing in low-risk or young patients are highlighted as follows: After initial rule-out, routine cardiac stress testing was reported to have a high false-positive rate with associated costs approximately 5 times that of negative results. In a HEART score cohort using a single troponin, the low-risk group had a 2.4% MACE rate and exercise stress testing did not identify any who had a MACE; across intermediate- and high-risk groups, 50% of stress tests in all groups combined were false positives. Several studies further noted a much higher false- than true-positive rate in patients younger than 40 years.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnostic evaluation [^1175NKij]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI), a subset of acute coronary syndrome, is damage to the cardiac muscle as evidenced by elevated cardiac troponin levels in the setting of acute ischemia. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Chest pain is a common presentation in patients with MI; however, there are multiple noncardiac causes of chest pain, and the diagnosis cannot always be made based on initial presentation. The assessment of a possible MI includes evaluation of risk factors and presenting signs and symptoms, rapid electrocardiography, and serum cardiac troponin measurements. A validated risk score, such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score, may also be useful. Electrocardiography should be performed within 10 minutes of presentation. ST elevation MI is diagnosed with ST segment elevation in two contiguous leads on electrocardiography. In the absence of ST segment elevation, non-ST elevation ACS can be diagnosed. An elevated cardiac troponin level is required for diagnosis, and an increase or decrease of at least 20% is consistent with MI. In some patients with negative electrocardiography findings and normal cardiac biomarkers, additional testing may further reduce the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization is the standard method for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but exercise treadmill testing, a stress myocardial perfusion study, stress echocardiography, and computed tomography are noninvasive alternatives.

### Identification of high-risk patients with acute coronary syndrome using point-of-care echocardiography in the ED [^115sQRAU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Stratifying risk of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the emergency department (ED) remains a frequent challenge. When ST-elevation criteria are absent, current recommendations rely upon insensitive and time-intensive methods such as the electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme testing. Here, we report on a series of cases, where emergency physicians used a simplified model for identifying regional wall motion abnormalities by point-of-care echocardiography in patients presenting with chest pain to the ED. With the use of a simplified model described herein, high-risk patients with ACS were identified rapidly in a cohort usually difficult to risk stratify.

### A review of causes and systemic approach to cardiac troponin elevation [^115BZZSC]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The first American College of Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology task force published recommendations for a universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) in 2000 based on the measurement of troponin (Tn). Although this rapid and highly sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of Tn elevation in absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. In 2007, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation task force proposed a new definition for acute MI based on detection of Tn and associated clinical evidence. The goal of this article is to review the universal definition of acute MI and to differentiate type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and non-acute coronary syndrome Tn elevations. The prognosis and a clinical approach to this differential diagnosis will be developed.

### Feasibility and accuracy of speckle tracking echocardiography in emergency department patients [^116vcSMt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a novel technology that measures regional wall-motion abnormalities that may speed diagnosis and intervention of acute coronary occlusion in Emergency Department (ED) patients with non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). STE provides an objective measurement of myocardial strain that is superior to visual assessment of wall motion when performed as part of a point-of-care (POC) echocardiogram. We determined the feasibility and preliminary accuracy of POC STE operated by emergency providers when compared to comprehensive echocardiography or final diagnosis of ACS.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 187 emergency provider POC echocardiograms with STE from 7/2014–5/2016 for suspected ACS at a large academic trauma center. Feasibility of POC STE was determined by calculating the percentage of complete exams (adequate apical 4-chamber and parasternal short axis views) out of all STE exams. We then used two different criterion standards for calculating diagnostic accuracy of STE: comprehensive echocardiograms with wall motion abnormalities or formal diagnosis of ACS based on elevated cardiac troponins, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery stenosis > 70% on catheterization.

Results

Of 187 STE studies performed, 75 (40%) were considered complete. Ultrasound-experienced providers had higher rates of complete exams (65% vs. 35%, P = 0.01). 16 of 75 exams (21%) were positive for myocardial strain, and of these 16 (100%) were admitted, 12 (75%) had positive troponins, 6 (46%) had positive comprehensive echocardiograms, and 3 (19%) had PCI or > 70% stenotic lesion on catheterization. Compared with comprehensive echocardiography, POC STE had 35% sensitivity, 70% specificity, 46% positive predictive value (PPV), and 59% negative predictive value (NPV). Compared with formal diagnosis of ACS, POC STE had 29% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 75% positive predictive value (PPV), and 51% negative predictive value (NPV).

Conclusion

STE is a potentially feasible adjunct to standard bedside echocardiography in ED patients with suspected ACS when operated by experienced ultrasound-trained physicians in the ED. This data shows STE performed by emergency providers is not yet sensitive enough alone to diagnose ACS, and has low accuracy when compared to comprehensive echocardiography. However, the PPV and specificity improve when performed by expert ultrasound-trained providers. STE should be considered for inclusion in the Emergency Ultrasound Fellowship curriculum.

### Increasingly sensitive assays for cardiac troponins: a review [^114grbem]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac troponins are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosis of myocardial infarction because of their high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury. However, acute and chronic conditions distinct from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) commonly lead to small elevations in troponin levels, with few data available regarding management of care for patients with such conditions. Recently developed highly sensitive troponin assays will likely lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of detectable troponin levels attributable to non-ACS conditions. Novel algorithms with highly sensitive assays, incorporating baseline troponin values and changes in values over 1 to 2 hours, may allow rapid exclusion of myocardial infarction and help to address specificity concerns but must be validated in appropriate target populations. Enhanced detection of very low troponin levels with highly sensitive assays has made feasible several potential new indications for troponin testing, including in the ambulatory setting, where assessment for low-level chronic myocardial injury may enhance risk stratification for heart failure and cardiac death.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1169mUSK]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing. These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians addresses key issues in the evaluation and management of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes. A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with acute cardiac symptoms, troponin elevation and culprit-free angiograms [^113qMc4B]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with acute cardiac symptoms, elevated cardiac troponin and culprit-free angiograms comprise a significant proportion of patients admitted with presumed acute coronary syndromes (ACS). International guidelines recommend that these patients receive lifelong secondary prevention under the presumption that angiographically undetectable coronary artery disease is the likeliest cause for their presentation. Recent studies using cardiac MRI suggest myocarditis to be the most common cause of these presentations. Emerging data also suggest that myocarditis presenting like an ACS may not be benign. In this article the current literature on patients presenting with acute cardiac symptoms, elevated cardiac troponins but culprit-free angiograms is reviewed, focusing on the diagnostic utility of cardiac MRI in this cohort, and the importance of diagnosing acute myocarditis. The development of higher sensitivity troponin assays will undoubtedly lead to an increase in the number of patients with presumed ACS but culprit free angiography. Robust management pathways including cardiac MRI are vital for cardiac centres dealing with these patients in order to achieve cost-effective, individualised patient care.

### Use and interpretation of cardiac troponins in the ED [^1135bcyK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins (cTn) are frequently assessed in patients presenting at the emergency department (ED) with chest pain and various diseases in which myocardial injury may be involved. Cardiac troponins are no longer only used for diagnostic investigations in acute coronary syndrome but may also provide valuable information regarding screening, prognosis, and risk stratification and help to guide therapeutic planning and ED dispositioning of patients with many different types of critical illnesses. Elevation of cTn is usually related to myocardial damage but is not synonymous with acute coronary syndrome. Other etiologies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with atypical symptoms and elevated cTn, as accurate diagnosis will affect both the initial treatment as well as the initial triage. A thorough knowledge of how to interpret the implications of elevated cTn will allow ED physicians to expand their list of differential diagnoses, facilitate risk stratification and ED disposition, and avoid potential iatrogenic complications resulting from inappropriate interventional therapies.

Acute coronary syndromes — initial in-hospital ECG and troponin recommendations specify that in patients with suspected ACS in whom the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, serial 12-lead ECGs should be performed to detect potential ischemic changes, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or clinical condition deteriorates; in patients with suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible, preferably using a high-sensitivity (hs-cTn) assay; and for an initial hs-cTn or cTn that is nondiagnostic, the recommended time intervals for repeat measurements after the initial sample collection (time zero) are 1 to 2 hours for hs-cTn and 3 to 6 hours for conventional cTn assays.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^111Knug7]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

An additional advantage of the new terminology should be realized in epidemiological applications. Biomarkers are often used to help predict prognosis, and most prognostic tools to predict long-term outcome post-MI focus on indices of acute myocardial damage, combined with presence/absence of well-established risk factors. In cases of TYPE 2 MI, the prognosis is most likely altered significantly by the nature and severity of the illness precipitating the biomarker elevation. As such, how biomarker data are used in prognostic algorithms will likely differ for TYPE 1 compared with TYPE 2 MI, and a clear distinction is needed.

When making the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI, the extreme sensitivity of troponin for detecting myocardial injury/infarction makes it imperative to place all results in clinical perspective. It is well recognized that troponin levels can be abnormal in the absence of symptoms, ECG changes, or any gross evidence of myocardial dysfunction or subsequent damage. Indeed, transient troponin elevations into the abnormal range can be detected in approximately one-quarter, to one-third, of athletes at the end of a marathon, with no evident functional consequences. However, unlike in the healthy athlete, even when biomarker elevations in seriously ill patients are relatively small, they cannot be ignored. Elevated troponin values can identify critically ill patients with a worse prognosis, – and this finding extends to vascular surgery patients who have perioperative troponin elevations. Indeed, prognosis may be worse for patients having troponin elevation without other evidence of MI compared with those with TYPE 1 MI.

### An emergency medicine approach to troponin elevation due to causes other than occlusion myocardial infarction [^111zidQy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Troponin is an integral component of the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, troponin may be elevated in conditions other than OMI.

Objective

This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with a focused evaluation of troponin elevation in patients with myocardial injury due to conditions other than OMI.

Discussion

ACS includes the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), which incorporates assessment for elevated troponin. Troponin I and T are the most common biomarkers used in assessment of myocardial injury and may be released with myocyte injury and necrosis, myocyte apoptosis and cell turnover, and oxygen supply demand mismatch. Troponin elevation is a reflection of myocardial injury, and many conditions associated with critical illness may result in troponin elevation. These include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Cardiac conditions include heart failure, dysrhythmia, and dissection, while non-cardiac causes include pulmonary embolism, sepsis, stroke, and many others. Clinicians should consider the clinical context, patient symptoms, electrocardiogram, and ultrasound in their assessment of the patient with troponin elevation. In most cases, elevated troponin is a marker for poor outcomes including increased rates of mortality.

Conclusions

Troponin can be elevated in many critical settings. The causes of troponin elevation include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Clinicians must consider the clinical context and other factors, as an inappropriate diagnosis of OMI may result in patient harm and misdiagnosis of another condition.

### Narrative review: alternative causes for elevated cardiac troponin levels when acute coronary syndromes are excluded [^112W1ABT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for the diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are largely based on an elevated troponin level. While this rapid and sensitive blood test is certainly valuable in the appropriate setting, its widespread use in a variety of clinical scenarios may lead to the detection of troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes. Many diseases, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, myocardial contusion, and renal failure, can be associated with an increase in troponin level. These elevations may arise from various causes other than thrombotic coronary artery occlusion. Given the lack of any supportive data at present, patients with nonthrombotic troponin elevation should not be treated with antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents. Rather, the underlying cause of the troponin elevation should be targeted. However, troponin elevation in the absence of thrombotic acute coronary syndromes still retains prognostic value. Thus, cardiac troponin elevations are common in numerous disease states and do not necessarily indicate the presence of a thrombotic acute coronary syndrome. While troponin is a sensitive biomarker to "rule out" non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, it is less useful to "rule in" this event because it may lack specificity for acute coronary syndromes.

There is no need for a second troponin assessment. The diagnosis of NSTEMI is made and appropriate treatment should be initiated. The positive predictive value for NSTEMI in patients with typical symptoms and a substantial (> 20 times the 99th percentile) elevation in cTn is > 90% (section 3.3.3). If the institution uses the ESC hs-cTn T 0h/1 h-algorithm, an initial hs-cTn T concentration above 52 ng/L allows triage of patients towards rule-in.

The next four scenarii highlight how to use the available different types of hs-cTn.

Q8. A 60-year-old patient without prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) presents to the emergency department with recurrent right-sided thoracic chest pain. The last chest pain episode started 5 h prior to hospital admission and is still ongoing. He is haemodynamically stable and the physical examination is normal. The 12-lead ECG is also normal. The initial hs-cTn T level is normal at 4 ng/L (ULN < 14 ng/L). The intern in the emergency department asks you as a cardiology consultant if this single very low hs-cTn T concentration allows the rule-out of NSTEMI.

General approach to risk stratification of suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) — when a noncardiac cause is obvious, "No cardiac testing required (Section 4.3) (1)". For an "Obvious nonischemic cardiac cause", perform "Other cardiac testing as needed". If ACS is being considered, actions include "Obtain troponin (1)" and "Use CDP to risk stratify (1)" (ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; CDP, clinical decision pathway; and ECG, electrocardiogram). Subsequent pathways include "No testing required (1)" or "Further diagnostic testing may be indicated", with "Moderate-severe abnormality" leading to "Invasive coronary angiography (1)".

Symptoms of myocardial ischemia — application of appropriate use criteria: For the clinical scenarios in this document, the AUC are intended to apply to patients who have the typical underlying pathology of an ACS, not simply an elevated troponin value in the absence of an appropriate clinical syndrome. The symptoms of an ACS may be described as both typical and atypical angina or symptoms felt to represent myocardial ischemia, such as exertional dyspnea, and are captured under the broad term ischemic symptoms. Although previous AUC used the Canadian Cardiovascular Society system for anginal classification, the broad spectrum of ischemic symptoms may limit patients' functional status and capturing the Canadian Cardiovascular Society status in practice may vary widely; therefore, the presence or absence of ischemic symptoms are presented without specific scale, and post-ACS symptoms may persist and/or be easily provoked with minimal activity.

### Myocardial injury in the era of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: a practical approach for clinicians [^115GygnK]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Traditionally, elevated troponin concentrations were synonymous with myocardial infarction. But with improvements in troponin assays, elevated concentrations without overt myocardial ischemia are now more common; this is referred to as myocardial injury. Physicians may be falsely reassured by the absence of myocardial ischemia; however, recent evidence suggests that myocardial injury is associated with even more detrimental outcomes. Accordingly, this article reviews the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, diagnostic evaluation, and management of myocardial injury.

Observations

Current epidemiological evidence suggests that myocardial injury without overt ischemia represents about 60% of cases of abnormal troponin concentrations when obtained for clinical indications, and 1 in 8 patients presenting to the hospital will have evidence of myocardial injury. Myocardial injury is a concerning prognosis; the 5-year mortality rate is approximately 70%, with a major adverse cardiovascular event rate of 30% in the same period. The differential diagnosis is broad and can be divided into acute and chronic precipitants. The initial workup involves an assessment for myocardial ischemia. If infarction is ruled out, further evaluation includes a detailed history, physical examination, laboratory testing, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, and (if there is no known history of structural or valvular heart disease) an echocardiogram. Unfortunately, no consensus exists on routine management of patients with myocardial injury. Identifying and treating the underlying precipitant is the most practical approach.

Conclusion and Relevance

Myocardial injury is the most common cause of abnormal troponin results, and its incidence will likely increase with an aging population, increasing prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, and greater sensitivity of troponin assays. Myocardial injury represents a challenge to clinicians; however, given its serious prognosis, it warrants a thorough evaluation of its underlying precipitant. Future strategies to prevent and/or manage myocardial injury are needed.

### Usefulness of contrast stress-echocardiography or exercise-electrocardiography to predict long-term acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting with chest pain without electrocardiographic abnormalities or 12-hour troponin elevation [^114jKE62]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients presenting to the hospital with a recent episode of chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischemia, nondiagnostic electrocardiographic findings, and normal 12-hour cardiac troponin levels remains a challenge for the clinician. We selected 1,081 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department during 2008 for a chest pain complaint of suspected cardiac origin without significant electrocardiographic abnormalities or troponin elevation. These patients underwent either contrast-enhanced stress-echocardiography with myocardial perfusion imaging or exercise-electrocardiography within 5 days of the index admission. We analyzed their 1-year cardiac outcome (i.e., unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac death). A post test likelihood of cardiac events was determined on the basis of the results of the provocative testing. Significantly better event-free survival (log-rank p < 0.0001) was found for both hard (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) and combined (acute coronary syndrome) end points in patients with normal contrast-enhanced stress-echocardiographic findings. However, this was not the case for patients in the exercise-electrocardiographic group, for whom event-free survival was not significantly different among the 3 possible result categories (normal, indeterminate, and abnormal test findings; log-rank p = NS). In conclusion, inducible ischemia detected by contrast-enhanced stress-echocardiography predicted the 1-year incidence of acute coronary syndrome (11.3% for positive vs 0.8% for negative results). However, this was not the case for exercise-electrocardiography, with a 2.7%, 2.3%, and 2.9% 1-year incidence of acute coronary syndromes for positive, negative, and indeterminate results, respectively.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^117AFCsq]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Despite these problems in clinical decision-making and patient management, this case illustrates the advantages to having the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI available. In discussing the Universal Definition for MI, the joint commission discussed the importance of also defining the extent or severity of the MI. Based on the relatively small rise in troponin and non-specific abnormalities on ECG, the amount of cardiac damage in this patient was felt to be small, and additional imaging studies to confirm that assessment were deferred. But the term TYPE 2 MI is still applicable, even though we may qualify the diagnosis using appropriate modifiers (such as possible or probable) with the recognition that the diagnosis may be confirmed, excluded, or further refined, depending on further studies.

The Diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI is advantageous not only for documentation purposes, but can also assist in quality review programs. Criteria for optimal care of acute MI often include measures such as time from onset of symptoms to first medical contact, time to first ECG, time from initial diagnosis to cardiac consultation, or time from diagnosis to lytic therapy, arrival in the catheterization lab, or reperfusion. Such measures are meaningless in patients such as the one presented here, and using an alternate diagnosis will prevent misclassification of the event.

### The prognostic value of high sensitivity troponin T 7 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome [^116YvseC]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The role of high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) in the convalescence phase after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is unknown. The authors aim to assess the prognostic utility of a single hs-TnT level at 7-week post-ACS. Second, the authors evaluated whether any serial changes in hs-TnT between the index admission and 7 weeks post-ACS had any link with the prognosis. Third, the authors assessed whether the prognostic utility of hs-TnT is independent of various echocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors measured hs-TnT levels in 326 consecutive patients at 7 weeks after an ACS event. The composite end point of death from any cause or acute myocardial infarction was evaluated over a median duration of 30 months.

Results

A high 7-week hs-TnT (> 14 ng/l) predicted adverse clinical outcomes independent of conventional risk factors, left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography (adjusted RR: 2.69 (95% CI 1.45 to 5.00)). Patients with persistent hs-TnT elevation at 7 weeks were also at an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those with an initial high hs-TnT which then normalised (unadjusted RR 3.39 (95% CI 2.02 to 5.68)).

Conclusion

The authors have demonstrated the prognostic utility of a single 7-week hs-TnT measurement in routine ACS patients and that it could be used to assist medium term risk stratification in this patient cohort. In addition, the authors also showed that hs-TnT predicted long-term adverse prognosis independent of various echo parameters. Future studies should evaluate whether tailoring specific treatment interventions to higher risk individuals as identified by an elevated hs-TnT during the convalescence phase of ACS would improve clinical outcomes.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: the challenges and opportunities [^114Swbqg]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods to improve the safety, accuracy and efficiency of assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary symptoms have occupied decades of study and have supported significant changes in clinical practice. Much of the progress is reliant on results of laboratory-based high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays that can detect low concentrations with high precision. Until recently, point-of-care (POC) platforms were unable to perform with similar analytical precision as laboratory-based assays, and recommendations for their use in accelerated assessment strategies for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome has been limited. As POC assays can provide troponin results within 20min, and can be used proximate to patient care, improvements in the efficiency of assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome is possible, particularly with new high-sensitivity assays.

### Contemporary point of care cardiac troponin testing in suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112pPb7p]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Around one million patients present to hospital with chest pain every year, accounting for approximately 5% of all emergency department attendances in the UK. However, only one in five patients are found to have had a myocardial infarction. Therefore, for several years, there has been a drive to develop diagnostic strategies which allow accurate identification of patients without myocardial infarction at an earlier stage, who may not require admission to hospital for serial cardiac biomarker testing. Such strategies have the potential to improve patient experience and optimise resource allocation both in the emergency department and in hospital, at a time of ever-increasing demands.

Cardiac troponin is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury, and international guidelines recommend concentrations are measured using a high-sensitivity assay. While high-sensitivity assays were first introduced in Europe in 2010, they have only recently become available for use in clinical practice in the USA. The higher precision and lower limits of detection afforded by these tests has facilitated the development of pathways which can rule out myocardial infarction at an earlier stage, the majority of which have demonstrated a magnitude of benefits in diagnostic accuracy compared with using the recommended diagnostic threshold (99th centile) alone. In practical terms, implementation of these approaches requires investment in infrastructure to deliver accurate and timely cardiac troponin results on a high-sensitivity platform which is not always available.

### The prognostic value of high sensitivity troponin T 7 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome [^112qeQ8Q]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study can be summarised as follows: First, during the convalescence phase (7 weeks) after an ACS event, hs-TnT further risk stratifies patients who are at risk of long-term cardiovascular events. Second, the prognostic utility of hs-TnT is independent of conventional cardiovascular factors and surpasses that of both BNP and echo LVSD. Third, we have demonstrated that patients who have persistent hs-TnT elevation at 7 weeks post-ACS were at a higher risk (threefold increase) of long-term cardiovascular events when compared with those in whom hs-TnT levels normalised at 7-weeks follow-up.

Two recent studies demonstrated the prognostic utility of an acute hs-TnT sample in patients presenting with ACS. In both studies, elevated hs-TnT sampled at the time of presentation predicted 1- and 4-year all-cause mortality. Our study extends this observation to establish the prognostic role of hs-TnT at 7 weeks post-ACS. Importantly, this is the first study to address the role of serial hs-TnT measurements in ACS patients. We found that patients who develop new hs-TnT elevation and those who have persistent hs-TnT levels at 7 weeks are at a very high risk of adverse clinical outcomes (figure 4). The former group was however too small in our study to attach much significance to. Conversely, patients with hs-TnT elevation during index admission which subsequently normalised at 7 weeks post-ACS had a low cardiovascular event rate on long-term follow-up. This latter group was quite substantial and represented 52% of our ACS cohort. These findings have important clinical implications for the care of patients with ACS. It demonstrates that hs-TnT has potential clinical application both during the acute phase and at 7 weeks in order to assess the longitudinal course after ACS, that is, a 7-week hs-TnT could redefine risk in those who had an elevated hs-TnT at the baseline ACS event. Our study is also consistent with the findings of deFilippi et al who found in a cohort of older community dwelling adults that changes in hs-TnT over time accurately predicted new onset HF and cardiovascular death.

### Use and misuse of cardiac troponins in clinical practice [^111oq5Sx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins are very sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. Elevated troponin levels in the setting of acute coronary syndrome are diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction and provide guidance to clinicians with regard to appropriate use of intensive medical and revascularization therapies. However, elevated troponin levels are commonly seen in several noncoronary ischemia presentations and create considerable confusion among clinicians in these settings. In this review article, we discuss the utility of troponins in various clinical settings and present a "common sense" approach to interpreting troponin elevation outside the setting of acute coronary syndrome.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: prospective cohort study [^111zuiV9]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

What is the optimal positive predictive value for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing in this setting? Most studies report a positive predictive value of between 45% and 65% (fig 3), but as yet no consensus exists on the optimal value. The ideal test would identify only those patients with myocardial infarction, but given that many causes of myocardial injury other than acute coronary syndrome exist, even with careful clinical assessment and selection of patients for testing, the positive predictive value is always going to be below 100%. In this context, a test that identified more patients with the condition than without might be acceptable. It is important that clinicians are aware of the predictive value of testing and use the results to inform subsequent investigations rather than starting treatment for myocardial infarction in all patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations.

Although a more selective approach to testing clearly improves the positive predictive value, could this potentially lead to clinicians missing patients with myocardial infarction? Among the 1054 unselected patients, a total of 17 patients had type 1 myocardial infarction and 13 patients had type 2 myocardial infarction. Of these 30 patients, five (two with type 1 myocardial infarction and three with type 2 myocardial infarction) did not have cardiac troponin requested by the attending clinician. Four patients were managed appropriately for their primary presenting condition without the need for troponin testing, and one patient was discharged with atypical chest pain in whom testing would have been informative (supplementary table H). Interestingly, the approach to testing does not influence the negative predictive value of our previously defined risk stratification threshold to rule out myocardial infarction at presentation. Across both the selected UK and US cohorts, the safety and efficacy of rule-out strategies using high sensitivity troponin assays remained comparable.

Although elevated cardiac troponin concentrations without acute coronary syndrome may be challenging to interpret, they convey potentially important clinical information. Nearly all of these patients were already recognised by their attending physician as being acutely unwell and were admitted to hospital. Cardiac troponin is a powerful prognostic marker in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, but no guidance exists on how to investigate these patients, including the role of cardiac monitoring, and as yet no evidence is available to suggest that cardiovascular treatments will improve outcomes. Further studies are now needed to systematically evaluate patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, to determine the underlying mechanisms, and to inform the optimal management of these patients.

### Novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^113VzSYL]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay can safely identify two-thirds of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome as low risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death in the emergency department. Diagnostic pathways that harness the potential of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing by incorporating cardiac troponin concentrations within the reference range to risk stratify patients miss fewer events than pathways that rely on the 99th centile to rule out myocardial infarction.

### Acute coronary syndrome vs nonspecific troponin elevationjamanetwork.com › journals › jamainternalmedicine › fullarticle… [^114RSPeW]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Results During the study period, 615 patients had elevated troponin T levels. Only 326 patients received a main diagnosis of ACS, while 254 had nonthrombotic troponin elevation; for 35 patients, the diagnosis was not conclusive. Positive predictors for the diagnosis of ACS were age between 40 and 70 years, history of hypertension or ischemic heart disease, normal renal function, and a troponin T level higher than 1. 0 ng/mL. Diagnostic criteria for thrombotic ACS were in accordance with the ESC/ACC guidelines and included a typical rise and fall of cardiac-specific enzyme levels and one of the following: typical ischemic symptoms; electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia; and evidence of significant coronary lesion on coronary angiography.

Unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of predictor variables for the diagnosis of ACS. Our findings support the evidence that a slight elevation in troponin level is common in hospitalized patients within a large spectrum of clinical settings, especially in the critically ill patients. According to our assessment, over 40% of the patients in whom we found an elevated troponin T level did not have ACS. The PPV of an elevated troponin T level for the diagnosis of ACS was only 56%, and in patients with a level of 1. 0 ng/mL or lower, it was as low as 48%, which is undoubtedly not enough to rule in the diagnosis of MI. The high level of agreement on the diagnosis between the physicians reflects this adherence. Our suggested algorithm for the diagnosis of ACS in the presence of a positive troponin test result obviously needs to be validated prospectively.

In conclusion, an elevated troponin level is a relatively common finding in hospitalized patients, even in the absence of clinical evidence of a coronary event. Although troponin elevation is an essential requirement for the diagnosis of MI, it is not a sufficient one. Our results can help rule out or rule in the diagnosis of ACS in the presence of an elevated troponin level after considering the suggested predictors, mainly age, renal function, and maximal troponin value. These predictors can increase diagnostic accuracy and guide the appropriate treatment.

### Troponin and other biomarker levels and outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19: derivation and validation of the HATCOVID-19 mortality risk score [^112yNbzn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare troponin with other biomarkers to assess its relative association with COVID‐associated mortality. Based on our findings, myocardial injury appears to be a common pathway through which COVID‐19 can lead to mortality. Whether myocardial injury is predominantly the proximate cause or simply a marker of COVID‐19‐associated mortality is unclear. The mechanisms of troponin elevation associated with COVID‐19 include microvascular injury, stress cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, hypoxia with supply–demand mismatch, systemic inflammatory response, and direct viral injury. 13 Although there have been case reports of COVID‐19‐associated myocarditis diagnosed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and endomyocardial biopsy, 14, 15 its incidence is unclear. Furthermore, while some patients with COVID‐19 with troponin elevation and ST‐segment elevation have obstructive coronary disease, a substantial proportion of these patients do not undergo coronary angiography. 16 In our study, only 2 patients underwent coronary angiography, with 1 patient undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization for ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. This suggests that in the vast majority of patients in our cohort who had troponin elevation, coronary angiography was not pursued because it was not felt that revascularization would result in significant clinical benefit. In our study cohort, among the patients who underwent echocardiographic imaging, there were no significant differences in the frequency of left or right ventricular dysfunction among patients with or without severe troponin elevation.

### Early noninvasive cardiac testing after emergency department evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome [^114n4ZHs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Professional guidelines recommend noninvasive cardiac testing (NIT) within 72 hours of an emergency department (ED) evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome. However, there is inexact evidence that this strategy reduces the risk of future death or acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of early NIT in reducing the risk of death or acute MI within 30 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, multicenter cohort study within the Kaiser Permanente Southern California integrated health care delivery system compared the effectiveness of early noninvasive cardiac testing vs no testing in patients with chest pain and in whom acute MI was ruled out who presented to an ED from January 2015 to December 2017. Patients were followed up for up to 30 days after emergency department discharge.

Exposures

Noninvasive cardiac testing performed within 3 days of an ED evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was composite risk of death or acute MI, within 30 days of an ED discharge.

Results

A total of 79 040 patients were evaluated in this study, of whom 57.7% were female. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 57 (16) years, and 16 164 patients (21%) had completed early NIT. The absolute risk of death or MI within 30 days was low (< 1%). Early NIT had the minor benefit of reducing the absolute composite risk of death or MI (0.4% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.3%]), and, separately, of death (0.2% [95% CI, -0.2% to -0.1%]), MI (-0.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to -0.1%]), and major adverse cardiac event (-0.5% [95% CI, -0.7% to -0.3%]). The number needed to treat was 250 to avoid 1 death or MI, 500 to avoid 1 death, 333 to avoid 1 MI, and 200 to avoid 1 major adverse cardiovascular event within 30 days. Subgroup analysis revealed a number needed to treat of 14 to avoid 1 death or MI in the subset of patients with elevated troponin.

Conclusions and Relevance

Early NIT was associated with a small decrease in the risk of death or MI in patients admitted to the ED with suspected acute coronary syndrome, but this clinical strategy may not be optimal for most patients given the large number needed to treat.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1131k1h6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome

The primary role for the troponin assay since its inception has been to diagnose patients with acute MI (AMI). While the improved sensitivity and specificity of troponin (over creatine kinase–MB) may have improved diagnostic accuracy for AMI in the emergency department and hospital, its shortcoming may be that, depending on the time between symptom onset and presentations, there is a delay of several hours in elevation of the biomarker. – This delay causes a delay in diagnosis and, thus, longer emergency department and observation stays both for patients with and those without AMI. New high‐sensitivity assays have overcome this weakness with their improved sensitivity, making the first low‐level elevations of troponin detectable within 90 to 180 minutes of the event. Two large prospective studies performed in the emergency department setting showed that the high‐sensitivity troponin assays are more accurate than previous assays in the successful diagnosis of AMI within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. – The increase in accuracy and speed could be beneficial in multiple ways. Patients are diagnosed more quickly and, as a result, may be treated more rapidly, including earlier invasive therapy. For the majority of patients, the improved assays will lead to a quicker rule‐out of MI. This may allow for more prompt subsequent evaluation and perhaps to earlier discharge of appropriate patients, decreasing further costs. However, there has not been adequate prospective evaluation of the use of these new assays in a diagnostic algorithm, and these assays may perform in a less‐specific manner in the general chest pain population outside of the strict criteria required to enter a randomized clinical trial. Also, the cost‐effectiveness of these new algorithms and strategies has not yet been established.

### Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^115RRtwR]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The term "acute coronary syndrome" encompasses a range of thrombotic coronary artery diseases, including unstable angina and both ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Diagnosis requires an electrocardiogram and a careful review for signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia. In acute coronary syndrome, common electrocardiographic abnormalities include T-wave tenting or inversion, ST-segment elevation or depression (including J-point elevation in multiple leads), and pathologic Q waves. Risk stratification allows appropriate referral of patients to a chest pain center or emergency department, where cardiac enzyme levels can be assessed. Most high-risk patients should be hospitalized. Intermediate-risk patients should undergo a structured evaluation, often in a chest pain unit. Many low-risk patients can be discharged with appropriate follow-up. Troponin T or I generally is the most sensitive determinant of acute coronary syndrome, although the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase also is used. Early markers of acute ischemia include myoglobin and creatine kinase-MB subforms (or isoforms), when available. In the future, advanced diagnostic modalities, such as myocardial perfusion imaging, may have a role in reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

### Early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^112jFgm9]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of acute chest pain has been augmented in recent years by advances in the sensitivity and precision of cardiac troponin assays, new biomarkers, improvements in imaging modalities, and release of new clinical decision algorithms. This progress has enabled physicians to diagnose or rule-out acute myocardial infarction earlier after the initial patient presentation, usually in emergency department settings, which may facilitate prompt initiation of evidence-based treatments, investigation of alternative diagnoses for chest pain, or discharge, and permit better utilization of healthcare resources. A non-trivial proportion of patients fall in an indeterminate category according to rule-out algorithms, and minimal evidence-based guidance exists for the optimal evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of these patients. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the ESC proposes approaches for the optimal application of early strategies in clinical practice to improve patient care following the review of recent advances in the early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The following specific 'indeterminate' patient categories were considered: (i) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin < 99th percentile; (ii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin < 99th percentile but above the limit of detection; (iii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile but without dynamic change; and (iv) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile and dynamic change but without coronary plaque rupture/erosion/dissection. Definitive evidence is currently lacking to manage these patients whose early diagnosis is 'indeterminate' and these areas of uncertainty should be assigned a high priority for research.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and clinical risk scores in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^113RKneU]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

There are several alternatives to the 2 rule-out pathways presented in this analysis. The ESC introduced 0- and 1-hour rule-out pathways in their 2015 guideline. This pathway has excellent diagnostic performance and has been validated in a number of settings, including a subgroup analysis of the present study. – However, the practicality of delivering presentation troponin results and obtaining serial testing at 1 hour may be challenging in many healthcare settings. Until point-of-care solutions facilitate rapid turnaround times with similar test characteristics to laboratory troponin assays, safe alternative pathways with serial testing at 2 or 3 hours are required. In such settings, we believe the ESC 3-hour pathway should be applied with a clinical risk score. Alternatively, the EDACS score alone provides excellent safety and efficacy when applied with a nonischemic ECG and serial cardiac troponin testing at 0 and 2 hours, as recommended by the authors.

Troponin assays in suspected ACS — test characteristics: In a secondary analysis of randomized controlled trial data at a single academic ED, there was no difference in test characteristics with cTnI or high-sensitivity troponin I, with 100% sensitivity and NPV for both; the analysis had a small sample size (N = 133).

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a cohort study [^111CU4z2]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Of the 2905 patients with troponin concentrations of less than 5 ng/L at presentation, only 12 had an adverse event, of whom ten had an index myocardial infarction with five having clear diagnostic evidence of myocardial ischaemia on the presenting electrocardiograph. Two further patients were in cardiac arrest at presentation and did not survive. We included all consecutive patients without selection to make our safety estimates conservative. However, most of these adverse events would have been identified at presentation and therefore these patients would probably not have been discharged from hospital. This finding also shows the importance of not applying this threshold in isolation and that all available information should be used for clinical decision making.

Our observations complement previous studies of the use of cardiac troponins to triage patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in emergency departments. The limit of detection and the limit of blank of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay both show promise for the assessment of patients at presentation. These studies were included in a systematic review and meta-analysisshowing that cardiac troponin T concentrations below the limit of detection had a false negative rate of 1.5% and identified 25% of patients as low risk. However, half of the studies used a contemporary troponin assay as a reference and would have missed smaller myocardial infarctions that could only be detected with a high-sensitivity assay, which will inflate the negative predictive value. In our analysis, we judged the final diagnosis using a high-sensitivity assay to ensure robust case ascertainment. Unlike previous studies of the cardiac troponin T assay, our analysis was the first to use a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay, which has greater precision and reproducibility at low concentrations and at the proposed threshold. This will ensure the application of this approach is consistent across sites, analysers, and reagent batches: a prerequisite for use in clinical practice. Furthermore, use of cardiac troponin I at our threshold identifies two-to-three-times more low-risk patients than do previous approaches, which would avoid the need for repeat testing in most patients, or the incorporation of clinical risk scores used in accelerated diagnostic pathways. Studies are needed assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of our approach in routine clinical practice.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I at presentation in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a cohort study [^11281iEs]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In more than 6000 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we have defined a cardiac troponin threshold at presentation that identifies almost two-thirds of patients as being at very low risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death, and who could potentially be safely discharged from the emergency department. Implementation of this approach would reduce avoidable hospital admission and have major benefits for both patients and health-care providers.

Our study has several strengths that distinguish it from previous studies. First, we prospectively identified all consecutive unselected patients presenting to both secondary and tertiary care hospitals, including patients admitted out of hours. As such, we believe our findings to be both representative and generalisable, and that this approach will be widely applicable across different health-care settings. Second, our study population exceeded the combined number of patients in a meta-analysis, which enabled us to analyse clinically important subgroups, such as patients who present early or have previous cardiovascular disease. Third, we have systematically assessed a range of troponin concentrations to identify a threshold that maximised the proportion of patients to be safely discharged. Finally, we used an assay with the necessary precision under routine laboratory conditions to report troponin concentrations at this threshold and to use this approach to guide patient care.

### Common causes of troponin elevations in the absence of acute myocardial infarction: incidence and clinical significance [^113MDYnL]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin is a preferred biomarker of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Unfortunately, elevation of troponin can be detected in a variety of conditions other than acute MI. This review focuses on the incidence and clinical significance of increased troponin in conditions commonly associated with troponin elevations, particularly in those that may resemble acute MI.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Rates of echocardiography, coronary angiography, and coronary intervention associated with troponin testing in hospitalized patients [^112hktK9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) often depends on detection of cardiac troponin elevation > 99th percentile. However, troponin elevation is commonly found in patients without AMI. We have previously reported an association between troponin elevation and rates of electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO), and coronary angiography (CAG) in patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis. We hypothesized that elevated troponin might be associated with greater use of ECHO and CAG in primary diagnoses other than sepsis and that this correlation might also include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We reviewed all inpatient admissions to nine hospitals in Texas in 2016 collecting primary International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (International Classification of Diseases-10) diagnoses, troponin test data, and the presence of ECHO, CAG, or PCI during hospitalization. We identified 56,895 unique inpatient admissions, of which 14,326 (25.2%) were associated with troponin testing. Of patients tested, 26.1% had one or more troponin I values ≥ 0.1ng/ml (99th percentile). Primary ICD-10 diagnoses were grouped into (1) AMI, (2) primary diagnosis other than AMI (non-AMI), (3) congestive heart failure (CHF), (4) sepsis, and (5) Other excluding AMI, CHF, or sepsis. Troponin testing was itself associated with greater utilization of ECHO, CAG, and PCI in all groups except CHF. Troponin I values ≥ 0.1ng/ml were associated with increased rates of ECHO, CAG, and PCI across all groups.

Figure 1
The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

As noted, the initial ACS assessment includes the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high‐sensitivity troponin trends. An ST elevation MI is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram, but patients with NSTE‐ACS should be divided into those with very high‐risk features and those without such very high‐risk features. Very high‐risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; recurrent or ongoing chest pain, refractory to medical management; acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia; life‐threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation; mechanical complications; or recurrent dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients with STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate (or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible), as do the NSTE‐ACS patients with very high‐risk features. For NSTE‐ACS without very high‐risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 h. The results of angiography determine the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Then warranted is the consideration of long‐term medical therapy and lifestyle measures, with an emphasis on smoking cessation.

### A single blood test to rule out acute coronary syndrome [^111qDqmt]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians should be confident that newer approaches using low concentrations of cardiac troponin are a magnitude safer than prior strategies using the 99th centile alone at presentation and 3 hours as recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Clinicians should be prepared to restructure the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in their institution to harness the potential of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing, and to improve the efficiency and safety of healthcare delivery.

A meta-analysis of single results below the limit of detection (< 5 ng/L) in patients with a nonischemic ECG reported across eleven studies and 2,825 patients a pooled sensitivity of MACE at 98%.

Diagnostic evaluation

At baseline, prior to initiating ICI therapy, it is suggested that a judicious combination of biomarkers (e.g. troponin I or T, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide [NT pro-BNP], total CK, fasting lipid profile, total CK and an electrocardiogram [ECG] be evaluated in all patients). Myocarditis is very rare but other potentially serious cardiac manifestations (life-threatening rhythm disturbances and acute coronary syndromes) are reported more commonly. Since the major indicator of suspicion for both myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome is elevated troponin, a fasting lipid profile serves as an important screening tool to distinguish between atherosclerosis-related troponin elevation and potential myocarditis. Two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D Echo) may also be warranted in high-risk patients with cardiac history, symptoms of dyspnea, or if initial tests are abnormal. Serial ECGs and cardiac biomarker testing should be considered, particularly in patients with abnormal baseline investigations or suspicious symptoms. There are no current recommendations for the appropriate time interval between tests. Patients who develop concerning symptoms while undergoing ICI therapy should have chest imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism, pneumonitis, or pulmonary edema, as well as an ECG; cardiac biomarkers done at baseline evaluation should be retested. A repeat 2D Echo should be considered in any patient who has significant dyspnea or abnormal cardiac safety screening tests.

When to refer

An accurate baseline CV risk assessment should be undertaken, including consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate, in any patient who has multiple CV risk factors or established CV disease at the onset of immune therapy. Immediate referral is warranted for any patient who develops abnormal cardiac test results during the course of ICI therapy. Since myocarditis can rapidly lead to death, patients with suspected or documented myocarditis should be admitted to the hospital for cardiac monitoring. Patients with confirmed myocarditis should receive emergent intervention with high dose corticosteroids, and immediate discontinuation of immunotherapy. Until data are available (e.g. cut-off levels of troponin) to determine when to start corticosteroids in patients with possible (as opposed to confirmed) myocarditis, this decision should be made on a case by case basis. The importance of active, ongoing consultation with a cardiologist to discuss the risk/benefit of continuing ICI therapy, starting steroids, or instituting other cardiac treatments, cannot be overstated.

### Troponins in acute coronary syndromes [^115zAaqw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins have replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Expert recommendations set the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population, which due to a lack of standardization, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I correlate with higher risk of death and recurrent ischemic events compared to patients with levels of troponin below the decision limit. Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. Moreover, patients with elevated levels of troponin derive the most benefit from more intense medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications, as well as an early invasive management strategy. Whereas cardiac troponins are extremely specific for myocardial necrosis, they do not discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Clinicians must, therefore, determine whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. Combining troponin with other cardiac biomarkers may offer complimentary information on the underlying pathobiology and prognosis in an individual patient. Future generations of troponin assays may detect specific posttranslational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the timing and mechanism of myocardial injury.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate, rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance will have to be accompanied by improved clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret the results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of MI(Table 3) was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation that provided increased structure and clarity around the diagnosis of MI in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 MI. It also allowed for diagnosis in the setting of sudden cardiac death, as well as enhanced categorization for periprocedural MIs. As sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false‐positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less of a problem. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in interpretation of positive troponin results has increased, given that there is a large differential diagnosis generated by a positive troponin assay (Figure).

### Reliable exclusion of acute coronary syndrome among hospitalized patients with elevated troponin [^112JGd58]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) occurs in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as well as various scenarios not associated with ACS.

Hypothesis

Simple clinical criteria can reliably exclude ACS among hospitalized patients with elevated cTnI.

Methods

Records for patients hospitalized from January to April 2011 with elevated cTnI (> 0.29 ng/dL) and an available echocardiogram were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were excluded. Based on available clinical data, patients were classified as having ACS or elevation of cTnI unrelated to ACS (non-ACS). Median follow-up was 365 days.

Results

Of 265 records meeting inclusion criteria, 82 (31%) had ACS and 183 (69%) had non-ACS. In multivariable analysis, odds ratios for non-ACS were 7.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8–15.3) for peak cTnI < 2 ng/dL, 6.3 (95% CI: 3.1–13.0) for absent wall-motion abnormality, and 4.4 (95% CI: 2.2–8.6) for no prior coronary artery disease history. The area under the receiver operating curve for amodel using these 3 variables was 0.86, with a 98% negative predictive value for excluding ACS. Patients who met these 3 criteria had no ACS-related deaths over 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Hospitalized patients with peak Tn level < 2 ng/dL, no prior history of coronary artery disease, and no new echocardiographic wall-motion abnormality appear to have a very low likelihood of ACS. Prospective validation of these results is needed to determine whether additional diagnostic testing could be safely avoided in hospitalized patients meeting these simple clinical criteria.

### High-sensitivity troponin and the application of risk stratification thresholds in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^11626o7J]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of risk stratification thresholds in diagnostic pathways has been evaluated in retrospective analyses of cohort studies, but have not been prospectively validated. Many approaches have been proposed, often in small cohorts of selected patients attending a single center, with a limited number of patients in high-risk subgroups. As such, there remains uncertainty as to the performance of these thresholds in practice, where patients are often older and more likely to have comorbidities. Our aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of an optimized risk stratification threshold with the limit of detection, in the patient population in whom risk stratification thresholds have been advocated by international guidelines. In a prespecified secondary and observational analysis of a multicenter trial of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluate diagnostic performance in patients presenting with at least 2 hours of symptoms by age and in subgroups to provide reliable estimates for clinical practice. In a substudy of the trial population, we explore the generalizability of this approach by evaluating performance of these risk stratification thresholds across different high-sensitivity assays.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in acute chest pain — bedside TTE can aid diagnosis by assessing left and right ventricular function, regional wall motion, valvular abnormalities, and pericardial effusion; high-risk patients, including those with elevated hs-cTn, should undergo a comprehensive TTE if no recent TTE has been performed; before a comprehensive study, a limited urgent bedside ultrasound to assess for regional wall motion abnormalities, ventricular dysfunction, valvular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion can provide valuable triage information in intermediate-risk patients or those with ECG changes suggestive but not diagnostic of ischemia; assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities should be interpreted by those with appropriate training and expertise.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Suspected myocardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection — evaluation pathway specifies that when suspicion for cardiac involvement is low, no further cardiac testing is generally recommended; when suspicion is moderate or high, initial testing should generally consist of an electrocardiogram (ECG), measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) preferably using a high-sensitivity assay, and an echocardiogram (transthoracic or point-of-care ultrasound), with closer monitoring warranted for hospitalized patients with an elevated cTn. In those with a rising cTn, ECG abnormalities concerning for myocarditis and/or echocardiographic abnormalities concerning for myocarditis, cardiology consultation is recommended, and the presence of normal left ventricular (LV) wall motion and/or other non-LV echocardiographic abnormalities should invite testing for other conditions, informed by the presentation. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is recommended if the patient is hemodynamically stable and, in symptomatic patients, CMR is the most sensitive method to exclude ischemia and preexisting cardiomyopathies while confirming cardiac changes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are demonstrable after 4 weeks. For those who are unstable or exhibit high-risk features, evaluation at an advanced heart failure center is recommended, and endomyocardial biopsy should be considered in those with clinical deterioration, particularly if heart block or ventricular arrhythmias are present once obstructive coronary artery disease has been excluded.

Study Population

High-STEACS (High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome) was a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial that evaluated the implementation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay in consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome across 10 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Scotland (URL: Unique identifier: NCT01852123). The study design has been described in detail previouslyand was conducted with the approval of the Scotland Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Individual patient consent was not sought. This approach ensured that consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome were included without selection bias. All patients presenting to emergency departments between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016, were screened by the attending clinician and prospectively included in the trial if cardiac troponin was requested for suspected acute coronary syndrome.

For this prespecified secondary and observational analysis, we evaluate the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in patients without evidence of myocardial injury at presentation (cardiac troponin concentrations below the sex-specific 99th centile), excluding those patients who presented early (≤ 2 hours from symptom onset to the initial blood draw), or those with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Substudy Population

To evaluate the generalizability of risk stratification thresholds we used stored samples from a substudy of the trial to compare the performance of different high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assays (Abbott ARCHITECT STAT and Siemens Atellica, Siemens Healthineers) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (Roche Elycsys, Roche Diagnostics). Participants provided informed consent for additional blood sampling and storage, as described previously. – The analysis population was defined in the substudy using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as for the trial population.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of emergency department patients with suspected Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes [^114tvaFc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Emergency department non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) after exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — testing and disposition: Level B recommendations state, "Do not routinely use further diagnostic testing (coronary CT angiography, stress testing, myocardial perfusion imaging) prior to discharge in low-risk patients in whom acute MI has been ruled out to reduce 30-day MACE". Level C recommendations state, "Arrange follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for low-risk patients in whom MI has been ruled out. If no follow-up is available, consider further testing or observation prior to discharge (Consensus recommendation)". Level A recommendations are "None specified". Context includes 2014 AHA/ACC guidance that "It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to have a treadmill ECG… or stress echocardiography before discharge or within 72 hours after discharge", and a randomized trial in which "all patients underwent 6-hour serial cardiac troponin T ruleout testing", showing 30-day major adverse cardiac events of "0.4%" with stress myocardial perfusion imaging versus "0.8%" with standard management (relative risk "0.50; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.00") and that imaging "did not significantly reduce 30-day MACE".

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) — key points on imaging state that non-invasive imaging is critical in the differential diagnosis of ACS and frequently requires multi-modality imaging, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the most useful imaging test in the diagnostic work-up of MINOCA and can detect or exclude other cardiac causes of troponin rise.

### Cardiac troponin level elevations not related to acute coronary syndromes [^11219eGm]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, cardiac troponins (cTn) have emerged as the preferred biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of myocardial injury. In conjunction with typical clinical findings of ischaemia, elevated cTn levels in blood confirm a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, neither cTnT or cTnI are exclusively released as a result of ischaemic myocardial cell necrosis, but also with numerous nonischaemic acute and chronic cardiac conditions, such as myopericarditis, toxic injury, or severe cardiac overload. With the advent of high-sensitivity assays, causes of cTn elevation not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become common findings in patients with chest pain and in those with acute or chronic systemic disorders. Elevated cTn levels in blood are associated with increased rates of cardiac events and mortality, independently of the underlying disease. However, the clinical conditions leading to cTn release in patients who do not have ACS, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these individuals, are largely unknown. Here, we provide an overview of the many causes and the prognostic importance of the release of cTn not related to ACS. We also recommend strategies to discriminate between ischaemic and nonischaemic cTn elevation, and describe the clinical evaluation of these patients.

### The prognostic value of high sensitivity troponin T 7 weeks after an acute coronary syndrome [^114KAAPF]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

There are two limitations worth mentioning in this study. First, due to the modest number of patients, we cannot deduce much about the subgroup of patients (n = 10) with new hs-TnT elevation at 7 weeks. The main implications of our study relate to those with either persistent hs-TnT elevation or a high/low pattern. Second, this study was conducted in the era when STEMI patients were thrombolysed and, therefore, revascularisation rates in the form of percutaneous coronary intervention are substantially lower than nowadays in Western countries. Nevertheless, this study reflects the real world and routine ACS patients rather than a clinical trial population.

In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time the prognostic utility of a single 7-week hs-TnT measurement in routine ACS patients which helps refine medium term risk stratification and medium term treatment strategies in this patient cohort. Future studies should evaluate whether tailoring specific treatment interventions to higher risk individuals as identified by an elevated hs-TnT during the convalescence phase of ACS would improve clinical outcomes.

Key messages

During the convalescence phase (7 weeks) after an ACS event, hs-TnT further risk stratifies patients who are at risk of long-term cardiovascular events.
The prognostic utility of hs-TnT is independent of conventional cardiovascular factors and surpasses that of both BNP and echo left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
We have demonstrated that patients who have persistent hs-TnT elevation at 7 weeks post ACS were at a higher risk (threefold increase) of long-term cardiovascular events when compared to those where hs-TnT levels normalised at 7-weeks follow-up.

European Society of Cardiology (ESC) diagnostic criteria for suspected myocarditis from noninvasive testing include: newly abnormal 12‑lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or Holter and/or stress testing; elevation in circulating cardiac troponin (cTn) with a time course similar to that of acute myocardial infarction or a prolonged and sustained release (weeks or months); new, otherwise unexplained left ventricular (LV) and/or right ventricular (RV) structure and function abnormality on cardiac imaging (echocardiography/ventriculogram/cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR]), including incidental findings in apparently asymptomatic patients; and new abnormal tissue characterization suggestive of inflammation by CMR. Mimics to consider include acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, idiopathic/genetic arrhythmias, noninflammatory nonischemic DCM/HF‑infiltrative cardiomyopathies such as cardiac amyloidosis, or hemochromatosis, and CMR with tissue characterization criteria is useful for differentiating myocarditis from ischemic injury.

Myocarditis subgroups

Patients were considered to have myocarditis if they met the criteria proposed in the position statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working group, displaying either symptomatic troponin elevation or troponin elevation with newly abnormal ECG or functional or structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging (cardiac echocardiogram and cardiac MRI), in the absence of angiographically-detected coronary artery disease or contributing cardiovascular history. Patients were categorized as 'severe' acute myocarditis if they displayed a grade 3–4 toxicity according to criteria adapted from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V.5.0(specific criteria are presented in the online supplemental table 1). Patients were categorized as exhibiting 'subclinical' myocarditis if they displayed a persistent low-grade troponin elevation not requiring hospitalization (grade 2 or less toxicity), in the absence of ischemic supply/demand mismatch etiologies, angiographically-detected coronary artery disease, contributing cardiovascular history or alternative causes. For more details on patient severity scoring and data abstraction, please see the Supplement online supplemental file 1.

Evaluation and treatment of suspected ICI-associated myocarditis were driven by the degree of troponin elevation and ECG changes. All patients were referred to cardio-oncology for consultation, and were assessed by repeat ECG, cardiac biomarkers including troponin, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), echocardiogram. Decision was made to follow as outpatient with repeat evaluation in 24 hours or for inpatient management. Patients with high probability of severe myocarditis (troponin > 5–10×upper limit of normal, low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome, ECG changes including atrioventricular (AV) block), received 1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously in the clinic, prior to transfer. Inpatient management included evaluation for acute coronary syndrome, cardiac MRI (CMR), and further steroid therapy. Once myocarditis was confirmed, intravenous steroids (typically 1 g of methylprednisolone daily) were continued for 3–5 days followed by conversion to a long-term oral steroid taper.
