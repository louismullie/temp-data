## Question

What electrolyte abnormalities would you see with high NGT output?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the electrolyte abnormalities seen with high nasogastric tube (NGT) output and how to manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of gastric fluid losses and the acid-base consequences. Then, I should verify the expected electrolyte pattern in serum and urine. Next, I will consider volume status and renal responses that perpetuate the abnormalities. After that, I need to check for additional contributors and complications. Finally, I will outline a practical monitoring and replacement strategy, including special situations and a concise summary of expected abnormalities.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. High NGT output represents loss of gastric hydrochloric acid and water, which removes hydrogen and chloride ions from the extracellular space and leaves bicarbonate behind, predisposing to metabolic alkalosis. This is the classic gastric alkalosis from nasogastric suction or vomiting, with an initial "alkaline tide" that becomes sustained when volume depletion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and impairs renal bicarbonate excretion [^112Chzru] [^111VQHs2].

> I will now examine the primary electrolyte pattern. Hypochloremia is expected because chloride is lost with hydrogen as HCl. Serum chloride typically falls below 95–100 mmol/L and may be even lower with prolonged losses, and this hypochloremia itself contributes to impaired renal bicarbonate excretion and maintenance of alkalosis [^112Chzru] [^111VQHs2]. Wait, let me verify the potassium piece: aldosterone-driven renal potassium wasting leads to hypokalemia, often in the 2.5–3.5 mmol/L range, and the combination of hypokalemia and hypochloremia sustains the alkalosis even after the cause resolves, so I should not overlook early potassium shifts and total body potassium deficits [^111VQHs2] [^112Chzru].

> Hold on, I should verify sodium balance carefully. Initially, I thought hyponatremia would be universal due to water and sodium losses, but wait, that is too simplistic. In practice, patients may be normonatremic or even hypernatremic if there is relative water loss exceeding sodium or if hypertonic fluids are used, so sodium status is variable and must be interpreted in the context of volume status and fluid prescriptions rather than assumed to be low. I need to ensure I do not anchor on hyponatremia without checking the clinical picture and intake/output records [^113Pv5do].

> Next, I should review the acid-base pattern. A non–anion gap metabolic alkalosis is expected due to bicarbonate generation and chloride loss, with serum bicarbonate commonly elevated above 28–30 mmol/L and pH above 7.45. The alkalosis is maintained by hypovolemia, hypochloremia, and potassium deficiency, which together impair renal bicarbonate excretion until these factors are corrected [^112Chzru] [^111VQHs2].

> Let me consider volume status and renal responses. Extracellular fluid contraction from gastric fluid loss reduces effective arterial blood volume, lowers GFR, and activates RAAS, which increases sodium and water reabsorption and promotes potassium and hydrogen secretion, thereby worsening hypokalemia and sustaining alkalosis; urine chloride is typically very low (< 10–15 mmol/L) in this hypochloremic, volume-contracted state, which is a useful clue to the pathophysiology [^111VQHs2] [^112Chzru].

> I should double-check for additional contributors and complications. Prolonged high NGT output can precipitate prerenal azotemia and acute kidney injury, and magnesium losses may be substantial, leading to hypomagnesemia that further complicates potassium repletion; in infants with pyloric stenosis, early NGT placement can exacerbate gastric losses and delay electrolyte correction, so I need to be cautious about iatrogenic amplification of losses and tailor replacement accordingly [^115HGBCj]. But wait, what if the patient is on diuretics or receiving acetate-containing fluids? Those can independently promote metabolic alkalosis and potassium wasting, so I should review medications and IV solutions to avoid inadvertently worsening the picture [^111VQHs2] [^115bXyd6].

> Next, I should review a practical monitoring and replacement strategy. I need to ensure frequent labs: electrolytes, bicarbonate, BUN/creatinine, and magnesium at least daily initially, with urine chloride helping distinguish chloride-responsive alkalosis; replacement should prioritize isotonic saline to restore volume and chloride, potassium chloride to correct hypokalemia, and magnesium sulfate if hypomagnesemia is present, because repleting magnesium improves potassium retention and facilitates correction of alkalosis [^113Pv5do] [^111VQHs2]. Hold on, I should verify fluid choices: avoid giving large volumes of hypotonic fluids early because they can worsen potassium losses and delay correction; once euvolemia is restored, chloride and potassium repletion will more reliably correct the alkalosis [^114K9YdH].

> I need to ensure I address special situations. In patients with high-output enterocutaneous fistulas or short bowel physiology, the electrolyte pattern may mirror high NGT losses but with even greater sodium, potassium, and magnesium deficits. Here, parenteral nutrition or dedicated electrolyte infusions are often required, and oral rehydration solutions with glucose and sodium can reduce secretory losses once the patient is stable and volume replete [^111dcL9H] [^114MqU7T]. Let me reconsider: if the NGT is being used for decompression in obstruction, I should also anticipate that ongoing losses will persist until the underlying cause is treated, so replacement must be dynamic and matched to measured output rather than fixed [^114K9YdH].

> To synthesize, the expected electrolyte abnormalities with high NGT output are hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and a non–anion gap metabolic alkalosis driven by gastric HCl loss and volume depletion, with sodium balance variable depending on total fluid losses and replacement. Magnesium deficiency is common and can perpetuate refractory hypokalemia, and persistent alkalosis reflects ongoing chloride and potassium deficits until corrected [^112Chzru] [^111VQHs2] [^111dcL9H]. I should confirm that management centers on isotonic saline and targeted potassium and magnesium repletion, with close monitoring of volume status, renal function, and acid-base parameters until the underlying cause of high NGT output is addressed and homeostasis is restored [^115kt22N] [^114K9YdH].

High nasogastric tube (NGT) output causes **hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis** from gastric HCl and K+ losses, with hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia also common [^112Chzru]. These abnormalities increase arrhythmia risk and can cause neuromuscular complications; **monitor electrolytes daily** and replace losses with isotonic saline and potassium chloride, adding magnesium and other electrolytes as needed [^113Pv5do] [^114K9YdH] [^115bFNEa]. Early recognition and correction prevent progression to renal failure and arrhythmias [^114wG3x7] [^116eZmH1].

## Pathophysiology of electrolyte abnormalities

High NGT output reflects loss of gastric secretions rich in HCl and potassium, leading to characteristic **electrolyte and acid-base disturbances**:

- **Hydrogen chloride (HCl) loss**: Gastric secretion of HCl leads to metabolic alkalosis when lost via NGT suction or vomiting [^112Chzru].
- **Potassium loss**: Gastric fluid contains ~10–15 mmol/L K+; sustained losses cause hypokalemia [^112Chzru].
- **Sodium and chloride loss**: Gastric fluid contains ~60–100 mmol/L Na+ and ~100–150 mmol/L Cl−; losses cause hyponatremia and hypochloremia [^112Chzru].
- **Volume depletion**: Fluid loss activates RAAS, increasing Na+ reabsorption and K+ excretion, worsening hypokalemia and alkalosis [^111VQHs2].

---

## Clinical consequences

These electrolyte abnormalities cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Cardiac complications**: Hypokalemia and alkalosis increase arrhythmia risk, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia [^notfound].
- **Neuromuscular complications**: Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia cause muscle weakness, cramps, and tetany [^notfound].
- **Renal complications**: Alkalosis and hypokalemia can cause renal tubular damage and acute kidney injury [^notfound].
- **Metabolic complications**: Persistent alkalosis impairs drug metabolism and worsens clinical outcomes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines for monitoring and management

### Monitoring

- **Electrolytes**: Check Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO3−, Mg2+, and Ca2+ daily initially, then every 2–3 days once stable [^notfound].
- **Acid-base status**: Monitor arterial blood gases or venous bicarbonate to track alkalosis [^112Chzru].
- **Renal function**: Track BUN and creatinine for AKI risk [^114K9YdH].
- **Volume status**: Assess clinically and with urine output to guide fluids [^114K9YdH].

---

### Management

- **Fluid replacement**: Use isotonic saline to correct volume and chloride deficits; avoid hypotonic fluids early due to hyponatremia risk [^116jTm1D].
- **Potassium replacement**: Give KCl IV or PO to correct hypokalemia; monitor for arrhythmias during repletion [^115bFNEa].
- **Magnesium replacement**: Correct hypomagnesemia to facilitate K+ repletion and reduce arrhythmias [^114wG3x7].
- **Acid-base correction**: Treat underlying cause and correct electrolytes; avoid bicarbonate unless severe acidosis coexists [^116y1Yuf].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involve gastroenterology, nephrology, and nutrition for complex cases [^111gmeou].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

High NGT output causes **hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia** from gastric HCl and K+ losses, with volume depletion amplifying RAAS-mediated K+ wasting. Daily electrolyte and acid-base monitoring, isotonic saline with KCl repletion, and correction of magnesium are essential to prevent arrhythmias and renal injury; **early, protocolized management** reduces complications and improves outcomes [^114K9YdH] [^112Chzru].

Epithelial trafficking and polarity defects

Diseases of epithelial trafficking and polarity defects are characterized by abnormalities in the structure and, thus, the function of enterocytes. These defects disrupt the normal function of the cellular membrane, intracellular organelles, transporters, and electrolyte channels. They lead to severely impaired absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and micronutrients. Patients present with an early onset severe high output diarrhea and almost universally require PN support. PN management is the cornerstone of nutritional therapy in these diseases, with a specific emphasis on complex and frequently challenging fluid and electrolyte management. Lifelong PN is needed in most patients; however, over time, in some cases, enteral nutrition can be introduced with the use of specialized formulas (Table 2). Partial PN dependency or enteral autonomy has been reported in some patients. The cause and mechanism of the improvements over time is not clear and requires further research.

### Akinetic crisis and withdrawal syndromes: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^11342T8Y]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In a first step, potential triggers of the akinetic crisis should be treated. Pneumonia or a urinary tract infection should be treated with antibiotics, abnormal electrolytes and blood sugar levels should be corrected, triggering medication such as neuroleptics and antiemetics should be discontinued. Second, supportive therapeutic measures as monitoring vital functions, fever-reducing medication, thrombosis prophylaxis and sufficient intravenous fluid administration should be ensured. Third, potential complications that impair the prognosis should be prevented such as rhabdomyolysis, aspiration pneumonia (19.2%), disseminated intravascular coagulation disorders (8.1%), acute renal failure (5.1%), thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, rare epileptic seizures, acute liver failure, acute cardiac decompensation (< 2%) or cardiac arrhythmias.

One of the most important pillars of therapy should be the resumption and adjustment of dopaminergic medication. In the case of pronounced dysphagia, parenteral routes of administration or the use of a nasogastric or PEG tubes are recommended to ensure effective medication delivery. Transient levodopa resistance must be taken into account, which should lead to adequate dose adjustment. Oral, soluble Levodopa preparations dissolved in water are most commonly used in the akinetic crisis. If dysphagia occurs, a nasogastric tube should be used for levodopa application at an early stage or a PEG tube that has already been inserted should be used. The interference of dopaminergic medication with gastroenteric nutrition must be taken into account, which can be prevented by predominant application of tube feeding at night and dopaminergic medication during the day, discontinuation of tube feeding 1 h before and after levodopa application or tube feeds with a lower protein content of 0.8 g/kg/day. In special, treatment-resistant cases, a nasogastric levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion can be considered. This alternative is particularly suitable if there is already an indication for PEG placement due to persistent, severe dysphagia or if LCIG therapy could also be useful after the acute crisis in the event of motor fluctuations. The newly released subcutaneous foslevodopa-carbidopa pump might be also considered, although there are no data yet available for the use in akinetic crisis. In addition to or as an alternative to levodopa, various dopamine agonists can be used in the treatment of akinetic crisis. Apomorphine can be administered via intermittent applications in the form of subcutaneous pen injections, continuously in the form of pump treatment or eventually sublingually as specific apomorphine strips. Apomorphine doses used in the literature are highly variable and range from 0.7 to 8 mg/h in the form of subcutaneous continuous infusion treatment and should be adjusted according to symptoms. Due to the frequent side effect of nausea, apomorphine should be combined with domperidone, which can also be administered rectally. The use of transdermal application of the non-ergot dopamine agonist rotigotine in akinetic crisis has been described in individual cases with a starting dose of 2 mg/24 h patch and fast increase to 6 mg/24 h within 4 days.

Intestinal continuity

The benefits of restoration of intestinal continuity by joining the small bowel remnant to the colon need to be considered. It provides a distinct advantage of increasing enteral tolerance by increasing the absorptive surface and prolonging transit time. It may also allow colonic adaptation to occur which will increase absorption of short-chain fatty acids which can potentially be an additional source of enteral calories. However, the disadvantage of continuity may be high stool output with watery diarrhoea which can be difficult to manage and cause perianal complications. Careful replacement of fluid and electrolytes is essential and some cases with high stool output (stoma output > 30 mL/kg, > 6 watery stools/day) may require antidiarrhoeal agents like loperamide or antisecretory agents, for example, proton pump inhibitors or clonidine. In children where the colon cannot be in continuity because of high output, the options are to keep the proximal small bowel loop drained with a nasojejunal tube until a definitive management plan has been formed, create a tube enterostomy or create a standard spouted stoma. A tube enterostomy is made by bringing the bowel to the surface of the abdominal wall and creating a small opening big enough to insert a tube the size of a Foley catheter. The advantage is that bowel length is not lost in creating a spout as in a traditional stoma, and in the event of reversal some length is preserved. With a tube enterostomy, it is also easier to control the output which is likely to be high and watery by spiggoting. This gives the option to 'expansion recycle' should lengthening be considered and also reduces loss of length in subsequent closure.

### Bowel preparation for elective procedures in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SdCEA]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the common requirement for bowel preparation in young people, the results of this review have highlighted a very poor evidence base. A mixture of clinical heterogeneity related to multiple agent regimens and methodological heterogeneity limiting the ability for meta-analysis has significantly limited synthesis. In multiple small analyses, PEG-ELS, senna, normal saline, sodium phosphate and sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate found no difference in adequacy of bowel preparation. This was similar across the remaining individual studies. As such, despite the significant weaknesses of the evidence base, it is worth noting that no difference in adequacy of bowel preparation has been reported in any included study. This was also the case with adverse events, although it must be noted these were reported in an extremely heterogeneous fashion, with individual minor, major and patient overall recording of events across studies.

Of note, there was a significant difference in favour of sodium picosulfate and magnesium citrate regarding tolerability, specifically the need for a nasogastric tube to complete the bowel preparation. This is a particularly interesting finding, as the primary studies highlighted that while tolerability of PEG was extremely poor, smaller volumes than planned appeared to have little impact on efficacy. This raises the question of the need for the nasogastric tube at all and so this may need further investigation in the future. Sodium picosulfate was also compared with bisacodyl and a phosphate enema in a single study with equivocal preparation, tolerability and safety reported.

PEG appeared to be the least tolerable agent across all studies, with a number of the patients requiring a nasogastric tube insertion, but this is from qualitative synthesis of individual studies, with this outcome reported in heterogeneous fashion so meta-analysis was not possible. Additionally, as the age ranges of included participants varied greatly, it is hard to make firm conclusions on this finding as the need for nasogastric tubes is likely to be very age dependent. Oral sodium phosphate was well tolerated in individual studies. Despite the satisfactory tolerability and safety profile of sodium phosphate, it should be noted that care must be taken when using this agent as it can cause significant electrolyte imbalances. As such, it should not be used in patients with deranged baseline electrolytes, suboptimal renal and hepatic function, as it poses a risk of acute kidney injury and phosphate nephropathy.

### Is discard better than return gastric residual aspirates: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112zkCjr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The potential advantages and disadvantages of discarding and returning residual gastric aspirates should be considered. Discarding aspirates may reduce the handling of feed delivery systems for medical staff and the risk of potential contamination, but it exposes staff to splash injury. However, whether discarding residual gastric aspirates reduces the level of gastric retention remains unclear. In the present meta-analysis, the result of the 48th hour residual volume indicate no difference in discarding and returning aspirates; the result is similar to that of the 7th day residual volume. Discarding residual gastric aspirates may result in insufficient nutritional supplement for the patient and higher risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbance. Meanwhile, returning residual gastric aspirates can improve the management of nutrition delivery and balance of fluid and electrolyte; however, this process is prone to higher risk of tube blockage and contamination. It's well-known that discarding the residual gastric aspirates can increase the risk of reducing energy intake, however, the very abnornal looking aspirates such as bloody, fecal or very bilious aspirates are virtually always discarded since it's a sign of gastric bleeding or intolerance. The present study did not found any difference between the return and discard intervention in terms of the average potassium level, the episodes of gastric emptying delay, and related adverse complications. The discard or return of residual gastric aspirates should be highly individualized and appropriately used after careful assessment of the potential benefits and risks of such therapy, considering specific short- and long-term goals.

### Is discard better than return gastric residual aspirates: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gqQiz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To return or discard gastric residual volume is an important question that warrants discrete verification. Gastric residues may increase the risk of tube blockage and infection, whereas discarding gastric residues may increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalance in patients. The three included RCTs indicated that the return of gastric residues provided more benefits on the balance of fluid and electrolyte but did not increase the gastric intolerance; these studies supported the return of gastric residues to improve the outcomes of critically ill adult patients. However, our synthesized results indicate no significant differences in the 48th hour residual volume, the average potassium level, the episodes of gastric emptying delay, the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and the episodes of vomiting and diarrhea for adult patients. Even when including a larger sample size, we still did not detect differences in the benefits of discarding and returning residual gastric aspirates, and the quality of evidence was generally moderate (Table 2). A previous systematic review and meta-analysis in Chinese patients included two RCTs; consistent with our present finding, this work did not provide evidence that returning gastric residual aspirates can effectively improve the management of gastric retention without increasing potential complications. Therefore, more rigorous, multi-center, large-sample RCTs are needed to validate the effects of discarding or returning residual gastric aspirates and provide solid evidence and guidance to clinical practice.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111VQHs2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Mineralocorticoid Excess and Metabolic Alkalosis

Almost all cases of metabolic alkalosis present with an excess of mineralocorticoids. Most represent RAS stimulation consequent to decreased intravascular volume, which encompasses conditions with either true vascular volume deficit (ie, vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or overuse of diuretics) or decreased effective vascular volume (ie, congestive heart failure). The other major category of metabolic alkalosis with increased mineralocorticoids encompasses patients with normal or expanded vascular volume such as in primary aldosteronism. The role of mineralocorticoid excess in the generation and or the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in volume-depleted or volume-expanded states will be discussed in the following sections.

Maintenance Phase of Metabolic Alkalosis in Volume-Depleted States

The maintenance phase of metabolic alkalosis in disease states associated with ECF volume contraction refers to a period after the generation phase where the initiating factors responsible for increased arterial pH and HCO₃⁻ concentration (vomiting or diuretic overuse) may have abated but the metabolic alkalosis persists. Factors that impair the elimination of excess serum HCO₃⁻ will prevent the correction of metabolic alkalosis. The most important among these factors are decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) consequent to volume contraction, hypochloremia, K⁺ deficiency, and steroid (aldosterone) excess. The role of these factors in the maintenance of gastric alkalosis and diuretic-induced alkalosis will be discussed in the following sections.

Decreased Kidney Perfusion

Both vomiting (or nasogastric suctioning) and chloruretic diuretic overuse are associated with ECF volume contraction consequent to the loss of Cl⁻-rich fluid in the stomach or kidney tubules, respectively, resulting in decreased kidney perfusion and GFR. The reduction in GFR reduces the amount of filtered HCO₃⁻, preventing effective removal of excess HCO₃⁻ from the blood compartment.

Hypochloremia

Almost all patients with metabolic alkalosis and vascular volume depletion display both hypochloremia and kidney hypoperfusion (low GFR). Low serum Cl⁻ directly results from the loss of Cl⁻ into the lumen of the stomach and kidney tubules. This interferes with renal HCO₃⁻ excretion via several mechanisms, one of which is the impairment of HCO₃⁻ secretion in B-intercalated cells via pendrin (Fig 5A), which is inactivated both due to the low luminal Cl⁻ concentration and the transcriptional downregulation consequent to K⁺ depletion (Fig 5B).

Gastric Alkalosis

Vomiting due to gastric outlet obstruction or nasogastric tube suctioning can lead to metabolic alkalosis consequent to the loss of gastric acid and fluid through the acid-producing activity of the parietal cell. Parietal cells secrete H⁺ along with Cl⁻ into the gastric lumen to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) needed for digestion as shown in Figure 3. The generation of intracellular H⁺ in parietal cells is coupled to the production of HCO₃⁻ facilitated by the CAII activity. The H⁺ is extruded into the gastric lumen via the gastric H⁺/K⁺-ATPase, whereas the HCO₃⁻ ion is transported to the blood predominantly via the basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ anion exchange protein 2 (AE2), "generating" base excess that is referred to as "alkaline tide". The secretion of H⁺ into the gastric lumen and transport of HCO₃⁻ to the blood is the initial step in both the physiologic digestion process and gastric fluid loss due to vomiting. The initial increase in serum HCO₃⁻ concentration will be short-lived as long so the individual remains euvolemic, normochloremic, and normokalemic. However, significant gastric fluid loss (as in nasogastric suctioning or severe vomiting) will result in extracellular fluid (ECF) contraction and hypochloremia due to the direct loss of HCl from the gastric lumen. In addition, the resulting volume depletion will activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thus generating hypokalemia consequent to enhanced renal K⁺ wasting. Together these factors are critical to the maintenance of metabolic alkalosis especially after the cause of the gastric fluid loss has ceased.

Short bowel syndrome

Short bowel syndrome is a condition where high output leads to water, sodium and often magnesium depletion. It occurs with a small bowel stoma, or fistula when output is greater than 1.5 litres over 24 hours. Detailed management is outside the remit of this document but involves looking for and treating other contributory factors to explain the high output. Management then includes use of oral rehydration solution, restriction of hypotonic fluids, use of loperamide and codeine to slow bowel transit, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce gastric secretions and bile sequestrants if the colon is in continuity. PERT and antibiotics to treat SIBO are also sometimes useful. It is a rare entity, often managed suboptimally, so nutrition-focused gastroenterologists and specialist dietitians should be involved.

Postoperative Care

Postoperatively, patients are monitored in a step-down unit for 3 to 4 days after surgery. In the early postoperative period, judicious use of intravenous fluids is prescribed due to the large fluid shifts associated with the extensive dissection of this procedure. The chest tube remains in place for 3 to 4 days predominantly to observe the character of the output and monitor for bleeding. It is removed after the patient has fatty foods to ensure the absence of chyle leak. Prophylactic antibiotics are continued until the chest tube is removed. Although a nasogastric tube is frequently used intraoperatively to aid in identifying the esophagus, it is removed before the completion of the procedure. Patients remain without orally consumed food and fluid for the first 24 hours and then the diet is slowly advanced as bowel function returns. Blood work is tested twice daily for the first few days. Electrolytes are actively replaced to limit the risk of atrial fibrillation. Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy is started immediately postoperatively and maintained for 6 weeks after surgery as an outpatient after hospital discharge.

### Enteral Clostridium difficile, an emerging cause for high-output ileostomy [^116eZmH1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The loss of fluid and electrolytes from a high-output ileostomy (> 1200 ml/day) can quickly result in dehydration and if not properly managed may cause acute renal failure. The management of a high-output ileostomy is based upon three principles: correction of electrolyte disturbance and fluid balance, pharmacological reduction of ileostomy output, and treatment of any underlying identifiable cause. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that Clostridium difficile may behave pathologically in the small intestine producing a spectrum of enteritis that mirrors the well-recognised colonic disease manifestation. Clinically this can range from high-output ileostomy to fulminant enteritis. This report describes two cases of high-output ileostomy associated with enteric C difficile infection and proposes that the management algorithm of a high-output ileostomy should include exclusion of small bowel C difficile.

### Study to determine the likely accuracy of pH testing to confirm nasogastric tube placement [^111BBYDA]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is recommended to provide nutrition and hydration to patients unable to swallow. Every year, approximately 790 000 adults and children in the UK require to be fed by NGT to avoid malnutrition and dehydration and to give essential medications. However, if the NGT is not positioned in the stomach or is dislodged in the oesophagus, nasopharynx or bronchial tract it can result in serious harm, including aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary haemorrhage, pneumothorax and death. The Department of Health in the UK has identified that deaths by NGT misplacement should be 'never events'. However, 3%–4% of NGTs are misplaced every year and the number of serious incidents reported has increased by more than 60% between 2014 and 2017, which calls into question current NGT testing methods.

Current healthcare guidelines recommend that the first-line test to confirm correct NGT placement prior to giving food or medications must be that the pH of an NGT aspirate is ≤ 5.5 (acidic). Nevertheless, false positive readings might occur if the tube is misplaced in the oesophagus or false negative readings (pH > 5.5) may occur in patients who secrete less gastric acid, because of antacid medications, achlorhydria or buffering by NGT feeds. Furthermore, aspirate may not be obtained immediately, which can lead to significant delays to feeding while waiting for a second-line test, most often a chest X-ray, to check the NGT position. Although, the chest X-ray is often regarded as the gold standard test, misinterpretation of X-rays has been reported as causing more cases of serious harm and death due to NGT misplacement than false pH readings (45% vs 8%). Furthermore, X-rays cannot be repeated very often without risking excessive radiation and they have cost and resource implications, and can result in significant delays to feeding. It has been suggested that modified NGTs with external magnetic, electromagnetic guidance systems or fibre-optic capabilities could be used to determine real-time NGT location and help prevent misplacement. However, these devices have yet to be implemented because they require expensive equipment and extensive training to interpret findings. Moreover, lung misplacements can still occur using these devices due to associated problems of malfunctioning, calibration and misinterpretation, therefore these methods are not recommended as stand-alone tests.

All patients receiving CAH should be regularly reassessed with regard to the continuation, amendment, or discontinuation of the relevant treatment. The objectives of reassessment are to (a) ensure the CAH is meeting the patient's hydration requirements (i.e. that the patient is not under- or over-hydrated), (b) ensure the CAH is well tolerated, (c) ensure the CAH remains acceptable to the patient, and (d) ensure the CAH remains appropriate/consistent with the "goals of care".

Patients receiving long-term CAH, and especially patients with ongoing GI fluid losses (i.e. vomiting, diarrhoea, high output stomas, small bowel fistulas), require regular biochemical monitoring to guide fluid and electrolyte replacement. Patients in the terminal phase do not require regular biochemical monitoring.

### A new technique of closing a gastroatmospheric fistula with a rectus abdominis muscle flap [^113jVwoy]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Proximal enteroatmospheric fistulae are difficult to manage and carry high mortality from sepsis and electrolyte imbalances. Conservative management with total parenteral nutrition, exclusion of fistula, resection and anastomosis are conventional methods of treatment with low success rate. Providing muscle cover to manage an enteroatmospheric fistula is a noble concept. A postoperative high-output gastroatmospheric fistula (GAF) was repaired by superior epigastric artery-based rectus abdominis muscle flap (RAMF). Postoperative recovery was uneventful. This technique may be useful for closure of proximal enteroatmospheric fistulae that fail to heal through medical and conventional surgical management.

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (Md gastroview) [^116wgMzL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Dehydration: Administration of hypertonic MD-Gastroview solutions may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension due to fluid loss from the intestine. A 1 in 4.6 (1:4.6) dilution of MD-Gastroview yields an approximately isotonic 16.5 percent diatrizoate salts solution; less dilute solutions are hypertonic and may lead to intraluminal movement of fluid with resulting hypovolemia. In young or debilitated children and in elderly cachectic persons, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state. If MD-Gastroview is used in infants and children (under 10 kg) or in dehydrated or debilitated patients, the solution must be prepared using the specific dilutions described in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In debilitated patients and in patients with electrolyte imbalances, postprocedural monitoring of hydration, serum osmolarity, electrolytes and clinical status is essential. In pediatric or severely debilitated patients, the maintenance of an open intravenous fluid line for rehydration may be advisable should hypotension or shock supervene. Electrolyte disturbances must be corrected prior to the administration of any hypertonic MD-Gastroview solutions.

Aspiration: Aspiration of MD-Gastroview into the trachea and airways may result in serious pulmonary complications including, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis or death. Bronchial entry of any orally administered contrast medium causes a copious osmotic effusion. Therefore, avoid use of MD-Gastroview in patients with esophagotracheal fistula and minimize risks for pulmonary aspiration in all patients. If MD-Gastroview is given by nasogastric tube, the position of the tube in the stomach must be verified before administration.

Anaphylactic Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of MD-Gastroview. Patients at increased risk include those with a history of a previous reaction to a contrast medium, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine, and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity (bronchial asthma, hay fever, and food allergies). Medical personnel trained in the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and the necessary drugs and medical equipment should always be readily available when MD-Gastroview is used.

### The need for pragmatic clinical trials in low and middle income settings-taking essential neonatal interventions delivered as part of inpatient care as an illustrative example [^114VWwvx]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Babies born preterm or small for gestational age often require ongoing, facility based care. Providing adequate fluid and nutrient intake is clearly important to short term survival and long term health and development, 'feeding' is therefore an essential intervention. But how do we provide optimal fluid and nutrient intake in LMIC? In high income settings the smallest babies who have the highest mortality risk are frequently only given intravenous fluids in the first days of life. This may be followed by very gradual introduction of enteral feeds over a period of days during which they also receive intravenous nutrition. In high income settings one nurse may be caring for 2 to 4 babies depending on their illness severity and monitoring of blood glucose, respiratory effort, oxygenation and wider assessment of clinical well-being are frequent, but the nurse ratios and ability to monitor are very different in LMIC settings. Is the evidence then relevant, given that the standard of care is likely to be much lower due to reduced staffing?

In the first days of life when fluids may have to be given intravenously there is uncertainty over which glucose infusion rate is optimal for preventing hypo or hyperglycaemia and uncertainty of the balance of risks and benefits from liberal or more restricted fluid intake in preterm infants. Key questions also remain over how best to introduce milk (enteral) feeds. Evidence from high income settings is sparse but suggests introducing milk feeds before the 4 th day of life and advancing feed volumes quickly each have no more risk than delaying their introduction or advancing feed volumes more slowly. If one starts feeds evidence provides little guidance for whether nasogastric tubes that may obstruct unassisted ventilation more than orogastric tubes or bolus or continuous feeding are advantageous. While these limitations of the existing evidence are relevant to all settings the context for providing nutritional support in many LMIC may be very different. Nurses care for many more babies, blood glucose testing may be impossible or performed very rarely, electrical monitoring of physiological status, electrically powered pumps to deliver low volumes of fluids accurately and intravenous nutrition are all absent. The latter aspects in particular raise major questions. Is it better to initiate feeds immediately after birth and rapidly escalate volumes, potentially risking respiratory deterioration or necrotizing enterocolitis, or delay and provide inadequate calorie intake because intravenous nutrition is not available? Is it safe to give intravenous fluids at all when only adult fluid giving sets are available that make accurate regulation of infused volumes to preterm babies extremely difficult, especially when nurses are so few?

### Dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (dextrose in lactated Ringer's) [^114MVDgi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolytes losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

The osmolarity of 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer's Injection is 530 mOsmol/liter (calc). Administration of substantially hypertonic solutions may cause venous irritation, including phlebitis.

Solutions containing calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease. Parenteral calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Solutions containing lactate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

The conversion of lactate to bicarbonate is markedly delayed in the presence of tissue anoxia and reduced capacity of the liver to metabolize lactate. This may occur under conditions such as metabolic acidosis associated with circulatory insufficiency, extracorporeal circulation, hypothermia, glycogen storage disease, liver dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis, shock or cardiac decompensation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series in order to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (greater than 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

### Prolonged brackish water exposure: a case report [^116i9sQu]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure to and consumption of brackish water are associated with an elevated risk of infection, hypernatremia, and hypothermia. Minimal data exist to support the diagnosis and treatment of patients with long-term brackish water exposure. We present a case of a patient who spent 5 to 10 d semisubmerged in the Elizabeth River in coastal Virginia. A 55-y-old male presented via ambulance after 5 to 10 d of being "stuck in the mud". He was hypernatremic, with a sodium of 176 mEq·L -1, hypothermic to 34.5°C (94.1°F), and hypotensive at 88/50 mm Hg, with a sodium concentration of 176 mEq·L -1 and an osmolality of 412 mosm·kg -1. He developed pneumonia, with respiratory cultures growing Vibrio parahemolyticus, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Shewanella algae. He had pustules, which grew Aeromonas hydrophilia and Aeromonas caviae. A nasogastric tube was placed. Using suction, 500 mL of coarse sand and gravel was removed from his stomach. Antibiotics and intravenous fluids were given. The patient fully recovered after 3 wk and was discharged to rehabilitation. Exposure to brackish water can present a unique set of infectious and metabolic complications. Initial care should include treatment of metabolic derangements, such as hypovolemia, hypernatremia, and hypothermia, and treatment of infections with antibiotics based on knowledge of the most likely causative organisms.

### Effect of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance fluid therapy on urine output, fluid balance, and electrolyte homeostasis: a crossover study in fasting adult volunteers [^116jTm1D]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Editor's key points

The physiological response to i.v. fluid therapy composition (tonicity, electrolytes, osmoles) and volume will determine risk of fluid overload.
Daily administration of several litres of commonly used i.v. crystalloid fluids will lead to electrolyte–salt overload in surgical patients.
This study found that an isotonic crystalloid fluid was associated with less urine output when compared with a hypotonic fluid.
More care should be used when prescribing perioperative fluid therapy; this is crucially important when larger volumes are administered over more than 24 h.

Maintenance i.v. fluid solutions are prescribed to cover the daily need for water and electrolytes in patients who are unable to ingest food or fluids. Ideally, they also contain dextrose or glucose to prevent starvation ketosis while awaiting full (par)enteral nutrition. Although maintenance fluids are used daily in hospitals worldwide, the scientific evidence guiding clinical practice is strikingly limited. Current guidelines are based on older dietary reference values, which by their very nature concern only oral intake. Our understanding of the human organism's response to the tonicity of correctly dosed i.v. maintenance fluids remains an educated guess based on older physiological experiments. Previous studies showed that a large volume of isotonic fluid administered rapidly is excreted more slowly than an equal amount of a hypotonic solution. However, it remains unclear whether the tonicity of maintenance fluids could be a separate contributor to fluid overload and altered electrolyte concentrations. The scarce data on prescription practices demonstrate the frequent use of isotonic solutions, ignoring available guidelines.

Important paediatric research emphasized the protective effect of isotonic maintenance solutions against hyponatraemia-induced morbidity compared with hypotonic solutions prescribed using the classical Holliday and Segar formula. Yet this use of isotonic fluids remains contested, even among paediatricians, some of whom have called for improved awareness of inappropriate (and appropriate, i.e. hypovolaemia-induced) secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) instead of redundantly salt loading a large number of children. Furthermore, the design of the abovementioned trials, all of which focused on the occurrence of hyponatraemia, provided no insights into the deleterious potential of salt-rich solutions. Even more controversially, some authors recently suggested extrapolating the routine use of isotonic maintenance fluids to the adult setting. Not only are the symptoms of potential hyponatraemia less dramatic in this population but also the detrimental effects of fluid and salt overload are well known in the care of surgical and critically ill adult patients.

### Dextrose, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium phosphate, dibasic (isolyte P in dextrose) [^115bXyd6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly in the presence of renal disease.

Solutions containing acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements, or the use of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.

Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) — neostigmine efficacy and dosing — Neostigmine remains the pharmacologic agent of choice in ACPO, with three placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trials demonstrating effectiveness in 85% to 94% of cases; in a meta-analysis, resolution of ACPO was significantly higher after 1 dose of neostigmine (2–5 mg) compared with placebo (89.2% [range, 84.6%-95.2%] vs 14.8%), and for patients who fail an initial dose, are partial responders, or have recurrence, a second dose has been associated with clinical response in 40% to 100%; male gender, younger age, postsurgical status, and electrolyte imbalance are risk factors for nonresponse, and daily administration of polyethylene glycol via nasogastric tube has been shown to decrease recurrence.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^111SGjeS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — bowel preparation for colonoscopy — Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, colonoscopy should be performed after adequate colon cleansing. Four to six liters of a polyethylene glycol-based solution or the equivalent should be administered over 3–4 h until the rectal effluent is clear of blood and stool, and unprepped colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy is not recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). A nasogastric tube can be considered to facilitate colon preparation in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who are intolerant to oral intake and are at low risk of aspiration (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), and in studies of urgent colonoscopy, as many as one-third of patients required a nasogastric tube to facilitate rapid bowel preparation. Studies using large volume (4–6 l), rapid (3–4 h) purge with colonoscopy performed within 1–2 h of preparation completion report high rates of definitive diagnosis (22–42%) and hemostasis (34%), whereas cecal intubation rates are low (55–70%) with urgent colonoscopy without oral or rectal preparation. Complications of colon preparation with polyethylene glycol are rare but include aspiration pneumonia, as well as fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, and aspiration precautions should be used particularly in older and debilitated patients.

### Superior mesenteric artery syndrome treated successfully by endoscopy-assisted jejunal feeding tube placement [^113AgzGg]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Learning points

The goal of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome treatment is weight gain, the relief of intestinal obstruction symptoms and the correction of precipitating factors.
Initial treatment is usually conservative non-operative treatment, which includes gastrointestinal decompression using nasogastric tube placement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support.
Jejunal feeding tube placement past the obstruction to allow continuous enteral feeding is safe and useful.
This treatment might be a valuable initial alternative to conventional conservative total parenteral nutrition therapy in high operative risk patients with SMA syndrome.

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^114wG3x7]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Level of evidence: moderate (inconsistency, extrapolated, uncertain target glucose values, potassium and magnesium extrapolated from cardiac and critical care data).
Recommendation grade: weak (benefit must be outweighed against the risk of hypoglycemia, diabetic patients likely to benefit the most, the risk of atrial fibrillation may be reduced by fluid and electrolyte correction, but the cause is multifactorial).

10. Preoperative carbohydrate loading

An oral carbohydrate drink given preoperatively is a recommendation in most other ERAS Society Guidelines to reduce dehydration and improve insulin sensitivity by giving a carbohydrate load 2–4 h prior to surgery. Emergency laparotomy patients are already under physiological stress and giving carbohydrates in this setting may elevate glucose levels further with no effect on insulin sensitivity. We could not identify any studies on the use or benefit of carbohydrate loading in emergency general surgery. The increased risk of gastric stasis, intra-abdominal pathology, preoperative use of opioids and generalized practice of using preoperative nasogastric tubes and avoiding oral intake prior to surgery meant we extrapolated evidence of potential harm and this group could not recommend the use of carbohydrate loading.

Recommendation:
Level of evidence: Low and potential harm.
Recommendation grade: Strong, do not use in the emergency laparotomy population.

11. Pre-operative nasogastric intubation

Nasogastric tubes (NGTs) have been traditionally used in emergency surgery to reduce gastric distension and drain gastric contents. The use of nasogastric tubes in elective colorectal surgical patients is declining as the evidence base has shown an increase in complications such as respiratory infections and pharyngolaryngitis as well as patient discomfort and delay to feeding, with no change in morbidity or mortality. The use in the emergency setting is very different with a risk–benefit ratio depending on the clinical circumstances and cause of abdominal pathology and patient factors. Patients may have pathology causing gastric distension and high gastric fluid volumes, and decompression may be beneficial and reduce the risk of aspiration at induction of anesthesia. This risk benefit is different in the preoperative and postoperative setting. We therefore discuss the postoperative use and continuation in part 2 of this guideline.

Recommendations:
Pre-operative nasogastric tube insertion should be considered on an individual basis assessing for the risk of aspiration and gastric distension depending on the pathology and patient factors.

Level of evidence: Moderate (extrapolation from elective surgery).
Recommendation grade: Strong (aspiration can be life-threatening and its reduction by nasogastric insertion outweighs the risk of short-term use).

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^116HRU8J]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Table 1 — Other recommendations for refeeding syndrome (RS) risk focus on electrolytes and fluids with specific cautions. Items include Restore circulatory volume, Check electrolyte levels with Electrolyte replacement to correct deficiencies and Monitor fluid balance, and Check potassium, magnesium, phosphorus. Guidance includes Do not discontinue feeding if electrolyte levels fall and When serum potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus levels are significantly low, feeding should not be advanced further until supplementation has occurred. Calculations should Consider all sources of calories and fluids in your calculations (including dextrose), and clinicians should Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) and replace any low levels promptly. Fluid management notes Unless hemodynamically unstable, keep sodium-containing IV fluids to < 2 L/d initially in severely malnourished patients, such as those with anorexia nervosa, who may have a component of cardiomyopathy. Patients at high risk for RS should receive electrolytes substitution of lower than normal/in low normal range, and Prophylactic supplementation of electrolytes.

### Polyethylene glycol-3350, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate (Gavilyte-N) [^115ZP5w1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Renal Impairment

Use caution when prescribing GaviLyte-N for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration, and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients.

5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis

Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and GaviLyte-N may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease

If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering GaviLyte-N. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of GaviLyte-N. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.

5.7 Aspiration

Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration. Such patients should be observed during administration of GaviLyte-N, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube.

Do not combine GaviLyte- N with starch-based thickeners [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), a component of GaviLyte - N, when mixed with starch-thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch-thickened liquid. When a PEG-based product used for another indication was mixed in starch-based pre-thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia, thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported.

5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion

The contents of each jug must be diluted with water to a final volume of 4 liters (4 L) and ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances.

### Pressure support ventilation (PSV) versus neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in difficult to wean pediatric ARDS patients: a physiologic crossover study [^115aoxAG]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Study protocol

All children admitted to PICU for moderate PARDS, according to our PICU protocol, were evaluated for weaning verifying the following criteria: resolution or improvement of PARDS causes, hemodynamic stability, absence or progressive reduction of vasoactive drugs requirements, adequate level of consciousness (COMFORT ≥ 18), presence of spontaneous respiratory efforts, presence of the cough reflex, correction of significant metabolic and electrolyte imbalances and adequate gas exchange with Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cmH 2 O and FiO 2 ≤ 0.5.

Patients who fulfilled these criteria underwent a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) of 5 cmH 2 O for 30 to 120 min.

All patients who failed up to 3 SBTs in less than 7 consecutive days, and presenting at least two of the following signs: diaphoresis, nasal flaring, tachycardia (Heart Rate ≥ 40 bpm), arrhythmias, hypotension, apnea, P ET CO2 increase > 10 mmHg, arterial pH decrease < 7.32, PaO2 < 60 mmHg with a FiO₂ ≥ 0.40 (PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 150), were enrolled in the study, as they were considered at high risk of asynchrony phenomena.

After enrollment, the standard nasogastric tube of each patient was replaced with a specific nasogastric tube (Edi catheter) with an array of eight bipolar electrodes mounted at its distal end (Getinge Critical Care, Solna, Sweden). The initial placement was directed by measuring the distance from the patient's xiphisternum to the tragus of the ear and then extending the measurement until the nose. The Edi catheter was then inserted to the corresponding depth. Catheter positioning was carried out through a specific function of the Servo I ventilator (Getinge, Critical Care, Solna, Sweden), called Edi catheter positioning. Confirmation of its appropriate placement was achieved viewing the online electrical displays from the catheter: the presence of a good quality Edi trace, with P waves displayed by the central electrodes, indicates optimal positioning, with the array spanning equally the diaphragm in both caudal and cranial directions.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^113e13U8]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the absence of evidence, therapies are often based on intuition, belief, common sense or gut feeling. Over the years, some treatment strategies may become dogmas that are eventually considered as state-of-the-art and not questioned any longer. This might be a reason why there are many examples of "strange" treatments in medical history that have been applied in the absence of evidence and later abandoned for good reasons. In this article, five dogmas relevant to critical care medicine are discussed and reviewed in the light of the available evidence. Dogma #1 relates to the treatment of oliguria with fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors. In this context, it should be considered that oliguria is a symptom rather than a disease. Thus, once hypovolaemia can be excluded as the underlying reason, there is no justification for giving fluids, which may do more harm than good in euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients. Similarly, there is no solid evidence for forcing diuresis by administering vasopressors and loop diuretics. Dogma #2 addresses the treatment of crush syndrome patients with aggressive fluid therapy using NaCl 0.9%. In fact, this treatment may aggravate renal injury by iatrogenic metabolic acidosis and subsequent renal hypoperfusion. Dogma #3 concerns the administration of NaCl 0.9% to patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Since these patients are usually characterised by hyperkalaemia, the potassium-free solution NaCl 0.9%, containing exclusively 154mmol/l of sodium and chloride ions each, is often considered as the fluid of choice. However, large volumes of chloride-rich solutions cause hyperchloraemic acidosis in a dose-dependent manner and induce a potassium shift to the extracellular space, thereby increasing serum potassium levels. Thus, balanced electrolyte solutions are to be preferred in this setting. Dogma #4 relates to the fact that enteral nutrition is often withheld for patients with high residual gastric volume due to the theoretical risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux, potentially resulting in aspiration pneumonitis. Despite controversial discussions, there is no clinical data supporting that residual gastric volume should be generally measured, especially not in patients without a gastro-intestinal surgery and/or motility disorders. Clinical evidence rather suggests that abandoning residual gastric volume monitoring does not increase the incidence of pneumonia, but may benefit patients by facilitating adequate enteral feeding. Finally, dogma #5 is about sedating all mechanically ventilated patients because "fighting" against the respirator may cause insufficient ventilation. This concern needs to be balanced against the unwanted consequences of sedation, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay as well as increased risk of delirium. Modern concepts based on adequate analgesia and moderate to no sedation appear to be more suitable. In conclusion, dogmas are still common in clinical practice. Since science rather than fiction should govern our actions in intensive care medicine, it is important to remain critical and challenge long established concepts, especially when the underlying evidence is weak or non-existing.

Refeeding syndrome risk during enteral nutrition (EN) — in the patient at high risk for refeeding syndrome, feeding should be ramped up slowly to goal over 3 to 4 days while carefully monitoring electrolytes and volume status, and such patients should be monitored closely for up to 5 days for electrolyte abnormalities and volume status after feeding is initiated.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^114MqU7T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 5: Oral rehydration solution — In short bowel syndrome (SBS) without a colon, patients may be "net secretors", often with residual jejunum < 100 cm and daily jejunostomy output > 4 L; fluids should replace losses to maintain a urine output of at least 1 L/d. The oral intake of low sodium hypotonic and hypertonic solutions should be limited to reduce output, and a common misconception is to drink large quantities of water, which increases ostomy output; instead, use of a glucose–electrolyte oral rehydration solution (ORS) to enhance absorption and reduce secretion is preferred. Commercially prepared ORS products and homemade recipes are available; ORSs differ from sports drinks because the sodium content is considerably higher and the sugar content lower, while most SBS patients with a colon can usually maintain adequate hydration with hypotonic fluids.

### Alternative management of diabetic ketoacidosis in a Brazilian pediatric emergency department [^115VKfgR]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

The leading clinical manifestation is dehydration, which may be mild, moderate or severe with hemodynamic instability (capillary refill time > 3 seconds, weak pulses, cool extremities, tachycardia, normal or lower blood pressure) and despite dehydration, with only a few exceptions, urine output is considerable. Intense ketogenesis causes a rampant clinical condition, with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hyperpnea (from mild to Kussmaul breathing), facial redness and ketotic breath.

Initial assessment of the DKA patient must include detailed physical examination, focusing on the circulatory state (pulse, blood pressure and peripheral perfusion), dehydration degree, level of consciousness, presence of acidotic breathing, ketotic breath, or signs of associated infectious conditions. Finger-stick capillary blood glucose and ketonemia testing must be conducted at the bedside, ketonuria and glycosuria shall be monitored using urine reactive strips. Biochemical assessment will include venous blood glucose, blood gases, serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphorus), urea and creatinine, allowing for the calculation of serum osmolality and anion gap (formulas in Table 2).

Table 2
Formulas used to calculate serum osmolality and anion gap in DKA

In severely obtunded, unconscious patients or with signs of respiratory failure, orotracheal intubation and nasogastric tube should be placed in order to establish a safe air flow. In this situation, it is recommended to preserve "adaptive tachypnea" for the acidosis level, in order to avoid exaggerated vasoconstriction due to an accentuated drop in pCO2 levels, or otherwise increased vasodilatation secondary to the excessively increased pCO2 levels.

Moderate-to-severe dehydrated patients should be managed in a medical center specialized in critical care, where they can be constantly monitored and reassessed.

DKA treatment aims to correct dehydration, electrolytic disorders, hyperglycemia and acid-base imbalance, as well as identifying and controlling the triggering factors in order to avoid the complications resulting from such procedures.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^111eK7pc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric eating disorders — In children and adolescents with longstanding AN or other low-weight eating and feeding disorders, some clinical abnormalities may be irreversible, including growth impairment, decreased bone density, structural brain changes, and infertility, and patients admitted for malnutrition should be monitored for potential re-feeding syndrome during the initial re-nourishment phase. Frequent purging in BN or purging disorder may cause parotid swelling, Russell's sign, erosion of dental enamel, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, which may lead to orthostatic hypotension and syncope; esophageal tears can lead to serious and difficult-to-control bleeding, and binge eating can cause both gastric and esophageal rupture. The mortality rate is estimated to be about 1% in BN patients. Indications for medical hospitalization include severe abnormality of heart rate (bradycardia and orthostatic heart rate changes), blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension), body temperature (hypothermia), electrolyte abnormalities, and severe malnutrition. In hospitalized weight restoration, some data suggest that nasogastric tube feeding is more efficient than other approaches in promoting weight gain, but the long-term benefits have not been established and the clinical need for the approach not substantiated.

### Fluid and electrolyte management: putting a plan in motion [^112nfvwS]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid and electrolyte management is challenging for clinicians, as electrolytes shift in a variety of settings and disease states and are dependent on osmotic changes and fluid balance. The development of a plan for managing fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should start with correcting the underlying condition. In most cases, this is followed by an assessment of fluid balance with the goal of achieving euvolemia. After fluid status is understood and/or corrected, electrolyte imbalances are simplified. Many equations are available to aid clinicians in providing safe recommendations or at least to give a starting point for correcting the abnormalities. However, these equations do not take into consideration the vast differences between clinical scenarios, thus making electrolyte management more challenging. The supplementation plan, whether delivered intravenously or orally, must include an assessment of renal and gastrointestinal function, as most guidelines are established under the assumption of normal digestion, absorption and excretion. After the plan is developed, frequent monitoring is vital to regain homeostasis. A fluid and electrolyte management plan developed by a multidisciplinary team is advantageous in promoting continuity of care and producing safe outcomes.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^112Ptw9E]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113pJkoV]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the confounding factors?

In the setting of postoperative care, a number of confounding factors may impact on accurate haemoglobin measurement. Volume overload and haemodilution after major surgery are potential causes for low haemoglobin levels, despite normal and stable red cell mass. Therefore, the diagnosis of anaemia based on simple haemoglobin concentration may be misleading, and is confounded by plasma volume derangements, resulting in significant overdiagnosis 37. Potential volume overload should be taken into account, and may improve after diuresis.

Similar conditions may be present in the peri‐operative setting where prevention of intravascular volume deficit is a cornerstone of peri‐operative management. Here, intravascular volume and fluid therapy are fundamental whenever fasting is indicated for medical reasons; in the event of high‐fluid turnover rates during major surgery, or in cases of reduced enteral resorption due to sustained vomiting, severe diarrhoea or gastro‐intestinal dysfunction following circulatory shock. The primary aim of intravenous fluid therapy (crystalloid and colloid solutions) is the restoration of plasma and blood volume to ensure appropriate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

Unfortunately, appropriate assessment of volume status is complex. The diagnosis or quantification of moderate‐to‐severe volume deficit and volume responsiveness remains difficult, and may be attempted using laboratory variables (e.g. lactate, base excess), positional manoeuvres (passive lifting of legs), new monitoring devices (measuring pulse variability and stroke volume indexes or other preload variables) or echocardiography. Recent guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding hypervolaemia 7. During postoperative recovery, redistribution and excretion of fluids may lead to rapid recovery of haemodilution‐induced low haemoglobin concentrations.

Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) — fistuloclysis with enteral nutrition (EN) outcomes are reported as follows: In a study including 95 patients with high-output ECF and remaining small intestine longer than 100 cm, treatment groups included fistuloclysis (n = 35) with EN plus reinfusion of proximal fistula output and EN without reinfusion (n = 60), and all patients received parenteral nutrition (PN); fistuloclysis was defined as reinfusion of output from the proximal to the distal fistula via a feeding tube while EN formula was infused through this tube or another nasojejunal tube. Biochemical parameters improved with fistuloclysis, and hospital costs, hospital stay, and hospital mortality were significantly lower, with 1-year survival significantly higher in the fistuloclysis group.

Acute LGIB — UGIB indicators and nasogastric aspirate performance: Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability should lead to consideration of a brisk UGIB source; if the likelihood of UGIB is high, an upper endoscopy should be performed, whereas if suspicion is modest, a nasogastric aspirate/lavage can be used to assess possible UGIB. A positive nasogastric aspirate indicates a very high likelihood of an UGIB (likelihood ratio = 11), whereas a negative aspirate makes an UGIB less likely but still possible (negative predictive value 64%, likelihood ratio = 0.6). Additionally, red blood and clots are unlikely to be from an upper gastrointestinal source (likelihood ratio 0.05). The nasogastric tube can be left in place to facilitate colonoscopy after bowel preparation.

### Management of type 1 (acute) intestinal failure [^115kt22N]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Fluid requirements

Total maintenance fluid volume of 25–30 mL/kg/day is recommended for hospitalised patients. For high BMI (> 30 kg/m 2) patients, the intravenous fluid prescription should be adjusted to their ideal bodyweight, and expert advice sought if the BMI > 40 kg/m 2. Prescribing smaller volumes of fluid (20–25 mL/kg/day) should be considered for patients who are older or frail, have renal impairment or cardiac failure, are malnourished and/or at risk of refeeding syndrome. Patients with type 1 IF may have multiple factors which impact on their fluid requirements (box 2).

Box 2
Consideration for estimating fluid requirements

Electrolyte requirements

Standard adult daily electrolyte requirements are described in table 1. Additional electrolytes may be necessary if there are excessive electrolyte losses from vomiting, nasogastric tube aspirates or diarrhoea. These should be administered as separate infusions or, if able, added to the PN bag, under appropriate pharmaceutically controlled environmental conditions. All patients should be assessed for the presence of oedema. If the patient is fluid overloaded, or has several other intravenous infusions, they may require a lower volume of PN. Table 2 provides an estimation of potential additional requirements based on recognised composition of losses from the gastrointestinal tract.

### Superior mesenteric artery syndrome treated successfully by endoscopy-assisted jejunal feeding tube placement [^117FLTed]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This case report of feeding tube placement distal to the obstruction via the endoscopic approach for SMA syndrome in a postoperative patient showed that feeding tube placement was safe and useful, particularly in a perioperative high-risk patient, to improve SMA syndrome quickly. SMA syndrome studies have estimated the incidence at 0.013%–0.3% in the general population. It is defined as the compression of the third part of the duodenum due to the narrowing of the space between the SMA and the aorta, mainly by the loss of the mesenteric fat pad. The most common factor reducing the angle and distance between the aorta and the SMA is significant weight loss leading to the loss of mesenteric fat pads due to a medical disorder, psychological disorder or surgery. Patients may have acute (eg, postoperative) or slowly progressive symptoms, consistent with the symptoms of proximal small bowel obstruction. Patients with mild obstruction may have only postprandial epigastric pain and early satiety, while those with more advanced obstruction may have severe nausea, bilious emesis and weight loss. Patients may also have symptoms of reflux. The diagnosis of SMA syndrome may be aided by radiological, angiographic, ultrasonic and endoscopic studies. CT angiography is now the investigation of choice, with endoscopy and ultrasound playing adjunctive roles. We employed a CT scan with confirmatory findings. As a general rule, few criteria should be present on imaging: (1) duodenal obstruction with an abrupt cut-off in the third portion and active peristalsis; (2) an aortomesenteric artery angle of ≤ 25°, which is the most sensitive measure of diagnosis, particularly if the aortomesenteric distance is ≤ 8 mm; and (3) high fixation of the duodenum by the ligament of Treitz, an abnormally low origin of the SMA, or anomalies of the SMA. The goal of SMA syndrome treatment is weight gain, the relief of intestinal obstruction symptoms and the correction of precipitating factors. Initial treatment is usually conservative non-operative treatment, which includes gastrointestinal decompression using nasogastric tube placement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support. Among these, nutritional support is the major component of conservative treatment to increase the aortomesenteric angle and improve symptoms by increasing the intermembrane fat pad and prevent duodenal compression. Enteral nutrition is preferred, taking frequent small meals of nutritious liquid, lying on the left side or prone following meals. Metoclopramide is also advised to relieve symptoms. TPN can be useful when enteral feedings are not tolerated.

9.4.1 Dietary adjustments/fluid management

Gastric motility may be far less deranged for liquids than for solids with the result that many patients tolerate liquid feeds better than solid meals. Sometimes frequent small meals with low-fat, low-fibre and liquid nutritional supplements may be helpful.

If the patient has a stoma and a short bowel, fluid restriction, a sipped glucose saline solution, use of loperamide sometimes in high dose (occasionally with the addition of codeine phosphate) will reduce the risks of dehydration, sodium and magnesium depletion. If a high net secretory output occurs, a proton pump inhibitor (or occasionally octreotide) may be needed.

Post-feeding orthostatic symptoms in partial autonomic failure may respond to dietary adjustments and drugs such as fludrocortisone, midodrine and octreotide.

9.4.2 Vitamin/mineral deficiencies

Care is needed to ensure that micronutrient deficiencies particularly of iron, vitamin B 12 and the fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A, D and E, do not occur. Magnesium deficiency is common especially if a high output stoma. Magnesium oxide may cause fewer osmotic effects than other preparations but is expensive.

Bone mineral density is important to address and should be assessed with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning in those with malnutrition. For patients who cannot take oral measures to improve bone density, parenteral bisphosphonates such as zoledronate should be considered.

The development of a high-output stoma (HOS) is associated with water, electrolyte and nutritional complications. Prompt, careful assessment and management is required to avoid rapid clinical deterioration in this patient population. A multidisciplinary approach to management ensures the best possible outcome and quality of life for patients who experience HOS. This article outlines the important considerations in the identification and pathophysiology of HOS. A systematic approach to the management of the condition is outlined, considering fluid and electrolyte requirements, nutrient deficiencies and manipulation of gastrointestinal absorption, motility and secretions using medical and surgical therapies.

Non operative management

There are no advantages with the use of long tube decompression compared with the use of nasogastric tubes (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A).

However early tube decompression, either with long or nasogastric tube, may be beneficial (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C) in the initial management of non strangulating ASBO, in adjunct with fluid resuscitation and electrolytes imbalances correction. For challenging cases of ASBO, the long tube should be placed as soon as possible more advisable by endoscopy, rather than by fluoroscopic guide.

The use of Gastrografin in ASBO is safe (in terms of morbidity and mortality) and reduces the need for surgery, the time to resolution of obstruction and the hospital stay (Level of Evidence 1a GoR A). Nevertheless anaphylactoid reaction and lethal aspiration have been described.

Gastrografin may be administered on the dosage of 50–150 ml, either orally or via NGT and can be given both at immediately admission or after an attempt of initial traditional conservative treatment of 48 hours (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A).

Regarding the therapeutic value of Gastrografin, some authors affirmed that water-soluble contrast reduces the hospital stay but does not reduce the need for surgery, others has proven that is effective in both reducing the need for surgery and shortening hospital stay, without differences in complications and mortality.

As further adjuncts needs to be mentioned that oral therapy with magnesium oxide, L. acidophilus and simethicone may hasten the resolution of conservatively treated partial ASBO and shorten the hospital stay (Level of Evidence 1b GoR A).

To be thorough it has to be mentioned Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy, that appears to be beneficial in older patients with high anesthesiologic risk (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B). HBO therapy may be an option in the management of patients for whom surgery should be avoided.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) weaning protocols in adults — In those receiving enteral nutrition (EN), transition from PN should be achieved via a weaning protocol to prevent overfeeding and fluid overload, and one protocol decreased PN by 30 mL/h once EN achieved the same rate and discontinued PN when EN reached goal infusion rate with less overfeeding than prior practice. During prolonged weaning, the PN prescription may require daily adjustments with dextrose, amino acids, ILE, and electrolytes and fluid, whereas in metabolically stable adults PN can be weaned by reducing the number of days that PN is infused each week; patients must be closely monitored for fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, weight loss, and other evidence of nutrition decline.

### Intravenous rehydration for severe acute malnutrition with gastroenteritis [^113Z7VkE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Study Procedures and Follow-up

Basic infrastructural support for emergency care, patient monitors, bedside hemoglobin, glucose and lactate point-of-care tests were provided. Bedside observations were performed at admission and every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours, hourly to 8hours, then at 12, 24, 36 and 48hours after randomization. Clinical chemistry was assessed at 0, 8 and 24hours. Blood cultures were performed where facilities permitted. Participants unable to tolerate oral fluids had a nasogastric tube placed to administer oral rehydration fluids and nutritional milk (called F75); its correct positioning was checked at each administration. Participants were actively monitored for serious adverse events (SAEs), particularly suspected cardiac or pulmonary overload, at each clinical assessment. Participants were clinically assessed at 7-days and 28-days (trial exit) post-randomization. Study staff were unblinded throughout; laboratory tests were assayed blinded.

End Points

The primary endpoint was mortality at 96hours. Secondary efficacy endpoints were mortality to day-28; change in weight, MUAC, at Day 3 and Day 7; urine output at 8hours. Safety endpoints were evidence of pulmonary edema or heart failure; change in sodium at 24hours compared with 8hours (post intravenous strategy completion); and correction of electrolyte abnormalities (severe hyponatremia < 125 mmol/L or hypokalemia < 2.5mol/L).

### Causes and management of a high-output stoma [^115pzpKB]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Patients with a high-output stoma (HOS) (> 2000 ml/day) suffer from dehydration, hypomagnesaemia and under-nutrition. This study aimed to determine the incidence, aetiology and outcome of HOS.

Method

The number of stomas fashioned between 2002 and 2006 was determined. An early HOS was defined as occurring in hospital within 3 weeks of stoma formation and a late HOS was defined as occurring after discharge.

Results

Six-hundred and eighty seven stomas were fashioned (456 ileostomy/jejunostomy and 231 colostomy). An early HOS occurred in 75 (16%) ileostomies/jejunostomies. Formation of a jejunostomy (defined as having less than 200 cm remaining of proximal small bowel; n = 20) and intra-abdominal sepsis? obstruction (n = 14) were the commonest causes identified for early HOS. It was possible to stop parenteral infusions in 53 (71%) patients treated with oral hypotonic fluid restriction, glucose-saline solution and anti diarrhoeal medication. In 46 (61%) patients, the HOS resolved and no drug treatment was needed, 20 (27%) patients continued treatment, six (8%) of whom went home and continued to receive parenteral or subcutaneous saline, and nine died. Twenty-six patients had late HOS. Eleven were admitted with renal impairment and four had intermittent small-bowel obstruction. Eight patients were given long-term subcutaneous or parenteral saline and two also received parenteral nutrition. All had hypomagnesaemia.

Conclusion

Early high output from an ileostomy is common and although 49% resolved spontaneously, 51% needed ongoing medical treatment, usually because of a short small-bowel remnant.

Electrolyte transport diarrhea

Forms of CODE associated with impaired electrolyte transport include defects to chloride or sodium transporters with high fecal losses of either chloride or sodium in the stool. Patients present with watery diarrhea, dehydration, and severe changes to electrolytes and acid-base balance, if left untreated. PN, IV fluids, and electrolyte supplementation are required in the first months of life. Over time, oral supplementation of electrolytes, fluids, and specialized formulas can support increasing enteral tolerance up to enteral autonomy (Table 2).

Congenital chloride diarrhea

Congenital chloride diarrhea (CCD; MIM #) is a disorder of the intestinal Cl − /HCO 3 − exchange transporter, resulting in high fecal Cl − loses, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC26A3 gene.

Most children are born prematurely with hydramnios and absence of meconium, suggesting an intrauterine onset of diarrhea. Similar to congenital sodium diarrheas, the condition can go undiagnosed in the early neonatal period due to high-volume stool output resembling urine. During the first days of life, patients usually have a large, distended abdomen, and the neonatal weight loss is unusually high. Dehydration is common and can lead to death, particularly during the early neonatal period.

Clinical symptoms include failure to thrive and high output of very watery stool containing high chloride, > 90 mmol/L. However, stool chloride may be low in patients with chronically depleted serum chloride. Urine chloride is dependent on serum chloride, and in cases in which the serum chloride is < 95 mmol/L, urine testing is associated with an absence of chloriduria.

### How to manage a high-output stoma [^111N6xBY]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A high-output stoma (HOS) or fistula is when small bowel output causes water, sodium and often magnesium depletion. This tends to occur when the output is > 1.5–2.0L/24 hours though varies according to the amount of food/drink taken orally. An HOS occurs in up to 31% of small bowel stomas. A high-output enterocutaneous fistula may, if from the proximal small bowel, behave in the same way and its fluid management will be the same as for an HOS. The clinical assessment consists of excluding causes other than a short bowel and treating them (especially partial or intermittent obstruction). A contrast follow through study gives an approximate measurement of residual small intestinal length (if not known from surgery) and may show the quality of the remaining small bowel. If HOS is due to a short bowel, the first step is to rehydrate the patient so stopping severe thirst. When thirst has resolved and renal function returned to normal, oral hypotonic fluid is restricted and a glucose-saline solution is sipped. Medication to slow transit (loperamide often in high dose) or to reduce secretions (omeprazole for gastric acid) may be helpful. Subcutaneous fluid (usually saline with added magnesium) may be given before intravenous fluids though can take 10–12hours to infuse. Generally parenteral support is needed when less than 100cm of functioning jejunum remains. If there is defunctioned bowel in situ, consideration should be given to bringing it back into continuity.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^114K9YdH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

A complete blood count, renal function and electrolytes (to exclude pre-renal acute renal failure), and liver function tests are suggested as the first laboratory tests. Low serum bicarbonate levels, low arterial blood pH, high lactic acid level, marked leukocytosis, and hyperamylasemia may be useful in the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia. A coagulation profile should be also tested because of the potential need for emergency surgery.

Initial management

Supportive treatment must begin as soon as possible with intravenous crystalloids, anti-emetics, and bowel rest.

Isotonic dextrose-saline crystalloid and balanced isotonic crystalloid replacement fluids containing supplemental potassium in an equivalent volume to the patient's losses are recommended. Nasogastric suction can be diagnostically useful to analyze gastric contents (a feculent gastric aspirate is a characteristic of distal small bowel obstruction or large bowel obstruction). Nasogastric suction can be also therapeutically important to prevent aspiration pneumonia decompressing the proximal bowel. A Foley catheter should be also inserted to monitor urine output.

Diagnostic evaluation (Tables 2 and 3)

Abdominal plain X-ray

Abdominal plain X-ray is the first level radiologic study. In small bowel obstruction, plain abdominal radiographic findings are diagnostic in 50–60%, inconclusive in 20–30%, and misleading in 10–20% of patients.

Table 2
Procedures for the evaluation and treatment of bowel obstruction

In one study after radiography, the sensitivity of bowel obstruction was significantly higher than after clinical evaluation only: 74% versus 57%, respectively (P < 0.01). However, the positive predictive value did not differ significantly between clinical assessment only and with plain radiographs.

In a review of 140 cases of suspected large bowel obstruction, the abdominal X-ray had 84% sensitivity and 72% specificity.

General

These solutions should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels. Solutions containing potassium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing any of these solutions with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

These solutions are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in these or alternative solutions.

Non-operative management

The cornerstone of non-operative management is nil per os and decompression using a naso-gastric tube or long intestinal tube. Non-operative management is effective in approximately 70–90% of patients with ASBO. There has been some debate in the literature over the use of long intestinal tubes or naso-gastric tubes. In an older trial, no significant difference in failure rates was found between naso-gastric tubes and long intestinal tubes. In a more recent trial, 186 patients were randomized between a newly designed trilumen long tube and a naso-gastric tube. Long tubes seemed more effective in this trial with a failure rate of 10.4% in this group compared with 53.3% in the naso-gastric tube group. Results from this trial should be interpreted with care, because the failure rate of naso-gastric tube compression is much higher than would be expected from other literature. Moreover, a drawback of trilumen tubes is the need for endoscopic placement. Non-operative management should further include fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte disturbances, nutritional support, and prevention of aspiration.

Duration of the period in which non-operative management can be tried is subject to debate. Several retrospective series and databases have shown that delays in surgery increase morbidity and mortality. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative treatment is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Continuing non-operative treatment for more than 72 h in cases with persistent high output from a decompression tube, but no other signs of clinical deterioration, however, remains subject to debate. Common medical complications in patients with small bowel obstruction are dehydration with kidney injury, electrolyte disturbances, malnutrition, and aspiration.

Non-operative management: summary

The panel recommends a trial of non-operative management in all patients with ASBO, unless there are signs of peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia. Evidence for the optimal duration of non-operative is absent, but most authors and the panel consider a 72-h period as safe and appropriate. Further recommendations are found in Table 5.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^111dcL9H]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) access and monitoring — Tunneled central venous catheters are preferred for long-term PN over peripherally inserted central venous catheters and over totally implanted devices because ports must be accessed and exchanged on a weekly basis; PN should be initiated and adjusted to meet fluid, electrolyte, energy, protein, and micronutrient needs, with monitoring of weight, laboratory results, stool or ostomy output, urine output, and thirst. When ostomy output is high, increased fluid, potassium, magnesium, and zinc losses occur and need replacement; the amount of PN can be decreased when oral intake is adequate without excessive output and with weight maintenance or gain. In some patients, parenteral fluids without macronutrients may be needed if stool output exceeds intake, and during hot summer months additional daytime intravenous fluids may be required to prevent dehydration, as patients on home PN remain at increased risk of fluid electrolyte abnormalities.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111eugSV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Even the 2007 EAST guidelines on SBO management stated that there is no significant difference with regard to the decompression achieved, the success of nonoperative treatment, or the morbidity rate after surgical intervention comparing long tube decompression with the use of nasogastric tubes.

Nevertheless, in conservative treatment for challenging cases of ASBO, the long tube should be placed as soon as possible.

Early tube decompression, either with long intestinal tube or just a naso-gastric tube, is therefore advisable in the initial management of non strangulating ASBO, in adjunct with fluid resuscitation and electrolytes imbalances correction.

The first evidence of safety and efficacy of Water-soluble contrast medium (Gastrografin) use in ASBO was from Assalia et al. in the 90s. The first prospective RCT randomised 99 patients with partial ASBO either to 100 mL of Gastrografin administered through the nasogastric tube or conventional treatment. Mean timing of the first stool was 23.3 hours in the control group and 6.2 hours in the patients receiving Gastrografin (p < 0.00001). Ten obstructive episodes (21%) in the control group required operative treatment compared with six (10%) in the trial group (p = 0.12). Mean hospital stay for the patients who responded to conservative treatment was 4.4 days and 2.2 days in the control and trial groups, respectively (p < 0.00001). One patient in each group died after operation. No Gastrografin-related complications were observed.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^117F491a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG)

HG is a severe form of nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss of more than 5% of pre-pregnant weight, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. HG usually starts before the 22 nd week of gestation, affects 0.3–2.0% of pregnancies and sometimes requires hospital admission. In a Canadian population-based cohort study, Fell et al reported an increased risk of HG associated with hyperthyroid disorders, psychiatric illness, previous molar pregnancy, pre-existing diabetes and asthma.

Currently, three major etiologies have been described in the literature. Firstly, high levels of HCG can have a stimulating effect on the secretory process in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The production of thyroid-binding globulin also increases under estrogen stimulation, leading to a decrease in free thyroxine (T4). The transient decrease in the free T4 level causes stimulation of the thyroid and the patient can develop gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, leading to vomiting. Secondly, HCG is similar to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and possibly causes hyperemesis by stimulating the TSH receptor. Thirdly, there is a negative relation between the levels of prolactin and nausea/vomiting, whereas estrogens have a positive relation. Therefore, the higher levels of estrogens during pregnancy can raise the risk of HG.

HG is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is usually accompanied by hyponatremia, hypokalemia, low serum urea, raised hematocrit, metabolic hypochloremia alkalosis and ketonuria. Liver enzymes may be elevated in 50% of cases. Patients are dehydrated with fluid/food intolerance and weight loss due to the prolonged vomiting. Ultrasound assessment of pregnancy is mandatory, because HG may be associated with multiple and molar pregnancies.

No single therapy has emerged as significantly beneficial and the medical approach is based on electrolyte correction and prevention of dehydration. When hospitalized, these women usually need intravenous fluid therapy to correct electrolyte disturbances. Normal saline solution is recommended to correct possible hyponatremia. As in non-severe nausea and vomiting, thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may be appropriate to prevent severe symptoms. Thiamine also prevents Wernicke's encephalopathy in patients with prolonged vomiting. If patients fall to respond to conservative therapy, anti-emetics are indicated, including histamine receptor blockers, phenothiazines and dopamine antagonists. Malnutrition may necessitate nasojejunal enteral feeding, effective in symptom control and weight gain in severe HG. Total parenteral nutrition may be used in life-threatening cases.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies-general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^116DcNG5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Approach and Principles of Diet Management

Nutrition support is the cornerstone of medical management of CODE. Proper nutrition management aims to achieve normal growth and development, normal electrolyte and micronutrient levels, and prevention of dehydration- and nutrition-related pathologies such as renal insufficiency, metabolic bone disease, or vitamin deficiencies. However, beyond these roles of nutrition support, diet management can also contribute to the diagnostic process in certain CODE disorders and lead to improvement or resolution of diarrhea in others.

Principles of diet management

Nutrition support is almost universally required in the first few months of life for children afflicted by CODE. In the early stages, before a definite diagnosis is made, the main goal is to establish the basis of the diarrheal symptoms while avoiding dehydration and electrolyte imbalance and maintaining growth. Therefore, intravenous (IV) fluids are required initially, which may be followed by PN support. High-volume diarrheas require large-volume PN support and frequently, higher than normal amounts of sodium, bicarbonate, magnesium, and occasionally potassium and chloride. Over time, careful monitoring of minerals and vitamins is required to avoid deficiencies. Progression toward enteral autonomy or a reduction in PN dependency through an increase in formula and solid food intake can be achieved in selected cases in which CODE natural history is associated with improved absorption and food tolerance (Table 1). This requires ongoing follow-up and monitoring with repeated attempts to assess bowel function. Tolerance and absorption can be assessed clinically through measurement of stool output, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distention and in a more objective way through stool absorption studies. These include reducing substances for carbohydrates, elastase and 72-h fat collection for lipids, stool α-1 antitrypsin for protein, and stool electrolytes for electrolyte losses.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (isolyte S) [^115bFNEa]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

General

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

### Retrospective cohort study on the optimal timing of orogastric tube / nasogastric tube insertion in infants with pyloric stenosis [^115HGBCj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants can cause a buildup of gastric contents. Orogastric tubes (OGTs) or nasogastric tubes (NGTs) are often placed in patients with pyloric stenosis before surgical management to prevent aspiration. However, exacerbation of gastric losses may lead to electrolyte abnormalities that can delay surgery, and placement has been associated with increased risk of postoperative emesis. Currently, there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding OGT/NGT placement in these patients. This study examines whether OGT/NGT placement before arrival in the operating room was associated with a longer time to readiness for surgery as defined by normalization of electrolytes. Secondary outcomes included time from surgery to discharge and ability to tolerate feeds by 6 hours postoperatively in patients with and without early OGT/NGT placement.

Methods

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, data were extracted from the medical records of 481 patients who underwent pyloromyotomy for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis from March 2013 to June 2016. Multivariable linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to evaluate the association between placement of an OGT/NGT at the time of admission with increased time to readiness for surgery (defined as the time from admission to the first set of normalized laboratory values) and increased time from surgery to discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between early OGT/NGT placement and the ability to tolerate oral intake at 6 hours postsurgery. Analyses were adjusted for site differences.

Results

Among patients admitted with electrolyte abnormalities, those with an OGT/NGT placed on presentation required more time until their serum electrolytes were at acceptable levels for surgery by regression analysis (19.2 hours difference; 95% confidence interval, 10.05–28.41; P < .001), after adjusting for site. Overall, patients who had OGTs/NGTs placed before presentation in the operating room had a longer length of stay from surgery to discharge than those without (38.8 hours difference; 95% confidence interval, 25.35–52.31; P < .001), after adjusting for site. OGT/NGT placement before surgery was not associated with failure to tolerate oral intake within 6 hours of surgery after adjusting for site, corrected gestational age, and baseline serum electrolytes.

Conclusions

OGT/NGT placement on admission for pyloric stenosis is associated with a longer time to electrolyte correction in infants with abnormal laboratory values on presentation and, subsequently, a longer time until they are ready for surgery. It is also associated with longer postoperative hospital stay but not an increased risk of feeding intolerance within 6 hours of surgical repair.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Gastroparesis in children [^114GiCmb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Management

General approach

The pillars of treatment in gastroparesis include the diagnosis and management of an underlying disease, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, alleviation of symptoms, and maintenance of optimal nutritional status. Patients with mild disease can be managed as outpatients whereas those with severe and life threatening manifestations (e.g. pronounced dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, intractable vomiting) need hospitalization and close monitoring.

Dietary and lifestyle modifications

Management of gastroparesis includes dietary and lifestyle recommendations such as small-volume and frequent meals with low content in fat and non-digestible fibers. Patients are advised to avoid carbonated beverages and lying down for 1 to 2 h following meals. A thorough dietary history must be obtained in order to enlighten the clinician about the caloric intake of the patient and the tolerance of solids and liquids. Referral to a dietician is always warranted.

In cases of severe and persistent symptoms the majority of calories are provided in a liquid form given that liquid emptying is often preserved. Enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube or jejunostomy may be required for patients with severely impaired nutritional status. Total parenteral nutrition is reserved for the most complex patient who fails enteral feeds.

Pharmacologic treatment

There are many agents available for the management of gastroparesis.

Solutions containing calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease. Parenteral calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Solutions containing lactate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

The conversion of lactate to bicarbonate is markedly delayed in the presence of tissue anoxia and reduced capacity of the liver to metabolize lactate. This may occur under conditions such as metabolic acidosis associated with circulatory insufficiency, extracorporeal circulation, hypothermia, glycogen storage disease, liver dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis, shock or cardiac decompensation.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

### Polyethylene glycol-3350, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate [^1118gnzW]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

General

Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE.

Information for Patients

PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE.

Adults drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters. Any unused portion should be discarded. Pediatric patients (aged 6 months or greater) drink 25 mL/kg/hour. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. Any unused portion should be discarded. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear.

Use of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, and SODIUM BICARBONATE in children younger than 2 years of age should be carefully monitored for occurrence of possible hypoglycemia, as this solution has no caloric substrate. Dehydration has been reported in 1 child and hypokalemia has been reported in 3 children.

Drug Interactions

Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of short bowel syndrome: expert review [^114YuUqq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) — enteral nutrition (EN) and tube feeding in adults: There are few published reports of EN support and it appears to be rarely used, but the benefit of tube feeding was demonstrated in a randomized crossover study of 15 adult SBS patients showing increased net absorption. We suggest consideration of EN (ie, tube feeding) in combination with oral feeding in stable patients with SBS-IF and insufficient oral intake when stool output is < 2 L/d and expected gains may allow weaning from parenteral nutrition (PN). For long-term EN, intermittent self-placement of a nasogastric tube or placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube are considerations, and a temporary trial of nasogastric tube feeding should be considered to ensure tolerance. Once enteral access has been obtained, slow continuous infusion into the stomach, rather than bolus or small-bowel infusion, is suggested to maximize intestinal transit time, improve nutrient contact time and absorption, and reduce diarrhea.

### Do we need new prokinetics to reduce enteral feeding intolerance during critical illness? [^1176XXHg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Commentary

A clear consensus definition on acute gastrointestinal injury during critical illness is lacking. Gastrointestinal feeding intolerance (GFI) is usually defined by vomiting, abdominal distention, complaints of discomfort, high nasogastric tube output, high gastric residual volumes (GRVs) measured at intervals, diarrhea, reduced passage of flatus and stool, or abnormal abdominal radiographs. In daily practice, ICU nurses typically assess intolerance solely by measuring GRVs, with common threshold levels for interrupting enteral nutrition (EN) ranging from 200–250 mL. GFI may be encountered in 50% of ventilated patients, depending on the diagnosis, premorbid condition, ventilation mode, medications, and metabolic state.

The recently updated guidelines for adult critically ill patients by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) suggest that, in most patients, it is acceptable to initiate EN in the stomach. Patients should be monitored daily for tolerance of EN and inappropriate cessation of EN should be avoided. Administration should be diverted lower in the gastrointestinal tract (post-pyloric feeding) in patients at high risk for aspiration or in case of gastric EN intolerance.

Now here a clinical dilemma may arise: The most likely routine to monitor GFI is to measure GRV. However, GRVs do not correlate with incidences of pneumonia, regurgitation, or aspiration. GRVs were shown to have very low sensitivity and positive and negative predictive value to predict aspiration. Raising the cutoff value for GRVs (to interrupt EN administration) from 50–150 to 250–500 mL does not increase the incidence of complications. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that it is safe to completely abandon measuring GRV and as a consequence nutritional targets are better achieved, although more vomiting was noticed in one study.

Combining evidence and pragmatism ASPEN/SCCM recommends GRVs not be used as part of routine care to monitor ICU patients receiving EN. However, for those ICUs where GRVs are still utilized, holding EN for GRVs < 500 mL in the absence of other signs of intolerance should be avoided.

Enteral nutrition (EN) order components and supplementary/electronic orders — The EN delivery site with correct route and EAD is described as a critical element of the EN order, and identifying the site for EN and medication administration can decrease the possibility of EN administration via the wrong access when more than 1 port or access device is present. The EN order includes the method of administration (pump, gravity, or bolus), the EN infusion rate, and an infusion schedule that lists infusion times and initial rate or volume, includes an advancement rate/volume and the total volume to be infused within the 24-hour period, identifies volume and frequency for water flushes, and specifies whether EN is given by continuous drip, intermittent drip, cyclic drip, or bolus delivery. Organizations can implement standardized electronic order sets that prevent prescribers from ordering improper administration methods for specific EADs, for example allowing jejunostomy feedings only by continuous feeding administration; supplementary orders can assist with advancement of EN, transitions between PN, EN, and oral diet or care settings, and address HOB elevation, enteral feeding tube care, GRV checks, and monitoring and laboratory parameters. Electronic order sets can help prescribers determine whether a base EN formula provides adequate macronutrient content for a 24-hour period or if modular macronutrients are needed; patients with fluid tolerance limits may need augmentation of base EN formulas with a modular macronutrient to increase calories without additional fluid, populations with high protein needs may need additional protein modulars, and those requiring protein restriction may benefit from carbohydrate or fat modulars. Institutions can include micronutrient, electrolyte, and water content of EN formulas in CPOE information boxes to help prescribers select EN products for patients with electrolyte imbalances or conditions where micronutrients are either not eliminated properly or are depleted with high-volume fluid losses.

### Nutrition and management of enterocutaneous fistula [^112azpcK]. The British Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The management of enterocutaneous fistula is challenging, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. This article reviews treatment, with emphasis on the provision and optimal route of nutritional support.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified using Medline searches. Secondary articles were identified from the reference lists of key papers.

Results and Conclusion

Management of enterocutaneous fistula should initially concentrate on correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, drainage of collections, treatment of sepsis and control of fistula output. The routine use of somatostatin infusion and somatostatin analogues remains controversial; although there are data suggesting reduced time to fistula closure, there is little evidence of increased probability of spontaneous closure. Malnutrition is common and adequate nutritional provision is essential, enteral where possible, although supplemental parenteral nutrition is often required for high-output small bowel fistulas. The role of immunonutrition is unknown. Surgical repair should be attempted when spontaneous fistula closure does not occur, but it should be delayed for at least 3 months.

### Oral rehydration salt solutions for children: a review [^1175uDCv]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Dehydration continues to be a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in children globally. Oral rehydration salts (ORS) solutions can successfully treat mild to moderate dehydration. However, the uptake of this simple and cost-effective intervention remains low in both high-income and low-to-mid-income countries. The low-osmolality ORS solution recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) contains an appropriate balance of electrolytes and glucose that helps effectively absorb water and electrolytes, irrespective of the cause of gastroenteritis. ORS solution can be administered orally in most cases of mild to moderate dehydration; however, a nasogastric tube can be used in cases of oral intolerance in selected cases. The amount of ORS solution required for rehydration depends on the estimates of fluid losses and the child's weight. Severe dehydration could be managed with intravenous fluids initially; however, oral rehydration therapy can be used as soon as the patient is stable. The few contraindications for the use of oral rehydration solution include altered mental status, inability to tolerate oral or nasogastric intake of fluids, underlying gastrointestinal problems such as ileus, anatomical abnormalities, and gut malabsorption. This review describes the use of different ORS solutions in the United States and discusses the newly studied, non-glucose-based ORS solutions. The review also discusses hydration strategies for fluid loss during exercise and in hot environments.

### ACG clinical guideline: nutrition therapy in the adult hospitalized patient [^111EyCe6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) monitoring and tolerance assessment in hospitalized adults should include routine monitoring for tolerance and for adequacy of provision as a percent of target goal calories, cumulative caloric deficit, and inappropriate cessation of EN, while gastric residual volume should not be used routinely as a monitor. In patients at high risk for refeeding syndrome, feeding should be ramped up slowly to goal over 3 to 4 days with careful monitoring of electrolytes and volume status. Enteral feeding protocols should be used, and a validated protocol should be used, such as a volume-based feeding protocol or a multi-strategy (bundled) top-down protocol. Patients on EN should be assessed for risk of aspiration; for those at high risk, proactive steps include use of a prokinetic agent, diverting the level of feeding lower in the GI tract, switching to continuous infusion, and using chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily. For patients receiving EN who develop diarrhea, an evaluation should be initiated to identify an etiology and direct management, and management should use one of three strategies: use of fermentable soluble fiber as an adjunctive supplement to a standard EN formula, switching to a commercial mixed fiber (soluble and insoluble) formula, or initiating a small peptide/MCT oil formula.

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^111LYw8c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Nasogastric tube administration of colonic preparations — NG tubes have been used to instill colonic preparations, primarily PEG-ELS solutions, in both children and adults, and may be required in patients unable to drink fluids or with a significant swallowing disorder; purge preparations (rapid and high-volume) for patients with lower GI bleeding and urgent colonoscopy may require placement and use of a NG tube, but case reports have demonstrated the potential for severe, life-threatening adverse events, such as aspiration, and adjunctive use of prokinetic and antiemetic agents as well as avoidance of overrapid instillation may make this route more tolerable.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^112v6PH1]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Often patients have been admitted with a pathology outside the GI tract such as patients who have had orthopaedic, gynaecological cardiac procedures, or have been admitted with medical (non‐surgical) diagnoses. Patients with pseudo‐obstruction are frequently significantly poly‐morbid and frail and have electrolyte disturbance or acute renal failure. The condition is also described after caesarean section.

There is a high in‐hospital mortality rate associated with this condition (up to 8%). Thus, these patients need to be closely monitored and managed urgently. This may include serial abdominal X‐rays which allow assessment of caecal diameter, a crucial aspect to guide further management. A caecal diameter of 9–12 cm is concerning for impending perforation. Given the high association with renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance, monitoring of serum biochemistry can provide indications that the diagnosis might be that of pseudo‐obstruction but risk profile analysis alone is insufficient to diagnose this condition.

In order to establish the diagnosis of pseudo‐obstruction and exclude any mechanical cause a CT with intravenous contrast may be required. In this setting oral and rectal contrast are not used routinely in the UK and offer little benefit. If rectal contrast is used then a water‐soluble contrast agent such as Gastrografin should be used, because of the risk of perforation.

Question 5.8

What are the initial treatment options in pseudo‐obstruction?

Recommendation: Identification and correction of any renal dysfunction or electrolyte abnormality and review of prescribed medications is appropriate. Provided the patient remains stable with no peritonism or tenderness over the caecum and the caecal diameter is < 12 cm, conservative management can be continued for 48–72 h.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: C

Consensus: 100% (SA 55.6%, A 44.4%)

Pseudo‐obstruction is associated with electrolyte disturbance and acute renal failure. Careful correction of these disturbances can be associated with resolution of the pseudo‐obstruction in the absence of any further management. Calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium levels should be monitored and corrected as required. Acetylcholine enhances motor transit and peristalsis in the human colon. Therefore, any disturbance or reduction in acetylcholine production increases the risk of pseudo‐obstruction. Accordingly, a careful review of prescribed medications is required to exclude, where possible, any opiate or anticholinergic medications. Nasogastric tube decompression may be considered along with increasing patient mobility or simple frequent positional changes in bed including lying on the abdomen, if possible.

### Bowel preparation before colonoscopy [^115uFMEN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

High-volume polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solutions (PEG-ELS) — PEG-ELS is one of the most common methods of cleansing the colon, and large volumes (4 L) have traditionally been used; although 4-L PEG-ELS is not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to be administered in a split-dose fashion, evidence indicates that using 4-L split-dose PEG-ELS is considered the current criterion standard colonoscopy preparation. Despite general tolerability, 5% to 15% of patients do not complete the preparation because of poor palatability and/or large volume. Clinical trials show no significant physiologic changes in weight, vital signs, serum electrolytes, blood chemistries, or complete blood counts, and histologic features of the colonic mucosa are not altered, permitting use in suspected inflammatory bowel disease. PEG-ELS is considered generally safe for patients with pre-existing electrolyte imbalances and for those who cannot tolerate a significant sodium load. Routine addition of prokinetic agents or bisacodyl to 4-L PEG-ELS does not improve tolerance or colonic cleansing, and enemas do not improve efficacy but increase discomfort. For administration, these preparations work most effectively when ingested quickly, for example 240 mL every 10 minutes. Reported adverse events include nausea with and without vomiting, abdominal pain, rare pulmonary aspiration, Mallory-Weiss tear, pancreatitis, colitis, lavage-induced pill malabsorption, cardiac arrhythmia, and exacerbation of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. PEG-ELS gut lavage via nasogastric tube is described as the most effective method for colonic cleansing in infants and children.

WARNINGS

Dehydration: Administration of hypertonic
Gastrografin solutions may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension due
to fluid loss from the intestine. A 1 in 4.6 (1:4.6) dilution of Gastrografin
yields an approximately isotonic 16.5 percent diatrizoate salts solution;
less dilute solutions are hypertonic and may lead to intraluminal
movement of fluid with resulting hypovolemia. In young or debilitated
children and in elderly cachectic persons, the loss of plasma fluid
may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state. If Gastrografin is
used in infants and children (under 10 kg) or in dehydrated or debilitated
patients, the solution must be prepared using the specific dilutions
described in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In
debilitated patients and in patients with electrolyte imbalances,
postprocedural monitoring of hydration, serum osmolarity, electrolytes
and clinical status is essential. In pediatric or severely debilitated
patients, the maintenance of an open intravenous fluid line for rehydration
may be advisable should hypotension or shock supervene. Electrolyte
disturbances must be corrected prior to the administration of any
hypertonic Gastrografin solutions.

Aspiration: Aspiration of Gastrografin into the trachea and airways
may result in serious pulmonary complications including, pulmonary
edema, pneumonitis or death Bronchial entry of any orally administered
contrast medium causes a copious osmotic effusion. Therefore, avoid
use of Gastrografin in patients with esophagotracheal fistula and
minimize risks for pulmonary aspiration in all patients. If Gastrografin
is given by nasogastric tube, the position of the tube in the stomach
must be verified before administration.

Anaphylactic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, including
fatalities, have been reported with the use of Gastrografin. Patients
at increased risk include those with a history of a previous reaction
to a contrast medium, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine,
and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity (bronchial asthma,
hay fever, and food allergies). Medical personnel trained in the treatment
of anaphylactic reactions and the necessary drugs and medical equipment
should always be readily available when Gastrografin is used.

Microvillous inclusion disease

Microvillous inclusion disease (MVID) is an autosomal recessive enteropathy characterized by profuse neonatal diarrhea resulting in malabsorption, dehydration, and electrolyte derangements. The most common cause of MVID results from biallelic mutations in MYO5B gene (MIM #). However, UNC45A and STX3 gene mutations have also been reported to cause cellular phenotype similar to MVID (MIM #and #619445, respectively). Mutations in these genes lead to abnormal cytoskeletal motor proteins that in turn affect intestinal cell structure and primarily cause a loss of sodium fluid absorption, also known as electrolyte transport induced diarrhea.

Children with MVID commonly experience high stool volume losses between 150 and 400 mL/kg/d associated with severe dehydration, metabolic acidosis, impaired renal function, and mild/severe hyponatremia. Low urine sodium with low fractional Na excretion, high urine osmolality, and hyperaldosteronism with high urine potassium are common findings. Stool output and electrolyte derangements are exacerbated by enteral intake secondary to minimal absorptive capability and lack of intestinal transporters. Exacerbation of stool output with enteral intake leads to limitations to oral intake and primary dependence on parenteral support with some variation in tolerance, as in the case of STX3 gene mutation. Cholestatic liver disease can be expressed among this cohort as part of the phenotype as well as secondary to intestinal failure-associated liver disease due to long-term dependence on PN.

There is no medical treatment capable of overcoming the intestinal failure, with the mainstay of treatment centered around parenteral support and decreasing the risk of associated comorbid conditions. Surgically, intestinal transplantation has shown promise, and subtotal enterectomy as a means to better control bowel losses or as a bridge to transplantation has been recently described.

### Successful management of chronic high-output ileostomy with high dose loperamide [^111zGcRd]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

High-stoma output is a common problem that can lead to dehydration and electrolyte disturbance. The following report describes three patients with end ileostomy who had high-stoma outputs where conventional medical management was unsuccessful in controlling stoma output. All three patients responded to high-dose loperamide, resulting in significant clinical improvement. High-dose loperamide therapy should be considered in patients with high-stoma output who have failed conventional medical management.
