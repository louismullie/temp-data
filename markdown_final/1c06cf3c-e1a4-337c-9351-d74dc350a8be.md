## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about functional movement disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining functional movement disorder and its place within functional neurological disorders. Then, I should verify the diagnostic shift from exclusion to positive rule-in criteria. Next, I will examine core clinical features and bedside signs, followed by epidemiology and risk factors. After that, I need to review pathophysiology and neurobiology. Then, I will appraise diagnostic tools and biomarkers, including electrophysiology and imaging. I should also consider special phenotypes and comorbidities, outline evidence-based treatment and prognosis, and finally identify pitfalls, controversies, and future directions, making sure I double-check claims against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and nosology. Functional movement disorder is a motor subtype of functional neurological disorder characterized by abnormal movements that are internally inconsistent, incongruent with recognized neurological disease, and variably responsive to distraction, with preserved capacity for normal movement despite the symptom experience of involuntariness, which aligns with DSM-5 and contemporary reviews emphasizing a positive, rule-in diagnosis rather than exclusion [^e52b7c0b] [^eb4523a1] [^46623288].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic paradigm shift. Historically framed as "psychogenic" or a diagnosis of exclusion, FMD is now diagnosed by positive clinical signs such as distractibility, entrainment, variability, and incongruence, with DSM-5 removing the requirement for identifiable psychological stressors, reflecting a biopsychosocial model rather than a purely psychological causation model [^e52b7c0b] [^46623288] [^eb4523a1].

> I will now examine the core clinical features. Key bedside signs include distractibility with improvement during attentional redirection, entrainment of tremor to a paced rhythm, Hoover's sign in functional limb weakness, give-way weakness, and motor inconsistency across tasks; these signs, when present, support a confident positive diagnosis and are preferred over pejorative labels like "psychogenic" to facilitate acceptance and engagement [^e52b7c0b] [^7c1bbd0a] [^3ce078b2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about epidemiology without checking ranges. Prevalence estimates vary by setting, with FMD comprising roughly 3–6% of movement disorder clinic cases and an incidence around 4–5 per 100,000 person-years; female predominance is commonly reported, though some cohorts show a smaller gap, and onset spans adolescence through older adulthood, including a meaningful proportion with onset after 60 years [^af5036d9] [^b463d95f] [^06a928be].

> Next, I should review risk factors and precipitants. Female sex, psychiatric comorbidity, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, and fluctuating courses are more frequent in FMD, while physical precipitants such as injury, infection, or medical procedures are common at onset; adverse childhood experiences and trauma history also associate with risk, supporting a multifactorial model rather than a single-cause explanation [^413b8f33] [^e1b72f98] [^fd3ff8ea].

> Let me consider the neurobiology carefully. Contemporary models implicate three interacting processes: misdirected attention to movement, abnormal predictive beliefs and expectations, and a disrupted sense of agency, with convergent neuroimaging and electrophysiology showing hypoactivation of premotor/supplementary motor areas, increased limbic–motor coupling, and abnormal beta synchronization during movement preparation; these findings sit within a predictive coding framework where priors override sensory evidence, producing movements experienced as involuntary [^eb4523a1] [^b385d792] [^82f60127] [^a61fce59].

> I should double-check diagnostic adjuncts. Electrophysiology can support the diagnosis in tremor and myoclonus phenotypes by demonstrating entrainment, variability, and patterns inconsistent with organic disease, while neuroimaging reveals network-level abnormalities but remains adjunctive rather than standalone; emerging biomarkers such as contingent negative variation and drift-diffusion metrics suggest slowed information processing and attentional deficits, though most are not yet validated for individual diagnosis [^f6a4f8bd] [^7c1bbd0a] [^82f60127] [^a61fce59].

> But wait, what about special phenotypes and overlaps. Functional dystonia is diagnostically challenging due to variability and overlap with organic dystonia, with proposed subtypes including mobile and fixed forms; functional tics surged during the COVID-19 era and can mimic organic tics but often show adult onset, absent premonitory urges, and social media exposure; cranial functional movement disorders such as convergence spasm and unilateral platysmal spasm are underrecognized yet diagnostically informative when identified [^ea2301a8] [^29b18814] [^d7af624c] [^60ea24d5] [^31d44f25].

> I need to ensure I cover comorbidity and functional overlays. Anxiety, depression, dissociation, pain, and fatigue are common and correlate with severity, and functional neurological symptoms frequently coexist with organic disease, including Parkinson's disease, where FMD may even precede motor PD in some cases; this mandates careful phenotyping and avoidance of premature closure [^72d51db7] [^f0033b19] [^1f99221a].

> Next, I should review treatment and prognosis. Early, clear explanation of the diagnosis as real and potentially reversible, combined with multidisciplinary rehabilitation, is foundational; specialized physiotherapy targeting movement retraining, attentional redirection, and self-management yields meaningful improvements, and randomized data show multidisciplinary care improves symptoms and quality of life versus nondirected support; prognosis is heterogeneous, with about 40–60% improving meaningfully at 1–2 years, and early diagnosis and treatment are consistently associated with better outcomes [^e52b7c0b] [^d7527b8a] [^6f9cbd0b] [^06a928be].

> Hold on, I should verify pitfalls and controversies. Misdiagnosis risk persists, especially in dystonia and tics, and some patients carry both functional and organic disease; stigma and patient disbelief remain barriers to engagement; while neuromodulation such as TMS shows preliminary signals, evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so it should not be offered outside trials; and although historical features can assist prediction, they must not replace examination-based positive signs in diagnostic decision-making [^38dcc213] [^0170154e] [^413b8f33] [^e52b7c0b].

> Let me reconsider future directions to ensure completeness. Standardized outcome measures and core domains are being refined to harmonize research; digital and VR-based interventions are being explored to leverage attentional retraining; and efforts to integrate neurobiological insights into personalized, culturally adapted care are underway, with particular attention to underrepresented populations and longitudinal trajectories [^40cb87c5] [^3f87a616] [^af5036d9].

> In summary, functional movement disorder is a genuine neurological disorder diagnosed by positive clinical signs of inconsistency, incongruence, and distractibility, driven by attentional, belief-based, and agency-related mechanisms within distributed brain networks; early, biopsychosocial, multidisciplinary care that includes education, movement retraining, and psychological support offers the best chance for recovery, and clinicians should remain vigilant for overlaps with organic disease while avoiding stigmatizing language and unnecessary testing [^e52b7c0b] [^eb4523a1] [^d7527b8a].

Functional movement disorder (FMD) is a **positive clinical diagnosis** characterized by abnormal movements that are inconsistent, incongruent with organic disease, and distractible, with a preserved capacity for normal movement [^e52b7c0b] [^eb4523a1]. It is common in neurology practice and often disabling, yet **prognosis is better with early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care** [^e52b7c0b] [^d7527b8a]. Key features include abrupt onset, variability, and response to distraction; common phenotypes are tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, and gait disorders [^7c1bbd0a] [^3ce078b2]. Pathophysiology involves abnormal attention, beliefs, and agency, with limbic–motor network dysfunction and impaired sense of agency [^eb4523a1] [^b385d792]. Management centers on **education, physiotherapy, and psychotherapy**, with emerging evidence for neuromodulation; early intervention improves outcomes [^d7527b8a] [^0170154e].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

- **Positive clinical signs**: Inconsistency, incongruence, distractibility, and entrainment are hallmark features [^e52b7c0b] [^7c1bbd0a].
- **Common phenotypes**: Tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, gait disorders, and functional weakness are frequent [^7c1bbd0a] [^3ce078b2].
- **Ancillary tests**: Electrophysiology (EMG, accelerometry) and neuroimaging can support diagnosis but are not definitive [^f6a4f8bd] [^b385d792].
- **Diagnostic criteria**: DSM-5 supports a positive diagnosis based on clinical features, not exclusion [^46623288].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Attention and beliefs**: Abnormal attentional focus and maladaptive beliefs about symptoms are central [^eb4523a1] [^a93d73a5].
- **Agency**: Impaired sense of agency contributes to movements perceived as involuntary [^eb4523a1] [^56662dd3].
- **Network dysfunction**: Limbic–motor interactions and hypoactivation of motor control regions are implicated [^b385d792] [^a74f58a9].
- **Predictive coding**: Aberrant predictive processing may underlie symptom generation [^eb4523a1] [^a61fce59].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

FMD accounts for **3–6% of movement disorder clinic referrals**, with a female predominance and mean onset around age 40–50 [^af5036d9] [^06a928be]. Risk factors include female sex, psychiatric comorbidity, trauma, and exposure to neurological illness in the family [^413b8f33] [^a380521e].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

- **Education**: Clear, non-stigmatizing explanation of the diagnosis is essential [^e52b7c0b] [^d2ac6f3e].
- **Physiotherapy**: Movement retraining and attentional strategies are first-line [^e52b7c0b] [^3ff58c7a].
- **Psychotherapy**: CBT and related approaches address beliefs and coping [^e52b7c0b] [^d7527b8a].
- **Neuromodulation**: TMS shows promise but needs larger trials [^0170154e].
- **Prognosis**: Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcomes; ~40% improve at 1 year, but chronicity and disability are common without care [^06a928be] [^6f9cbd0b].

---

## Challenges and controversies

Misdiagnosis is common due to overlap with organic disease and **lack of biomarkers** [^f6a4f8bd] [^38dcc213]. Stigma persists, and patients often face disbelief or inadequate care [^eeaac5d9]. Research gaps remain, including limited RCTs and unclear optimal treatment combinations [^e52b7c0b] [^46623288].

---

Functional movement disorder is a **real, treatable neurological disorder** with distinct clinical features and a biopsychosocial pathophysiology. Early, positive diagnosis and multidisciplinary care yield the best outcomes, and ongoing research is refining diagnostics and therapies [^e52b7c0b] [^eb4523a1].

### Tics and functional tic-like movements: can we tell them apart? [^c6305689]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Within the broad spectrum of movement disorders, tics and functional tic-like movements belong to a particular clinical category. Both types of movements are within the range of normal movement kinematics and muscle synergies, but appear repetitive and without appropriate context embedment. Historically, there have been many attempts to separate the 2 types of movements, but because of their phenomenological overlap, clinical distinction may be prone to error, and misdiagnoses may often occur. Most importantly, the 2 types of movement may coexist. Here, we review the available literature on the 2 types of motor phenomena and demonstrate some of the difficulties in distinguishing tics from functional tic-like movements on clinical grounds. We also highlight similarities and differences in pathophysiologic characteristics, documenting the significance of action monitoring, attentional allocation, and behavioral reinforcement in both types of movements, as well as in their risk factors. We discuss the overlap of current behavioral treatments for tics and functional tic-like movements and emphasize implications of diagnostic mislabeling. Such implications include the need to tailor behavioral treatment approaches to individual phenomenological profiles and guiding decision making for severe patients requiring invasive interventions, such as deep brain stimulation. A deeper insight from clinicians with respect to persisting challenges in classifying and differentiating these motor phenomena could accelerate the development of reliable clinical and physiologic markers (i.e., next generation phenotyping) and a neurobiology-driven therapeutic approach for these motor phenomena.

The aim of the present study was to examine which of the clinical characteristics and associated features mentioned in the literature are discriminative between FMDs and non‐FMDs. These factors might assist clinicians to identify patients suspected for FMDs before phenotyping and alert them to focus on positive symptoms during clinical examination. In addition, a preliminary model was developed to predict the likelihood of an FMD in a movement disorder patient.

Step 3. Could the movement disorder be functional?

Functional movement disorders can either be hyper‐ or hypokinetic, with the first being much more prevalent. The diagnosis of a functional movement disorder is no longer made per exclusion, but should be a positive diagnosis, based on features in the history and examination. 17 These features are abrupt onset, varying (severity of) symptoms, and a temporary decrease of symptoms when the patient is distracted. Specifically in the case of tremor or jerky movements, entrainment can be objectified, a phenomenon in which the involuntary movements copy the rhythm of an externally cued voluntary movement (like finger‐tapping). 18 In functional dystonia, the posturing is frequently fixed instead of mobile. 18 Additional features pointing in the direction of a functional movement disorder include a history of unexplained medical symptoms, prominent pain, paroxysmal symptoms, and sometimes a physical or psychosocial trigger and selective disability. 19 Despite these characteristics, it sometimes remains difficult to distinguish functional movement disorders from non‐functional ones, and they can coincide in the same patient.

Step 4. Determine the clinical syndrome

We denote the clinical syndrome as the constellation of all clinical features, including different movement disorders, as well as additional neurological signs (such as spasticity, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, deafness, blindness, and cognitive difficulties) and non‐neurological signs (including dysmorphisms, skin and psychiatric abnormalities [e.g. obsessive–compulsive disorder, behavioural changes, apathy]). Sometimes the clinical syndrome strongly points to a specific diagnosis and prompts directed genetic testing. However, in children, clinical syndromes are usually less distinct. In these cases, it is advisable to select the main movement disorder as the starting point for diagnostic testing. In the following section we outline the basic approach grouped by the main movement disorder phenotype. We also provide references to diagnostic algorithms for some specific movement disorders.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^12ab21f6]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

It is concluded that 10 clinical characteristics and associated features described in the literature are discriminative between patients with hyperkinetic FMDs and non‐FMDs in a large retrospective tertiary clinic cohort. The features sex, age of onset, psychiatric history, family history, more than one motor phenotype, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day were not only suggestive but also discriminative between our two patient groups. A preliminary predictive model combining these factors might help clinicians to identify patients suspected to have FMDs before phenotyping and create awareness to test for positive symptoms. However, this concept needs extensive further testing and validation in prospective studies in more representative cohorts.

### Functional movement disorder as a prodromal symptom of Parkinson's disease-clinical and pathophysiological insights [^f0033b19]. Movement Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional movement disorder (FMD) is a common manifestation of functional neurological disorder. FMD can occur alongside other neurological conditions, but especially in patients with established Parkinson's disease (PD). An interesting observation emerging across cohort studies and case series is that FMD can precede the diagnosis of PD, suggesting that FMD may itself be a prodromal symptom of neurodegeneration. Such a notion would have significant clinical implications for the assessment and management of people with FMD, particularly with respect to decisions around the use of auxiliary investigations, counselling, and follow-up. In this Viewpoint we review the evidence concerning the temporal relationship between FMD and PD. We discuss the potential explanations and mechanisms for FMD as a prodromal symptom of PD, and highlight clinical considerations and important outstanding questions in the field. © 2024 The Author(s).

### The neuroimaging evidence of brain abnormalities in functional movement disorders [^b385d792]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Neuroimaging has been pivotal in identifying and reframing our understanding of functional movement disorders. If accessible, it compensates for the limitations of the clinical exam and is especially useful where there is overlap of functional symptoms with classical presentations of disease. Imaging in functional movement disorders has increasingly identified structural and functional abnormalities that implicate hypoactivation of the cortical and subcortical motor pathways and increased modulation by the limbic system. Neurobiological theories suggest an impaired sense of agency, faulty top-down regulation of motor movement and abnormal emotional processing in these individuals. This framework challenges our traditional understanding of functional movement disorders as distinct from the deceptive term of 'organic' diseases and proposes that these conditions are not considered as mutually exclusive. This update summarizes the literature to date and explores the role of imaging in the diagnosis of functional movement disorders and in detecting its underlying molecular network.

Introduction

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Although several studies have demonstrated the large share of FMDs in neurology outpatients, with frequencies ranging from 15% to 33% [1, 2], they are still underrepresented in neurology training programs and one of the most common reasons for referral to movement disorder specialists [3]. A possible explanation for this high referral rate is the concern about missing an 'organic' disorder; however, studies show that the number of misdiagnoses is actually low [4, 5]. This fear may also lead to unnecessary expensive laboratory and imaging tests, which cause even more delay, whilst early diagnosis seems to be one of the strongest prognostic factors for good outcome in FMD patients [6].

In the original criteria by Fahn and Williams, various clinical and historical characteristics were labeled with degrees of diagnostic certainty for FMDs, historically also called 'psychogenic', 'conversion' or 'non‐organic' disorders [7, 8]. These authors proposed to separate historical clues, such as psychiatric disturbance, abrupt onset, inconsistency over time and pain, from clinical clues, such as inconsistency, incongruence and distractibility. The historical clues were presumed to be suggestive for a diagnosis, whilst the clinical clues were used to establish a diagnosis of an FMD. Over the years, various studies provided strong evidence for the historical clues female gender, educational status, early age of onset, previous expansion to a disease model, paroxysmal disease course, dissociative symptoms, and fatigue as additional risk factors for FMD [9, 10, 11, 12], whereas limited evidence was published for employment in a health profession, witnessing an organic movement disorder in a family member, relational status and possible secondary gain [13, 14]. In addition to this expansion of historical clues, in patients with tremor and myoclonus electrophysiological testing turned out to be of value in cases where the clinical diagnosis remained uncertain [15, 16]. In the current DSM‐5 criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013), former historical clues are now called 'associated features' or 'clinical characteristics' [17]. Still, these factors are considered supportive, whereas a definite diagnosis should be based on positive clinical findings at examination showing clear evidence of incompatibility with recognized neurological disease.

Results

In all, 1009 patients above 18 years were detected in the database. Of these, 99 were excluded due to a lack of a final or a non‐movement disorder clinical diagnosis, and 36 due to more than one diagnosis (an FMD plus non‐FMD). A total of 874 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study, of whom 554 (63%) had a non‐FMD, including tremor 131 (24%), myoclonus 51 (10%), dystonia 257 (46%) and others 115 (20%). The remaining 320 (37%) were diagnosed with an FMD. In this group, the key symptom was tremor in 66 patients (21%), myoclonus in 102 patients (32%), dystonia in 82 patients (26%) and others (21%). In the non‐FMD group, 224 patients (40%) had more than one motor phenotype including dystonic tremor in 36%, myoclonus‐dystonia in 10%, medication‐induced movement disorders in 9%, and in the remaining 45% several other combinations were detected. In our FMD group 70 (24%) of the patients had more than one hyperkinetic movement disorder. All patients were diagnosed by an experienced movement disorder specialist. In more than 50% of the patients with functional tremor or myoclonus the diagnosis was supported by electrophysiological testing. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of age at onset and the frequency of the associated categorical features for patients with FMDs versus non‐FMDs. It was assumed that clinical characteristics, such as medical history or family history, were reported properly by the attending physician and therefore these items were scored as absent when they were not reported. In the case of unreported associated features, such as pain or fatigue, these missing values were replaced by absent. The percentage of missing values that were replaced is reported in the last column of the table. In FMD patients, symptoms had a significantly higher age of onset than in non‐FMD patients. The features sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day were more common (P < 0.01) in patients with FMDs, whilst more than one motor phenotype and positive family history were more prevalent in patients with non‐FMDs (P < 0.01). The frequency of cognitive symptoms and medical history did not significantly differ between our two groups.

### Functional movement disorders [^170d2bf0]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review highlights the most relevant recent developments in the field of functional movement disorders (FMD).

Recent Findings

The emphasis on making a 'positive' diagnosis has driven a renewed interest in assessing the value of simple clinical signs. Furthermore, an effort has been made to develop and test objective diagnostic tools. The association of FMD with several comorbidities is being acknowledged. Pathophysiological understanding has grown with the identification of new neurobiological abnormalities, including a decreased interoceptive sensitivity. Finally - and most importantly - the recognition of the potential benefits of specialized physiotherapy is changing FMD management.

Summary

The field of FMD is moving forward on a number of fronts, including diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. A major priority for future research is providing robust evidence regarding treatment.

### Functional tics: expanding the phenotypes of functional movement disorders? [^d7af624c]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Until the outbreak reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, functional tics were considered to be a relatively rare clinical phenotype, as opposed to other functional movement disorders such as functional tremor and dystonia. To better characterize this phenotype, we compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic and those of patients with other functional movement disorders.

Methods

Data from 110 patients were collected at the same neuropsychiatry centre: 66 consecutive patients who developed functional tics without other functional motor symptoms or neurodevelopmental tics and 44 patients with a mix of functional dystonia, tremor, gait, and myoclonus.

Results

Both groups were characterized by female sex preponderance (70%-80%) and (sub)acute onset of functional symptoms (~80%). However, patients with functional tics had a significantly earlier age at onset of functional symptoms (21 vs. 39years). Exposure to relevant social media content was reported by almost half of the patients with functional tics, but by none of the patients with other functional movement disorders. Comorbidity profiles were similar, with relatively high rates of anxiety/affective symptoms and other functional neurological symptoms (nonepileptic attacks).

Conclusions

Patients who developed functional tics during the pandemic represent a phenotypic variant of the wider group of patients with functional movement disorders, associated with younger age at onset and influenced by pandemic-related factors, including increased exposure to specific social media content. Diagnostic protocols and treatment interventions should be tailored to address the specific features of this newly defined phenotype.

### Characteristics and prognosis of functional movement disorders in China: FMD-China registry study [^3ebc634b]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Method

2.1 Diagnosis of Functional Movement Disorders and Phenotype Classification

This prospective registry study (ClinicalTrials NCT05667935) was conducted between January 2022 and December 2024, recruiting a total of 119 patients from the movement disorders clinics of 22 centers across China. We included adult patients (age ≥ 18) who met the Fahn & Williams diagnostic criteria based on inclusive clinical characteristics for FMD and were willing to participate and cooperate in completing follow‐up. Exclusion criteria were patients with concurrent definitive organic movement disorders (such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), those unable to cooperate with completing relevant examinations and follow‐up. To ensure diagnostic accuracy, a two‐step procedure was implemented. Initially, at baseline, a movement disorder specialist pre‐enrolled 154 patients with clinical interviews, physical examinations, and utilized electrophysiological studies (such as electromyography, nerve conduction velocity tests) and neuroimaging modalities (including magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography) for initial diagnosis. Subsequently, a panel of multi‐center movement disorder experts reviewed each case, making the final diagnosis by integrating comprehensive medical histories and video recordings from all sub‐centers within 2 weeks after being uploaded. Ultimately, we included 119 FMD patients for subsequent data analysis, and follow‐up details can be found in the Data S1. Movement disorder phenotypes were classified according to the FMD‐GAP study framework. Categorizing patients with co‐existing movement disorder manifestations as the mixed type, while others were classified based on their predominant motor symptom. At the same time, we also counted the frequency of occurrence of motor and non‐motor symptoms. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital (approval number: 2021–313), ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines for human subject research.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^413b8f33]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and purpose

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Over the years several associated features have been shown to be suggestive for FMDs. Which features mentioned in the literature are discriminative between FMDs and non‐FMDs were examined in a large cohort. In addition, a preliminary prediction model distinguishing these disorders was developed based on differentiating features.

Method

Medical records of all consecutive patients who visited our hyperkinetic outpatient clinic from 2012 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed and 12 associated features in FMDs versus non‐FMDs were compared. An independent t test for age of onset and Pearson chi‐squared analyses for all categorical variables were performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a preliminary predictive model for FMDs.

Results

A total of 874 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 320 had an FMD and 554 a non‐FMD. Differentiating features between these groups were age of onset, sex, psychiatric history, family history, more than one motor phenotype, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day. Based on these a preliminary predictive model was computed with a discriminative value of 91%.

Discussion

Ten associated features are shown to be not only suggestive but also discriminative between hyperkinetic FMDs and non‐FMDs. Clinicians can use these features to identify patients suspected for FMDs and can subsequently alert them to test for positive symptoms at examination. Although a first preliminary model has good predictive accuracy, further validation should be performed prospectively in a multi‐center study.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^6757a8f1]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our retrospective study had some limitations. In different associated features, missing values from the medical records were replaced by absent. Clearly, this can result in an underestimation as well as an overestimation of each of these features. The number of replacements was low, however. As already mentioned, the threshold for medical history was set low, whereas the threshold for cognitive symptoms was set very high. Structured questions are required to study these features. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the clinical characteristics and associated features were used to make the diagnosis (diagnostic suspicion bias), although the diagnosis of FMD should preferably be made on positive symptoms. This is difficult to rule out. Prospective studies are required to further elucidate which features have additional discriminative value.

Despite the limitations, the discriminative capacity of several associated features and our preliminary model are promising. Prospective studies to validate our results in more representative and dominant motor phenotype matched cohorts in academic and non‐academic hospitals are required. These prospective studies should involve systematic assessments with questionnaires and clearly defined variables, including educational status, dissociative symptoms, medical disability and relational status. Future predictive models could assist to identify FMDs earlier, lowering referral rates and resulting in a reduction of medical costs. Even more important, early recognition might lead to earlier treatment which is critical for long‐term outcome in these patients.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^612a8432]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Using this equation, it is possible in our cohort to predict whether a patient has an FMD. For example, a patient with depression in his medical history and a negative family history, who is tired because of progressive, non‐painful dystonic posturing of his right foot since the age of 30, with an abrupt onset of his symptoms and fluctuations during the day has a predicted probability of being diagnosed with a FMD of 92%.

Clinical characteristics and associated features

The following items from the database were used for this study: sex, age of onset, more than one motor phenotype, medical history, psychiatric history, cognitive symptoms, family history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day. Apart from gender and age of onset, the features were dichotomized as present or absent. Medical history was scored present in the case of at least one previous, non‐psychiatric medical condition. This also included previous functional medical disorders, such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. Thresholds for the features psychiatric history and cognitive symptoms had to be set high because of the retrospective study design. Only in patients with an established psychiatric diagnosis (e.g. depression, post‐traumatic stress disorder) was psychiatric history scored as present and only in cases of intellectual disability (general learning disabilities and mental retardation), or when a patient was diagnosed with a dementia syndrome, were cognitive symptoms scored as present. The item family history was scored present if a patient had a first‐degree relative with a movement disorder. The database did not contain sufficient information about education, employment, medical disability, relationship status, life events or any dissociative symptoms and it was not possible to define and extract possible secondary gain from the charts. Therefore, these factors could not be analyzed in the current study. Note that all other factors from former literature and current criteria were included. During the extraction of the data from the medical records, it was assumed that if features such as pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning, and fluctuations during the day were not mentioned in the medical records, these were of such little impact that they could be replaced by absent.

Statistical analysis

Clinical characteristics and associated features were compared for patients with hyperkinetic FMDs versus non‐FMDs. An independent t test for age of onset, the only continuous variable, and Pearson chi‐squared analyses for all categorical variables were performed. Due to the number of tests, the significance level was set at α = 0.01.

The significant variables were submitted to a multivariate logistic regression model for the prediction of FMD. The ability of our model to identify patients with FMDs was quantified as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The adequacy of the fitted model was tested using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness‐of‐fit statistic. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 23 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

### Characteristics and prognosis of functional movement disorders in China: FMD-China registry study [^af5036d9]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by motor or sensory dysfunction with well‐defined clinical features. Rather than being a diagnosis of exclusion, FND is identified by positive "rule‐in" signs: symptoms are internally inconsistent (e.g. varying with distraction) and incongruent with recognized patterns of neurological or medical disease. Epidemiological studies report an FND incidence ranging from 4 to 12 cases per 100,000 person‐years. Within FND subtypes, Functional Movement Disorders (FMDs) demonstrate an annual incidence of 4–5 cases per 100,000 person‐years, constituting a significant proportion of FND cases. Our recent multicenter registry study of specialized movement disorders clinics in China found that FMDs represent 6.23% of cases, aligning with the 3%‐6% prevalence of FMDs reported in Western populations. Despite these substantial incidence rates, FMDs remain underinvestigated, with critical gaps persisting in our understanding of their pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies — particularly within the Chinese population.

The literature has established several characteristic clinical features of FMDs. Epidemiological data consistently reveal a female predominance, with women demonstrating greater susceptibility than men. Patients with FMDs show significantly higher rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety, compared to those with other neurological conditions. Longitudinal evidence further indicates that adverse childhood experiences may predispose individuals to FMDs in adulthood. Currently, most FMD research derives from Western populations, while Asian studies, particularly from China, remain scarce. As FMDs represent complex biopsychosocial disorders, comprehensive phenotyping across diverse ethnic and cultural contexts is crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and optimizing therapeutic approaches.

To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a registry study focusing on China's Han population, with the objective of systematically characterizing the demographic, clinical, and neuropsychiatric scale of FMD patients in this ethnic group. Here, this investigation (1) delineates the baseline clinical characteristics of Chinese FMD patients, (2) documents their one‐year clinical trajectories, and (3) identifies potential prognostic factors through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Generally, our results provide foundational data for understanding FMD manifestations in the Chinese context and offer preliminary insights to guide both future research directions and clinical decision‐making.

### Pediatric movement disorders [^dbdb738d]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pediatric movement disorders are a heterogeneous group of symptoms that occur in the context of a large number of different neurological diseases. Accurate diagnosis and quantification of these disorders is essential for determining outcome, appropriate treatment, and criteria for inclusion in research trials. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in diagnosis and treatment for childhood movement disorders.

Recent Findings

The ultimate goal is to discover new treatments that can lead to measurable improvement in functional outcome for affected children. In order to accomplish this goal, we must have consistent definitions and accurate measurements to determine the diagnosis and severity for each child in a clinic or research trial. Recent progress in defining childhood movement disorders has led to consensus definitions of different types of hypertonia. There has also been progress in the development of outcome measures that relate to meaningful functional performance in a variety of skill areas. Most exciting is the prospect of new treatments, and we survey the current non-medical, medical, and surgical therapies for childhood motor disorders.

Summary

Although pediatric movement disorders are a complex and often poorly understood group of symptoms, recent work has shown that there is a possibility of defining, measuring, and ultimately treating these debilitating diseases.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^620ddb22]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Over the years several associated features have been shown to be suggestive for FMDs. Which features mentioned in the literature are discriminative between FMDs and non-FMDs were examined in a large cohort. In addition, a preliminary prediction model distinguishing these disorders was developed based on differentiating features.

Method

Medical records of all consecutive patients who visited our hyperkinetic outpatient clinic from 2012 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed and 12 associated features in FMDs versus non-FMDs were compared. An independent t test for age of onset and Pearson chi-squared analyses for all categorical variables were performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a preliminary predictive model for FMDs.

Results

A total of 874 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 320 had an FMD and 554 a non-FMD. Differentiating features between these groups were age of onset, sex, psychiatric history, family history, more than one motor phenotype, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day. Based on these a preliminary predictive model was computed with a discriminative value of 91%.

Discussion

Ten associated features are shown to be not only suggestive but also discriminative between hyperkinetic FMDs and non-FMDs. Clinicians can use these features to identify patients suspected for FMDs and can subsequently alert them to test for positive symptoms at examination. Although a first preliminary model has good predictive accuracy, further validation should be performed prospectively in a multi-center study.

### Functional movement disorders [^40a9d7ae]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review highlights the clinical presentation of functional movement disorders (FMDs) and presents current evidence on bedside signs and paraclinical tests to differentiate them from other neurological disorders.

Recent Findings

FMDs are diagnosed by the presence of positive clinical signs as emphasized in the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 classification criteria. Bedside signs are numerous, and a subset of them has been validated in controlled studies. This review summarizes evidence from the literature on specificity and sensibility of positive clinical signs for FMDs. The value of rule-in paraclinical tests to confirm the diagnosis is also presented. Recent developments in neuroscience with pathophysiological mechanisms and current treatment strategies are also discussed.

Summary

FMDs represent a field of neurology that is currently rapidly growing in terms of research. Clinicians should be aware that highly reliable signs exist for the diagnosis and that early multidisciplinary treatment should be offered.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^e7abb51b]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Subjects

The medical records of all consecutive patients who visited the hyperkinetic Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen, a tertiary referral center, between January 2012 and July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics and associated features were manually extracted from the electronic medical record system into a movement disorder database. All data were scored using the first visit consultation reports. The subjects extracted from the database were 18 years or older at the time of consultation and were diagnosed with a hyperkinetic FMD or non‐FMD. The most recent clinical diagnosis was used as the gold standard: the final diagnosis after neurological examination, and in some cases additional imaging, laboratory or neurophysiological testing. Patients were excluded when there was lack of a final clinical diagnosis, a diagnosis which was not a movement disorder (e.g. primary psychiatric disorder or neuromuscular disorder), or more than one diagnosis (i.e. combination of an FMD and a non‐FMD). This study was reviewed by the ethics committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen and according to local regulations no approval was needed. Obtaining informed consent was exempt because of the retrospective design and the extensive number of included patients.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^9670e779]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study describes differences in clinical characteristics and associated features between FMD and non‐FMD patients in a retrospective large cohort from a tertiary hyperkinetic movement disorder referral clinic. Ten associated features, mainly based on the current DSM‐5, were significantly discriminative between the two groups. Age of onset was higher in FMD than in non‐FMD patients. The categorical features sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term and fluctuations over the day were more frequent in FMD patients, whilst more than one motor phenotype and a positive family history were more frequent in non‐FMDs. The features medical history and cognitive symptoms were not discriminative between the two groups. Based on our retrospective results a preliminary predictive model was made with a discriminative ability of 91%.

The 874 patients in our study cohort were selected from a highly specialized outpatient clinic with only hyperkinetic movement disorders. Despite the fact that most FMDs are hyperkinetic [18], our cohort did not represent the general movement disorder clinic with a large proportion of Parkinson patients. In our adult non‐FMD group (554) the dominant motor phenotype was dystonia 46%, followed by tremor 24% and myoclonus 10%. In the 320 FMD patients the dominant motor phenotype was more represented by myoclonus in 32%, followed by dystonia in 26% and tremor in 21% of patients. These top three were similar to a previous FMD study, but with different percentages: tremor 55%, dystonia 39% and myoclonus 13% [19]. This is probably due to the fact that our center has a great interest in jerky movements. As noted, the distribution of the dominant motor phenotype was not the same in the FMD and non‐FMD groups, with an overrepresentation of dystonia in the non‐FMD group. This might have influenced our results as functional dystonia is considered a more challenging clinical diagnosis than functional myoclonus or tremor that can be supported with electrophysiological testing (as was performed in 50% of cases). It is known from the literature that many clinical characteristics and features are not significantly different in the different FMD motor phenotypes [20]; our cohort was considered not fully representative for a general movement disorder clinic but compatible with the hyperkinetic FMD and non‐FMD patients in a specialized center.

### Physiotherapy for functional motor disorders: a consensus recommendation [^6b007eed]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions/summary

FMDs are complex and the aetiology is multifactorial. Patients with this diagnosis are therefore heterogeneous. Treatment needs to reflect this. Physiotherapy aimed at restoring movement and function has face validity, is becoming evidence based and is acceptable to patients. Physiotherapy resources are currently employed for patients with FMD, but the supporting structures do not exist and there is a lack of information for physiotherapists to help plan their treatment. The biopsychosocial model and recommendations that we present are aimed at helping physiotherapists to plan individualised treatments that target the problems that contribute to a patient's symptoms. A stepped care approach is important to escalate treatment when necessary.

### Functional neurological disorder: new subtypes and shared mechanisms [^eb4523a1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Functional neurological disorder is common in neurological practice. A new approach to the positive diagnosis of this disorder focuses on recognisable patterns of genuinely experienced symptoms and signs that show variability within the same task and between different tasks over time. Psychological stressors are common risk factors for functional neurological disorder, but are often absent. Four entities-functional seizures, functional movement disorders, persistent perceptual postural dizziness, and functional cognitive disorder-show similarities in aetiology and pathophysiology and are variants of a disorder at the interface between neurology and psychiatry. All four entities have distinctive features and can be diagnosed with the support of clinical neurophysiological studies and other biomarkers. The pathophysiology of functional neurological disorder includes overactivity of the limbic system, the development of an internal symptom model as part of a predictive coding framework, and dysfunction of brain networks that gives movement the sense of voluntariness. Evidence supports tailored multidisciplinary treatment that can involve physical and psychological therapy approaches.

### Functional gait disorders: a sign-based approach [^3ce078b2]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional gait disorders are both common and disabling. Depending on the clinical setting, 2%–20% of patients referred to movement disorders outpatient clinics have a functional movement disorder, and 40% of these patients have gait abnormalities without a structural lesion. It is important to timely recognize the features of a functional gait as approximately 12% of patients across all neurologic disease categories have a functional overlay. However, many clinicians find these functional gait disorders difficult to diagnose. They are often seen together with other functional movement disorders, although pure functional gait disorders occur in approximately 6%–8.5% of patients with functional neurologic disorders. When present together with other functional signs, proper recognition of a functional gait pattern is often very helpful in establishing the functional nature of the overall presentation, particularly when this is less obvious from the other neurologic signs.

For several reasons, the term functional gait disorder is preferred over psychogenic gait disorder. First, psychological distress is not always evident, and functional gait disorders are often diagnosed in the absence of obvious precipitating stressors. Indeed, psychological stressors are now considered only as risk factors and not as essential causative triggers. Second, because acceptance of the diagnosis is essential for successful treatment, the more descriptive term functional gait disorders is preferred over psychogenic gait disorder, which has a negative connotation for many patients. For these reasons, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V (DSM-V) now uses the term Functional Neurological Symptom Disorders instead of Psychogenic Neurological Disorders. Moreover, the DSM-V diagnosis no longer relies on the presence of obvious psychological stressors. Importantly, functional neurologic symptoms (including functional gait disorders) are not thought to be produced intentionally and are therefore distinct from malingering and factitious disorder.

Several reviews have described the clinical phenomenology and treatment of functional movement disorders, but these only touched briefly on the spectrum and diagnosis of functional gait disorders. In this video-illustrated review, we describe a practical sign-based approach to functional gait disorders, aiming to improve the diagnostic process in daily clinical practice.

### Characteristics and prognosis of functional movement disorders in China: FMD-China registry study [^06a928be]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) are common within functional neurological disorders, yet understudied in Asian populations, particularly in China. Understanding FMDs across diverse cultural and ethnic contexts is crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and optimizing treatment strategies. This study aimed to characterize FMDs among Chinese Han individuals and identify key prognostic factors.

Methods

We enrolled 119 FMD patients from 22 centers across China. Data collected included demographics, clinical manifestations, neuropsychological assessments, and treatment details. Statistical analyses including ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and so on were used to analyze the clinical characteristics and potential prognostic predictors of FMD patients in China.

Results

Patients showed a mean onset age of 45.3years, female (58.8%), and a possible bimodal age distribution (peaks at 20–30 and ≥ 60years). Mixed phenotypes (32.8%) and tremor (29.4%) were most common, with high rates of anxiety (61.3%) and depression (53.8%), and 38.7% clinical symptom remission. Physical therapy may be a potential protective factor (OR = 0.077, p < 0.001), while trauma history (OR = 7.863, p = 0.002) and higher baseline CGI scores (OR = 1.933, p = 0.002) predicted poorer outcomes.

Conclusion

This first multi-center study of FMDs in China highlights a potential tendency toward a bimodal distribution, female predominance, and abnormal scores on psychiatric scales. Notably, physical therapy represents a potential protective factor, while trauma history may be a risk factor. Our findings identify the clinical profile and prognostic factors of FMDs in the Chinese population, offering valuable insights for clinical practice and future research.

### Cranial functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^31d44f25]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Functional (psychogenic) neurological symptoms are frequently encountered in neurological practice. Cranial movement disorders — affecting the eyes, face, jaw, tongue, or palate — are an under-recognised feature of patients with functional symptoms. They can present in isolation or in the context of other functional symptoms; in particular, for functional eye movements, positive clinical signs such as convergence spasms can be triggered by the clinical examination. Although the specialty of functional neurological disorders has expanded, appreciation of cranial functional movement disorders is still insufficient. Identification of the positive features of cranial functional movement disorders such as convergence and unilateral platysmal spasm might lend diagnostic weight to a suspected functional neurological disorder. Understanding of the differential diagnosis, which is broad and includes many organic causes (eg, stroke), is essential to make an early and accurate diagnosis to prevent complications and initiate appropriate management. Increased understanding of these disorders is also crucial to drive clinical trials and studies of individually tailored therapies.

### The prognosis of functional (psychogenic) motor symptoms: a systematic review [^6f9cbd0b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prognosis of functional (or psychogenic) motor symptoms (weakness and movement disorder) has not been systematically reviewed.

Methods

We systematically reviewed PubMed for all studies of eight or more patients with functional motor symptoms reporting follow-up data longer than 6 months (excluding studies reporting specific treatments). We recorded symptom duration, physical and psychiatric comorbidity, disability, occupational functioning at follow-up and prognostic factors.

Results

24 studies were included. There was heterogeneity regarding study size (number of patients (n) = 10 491), follow-up duration clinical setting and data availability. Most studies (n = 15) were retrospective. Reported symptom outcome was highly variable. Mean weighted follow-up duration was 7.4 years (in 13 studies where data was extractable). The mean percentage of patients same or worse at follow-up for all studies was 39%, range 10% to 90%, n = 1134. Levels of physical disability and psychological comorbidity at follow-up were high. Short duration of symptoms, early diagnosis and high satisfaction with care predicted positive outcome in two studies. Gender had no effect. Delayed diagnosis and personality disorder were negatively correlated with outcome. Prognostic factors that varied between studies included age, comorbid anxiety and depression, IQ, educational status, marital status and pending litigation.

Conclusions

Existing follow-up studies of functional motor symptoms give us some insights regarding outcome and prognostic factors but are limited by their largely retrospective and selective nature. Overall, prognosis appears unfavourable. The severity and chronicity of functional motor symptoms argues for larger prospective studies including multiple prognostic factors at baseline in order to better understand their natural history.

### Characteristics and prognosis of functional movement disorders in China: FMD-China registry study [^729400d4]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

As the first comprehensive characterization of FMDs in China, this study identifies both the baseline clinical characteristics of the disease and the one‐year follow‐up outcomes by describing the natural course of the disease. The observed 38.7% remission rate establishes a benchmark for clinical outcomes in Chinese FMD patients. Crucially, we identified physical therapy as a potential protective factor and trauma history as a significant prognostic indicator — findings provide potential clues for personalized treatment plans. These results underscore the necessity for multidisciplinary research integrating neurology, psychiatry, and social sciences to elucidate the complex biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying FMDs and develop culturally adapted, evidence‐based management strategies. This study fills the clinical data gap of FMDs in mainland China, providing local evidence for disease identification, personalized treatment, and multidisciplinary collaboration, while also laying the foundation for subsequent research and guideline development.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics and associated features in patients with hyperkinetic FMDs versus non‐FMDs

The 10 significant potential predictor variables (age of onset, sex, psychiatric history, family history, more than one motor phenotype, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term and fluctuations during the day) were submitted to the model. Sex did not contribute significantly and was therefore excluded, leading to a model with nine significant predictor variables. Table 2 depicts the prediction model that estimates the chance of being diagnosed with an FMD. The discriminative performance of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve with the AUC depicted by the blue line in Fig. 1. The AUC was 91% (95% confidence interval 88.8%–92.9%), which indicates a good discriminative ability between FMDs and non‐FMDs. In addition, the non‐significant Hosmer and Lemeshow statistic (P = 0.169) indicated a good model fit.

FROM CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION TO MECHANISM

One of the key developments in recent years in FMD has been the refinement of diagnostic criteria to focus more on positive physical signs and investigation findings to support the diagnosis, rather than the presence of psychological distress. This is one of the most important reasons why patients with FMD (and those with functional weakness) are such an important model for studying the neurobiology of functional neurological symptoms in general. In contrast to patients with symptoms such as sensory loss, pain, fatigue and memory disturbance, patients with FMD have objective motor signs that are amenable to clinical and experimental measurement. Diagnosis can therefore be positive in many patients, relying on important clinical differences in the way the movement disorder changes with physical examination manoeuvres, and provides a degree of certainty about the diagnosis, which may not be achievable in those whose symptoms are only measurable via self-report. From an experimental perspective, FMD can be objectively measured (e.g. using an accelerometer to measure tremor, using electromyography to measure reaction time or pattern of muscle recruitment), providing an objective parameter for experimental studies. Perhaps most importantly, the manner in which FMDs differ from typical 'organic' movement disorders both constrains and informs neurobiological models for symptom generation. Given the common co-occurrence of different functional neurological symptoms in the same patients, study of the neurobiology of FMD is likely to be directly relevant to the neurobiology of all functional neurological symptoms.

### Neurobiology of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^55ab4a13]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review explores recent developments in understanding the neurobiological mechanism of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMDs). This is particularly relevant given the resurgence of academic and clinical interest in patients with functional neurological symptoms and the clear shift in diagnostic and treatment approaches away from a pure psychological model of functional symptoms.

Recent Findings

Recent research findings implicate three key processes in the neurobiology of FMD (and by extension other functional neurological symptoms): abnormal attentional focus, abnormal beliefs and expectations, and abnormalities in sense of agency. These three processes have been combined in recent neurobiological models of FMD in which abnormal predictions related to movement are triggered by self-focused attention, and the resulting movement is generated without the normal sense of agency that accompanies voluntary movement.

Summary

New understanding of the neurobiology of FMD forms an important part of reappraising the way that patients with FMD (and other functional disorders) are characterized and treated. It also provides a testable framework for further exploring the pathophysiology of these common causes of ill health.

KEY CONCEPTS IN THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT DISORDERS

Following from modern diagnostic criteria for FMD, three key concepts emerge that must be encompassed by any neurobiological model that seeks to explain the disorder. The first relates to attention. A key feature that distinguishes patients with FMD from those with 'organic' movement disorders is that the FMD requires attention to manifest: when attention is distracted, there is typically a reduction, even disappearance of the movement disorder. Conversely, during examination, movements are often performed with considerable visual attention towards movement. The second key concept is symptom-related beliefs/expectations. This does not just mean consciously reportable beliefs about symptoms, but includes expectations or 'priors' in the setting of active inference in the brain. Active inference refers to a well grounded neurobiological theory of brain function that the brain actively predicts and seeks to explain sensory input on the basis of past experience: there is an internal model of the world that is used to interact with and explain the world. The interaction between 'bottom-up' sensory information and 'top-down' predictions about that information is suggested to take place at multiple levels of an interconnected hierarchy, and the end result of this process is a percept or movement. Patients with FMD can present symptoms that are incongruous with basic neuroanatomical/neurophysiological constraints of disease, but which, conceivably, fit with reasonable lay beliefs about brain function. For example, when the tremoring limb of patients with functional tremor is restrained, tremor often spreads to other body parts. This is something that defies some basic principles of organic tremor generation. An example of the same phenomenon outside FMD is of tubular visual field defect in which patients report a visual field defect that does not change in size when the patient is examined close to them or far away – something that defies the laws of optics. In this way, FMD can be characterized as being shaped by 'high-level' beliefs about symptoms. The third key concept relates to agency. Agency refers to a fundamental aspect of human self-consciousness. We can make reportable judgements about whether we did something ('I moved my arm' vs. 'My arm was moved') and in a more real-world context, we possess a background subjective sense of control over our actions – a sense of agency. The abnormal movements in FMD look like movement that has been deliberately (i.e. with conscious fore-thought) produced by the patient because attention is required for the movement to manifest and the movement produced is not congruent with some basic neuroanatomical/physiological constraints. Such movements would be predicted to be associated with a strong sense of agency. However, the self-report of patients is that the movement is not under their control, and the implication of this is that there is likely to be a disruption of processes in patients with FMD that would usually imbue such movements with a sense of agency.

### Biomarkers in functional movement disorders: a systematic review [^f6a4f8bd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional movement disorders (FMD) are proposed to reflect a specific problem with voluntary control of movement, despite normal intent to move and an intact neural capacity for movement. In many cases, a positive diagnosis of FMD can be established on clinical grounds. However, the diagnosis remains challenging in certain scenarios, and there is a need for predictors of treatment response and long-term prognosis. In this context, we performed a systematic review of biomarkers in FMD. Eighty-six studies met our predefined criteria and were included. We found fairly reliable electroencephalography and electromyography-based diagnostic biomarkers for functional myoclonus and tremor. Promising biomarkers have also been described for functional paresis, gait and balance disorders. In contrast, there is still a lack of diagnostic biomarkers of functional dystonia and tics, where clinical diagnosis is often also more challenging. Importantly, many promising findings focus on pathophysiology and reflect group-level comparisons, but cannot differentiate on an individual basis. Some biomarkers also require access to time-consuming and resource-consuming techniques such as functional MRI. In conclusion, there are important gaps in diagnostic biomarkers in FMD in the areas of most clinical uncertainty. There is also is a lack of treatment response and prognostic biomarkers to aid in the selection of patients who would benefit from rehabilitation and other forms of treatment.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^c8cb18a8]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

There has been a concerted move in recent times to shift from an exclusionary to a positive diagnosis of functional movement disorders (FMDs). To date, most of the focus has been on defining positive physical signs. Here the focus was on the diagnostic specificity of specific symptoms and patient characteristics.

Methods

For this prospective cohort study, newly referred patients in the Netherlands and Australia were recruited before their first neurology appointment. Participants completed questionnaires within 2months prior to their visit at one of the six different clinics. Directly following the first consultation, physicians received a questionnaire about their diagnostic process. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis was not a movement disorder. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of FMDs. Subsequently, a predictive model was constructed and assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve.

Results

Between 1 March 2021 and 1 March 2023, 465 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 171 (37%) had an FMD and 294 (63%) a non-FMD. Distinguishing factors amongst these groups included age at onset, gender, history or family history of a functional and psychiatric disorder, sudden onset, specific triggers, fluctuation patterns throughout the day and over an extended period, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and dissociation. Using these, a predictive model was developed, yielding a discriminative accuracy of 88%.

Conclusion

Specific symptoms and patient characteristics have high diagnostic discriminative value between FMDs and non-FMDs, providing an additional tool in positive diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of functional neurological disorder [^e52b7c0b]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND), previously regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, is now a rule-in diagnosis with available treatments. This represents a major step toward destigmatizing the disorder, which was often doubted and deemed untreatable. FND is prevalent, generally affecting young and middle aged adults, and can cause severe disability in some individuals. An early diagnosis, with subsequent access to evidence based rehabilitative and/or psychological treatments, can promote recovery-albeit not all patients respond to currently available treatments. This review presents the latest advances in the use of validated rule-in examination signs to guide diagnosis, and the range of therapeutic approaches available to care for patients with FND. The article focuses on the two most frequently identified subtypes of FND: motor (weakness and/or movement disorders) and seizure type symptoms. Twenty two studies on motor and 27 studies on seizure type symptoms report high specificities of clinical signs (64–100%), and individual signs are reviewed. Rehabilitative interventions (physical and occupational therapy) are treatments of choice for functional motor symptoms, while psychotherapy is an emerging evidence based treatment across FND subtypes. The literature to date highlights heterogeneity in responses to treatment, underscoring that more research is needed to individualize treatments and develop novel interventions.

### Physiotherapy and CBT for functional movement disorders… [^d7527b8a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Results show that multidisciplinary treatment effectively improves symptoms and physical aspects of the quality of life of patients with functional movement disorders against nondirected psychological support and education; this improvement seems to be driven by changes in mobility and pain domains. Importance Functional movement disorders are frequent and disabling neurological disorders with a substantial socioeconomic impact. Few randomized studies have analyzed the effectiveness of combined physiotherapy and psychotherapy in patients' quality of life. Conclusions and Relevance Results show that multidisciplinary treatment effectively improves FMD symptoms and physical aspects of patients' quality of life. Further studies must be performed to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of this approach in FMD. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05634486.

Functional neurological disorders are frequent neurological disorders manifesting in young adults with motor and/or sensory symptoms that arise from the voluntary motor or somatosensory nervous system and are experienced as involuntary. 1, 2 FND is the most common cause of referral for neurology clinics after headache, 3 with a huge socioeconomic impact on health systems. 4–6 Among the FND spectrum, functional seizures and functional movement disorders are the most frequent manifestations. FMDs have shown a similar impact on disability and quality of life than organic movement disorders. 7, 8. The underlying etiology of FMD remains elusive, but neural mechanisms coordinating emotional processing, attention, and the sense of agency of the movement have been elucidated as key circuits altered in these patients. 2 In this context, psychological factors appear to act as risk factors and contribute to the perpetuation of symptoms. 9 Due to.

Interestingly, a randomized feasibility study showed that specialized physiotherapy for FMD significantly improved SF-36 PCS score, physical function, and social function in FMD compared with standard physiotherapy, but a nonsignificant improvement was shown for pain and general health. 22 These discrepancies could be related to some differential aspects of our selected cohorts and approaches. Interestingly, the physical rehabilitation included a cognitive behavioral frame of reference where education in the symptoms' nature played a key role. This aspect is in line with our diagnosis approach received by both groups, based on published recommendations for diagnosis and physiotherapy in FMD. 28, 29 Another randomized clinical trial13 assessed the impact of brief psychodynamics interventions against standard medical care and showed improvement in the severity of functional symptoms and CGI scales at 12-month follow-up.

### Neurobiology of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^7b76e8d1]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

There are clear areas of overlap between these models, and indeed with previous models, for example, Brown's cognitive model of medically unexplained symptoms in which he proposes a role for 'rogue representations', and indeed going back as far as Russell Reynolds' proposal in the mid 19th century that beliefs about symptoms can involuntarily alter movement or perception. The advancement of recent models is to place FMD within a testable, biologically plausible framework. This framework still includes an important potential role for the 'presumed psychological factors' discussed at the beginning of this review, but also allows considerable flexibility in the manner in which symptoms might be triggered in individual patients. This shift in emphasis has relevance for diagnostic explanations for patients and treatment development, and it is hoped will eventually improve the provision of appropriate care and long-term prognosis for patients with FMD and other functional neurological symptoms.

### Familial psychogenic movement disorders [^a380521e]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Psychogenic (or functional) movement disorders (PMDs) are considered sporadic. Despite the growing literature describing the clinical features and the natural history of sporadic cases with PMDs, their occurrence in familial clusters is not reported.

Methods

We identified 10 patients from 5 families affected by PMDs. In this report, we describe the clinical characteristics along with videos and long-term follow-up of these patients.

Results

Clinical clues from the history and signs suggesting a functional origin of the symptoms in these patients with familial PMD were similar to those identified in sporadic cases. The phenomenology of the PMD was similar in the affected members of the same family.

Conclusions

We wish to highlight that a positive family history does not necessarily imply an organic disorder. When a positive family history for a condition is reported by a patient with PMD, examination of these further affected members may be needed and may identify further family members suffering from PMDs. A positive family history of PMDs may be an additional risk factor for developing PMDs. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^3470621e]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) are complex conditions at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. As the motor‐dominant subtype within the spectrum of functional neurological disorders, their presentation is characterized by abnormal movements, including tremors, dystonia, myoclonus and weakness.

According to the current criteria, a diagnosis of FMD should be based on positive signs detected mainly during examination, like internal inconsistency, effects of distraction and variability, although evidence of distractibility and variability of the movement disorder can also be gleaned from the history. Examples include Hoover's sign in functional paresis (positive when there is a lack of strength in voluntary hip extension whilst normal involuntary hip extension occurs during contralateral hip flexion against resistance) or entrainment in functional tremors (positive when a tremor synchronizes with the frequency of voluntary tapping of another body part). These positive signs demonstrate that movements temporarily improve when attention is focused on a different body part, disappear during distraction, or change in frequency and amplitude whilst a patient is performing another rhythmical movement.

In contrast to positive findings on neurological investigation, specific positive features from the history have remained relatively understudied, despite them potentially adding significant value to the diagnostic process. Several potentially useful historical features have been noted in patients with FMDs (regardless of the movement disorder phenomenology), but data on their sensitivity and specificity are lacking. In an earlier retrospective study in a large consecutive cohort of patients from a tertiary referral clinic specialized in hyperkinetic movement disorders, our study group has shown that some of these clinical characteristics and associated features are frequently reported and might be discriminative between FMDs and non‐FMDs. These factors included age, sex, history of a psychiatric disorder, positive family history, abrupt onset, a fluctuating disease course and the presence of pain and fatigue. These findings are in concordance with the literature, in which female gender, a relatively young age of onset, psychiatric comorbidities, precipitating physical events, marked variability in symptom severity (including complete remissions and sudden recurrences) and high levels of pain and fatigue appear to be more commonly reported in those with FMD.

A prospective study was therefore established to assess a wide range of clinical characteristics and associated features in a variety of movement disorder clinics, including academic and non‐academic hospital settings with diverse populations of movement disorder patients.

Through this work the aim was to provide clinicians with unbiased information on the diagnostic value of these historical and patient characteristics to increase the confidence with which they could reach an early correct diagnosis of FMD.

Abstract

Background and purpose

There has been a concerted move in recent times to shift from an exclusionary to a positive diagnosis of functional movement disorders (FMDs). To date, most of the focus has been on defining positive physical signs. Here the focus was on the diagnostic specificity of specific symptoms and patient characteristics.

Methods

For this prospective cohort study, newly referred patients in the Netherlands and Australia were recruited before their first neurology appointment. Participants completed questionnaires within 2 months prior to their visit at one of the six different clinics. Directly following the first consultation, physicians received a questionnaire about their diagnostic process. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis was not a movement disorder. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of FMDs. Subsequently, a predictive model was constructed and assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve.

Results

Between 1 March 2021 and 1 March 2023, 465 patients were eligible for inclusion, of whom 171 (37%) had an FMD and 294 (63%) a non‐FMD. Distinguishing factors amongst these groups included age at onset, gender, history or family history of a functional and psychiatric disorder, sudden onset, specific triggers, fluctuation patterns throughout the day and over an extended period, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and dissociation. Using these, a predictive model was developed, yielding a discriminative accuracy of 88%.

Conclusion

Specific symptoms and patient characteristics have high diagnostic discriminative value between FMDs and non‐FMDs, providing an additional tool in positive diagnosis.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^a219f94e]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In this study positive clinical features from the history of movement disorder patients that discriminate between FMDs and non‐FMDs were determined. Combined in a prediction algorithm, seven of these features predict FMD to a high degree of certainty. Whilst clinicians are always urged to be careful and holistic in their consideration of the full range of clinical evidence when making a diagnosis of FMD or a non‐FMD, it is believed that these findings can support clinicians in their diagnostic process, which might lead to earlier diagnoses and thereby potential improve patient outcomes. This study supports that FMD is a distinct condition with its own consistent clinical characteristics and ongoing research will further support this classification.

### Impaired metacognition of voluntary movement in functional movement disorder [^56662dd3]. Movement Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Motor symptoms in functional movement disorders (FMDs) are experienced as involuntary but share characteristics of voluntary action. Clinical and experimental evidence indicate alterations in monitoring, control, and subjective experience of self-performed movements.

Objective

The objective of this study was to test the prediction that FMDs are associated with a reduced ability to make accurate (metacognitive) judgments about self-performed movements.

Methods

We compared 24 patients with FMD (including functional gait disturbance, functional tremor, and functional tics) with 24 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects in a novel visuomotor-metacognitive paradigm. Participants performed target-directed movements on a graphics tablet with restricted visual feedback, decided which of two visually presented trajectories was closer to their preceding movement, and reported their confidence in the visuomotor decision. We quantified individual metacognitive performance as participants' ability to assign high confidence preferentially to correct visuomotor decisions.

Results

Patients and control subjects showed comparable motor performance, response accuracy, and use of the confidence scale. However, visuomotor sensitivity in the trajectory judgment was reduced in patients with FMD compared with healthy control subjects. Moreover, metacognitive performance was impaired in patients, that is, their confidence ratings were less predictive of the correctness of visuomotor decisions. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest metacognitive deficits to be most pronounced in patients with a functional gait disturbance or functional tremor.

Conclusions

Patients with FMD exhibited deficits both when making visuomotor decisions about their own movements and in the metacognitive evaluation of these decisions. Reduced metacognitive insight into voluntary motor control may play a role in FMD pathophysiology and could lay the groundwork for new treatment strategies. © 2023 The Authors.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^41f3b1a0]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the non‐FMD group, the features more than one motor phenotype and positive family history were significantly more frequent compared to the FMD group. Interestingly, in some cases, the combination of more than one motor phenotype was the reason for the referring specialist to consider an FMD. This was based on the fact that in FMD more than one and overlapping motor phenotypes have been described. In our cohort, combinations were more frequently in the non‐FMD group with diagnoses like myoclonus‐dystonia and dystonic tremor. The lower numbers in the FMD group could be due to the fact that only hyperkinetic phenotypes were coded. The presence of concurrent limb weakness was not scored, but can be common in FMDs. Not surprisingly, patients in the group of non‐FMDs more often had a first‐degree relative with a movement disorder. However, also in 16% of our FMD patients there was a positive family history. Although underlying mechanisms for familial FMDs are still the subject of study [27], in one study up to 55% of patients with FMDs reported a positive family history for a movement disorder or were frequently exposed to individuals with neurological disease [14]. Therefore, one should be aware that a positive family history in a patient with a movement disorder does not necessarily imply a non‐FMD.

### Functional neurological disorder: practical management [^75f553b2]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is a common and disabling condition seen by nearly every clinician in nearly every clinical setting. There are multiple subtypes with seizure and motor/movement being the most common. There is high health care utilization and costs, and many patients have a chronic course and remain disabled. It is clear from research over the past two decades that abnormalities in brain network activity are implicated in the pathophysiology of FND. Diagnosis requires positive criteria and knowing how to obtain a good history and avoid common pitfalls. There are evidence-based treatments and expert consensus recommendations. A multidisciplinary team knowledgeable about the disorder is important for the best outcomes but there is much more work to be done. This review will focus on the practical aspects of diagnosing and managing FND.

### Decade of progress in motor functional neurological disorder: continuing the momentum [^eeaac5d9]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is a prevalent, disabling and costly condition at the neurology-psychiatry intersection. After being marginalised in the late 20th century, there has been renewed interest in this field. In this article, we review advances that have occurred over the past decade (2011–2020) across diagnosis, mechanisms, aetiologies, treatments and stigma in patients with motor FND (mFND, that is, functional movement disorder and functional limb weakness). In each content area, we also discuss the implications of recent advances and suggest future directions that will help continue the momentum of the past decade. In diagnosis, a major advance has been the emphasis on rule-in physical signs that are specific for hyperkinetic and hypokinetic functional motor symptoms. Mechanistically, greater importance has been given to determining 'how' functional neurological symptoms develop, highlighting roles for misdirected attention, expectation and self-agency, as well as abnormal influences of emotion/threat processing brain areas on motor control circuits. Aetiologically, while roles for adverse life experiences remain of interest in mFND, there is recognition of other aetiologic contributors, and efforts are needed to investigate links between aetiological factors and mechanisms. This decade has seen the first randomised controlled trials for physiotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation and psychotherapy performed in the field, with consensus recommendations for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and outcome measures also published. Across patients, clinicians, healthcare systems and society, stigma remains a major concern. While challenges persist, a patient-centred integrated clinical neuroscience approach is primed to carry forward the momentum of the past decade into the future.

4.2 Clinical Phenotypes and Non‐Motor Symptoms

Mixed phenotypes (32.8%) and tremor (29.4%) predominated in our cohort, which is consistent with existing literature. Comparing these 2 types, except for the SCL‐90 Hostility, there are no other parts with statistical differences including the prognostic outcomes. Additionally, symptom phenotypes showed relative homogeneity in age of onset, gender distribution, and disease severity. This phenotypic convergence across diverse motor manifestations supports the concept of FMD as a singular diagnostic category despite its clinical heterogeneity. Notably, we identified potential temporal patterns: myoclonus/tics demonstrated earlier onset (typically in younger patients), contrasting with the later emergence of parkinsonian symptoms (predominantly in older individuals). This age‐stratified manifestation pattern, which parallels the natural history of organic movement disorders, suggests possible common pathophysiological underpinnings between functional and other neurological conditions.

Non‐motor symptoms were prevalent (48.7%), primarily sleep disorders (15.1%) and sensory disturbances (6.7%). This frequent co‐occurrence suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms (e.g. stress response, emotional dysregulation) underlying both motor and non‐motor manifestations. Notably, motor symptom severity correlated with fatigue and pain intensity, further supporting a unified model of central nervous system dysregulation. Abnormal scores on psychiatric scales were notably prevalent: 61.3% of patients screened positive for anxiety scales and 53.8% for depression scales, with elevated SCL‐90 scores across multiple domains (somatization, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism). However, a considerable proportion of patients (42.9%) exhibited a negative psychiatric history. Together with conclusions from existing reported literature, it is speculated that not all cases are caused by psychological factors. A multifactorial etiological model integrating physiological, psychological states, and social environmental influences may be more appropriate.

### Neuromodulation for the treatment of functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder: a systematic review [^0170154e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder are complex neuropsychiatric conditions that have been linked to circuit-based dysfunction of brain networks. Neuromodulation is a novel therapeutic strategy capable of modulating relevant brain networks, making it a promising potential candidate for the treatment of these patient populations. We conducted a systematic review of Medline, Embase and PsycINFO up to 4 March 2021. Trials investigating neuromodulation devices for the treatment of functional neurological disorder or somatic symptom disorder were selected. Extracted variables included study design, demographic and clinical characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, neurostimulation protocols, clinical outcome measures and results. 404 studies were identified with 12 meeting inclusion criteria. 221 patients were treated in the included studies with mean study sample size of 18 (4–70). Five studies were randomised clinical trials. Functional motor symptoms (six weakness, four movement disorders) were the most studied subpopulations. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was the most frequently used device (10 studies), followed by electroconvulsive therapy (one study) and direct-current stimulation (one study). Treatment protocols varied in intended therapeutic mechanism(s): eight studies aimed to modulate underlying network dysfunction, five aimed to demonstrate movement (one also leveraged the former) and three boosted their primary mechanism with enhanced suggestion/expectation. All but one study reported positive results; however, methodological/outcome heterogeneity, mixed study quality and small sample sizes precluded quantitative meta-analysis. Neuromodulation, particularly TMS for the treatment of functional motor symptoms, shows preliminary promise in a growing line of research. Larger, sham-controlled studies are needed to further establish efficacy and better understand therapeutic mechanisms.

### Neurobiology of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^f9ef13fa]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

It is common to begin review papers with a definition of the disorder under discussion. This presents some difficulties with the topic of this article: functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMDs). A common definition is that these are movement disorders presumed to be due to psychological factors or psychiatric illness and not structural or neurochemical disease. There are difficulties with this definition however. First, the dichotomy between structural/neurochemical disease and psychological factors/psychiatric illness suggests a compartmentalized brain and mind: a concept not supported by centuries of scientific research. Second, the presumed psychological or psychiatric factors in FMD are not apparent in many patients, are present in many people without FMD, are not used by neurologists in the diagnosis, and have even been rejected by psychiatrists as a necessary diagnostic criterion in the equivalent psychiatric diagnosis, conversion disorder. As we have argued previously, we prefer to define this disorder on the basis of its clinical appearance as a movement disorder that is significantly altered by distraction or nonphysiological manoeuvres (including dramatic placebo response) and which is clinically incongruent with movement disorders known to be caused by neurological disease.

### Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders: merging mind and brain [^ad0a2443]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMD) are part of the wide spectrum of functional neurological disorders, which together account for over 16% of patients referred to neurology clinics. FMD have been described as a "crisis for neurology" and cause major challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment. As with other functional disorders, a key issue is the absence of pathophysiological understanding. There has been an influential historical emphasis on causation by emotional trauma, which is not supported by epidemiological studies. The similarity between physical signs in functional disorders and those that occur in feigned illness has also raised important challenges for pathophysiological understanding and has challenged health professionals' attitudes toward patients with these disorders. However, physical signs and selected investigations can help clinicians to reach a positive diagnosis, and modern pathophysiological research is showing an appreciation of the importance of both physical and psychological factors in FMD.

### Functional movement disorder: a long journey to diagnosis [^dff4443f]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 61-year-old man presented to a country clinic with involuntary orofacial movements and progressive cognitive decline, causing significant disability and psychosocial distress. Review of records uncovered a 7-year history of presentations to several specialties, including memory clinics, neurology, internal medicine and emergency departments, with varied symptoms, extensive complex work up and inconclusive diagnosis. Comprehensive review at our hospital highlighted inconsistent neurological signs, fluctuating cognition and psychosocial stressors, which preceded symptom onset, leading to the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder (FMD), which subsequently improved with relaxation therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy and physiotherapy. We illustrate a variety of somatic symptoms, diagnostic clues and management outcomes for FMDs, and the importance of diagnostic criteria to minimise costly, time-consuming and ultimately unnecessary tests of exclusion.

4.3 Prognostic Factors and Treatment Implications

During the one‐year follow‐up period, 38.7% of patients demonstrated clinical improvement. Physical therapy emerged as a protective factor (OR = 0.077, p < 0.001), consistent with recent randomized controlled trials showing that movement retraining combined with cognitive‐behavioral therapy have been shown toameliorate symptoms by recalibrating dysfunctional sensorimotor pathways. Conversely, a history of trauma significantly predicted poorer outcomes (OR = 7.86, p = 0.002). This association may be mediated through multiple potential reasons: (1) dysregulation of stress‐responsive hormones (cortisol, prolactin); (2) structural brain alterations (e.g. hippocampal atrophy); and (3) functional changes in threat processing (e.g. amygdala hyperreactivity). These persistent neuroendocrine and neuroanatomical adaptations may compromise psychological coping mechanisms and perpetuate sensorimotor dysfunction.

Within the tremor subgroup, physical therapy maintained its protective effect (OR = 0.025, p = 0.004), whereas elevated baseline CGI scores (indicating more severe initial symptoms) were associated with poorer outcomes (OR = 2.73, p = 0.026). These results underscore the clinical importance of early therapeutic intervention to prevent symptom chronicity. Notably, while existing studies have demonstrated efficacy for psychotherapeutic interventions (CBT) and neuromodulation approaches (rTMS), our analysis failed to replicate these benefits. This discrepancy may reflect methodological limitations including: (1) insufficient statistical power due to sample size constraints, and (2) variability in treatment protocols (particularly inconsistent implementation of standardized CBT modules). In addition, among traditional Chinese medical treatments, interventions such as acupuncture and Chinese medical manipulation constitute important components of physical therapy in China (Table S8). We hypothesize that culturally congruent interventions may more readily exert biological effects. However, well‐designed randomized controlled trials are needed to verify this.

3.2 Motor Phenotypes and Respective Clinical Characteristics

FMDs phenotypes in the cohort were distributed as follows: mixed type (32.8%, n = 39), tremor (29.4%, n = 35), dystonia (15.9%, n = 19), jerks/myoclonus (6.7%, n = 8), facial symptoms (3.4%, n = 4), gait disorder (5.9%, n = 7), weakness/paralysis (5.0%, n = 6), and parkinsonism (0.8%, n = 1). This distribution aligns with the FMD‐GAP study (Table 2), where mixed type and tremor were most prevalent. Since mixed type can have multiple symptoms simultaneously, we conducted a symptom frequency analysis, which showed tremor (52.1%, n = 62), dystonia (25.2%, n = 30), and tics/myoclonus (19.3%, n = 23) as the most common manifestations (Table S1). Meanwhile, we compared the clinical characteristics and follow‐up results between tremor and mixed type; except for the SCL‐90 Hostility (t = −2.0586, p = 0.0454), there were no other parts with statistical differences, including the prognostic outcomes (Table S9).

Table distribution of motor symptom phenotypes.

Age at onset did not differ significantly across phenotypes (p > 0.05), with two incidence peaks observed: 20–30 years and ≥ 60 years (particularly in dystonia, mixed type, and gait disorder; Figure 1a–c). Females predominated in all phenotypes except dystonia (43.3% female), and gender distribution did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Symptom severity, assessed by s‐FMDRS and CGI scores, did not differ significantly across phenotypes (p > 0.05; Figure 1d and Table S2).

Symptom model and rationale for physiotherapy

Our aetiological framework is a biopsychosocial framework in which heterogeneous mixtures of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors need to be considered and formulated with the acceptance that relevant factors differ between different patients (table 1).

Table 1
A range of potential mechanisms and aetiological factors in patients with functional motor disorders

More specifically, for FMD we base some of our recommendations on a model for the mechanism of symptoms which may be more homogeneous between patients. In this model, FMD is conceived as an involuntary but learnt habitual movement pattern driven by abnormal self-directed attention. We emphasise that this is commonly triggered by physical or psychophysiological events such as injury, illness, pain and dissociation with panic and is mediated by illness beliefs and expectation. Life events, emotional disorder and personality traits are relevant in understanding and treating some patients with FMD, especially in cases where a clear link exists between mood/anxiety and symptom exacerbation. However, our recommendations, in keeping with revised criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (in DSM-5), move away from an assumption that 'recent stress' and a purely psychological model are essential to understand and treat patients with FMD.

### Misdirected attentional focus in functional tremor [^a93d73a5]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorders are the second most common diagnosis (16%) in new patients attending neurology outpatient clinics. They lead to as severe an impairment in quality of life as the equivalent organic diseases and overall carry a poor prognosis. Yet, as opposed to most other neurological disorders, long-term improvement or resolution of symptoms can occur, providing an extra impetus to improving treatments.

A characteristic and intriguing feature of functional movement disorders is that they typically manifest with attention to the affected body part or symptom and improve or even disappear with distraction, i.e. when performed automatically. In functional paralysis, for example, voluntarily movement is impaired, but normal movements occur during automatic movements; e.g. during posture readjustment, or gesturing while talking. In functional dysarthria, speech is typically normal in semi-automatic utterances. Functional tremor improves or disappears with distraction. Distractibility is therefore the hallmark diagnostic feature of functional movement disorders.

Attention clearly plays a crucial role in the expression of the abnormal movement patterns in functional movement disorders, raising the intriguing possibility that misdirection of attention may play some part in the pathogenesis. However, the concept of distractibility in functional movement disorders is based only on shifting the patients' attention by engaging them in an additional task. Here we use the more granular concept of 'focus' of attention. Skilled movement involves successfully allocating attention among different relevant 'signals' that are spatially distinct, including the target and the moving limb. There is no experimental evidence as to 'where' the spontaneous focus of attention typically lies in functional movement disorders. There is some evidence of increased gaze towards the affected limb during clinical examination. It remains unclear which attentional foci are beneficial, and which are detrimental. To improve treatment options, it is crucial to clarify (i) whether the attentional focus is misdirected in functional movement disorders compared to controls; (ii) whether such a misdirected attentional focus is detrimental to the movement and partly causative of the abnormal movement or in fact a beneficial strategy that helps minimize the abnormal movement; and (iii) which attentional foci improve symptoms. We set out to comprehensively assess attentional focus and its effect on movement performance in a functional movement disorder. Clinical experience suggests that attention plays a role in all functional movement disorders, and probably in functional neurological disorder in general. However, we focused our investigations on people with functional action tremor because a tremor can change rapidly, can be accurately measured and can even occasionally manifest in healthy individuals.

### Functional tremor [^7c1bbd0a]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional tremor is the most common functional movement disorder. It can be diagnosed with clinically definite certainty at the bedside by ascertaining its inconsistent (distractibility, frequency variability) and incongruent features (entrainment, ballistic suppression), requiring no additional neurological investigations except, in selected cases, those serving to elevate the diagnostic category to laboratory supported using accelerometry and surface electromyography. In the background of excessive attention to the affected body part and abnormal beliefs and expectations, functional correlates include the impairment of emotion processing, sense of agency, and abnormal connectivity between limbic and motor regions. While the treatment options remain under-studied, promising interventions in physiotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other psychotherapies are under evaluation to assessing their efficacy in attenuating this important source of neurological disability. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^8930b29e]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our newly developed algorithm can potentially assist clinicians in diagnosing FMD. This would not only create more awareness and confidence for clinicians not diagnosing movement disorder patients on a regular basis, but also early diagnosis and (hopefully) earlier management and treatment for FMD. This in turn may result in better outcomes, as long symptom duration is the worst prognostic factor in this patient group. Whilst most clinicians rely on examination findings to rule‐in a diagnosis of FMD, the predictive tool could also be beneficial for general neurologists, who may have less time or expertise in this field. The historical features and patient characteristics found to be discriminative between people with FMDs and non‐FMDs are likely to generalize to other functional syndromes based on existing clinical data, and further prospective studies would be useful in this regard.

There are some limitations to this study. Clinicians were asked to choose only between a functional or non‐functional diagnosis, not allowing dual diagnosis for the analysis. However, when asked, in 41 patients with a non‐FMD, clinicians answered that there was also a functional component to the symptom presentation. Possibly, this might have led to an underestimation of our model. Another is the limitation of possible covariance between our positive clinical variables and the final diagnosis by the movement disorder specialist. Although the gold standard for the diagnosis of FMD is to base it on findings in neurological examination, and in our study in 92% of patients it was reported that these were in place, it cannot be ruled out that in some cases features from the history were used in making the diagnosis. Interestingly, positive symptoms from the examination were also reported by clinicians in 43 patients from the non‐FMD group. This could reflect the limitation that clinicians were not allowed to make a dual diagnosis, but also highlights that positive signs should be used judiciously. These signs should be weighed carefully in the context of an individual patient's presentation and are often not as sensitive or specific as is commonly believed. The fact that patient outcome data were based on self‐reported online questionnaires has disadvantages. This sort of study design is prone to recall bias and may have led to an overestimation of some variables, for example symptom severity. Also, there was a high number of tremor patients in the non‐functional group, which is probably due to this study having been conducted in movement disorder centres where Parkinson's disease is commonly seen. In this specific group there might be less doubt about the diagnosis for clinicians compared to patients with dystonia or tic disorders. Finally, although data have been collected from various clinics, these were all patients referred to a movement disorder specialist.

### Functional or not functional; that's the question: can we predict the diagnosis functional movement disorder based on associated features? [^b1e6b55b]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, a relatively high age of onset was found in patients with FMDs compared to non‐FMDs, where former studies in different patient populations suggest the opposite [7, 21]. A possible explanation could be that the relatively old group of hypokinetic patients, i.e. parkinsonian patients, was excluded. Another explanation could be that our cohort comes from a tertiary movement disorder clinic, implying that younger patients might have already been diagnosed by their first attending physician. Interestingly, the mean age in our FMD cohort is in line with the literature that FMDs are not uncommon in the elderly [22].

The categorical features female sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset and inconsistency over time were more frequent in FMDs. In general practice and the aforementioned literature female sex is supposed to be an important risk factor for FMDs [23]. In our cohort also, the female to male ratio was 2:1 in FMD patients [5]. Next, whilst the criterion of psychological stress or psychiatric disturbance was removed from the current DSM‐5 manual, in our cohort a positive psychiatric history turned out to be more prevalent in FMDs. Although significant, still two‐thirds of our FMD patients did not have a previous psychiatric condition. Recent studies suggest that psychiatric illnesses are not a direct cause but might be a risk factor for developing an FMD, as part of an underlying model that integrates psychological and neurobiological perspectives [24]. It was detected that pain was more frequent in FMD patients compatible with the literature where pain has been shown to be an important clue for a functional origin of a movement disorder [7]. Interestingly, pain is also a frequent feature in patients with non‐FMDs, especially in (cervical) dystonia [25]. Despite the fact that dystonia was the most frequent motor phenotype (46%) in the non‐FMD group, pain still showed to be discriminative in our cohort. Fatigue was also significantly more frequent in the FMD group. Over the last few years, fatigue has become an important feature in the FMD literature. In a previous study, it has been shown to be significantly more frequent in patients with FMDs compared to patients with neuromuscular disorders [26]. Our results support this discriminative capacity of fatigue and it is emphasized that the role of fatigue in FMD should be recognized in clinical practice. Next, abrupt onset was more frequent in the FMD group. In the original criteria, this feature was described as suggestive for FMD based on a small case series [7]. In the current larger study, abrupt onset turned out to be a discriminative factor as well. Finally, inconsistency over time, a feature which in our study was separated into waxing and waning over the long term and fluctuations during the day, was more frequent in the FMD group and had a discriminative value. In sum, the features female sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset and inconsistency over time not only are suggestive for FMDs but could also help to discriminate these disorders from non‐FMDs.

### Effects ofgene variation and childhood trauma on the clinical and circuit-level phenotype of functional movement disorders [^fd3ff8ea]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional movement disorders (FMDs), part of the wide spectrum of functional neurological disorders (conversion disorders), are common and often associated with a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, little is known about their neurobiological underpinnings, particularly with regard to the contribution of genetic factors. Because FMD and stress-related disorders share a common core of biobehavioural manifestations, we investigated whether variants in stress-related genes also contributed, directly and interactively with childhood trauma, to the clinical and circuit-level phenotypes of FMD.

Methods

Sixty-nine patients with a 'clinically defined' diagnosis of FMD were genotyped for 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 14 candidate genes. FMD clinical characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity and symptomatology, and childhood trauma exposure were assessed. Resting-state functional connectivity data were obtained in a subgroup of 38 patients with FMD and 38 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls. Amygdala-frontal connectivity was analysed using a whole-brain seed-based approach.

Results

Among the SNPs analysed, a tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) gene polymorphism-G703T-significantly predicted clinical and neurocircuitry manifestations of FMD. Relative to GG homozygotes, T carriers were characterised by earlier FMD age of onset and decreased connectivity between the right amygdala and the middle frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the TPH2 genotype showed a significant interaction with childhood trauma in predicting worse symptom severity.

Conclusions

This is, to our knowledge, the first study showing that the TPH2 genotype may modulate FMD both directly and interactively with childhood trauma. Because both this polymorphism and early-life stress alter serotonin levels, our findings support a potential molecular mechanism modulating FMD phenotype.

### Characterising alexithymia in individuals with functional motor disorders: a cross-sectional analysis of the Italian registry of functional motor disorders [^38dcc213]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional motor disorders (FMDs) are defined as abnormal movements whose features are inconsistent over time, do not follow neuroanatomical pathways underpinning typical neurological diseases and might be significantly altered by distraction. They are characterised by a wide range of symptoms such as tremor, dystonia, paralysis, myoclonus, speech disorders, gait and coordination disturbances affecting different body parts. The prognosis for functional neurological disorders is often unfavourable, with up to 40% of affected individuals showing no improvement after several years of follow-up, high levels of interference of symptoms with daily functioning and poor quality of life.

The diagnosis of FMD is mainly based on the neurological examination, which should be based on positive signs of variability, distractibility, suggestibility and exclude other neurological causes that unequivocally explain symptoms. Several 'rule-in signs', such as tremor entrainment, Hoover's sign and give-way weakness, are commonly used in clinical practice to support the diagnosis of FMD. However, the diagnosis of FMD is often challenging and delayed due to the overlap with other neurological movement disorders (copresent in over 20% of individuals), the lack of specific biomarkers and the lack of specific training for healthcare professionals.

### Physiotherapy for functional motor disorders: a consensus recommendation [^3ff58c7a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with functional motor disorder (FMD) including weakness and paralysis are commonly referred to physiotherapists. There is growing evidence that physiotherapy is an effective treatment, but the existing literature has limited explanations of what physiotherapy should consist of and there are insufficient data to produce evidence-based guidelines. We aim to address this issue by presenting recommendations for physiotherapy treatment.

Methods

A meeting was held between physiotherapists, neurologists and neuropsychiatrists, all with extensive experience in treating FMD. A set of consensus recommendations were produced based on existing evidence and experience.

Results

We recommend that physiotherapy treatment is based on a biopsychosocial aetiological framework. Treatment should address illness beliefs, self-directed attention and abnormal habitual movement patterns through a process of education, movement retraining and self-management strategies within a positive and non-judgemental context. We provide specific examples of these strategies for different symptoms.

Conclusions

Physiotherapy has a key role in the multidisciplinary management of patients with FMD. There appear to be specific physiotherapy techniques which are useful in FMD and which are amenable to and require prospective evaluation. The processes involved in referral, treatment and discharge from physiotherapy should be considered carefully as a part of a treatment package.

### Current concepts in diagnosis and treatment of functional neurological disorders [^46623288]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes.

Observations

Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited.

Conclusions and Relevance

Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.

### The role of alexithymia in the development of functional motor symptoms (conversion disorder) [^2e49e4ca]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Functional motor symptoms (FMS), which include abnormal movements and weakness, are part of the wide spectrum of functional neurological symptoms, one of the commonest diagnoses made in neurological practice. Patients affected by FMS have levels of disability, distress and healthcare usage that equals, and in some cases surpasses, patients with neurodegenerative disease.

Recent years have seen a surge of research interest in functional neurological symptoms. One outcome has been a reduction in the emphasis on identifiable traumatic events (such as sexual abuse in childhood or adult life, remote or recent life events) being antecedents to the development of FMS. Several studies have demonstrated that such traumatic events, although clearly important, might not play a unique role in the aetiology of FMS, and, in the most recent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the presence of a psychological stressor has been downgraded from an essential to a supportive criterion for the diagnosis of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).

Recent cognitive and neurobiological models of the pathophysiology of functional neurological symptoms have concentrated more on 'how' symptoms might be produced than on 'why'. Research findings have identified three putative mechanistic processes leading to functional movement disorders (FMDs): abnormal attentional focus, abnormal beliefs and expectations, and abnormalities in sense of agency. These three processes have been combined in recent neurobiological models where abnormal predictions related to movement or perception are triggered by self-focused attention, and the resulting percept or movement is generated without a normal sense of agency.

Recent aetiological work has highlighted a possible role for physical precipitating factors in the triggering of functional neurological and other somatic symptoms, and in some cases clear links have been made between the nature of the physical precipitant and the phenomenology of the resulting functional symptom. However, the physical precipitants identified (minor injury, flu-like illness, diarrhoea, migraine) are very common in the healthy population, and therefore why they should trigger functional symptoms in only a small proportion of people remains unexplained. Therefore, the investigation of mechanistic factors in the development of functional neurological symptoms is of continued relevance and importance.

### Failure of explicit movement control in patients with functional motor symptoms [^22eaea07]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Functional neurological symptoms are one of the most common conditions observed in neurological practice, but understanding of their underlying neurobiology is poor. Historic psychological models, based on the concept of conversion of emotional trauma into physical symptoms, have not been implemented neurobiologically, and are not generally supported by epidemiological studies. In contrast, there are robust clinical procedures that positively distinguish between organic and functional motor signs that rely primarily on distracting attention away from movement or accessing it covertly. We aimed to investigate the neurobiological principles underpinning these techniques and implications for understanding functional symptoms. We assessed 11 patients with functional motor symptoms and 11 healthy controls in three experimental set-ups, where voluntary movements were made either with full explicit control or could additionally be influenced automatically by factors of which participants were much less aware (one-back reaching, visuomotor transformation, and precued reaction time with variable predictive value of the precue). Patients specifically failed in those tasks where preplanning of movement could occur and under conditions of increasing certainty regarding the movement to be performed. However, they implicitly learned to adapt to a visuomotor transformation as well as healthy controls. We propose that when the movement to be performed can be preplanned or is highly predicted, patients with functional motor symptoms shift to an explicit attentive mode of processing that impairs kinematics of movement control, but movement becomes normal when such processes cannot be employed (e.g., during unexpected movement or implicit motor adaptation).

### A positive diagnosis of functional (psychogenic) tics [^42e45d2a]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Functional tics, also called psychogenic tics or pseudo-tics, are difficult to diagnose because of the lack of diagnostic criteria and their clinical similarities to organic tics. The aim of the present study was to report a case series of patients with documented functional tics and to describe their clinical characteristics, risk factors and psychiatric comorbidity. Also clinical tips are suggested which might help the differential diagnosis in clinical practice.

Methods and Results

Eleven patients (mean age at onset 37.2, SD 13.5; three females) were included with a documented or clinically established diagnosis of functional tics, according to consultant neurologists who have specific expertise in functional movement disorders or in tic disorders. Adult onset, absent family history of tics, inability to suppress the movements, lack of premonitory sensations, absence of pali-, echo- and copro-phenomena, presence of blocking tics, the lack of the typical rostrocaudal tic distribution and the coexistence of other functional movement disorders were common in our patients.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that functional tics can be differentiated from organic tics on clinical grounds, although it is also accepted that this distinction can be difficult in certain cases. Clinical clues from history and examination described here might help to identify patients with functional tics.

### Physiotherapy for functional motor disorders: a consensus recommendation [^d2ac6f3e]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Education

The physiotherapist, like the physician, is in an excellent position to improve the patient's understanding of their disorder throughout treatment. The explanation given should build on a thorough explanation from the referring physician. Useful ingredients include:
Use of the term functional movement disorder/limb weakness/paralysis/tremor/dystonia/myoclonus to describe the disorder. The rationale for this in preference to 'psychogenic' or conversion disorder or other terms is explained elsewhere.
Acknowledgement that such symptoms are real, and are not imagined or 'put on' (ie, you believe them).
Acknowledgement that such symptoms are common and that they are commonly seen by the treating physiotherapist.
Explanation that symptoms can get better, that the problem is to do with nervous system functioning, not irreversible damage to the nervous system.
Explanation of how FMD is diagnosed using the demonstration of positive clinical signs which demonstrate normal movement (see below).
Explanation that a wide variety of factors may be involved in triggering symptoms, including physical illness and injury, and that psychological factors such as anxiety, depression or trauma may also be important.
Introducing the role of physiotherapy in 'retraining' the nervous system to help regain control over movement.
It may be important to discuss other terms used for FMD and the fact that many health professionals have ambivalent or negative attitudes to FMD.

This information should be backed up with written or online information (eg). In patients in whom doubts about the diagnosis remain, these often improve if therapy progresses successfully.

Positive signs of FMD which demonstrate the potential for normal movement

Demonstration that normal movement can occur (or that abnormal movement can stop) alters expectations about movement abnormalities, and can be a powerful way of convincing a sceptical patient (and their family) that their diagnosis of FMD is correct and the problem is potentially reversible. Several clinical signs to elicit normal movement and differentiate functional symptoms from neurological disease have been described. These are used as part of the diagnosis to positively identify FMDs, rather than it being just a diagnosis of exclusion. Some of these signs are listed in table 2.

### Characteristics of two distinct clinical phenotypes of functional (psychogenic) dystonia: follow-up study [^29b18814]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The fixed dystonia phenotype was originally established as a prototype of functional dystonia. Nevertheless, in recent reports different functional dystonia phenotypes have been recognized with dystonic movement comprising phasic instead of tonic contraction.

Objectives

To examine clinical characteristic in all patients with dystonia who fulfilled the criteria for functional movement disorders irrespective of phenotype in an attempt to determine parameters of clinical presentations that might impact the disease progression pattern and outcome.

Methods

Patients presented with dystonia features incompatible with organic disease without other features required for the diagnosis of functional movement disorders were analyzed and prospectively followed-up. The two-step cluster analysis was performed to obtain the subgroups of dystonia phenotypes.

Results

The two-step cluster analysis extracted two subgroup of patients. Patients of the first cluster (68.8%) presented with "mobile" dystonia (84.9%), of cranial/neck/trunk localization (90.9%), fluctuated clinical course (69.7%), with frequent additional movement or other functional neurological disorders (63.6%) during follow-up. In the second cluster (31.2%) all of the patients presented with "fixed" dystonia of extremities, and the clinical course was characterized by either the disease progression (60%), or continuous without improvement (26.7%), and rare occurrence of additional functional neurological disorders (13.3%).

Conclusion

In terms of clinical and demographic features as well as pattern of disease progression there are two clinical phenotypes in patients with functional dystonia. Distinctive features of incongruence and inconstancy are characteristic for "mobile" functional dystonia subgroup of patients.

### Virtual reality in functional neurological disorder: a theoretical framework and research agenda for use in the real world [^3f87a616]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND) is frequently encountered by neurologists.FND encompasses a wide range of neurological symptoms and includes several subtypes, including functional movement disorder (FMD), which in turn is one of the most common movement disorders, and persistent perceptual-postural dizziness (PPPD). Motor symptoms in FND may include tremor, dystonia, myoclonus and/or paresis. Clinicians can distinguish these symptoms from other neurological disorders by using positive rule-in criteria, such as entrainment in tremor and Hoover's sign in paresis, alongside more general characteristics such as distractibility and suggestibility.

As FND falls into the gap between physical and mental health, historically, the disorder has remained relatively poorly understood and under-researched. However, over the last 10–15 years, there has been considerable progress in FND research across mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment. In particular, there has been a shift from purely psychological theories regarding conversion of stress to a broader biopsychosocial framework emphasising the importance of biological risk factors and mechanisms, and their compatibility and interaction with cognitive as well as psychological mechanisms as part of more nuanced multifactorial models. Despite these promising developments, there is still significant uncertainty in the field of FND, most evidently demonstrated by limited evidence-based treatments.

There is increasing interest in and use of virtual reality (VR) technology across a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite there being several theoretical reasons why VR could be of utility in FND, there has been little research in this area. In this review, we provide a theoretical framework supporting the implementation of VR-based approaches in FND, with a primary focus on FMD (ie, motor FND) to illustrate and underpin the potential of VR which could be applied and adapted to most if not all FND subtypes.

3 Result

3.1 Demographic Characteristics of the‐China Cohort

The FMD‐China cohort comprised 119 patients, with a mean age at symptom onset of 45.3 years (standard deviation [SD] = 18.6; median = 44 years; range: 18–82 years). The mean symptom duration was 47.2 months (SD = 55.8; median = 24 months; range: 0.1–276 months). Females constituted 58.8% (n = 70) of the cohort, and 50.4% (n = 60) of patients had completed at least 12 years of formal education. Occupationally, 42.9% (n = 51) were employed/students, 23.5% (n = 28) were medically unemployed due to FMD, and 33.6% (n = 40) were unemployed for non‐medical reasons. Symptom onset was sudden in 55.5% (n = 66), subacute (≤ 3 months) in 39.5% (n = 47), and chronic in 5.0% (n = 6). Regarding trauma history, 42.0% (n = 50) reported psychological trauma, 3.4% (n = 4) surgical/medical events, 0.8% (n = 1) traumatic injury with tissue damage, and 10.9% (n = 13) trauma without tissue damage; 42.9% (n = 51) reported no trauma history. Additionally, we compared the summarized data of Garcin's study (Table 1).

Outcome measures

This is an unresolved issue in studies of FMD. Changes in disability (eg, using the Functional Independence Measure), quality of life (eg, the SF-36), clinical global impression (5 point scale)and cost benefit have been used. Objective research measures for FMD, such as the Psychogenic Movement Disorders Rating Scale, have questionable value in clinical practice and also for research because FMD symptoms are so variable.

### Phenomenology and classification of dystonia: a consensus update [^c9a52857]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

This report describes the consensus outcome of an international panel consisting of investigators with years of experience in this field that reviewed the definition and classification of dystonia. Agreement was obtained based on a consensus development methodology during 3 in-person meetings and manuscript review by mail. Dystonia is defined as a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned and twisting, and may be tremulous. Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. Dystonia is classified along 2 axes: clinical characteristics, including age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern and associated features (additional movement disorders or neurological features); and etiology, which includes nervous system pathology and inheritance. The clinical characteristics fall into several specific dystonia syndromes that help to guide diagnosis and treatment. We provide here a new general definition of dystonia and propose a new classification. We encourage clinicians and researchers to use these innovative definition and classification and test them in the clinical setting on a variety of patients with dystonia. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.

### The complex syndrome of functional neurological disorder [^39453cbe]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) often present with multiple motor, sensory, psychological and cognitive symptoms. In order to explore the relationship between these common symptoms, we performed a detailed clinical assessment of motor, non-motor symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability in a large cohort of patients with motor FND. To understand the clinical heterogeneity, cluster analysis was used to search for subgroups within the cohort.

Methods

One hundred fifty-two patients with a clinically established diagnosis of motor FND were assessed for motor symptom severity using the Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale (S-FMDRS), the number of different motor phenotypes (i.e. tremor, dystonia, gait disorder, myoclonus, and weakness), gait severity and postural instability. All patients then evaluated each motor symptom type severity on a Likert scale and completed questionnaires for depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, cognitive complaints and HRQoL.

Results

Significant correlations were found among the self-reported and all objective motor symptoms severity measures. All self-reported measures including HRQoL correlated strongly with each other. S-FMDRS weakly correlated with HRQoL. Hierarchical cluster analysis supplemented with gap statistics revealed a homogenous patient sample which could not be separated into subgroups.

Conclusions

We interpret the lack of evidence of clusters along with a high degree of correlation between all self-reported and objective measures of motor or non-motor symptoms and HRQoL within current neurobiological models as evidence to support a unified pathophysiology of 'functional' symptoms. Our results support the unification of functional and somatic syndromes in classification schemes and for future mechanistic and therapeutic research.

### Functional neurological disorder and somatic symptom disorder in Parkinson's disease [^1f99221a]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) and Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) in PD was not commonly accepted until recently, despite some evidence that emerged in the pre and early L-Dopa era. More recently, the recognition of FND and SSD were noted to be relevant for the management of PD. FND and SSD appear early in the course of PD, often preceding motor symptoms, may interfere with treatment outcomes, often acquire psychotic features during progression, and are mixed with and often concealed by the progressive cognitive decline. We review the related features from the range of the available reports and discuss theoretical models conceived to explain the potential pathophysiological background of these disorders. Finally, we suggest that FND and SSD should be included among the non-motor symptoms of PD and be considered a prodromal feature in a subset of patients.

### Reduced drift rate: a biomarker of impaired information processing in functional movement disorders [^a61fce59]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological disorder is a common and phenomenologically diverse condition. Resultant disability is caused by both the dominant clinical presentation, e.g. paralysis or tremor and additional symptomatology such as cognitive symptoms. Recently the similarity of neuropsychiatric profiles across a range of functional syndromes has been highlighted. This is suggestive of a common underlying mechanism with a theoretical deficit of information processing proposed. Identification of an experimental biomarker for such deficits could offer novel assessment and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we took the temporal discrimination threshold as a paradigm that can be used to model sensory processing in functional movement disorders. Our hypothesis was that we would be able to delineate markers of slowed information processing in this paradigm removed from the phenomenological presentation with a movement disorder. We recorded both response accuracy and reaction time in a two-choice temporal resolution/discrimination task in 36 patients with functional movement disorders and 36 control subjects. A psychometric function was fitted to accuracy data for each individual revealing both abnormally high threshold values (P = 0.0053) and shallow psychometric slopes in patients (P = 0.0015). Patients with functional movement disorders also had significantly slower response times (P = 0.0065). We then used a well-established model for decision-making (the drift diffusion model) that uses both response accuracy and reaction time data to estimate mechanistic physiological dimensions of decision-making and sensory processing. This revealed pathologically reduced drift rate in the patient group, a parameter that quantifies the quality and rate of information accumulation within this sensory task (P = 0.002). We discuss how the deficits we observed in patients with functional movement disorders are likely to stem from abnormal allocation of attention that impairs the quality of sensory information available. Within a predictive coding framework sensory information could be down-weighted in favour of predictions encoded by the prior. Our results therefore offer a parsimonious account for a range of experimental and clinical findings. Reduced drift rate is a potential experimental marker for a generalized deficit in information processing across functional disorders that allows diverse symptomatology to be quantified under a common disease framework.

### Outcomes of a 5-day physiotherapy programme for functional (psychogenic) motor disorders [^9dd4d320]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with functional motor disorder (FMD) are commonly seen by physiotherapists and there is growing evidence to support a physical rehabilitation approach. There are, however, few descriptions in the literature of the content of successful physiotherapy treatment. This prospective cohort study reports the practicalities and outcomes of a pilot 5-day physiotherapy programme. Patients were referred from a specialist movement disorders clinic. The treatment consisted of education and movement retraining, with a long-term self-management focus. Education and movement retraining was based on a pathophysiological model for FMD that stresses the importance of self-focussed attention and illness belief. Patients were assessed at baseline, end of treatment and 3-month follow-up. 47 patients completed the programme, mean symptom duration was 5.5 years, 64% were unemployed due to ill health. At the end of treatment, 65% rated their symptoms as "very much improved" or "much improved", this reduced to 55% at 3 months. At follow-up, there was a significant improvement in physical domains of the SF-36, Berg Balance Scale and 10 Metre Timed Walk. Measures of mental health did not change. This prospective cohort study adds to the growing evidence that supports the use of specialist physiotherapy treatment for FMD. Improvements here were made despite the cohort having characteristics associated with poor prognosis. We argue that specific treatment techniques are important and have the potential to improve physical function, quality of life and may prove to be a cost-effective treatment for selected patients with FMD.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^72d51db7]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Non‐motor symptoms

Functional movement disorder patients scored significantly higher on all non‐motor symptoms compared to the non‐FMD group (Table 1). The presence of bodily pain (a score of < 50 on the RAND36, lower pain scores represent more pain) was reported by 82% of the FMD patients and by 54% of the non‐FMD group (median 33 vs. 49, p < 0.001). Severe fatigue (a score of 35 or more on the CIS) was present in 86% of the FMD versus 59% of the non‐FMD patients (median 44 vs. 38, p < 0.001). Depressive symptoms and anxiety (a score of 5 or more on the PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7) were also more frequent in the FMD group compared to the non‐FMD group, 87% versus 59% (median 10 vs. 6, p < 0.001) and 66% versus 43% (median 7 vs. 4, p < 0.001). Patients with FMD reported also more dissociative symptoms (a score of 8 or more on the SDQ‐5) than patients from the non‐FMD group, 63% versus 26% (median 9 vs. 6, p < 0.001).

TABLE 1
Clinical characteristics and associated features in patients with FMD versus non‐FMD.

Quality of life, severity, physical and occupational impairment

In both groups, quality of life scores were low (3 out of 5) on the WHO ladder in the majority of patients. Severity and physical impairment were significantly different, with higher scores (representing worse outcome) in patients with FMDs. Proportions of patients in study or work did not differ between the two cohorts; however, FMD patients worked significantly less than before and stopped working more often because of their movement disorders compared to non‐FMD patients.

### Physiotherapy for functional motor disorders: a consensus recommendation [^10558d95]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many regard physiotherapy for functional motor disorders (FMD) as a useful part of treatment and there is increasing evidence for its use including a randomised controlled trial. There is, however, very little description, even in these studies, of what physiotherapy should actually consist of. A common view of physiotherapy for FMD is that when it helps, it does so only by providing a 'face saving way-out' for patients (another way of saying that the precise elements of treatment are unimportant as recovery is entirely under the control of the patient). On the contrary, evidence is emerging that the composition of physiotherapy does matter and that targeted physiotherapy based on an underpinning scientific rationale and embedded in transparent communication can address mechanisms that produce and maintain FMD. We therefore met as a group of geographically diverse and multidisciplinary health professionals to create recommendations for the content of physiotherapy for FMD to act as a guide for others and to form the basis of further treatment studies.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^662438a2]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, the aim was to assess the discriminative value of specific historical features and patient characteristics that can help to distinguish patients with FMDs from other movement disorders. Uniquely, it was conducted prospectively before patients were interacting with any physician, which minimizes bias and ensures that the data collected are not overly influenced by the clinician's perspective. The data collected in this study came exclusively from the questionnaires. Previous prediction models have shown clinical value in diagnosing FMDs; however, these were all done retrospectively based on documentation and information from clinicians.

Based on individual clinical data from 465 patients from various movement disorder clinics in the Netherlands and Australia, a novel diagnostic prediction model was developed. The final model yielded an estimated absolute probability of FMD based on self‐reported information from seven objective clinical features. Overall, this model had high diagnostic accuracy, expressed as an AUC curve of 88% (95% confidence interval 85.1–91.5) demonstrating the positive diagnostic value of specific historical and patient characteristics, and therefore clinicians with additional evidence‐based tools for diagnosis.

It was found that more than one out of three referrals had FMD (171 patients), which is higher than reported in previous studies on this topic. Although this study was conducted across various clinics, two of the centres were specialized FMD centres, which may have contributed to the elevated numbers. Compared to non‐FMD patients, FMD patients tended to be younger and had a female predominance. Tremor was by far the most dominant motor symptom in non‐functional patients (59%), which might be due to the relatively high number of patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 76) and essential tremor (n = 37). In the functional group there was considerable variation in key movement phenotype, and almost half of the patients had more than one motor phenotype (48%). This could be due to the difficulty physicians face in phenotyping FMDs, given that they are by definition incongruent with a recognized neurological disease. Another explanation for the large amount of overlap could be a suspected shared pathophysiology between different FMDs, which has been hypothesized in the literature.

### Mind the difference between primary tics and functional tic-like behaviors [^60ea24d5]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

What do these two cohorts tell us when added together with previously published work on sudden onset of tic‐like behaviors, and previous work on functional tic‐like symptoms more generally?

First, they clearly document an explosive presentation of a FND with "Tourette‐like" symptoms. Although at first glance, some similarities with clinical presentation of Tourette syndrome can be found, a closer look, however, reveals several obvious differences, including age of onset, course of symptoms, and number and kind of movement and vocalization. Because most of these patients had been misdiagnosed with Tourette syndrome before being seen at the specialist center, it is of utmost importance not to automatically make the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome in all those patients with otherwise unexplained jerks, vocalizations, and copro‐phenomena, but also to consider the diagnosis of a functional disorder. The typical onset of tics is discrete with simple motor tics such as eye blinking between the age of 5 and 7 years with typical waxing and waning course thereafter. In other words, rapid onset of tic‐like symptoms with complex movements and swear words well after the age of 10 years with constant symptom progression excludes the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.

Second, although patients with functional tic‐like behaviors were generally experiencing symptoms of a higher severity than patients with Tourette syndrome, in many cases an incongruity between reported severity and function is obvious. For example, patients and their families often report that because of the symptoms, unwanted obligations can no longer be performed, while favorite activities can be conducted without any restrictions. Some of the patients even started to present their own symptoms on social media.

Third, there is an interesting association between development of functional tic‐like behaviors and depressive symptoms and anxiety, suggesting that these symptoms may be an additional risk factor for the development of functional "Tourette‐like" behaviors.

Fourth, early diagnosis is key, and these publications will help in the recognition of the phenotype and early diagnostic explanation. Accelerating the diagnostic and diagnostic explanation process is likely to lead to better outcomes going by previous evidence in people with FND. Some clinicians have reported that symptoms may even stop immediately after exclusion of the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and adequate explanation and education.

### Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^fb164faa]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an overview of recent developments in diagnosis, pathophysiology, neuroimaging and management of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMD).

Recent Findings

There has been increasing interest to study the underlying pathophysiology of FMD, which has resulted in a broadened disease model, taking neurobiologic and psychosocial factors equally into account. In this context, the term 'psychogenic' has been replaced by 'functional' movement disorders by many authors in the field to express the changing focus toward a multifactorial disease model. The need for establishing a positive diagnosis of FMD as opposed to providing a diagnosis of exclusion is increasingly recognized and reflected by the introduction of 'laboratory-supported' diagnostic criteria of FMD. Important advances have been made through behavioral, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, although the fundamental cause of FMD remains poorly understood. Of particular interest have been several reports on abnormal sensorimotor features and cortical inhibition in both organic and functional dystonia, highlighting possible shared traits of both conditions. In terms of treatment, recent studies have reported benefit from both psychiatric and physical therapy-based interventions.

Summary

Increasing efforts have been made toward better understanding of FMD, and the disease model has been broadened to include neurobiologic and psychosocial factors. Laboratory-based diagnostic criteria have been established for many FMD to support the clinical diagnosis. To determine the most effective management strategies for FMD, a closer collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists and intensified research efforts with prospective treatment trials are needed.

### Neurobiology of functional (psychogenic) movement disorders [^a74f58a9]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

FROM CONCEPTS TO NEUROBIOLOGICAL MODELS

The discussion above suggests three key concepts that need to be integrated into any model that seeks to explain the generation of FMD. In addition, one would hope that any model could incorporate a role for known precipitating factors and risk factors for development of FMD, as well as being broad enough to account for the known common co-occurrence of different functional neurological symptoms in the same patient.

Voon et al. against the background of a number of functional imaging and behavioural studies in FMD, have proposed a model for how FMD might be generated. The key concept here is of a 'previously mapped conversion motor representation', that is, a (conditioned) pattern of movement established perhaps by a previous triggering event. The commonly reported presence of physical precipitating factors at onset such as injury could provide a relevant trigger for development of a 'conversion motor representation'. The additional emotional arousal that is often reported in the background and/or at the time of onset could certainly increase the salience of sensory information arising during a physical trigger and facilitate this process. Functional imaging studies from this group have provided evidence for hypoactivity in areas usually associated with action selection [e.g. supplementary motor area (SMA)], as well as abnormally strong connectivity between limbic structures (e.g. amygdala) and SMA. The proposal is that in an arousing context, the previously mapped conversion motor representation is activated in part because of the abnormal functional connectivity between limbic structures and SMA, and cannot be inhibited because there is a disconnection between SMA and areas (prefrontal cortex for example) that could usually inhibit unwanted action. The result is a movement that arises without a normal prediction of its sensory consequences (efference copy) and is therefore (mis)interpreted by patients as without agency and therefore not self-generated.

### Contingent negative variation: a biomarker of abnormal attention in functional movement disorders [^82f60127]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the most characteristic clinical features of functional movement disorders (FMDs) is their alteration with attention: when attention is focused onto movement, movement is impaired; but with distraction, movement typically normalizes [1]. This phenomenon of abnormal explicit control of movement and normal implicit control underlies commonly used clinical and electrophysiological diagnostic tests of FMDs such as Hoover's sign and entrainment and distractibility tests in functional tremor [2]. Attentional focus towards the mechanics of moving (i.e. monitoring the current state of the limb to be moved) forms a central feature of neurobiological models of FMD, whilst retraining attentional focus is a key part of specific physiotherapy‐based treatment programmes [1, 3, 4, 5]

There is some evidence of a pathophysiological role for explicitly directed attention in FMD [1, 6]. Therefore, experimental techniques that directly probe explicitly directed attention could help to identify potential biomarkers for FMDs [6]. A useful biomarker would be abnormal in people with FMD when they were symptomatic and would normalize if improvement of symptoms occurred.

The usefulness of a simple pre‐cued reaction time (RT) task, based on the classic Posner paradigm, as a diagnostic biomarker for FMD was previously explored [1, 6]. In this paradigm, a pre‐cue predicts with varying probability which movement will be required (a button press with the right or left hand) following an upcoming 'go' cue. In an initial behavioural study, it was shown that people with FMD, in contrast to healthy controls, did not improve their RT in response to a pre‐cue that reliably predicted the type of movement they were required to make [1]. In a subsequent study, this behavioural effect was replicated and it was shown that the normal desynchronization of beta power that can be detected by electroencephalography (EEG) prior to cued movement was not present in people with FMD performing this task [6]. A non‐significant trend for recovery of this beta desynchronization was found in people with FMD who had improved clinically following specific physiotherapy treatment [6]. This suggested that excessive synchronization of brain activity on the beta band could constitute a biomarker for abnormal movement preparation in FMD [6].

### Physical precipitating factors in functional movement disorders [^e1b72f98]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A traditional explanation for functional (psychogenic) neurological symptoms, including functional movement disorders (FMD), is that psychological stressors lead to unconsciously produced physical symptoms. However, psychological stressors can be identified in only a proportion of patients. Patients commonly reported a physical event at onset of functional symptoms. In this study, we aim to systematically describe physical events and surrounding circumstances which occur at the onset of FMD and discuss their potential role in generation of functional symptoms.

Methods

We recruited 50 consecutive patients from a specialized functional movement disorders clinic. Semi-structured interviews provided a retrospective account of the circumstances in the 3 months prior to onset of the FMD. Questionnaires to assess mood disturbance and life events were also completed.

Results

Eleven males and 39 females were recruited. Forty (80%) patients reported a physical event shortly preceding the onset of the FMD. The FMD occurred after an injury in 11 patients and after an infection in 9. Neurological disorders (n = 8), pain (n = 4), drug reactions (n = 3), surgery (n = 3) and vasovagal syncope (n = 2) also preceded the onset of the functional motor symptom. 38% of patients fulfilled criteria for a panic attack in association with the physical event.

Conclusions

In our cohort, physical events precede the onset of functional symptoms in most patients with FMD. Although historically neglected in favour of pure psychological explanation, they may play an important role in symptoms development by providing initial sensory data, which along with psychological factors such as panic, might drive subsequent FMD.

### Outcome measurement in functional neurological disorder: a systematic review and recommendations [^40cb87c5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Functional neurological disorder (FND or conversion disorder) is defined by motor and sensory symptoms (eg, tremor, dystonia, limb weakness, numbness and seizures) that demonstrate clinical features incompatible with other neurological/medical diagnoses and that are associated with significant distress and functional impairment. Until recently, there were few controlled treatment trials and little research effort into outcome measurement in FND. However, there has been a marked increase in the number and quality of intervention studies, so it is now critical to optimise outcome measures for this population, to facilitate comparison of the effectiveness and efficacy of different treatment modalities for specific FND symptoms.

FND has features that make decisions regarding outcome measurement particularly complex. These include heterogeneity and variability of symptoms and the marked influence of attention, beliefs and expectations. Discrepancy between objective measures and patients' subjective experiences of symptoms can also be a prominent feature. These aspects of FND potentially make objective 'snapshot' measures (eg, clinician-rated scales and objective performance tests) less reliable and valid. They also suggest that patient-rated outcomes may be particularly meaningful in this population.

A wide range of additional physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal and urological problems) are common in people with FND, typically associated with reduced quality of life and greater disability. More generally, elevated physical symptom burden is associated with significant disability, role impairments and high healthcare use. Many individuals with FND report significant psychological symptoms/comorbidity (eg, anxiety, depression and dissociation), potentially unhelpful coping behaviours and illness beliefs, and altered emotional processing, which are associated with symptom severity, poorer outcomes and diminished quality of life. These factors, therefore, may be particularly relevant to psychosocial outcomes in FND.

There is clearly a wide range of outcome domains relevant to FND, and a key challenge is to determine which are most important to capture. In evidence-based medicine, there has been an increasing emphasis on consistency in outcome measurement and the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET,) initiative facilitates the development of core outcome measure sets across a range of physical and mental health disorders. The COMET collaboration recommends five key outcome domains, including core physiological/clinical symptoms, life impact (ie, quality of life, functioning or participation and subjective health perception), resource use (health and social), adverse events and mortality. Another initiative, supported by the National Institutes of Health, involves development of 'common data elements', which currently includes core measures for neurological disorders.

### Functional dystonia and the borderland between neurology and psychiatry: new concepts [^ea2301a8]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Mind-brain dualism has dominated historical commentary on dystonia, a dichotomous approach that has left our conceptual grasp of it stubbornly incomplete. This is particularly true of functional dystonia, most diagnostically challenging of all functional movement disorders, in which the question of inherent psychogenicity remains a focus of debate. Phenomenological signs considered in isolation lack the specificity to distinguish organic and nonorganic forms, and dystonia's variability has frustrated attempts to develop objective laboratory-supported standards. Diagnostic criteria for functional dystonia that place emphasis on psychiatric symptoms perform poorly in studies of reliability, partly explained by the high frequency of psychopathology in organic dystonia. Novel approaches from the cognitive neurosciences may offer a way forward. Theory on Bayesian statistical prediction in cognitive processing is supported by sufficient experimental evidence for this model to be taken seriously as a way of reconciling contradictory notions about voluntary and unconscious motor control in functional movement disorders. In a Bayesian formulation of functional dystonia, misallocation of attention and abnormal predictive beliefs generate movements that are executed without a sense of agency. Building on this framework, there is a consensus that a biopsychosocial approach is required and that a unified philosophy of brain and mind is the best way to locate dystonia in the neurology-psychiatry borderland. At a practical level, movement disorder neurologists are best placed to differentiate organic from functional dystonia. The main role of psychiatrists is in the diagnosis and management of the primarily psychiatric disorders that often accompany dystonia. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^4539148f]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Clinical characteristics and diagnosis

Based on the results of our interim analysis which showed that 15% of patients were not diagnosed with a movement disorder, 529 patients were recruited in this study in the period March 2021–March 2023 (higher than the aim of 500 patients). Fifteen patients were unable to give informed consent. Ten cases were excluded from the study due to lack of a clinical diagnosis from the physician after first consultation and in 39 cases the final diagnosis was not a movement disorder (e.g. polyneuropathy, nine; mononeuropathy, five; lumbar spinal stenosis, four). A total of 465 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study, of whom 171 (37%) had an FMD and 294 (63%) were diagnosed with a non‐FMD. The most common diagnoses in this last group were Parkinson's disease (26%), idiopathic focal dystonia (14%) and essential tremor (13%). A complete list of non‐FMD diagnoses is provided in Table S1.

In FMD patients, the mean diagnostic certainty scored by physicians after the first consultation was 95% compared to 88% in the non‐functional group. In 158 (92%) of FMD patients, physicians reported positive symptoms at neurological examination (distractibility, entrainment, motor inconsistency and/or incongruence). Interestingly, positive symptoms were also scored in 43 patients with a non‐FMD (15%). Two patients (1%) initially diagnosed with FMD turned out to have a non‐FMD after 6 months' review (one orthostatic tremor, one choreatic movements secondary to thalamic infarction), whilst in five patients from the non‐functional group the diagnosis was changed to FMD (2%).

### Functional movement disorders are not uncommon in the elderly [^b463d95f]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Functional movement disorders (FMDs) are thought to be rare in the elderly. Clinical characteristics of the elderly people who develop FMDs are rarely reported. The objective of this study was to highlight the clinical characteristics of FMD in the elderly and compared these with a cohort of patients with a younger age of onset.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective review of the clinical records of patients with FMD who were seen at their center in the last 5 years and had consented to be included in research studies. Patients fulfilling currently accepted diagnostic criteria for FMD as documented, clinically established, or probable were included.

Results

Of 151 patients with FMD who were identified and had sufficient information, 21.0% (n = 33) had an onset after age 60 years (elderly group). The mean age of onset of FMD was 63.5 years (standard deviation, 5.2 years) in the elderly group and 35.5 years (standard deviation, 12.6 years) in the younger group. Tremor was the most common movement disorder in both groups (elderly group, 33.3%; younger group: 38.9%). Fixed dystonia was not observed in any patient who had an FMD onset after age 60 years. Gait abnormalities were significantly more common in the elderly group (69.7%) than in younger patients (23.5%; P < 0.001). Associated psychogenic nonepileptic seizures tended to be more common in elderly patients (18.2%) compared with younger patients (13%; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Contrary to common perceptions, FMDs are not uncommon in the elderly, and 1 in 5 patients in the current cohort, onset of FMD occurred after age 60 years. Gait abnormalities and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures may be more common in older patients.

### Physiotherapy for functional motor disorders: a consensus recommendation [^30c7057b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis, physician explanation and referral to physiotherapy

Recommendations for assessment and correct diagnosis of FMD are available elsewhere. There is a consensus among health professionals regarding the importance of a clear physician explanation to the patient and their carers regarding the diagnosis(detailed further below). The critical outcomes of the explanation which appear to facilitate physiotherapy are:
An understanding by the patient that their treating health professionals accept that they have a genuine problem (ie, not 'imagined' or 'made up');
An understanding by the patient that they have a problem which has the potential for reversibility (ie, a problem with function of the nervous system, not damage to the nervous system) and thus is amenable to physiotherapy.

A physician referral to physiotherapy for FMD should ideally contain a description of what the patient has been told and should be shared with the patient. Awareness of other relevant symptoms that may be present such as pain, fatigue, memory and concentration problems, anxiety and depression is important.

Not all patients with FMD are suitable for physiotherapy. We recommend that the following criteria should usually be met:
Patients should have received an unambiguous diagnosis of FMD by a physician, preferably using the recommendations above.
The patient should have some confidence in or openness to the diagnosis of FMD. Physiotherapy is unlikely to be helpful to someone who believes the diagnosis is wrong.
The patient desires improvement and can identify treatment goals.

Patients who do not fulfil all of these criteria may still benefit from physiotherapy. For example, to help them understand the diagnosis or for disability management where rehabilitation has explicitly failed. Not all patients with an acute onset of FMD will require additional specific treatment. A proportion will experience spontaneous remission, but follow-up studies have shown that the majority of patients remain symptomatic in the long term. Since chronicity of symptoms is associated with poor outcome, we would still recommend early referral of appropriate patients to physiotherapy. The question of how much spontaneous improvement might account for the benefit seen from physiotherapy (or indeed any other treatment) is one that needs to be answered via randomised clinical trials.

### Cranial movement disorders: clinical features, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and treatment [^5f3987ad]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Cranial movement disorders are a common neurological problem. These disorders can be limited to the cranial muscles alone or manifest as part of a more generalized movement disorder. Cranial movement disorders can originate from the highest (motor cortex) to the lowest (cranial nerve and muscle) levels of the motor system. Owing to the lack of diagnostic tests and biomarkers for these disorders, their differential diagnosis can be difficult even for the experienced neurologist. Advances have, however, been made in the identification and treatment of these conditions, and most can be managed effectively with appropriate knowledge of the diagnostic signs and effective treatments. Here, we review the clinical features, pathophysiologies and therapies of the main movement disorders that affect the face, jaw, tongue and palate.

### Triggers in functional motor disorder: a clinical feature distinct from precipitating factors [^dd2cbec2]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with functional motor disorder (FMD), like those with other functional disorders, may report physical events (i.e. injury, illness, general anesthesia) or psychological trauma/stressors (i.e. panic) at the time of symptom onset. These are typically called precipitating factors. For instance, fixed dystonia or functional paralysis is commonly reported after minor injury of the affected limb, functional seizures after panic attacks and irritable bowel syndrome in patients with traveler's diarrhea. These precipitating events, reported either alone or together with a history of predisposing factors (i.e. other functional disorders or adverse experiences) may contribute to abnormal attentional focus and alterations in "predictive processing" models of voluntary movement, ultimately leading to FMD.

Separately it has been noted that some patients may be hypersensitive to external stimuli (i.e. visual, tactile, auditory) which may induce the sudden onset of or exacerbate FMD in individuals who already have the disorder. These triggers have been reported in patients with functional myoclonus and with paroxysmal functional movement disorders.

Previous studies have also reported the presence of abnormal eye and cranial movements provoked by neurological examination (movement) and functional seizures induced by photic stimulation, saline injections and hypnosis. Such triggers have been also described in other neurological diseases like migraine, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease, but they have never been extensively investigated and characterized in FMD. Identifying such triggers may help the clinician to make diagnosis of FMD in particular when they are paroxysmal and understanding them may be useful for therapeutic management of these disorders.

Therefore, in the present study we assessed the clinical features of triggers in a large sample of FMD patients and compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients with and without triggers to understand more about their role in FMD.

### The functional neuroimaging correlates of psychogenic versus organic dystonia [^9caf7805]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for up to 30% of neurology out-patient referrals, and movement disorders are a common presentation. The historical nomenclature is complex, emphasizing poor understanding of their pathophysiology. Some terms are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), whilst others refer to putative aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Here, we use the term 'psychogenic' because of its widespread clinical use, particularly in relation to movement disorders.

Despite the use of established diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of psychogenic movement disorders remains a significant challenge and a 'crisis for neurology'. A better understanding of their neurobiology may help improve diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, which remain poor.

Functional neuroimaging has been used to examine sensory and motor psychogenic neurological disorders (2010;). The focus has been predominantly on negative motor symptoms, such as paralysis. To our knowledge, no neuroimaging studies have specifically examined psychogenic dystonia. Moreover, the published neuroimaging studies have not compared psychogenic neurological disorders with their organic counterparts, instead comparing the changes in neural activation with performance of an unaffected limb or healthy volunteers.

We studied the pathophysiology of psychogenic dystonia using functional neuroimaging in patients with psychogenic dystonia, compared with both healthy controls, and patients with genetically confirmed organic dystonia. To investigate movement-related activations in a homogeneous sample, we chose to examine patients presenting with fixed dystonia of the right lower limb. While dystonia of the lower limb can arise from organic neurological disease, a fixed immobile posture first arising in adulthood without clinical or laboratory evidence for organic disease is a characteristic presentation of psychogenic dystonia. All patients fulfilled probable to clinically established criteria for psychogenic dystonia. We used H₂¹⁵O PET to measure normalized regional cerebral blood flow during three tasks in which participants rested, held a fixed posture or undertook paced ankle movements of their right leg (which was affected in all patients). Continuous monitoring of the surface EMG and footplate manometry were used to monitor task performance.

### The clinical approach to movement disorders [^29d50fa8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Movement disorders are commonly encountered in the clinic. In this Review, aimed at trainees and general neurologists, we provide a practical step-by-step approach to help clinicians in their 'pattern recognition' of movement disorders, as part of a process that ultimately leads to the diagnosis. The key to success is establishing the phenomenology of the clinical syndrome, which is determined from the specific combination of the dominant movement disorder, other abnormal movements in patients presenting with a mixed movement disorder, and a set of associated neurological and non-neurological abnormalities. Definition of the clinical syndrome in this manner should, in turn, result in a differential diagnosis. Sometimes, simple pattern recognition will suffice and lead directly to the diagnosis, but often ancillary investigations, guided by the dominant movement disorder, are required. We illustrate this diagnostic process for the most common types of movement disorder, namely, akinetic-rigid syndromes and the various types of hyperkinetic disorders (myoclonus, chorea, tics, dystonia and tremor).

### Positive signs from the history as an aid for early diagnosis in functional movement disorders: the prospective TASMAN study [^b6e1f072]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although earlier studies suggested otherwise, a comparable number of patients with more than one phenotype in the non‐functional group (39%) was found, so this overlap is not unique to FMDs.

Historical data from our study support the biopsychosocial complexity in functional disorders. Psychiatric and other functional comorbidities were more frequent in FMD patients, which substantiates preliminary findings in the literature and highlights the role of psychological factors in functional neurological disorder. Moreover, patients with FMDs were also more likely to report a positive family history of a functional or psychiatric disorder, which contributes to a biological view on functional disorders. A family history of another neurological condition was common but not discriminative between the two groups and might be seen as a risk factor for an FMD as well as a non‐FMD.

In line with previous studies, patients with FMDs were more likely (51% vs. 25%) to have an acute onset and/or specific trigger that preceded symptoms, for example traumatic injury, new medication. For a long time the emphasis of a diagnosis of a functional disorder was on psychological stressors. Our data confirm studies by Pareés et al. that non‐psychological triggers are equally important to the development of FMDs. More than half of the FMD patients (55%) versus only 21% of non‐functional patients could describe the onset of their symptoms in detail. This may reflect that precipitating events occurring at the initial onset of the disorder not only possibly contribute to disrupted attentional focus and changes in predictive processing but also have significant impact on patient's recall accuracy. For the descriptions, this group used almost twice as many words as patients with other movement disorders. This finding is remarkably similar to findings in patients with functional cognitive symptoms (another subgroup of functional disorders), who provide a more detailed personal history with explicit examples in comparison to people with neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. dementia). This further supports overlap, not only between different functional motor phenotypes, but also between different subtypes of functional disorders in general.

### Identifying tardive dyskinesia: risk factors, functional impact, and diagnostic tools [^58810827]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder induced by dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs), including antipsychotics. Because the introduction of second-generation antipsychotics has reduced but not eliminated the risk for TD as had been hoped, recognizing and treating TD are important skills for clinicians. Many patients rely on DRBAs for chronic conditions. To minimize the risk of patients' involuntary movements becoming permanent, they must be detected early and treated. To improve the early recognition and diagnosis of TD, clinicians must know the risk factors, understand the functional impairment, regularly and systematically assess their patients, and appropriately apply diagnostic criteria.

### Frequency and characteristics of functional neurological disorder in the emergency department [^66fb1267]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Epidemiological characteristics

In 2023, 5504 neurological cases were treated in the emergency department. The keyword search of the entire emergency department documentation and further review identified 187 individual neurological emergency presentations that satisfied all inclusion criteria. The complementary inpatient discharge diagnosis-based search identified 18 additional cases. Of those 205 cases, 6 were ultimately diagnosed with a non-functional condition at discharge (1 discharged from ED, 5 from neurology wards). Thus, 199 patients, 3.6% of the total patient volume, had leading functional symptoms. Of those, 141 (71%) were female; age ranged between 18 and 83 (median: 33 years).

Clinical characteristics

Most patients (90%) had acute-onset symptoms, while 8% presented with subacute problems (onset 2–30 days ago), and only 2% had chronically persistent symptoms. In total, 108 cases (54%) had a functional/dissociative seizure; 42 patients (21%) had a motor or sensory deficit; 18 (9%) had dizziness; 15 (8%) another sensory symptom; 12 (6%) had a movement disorder other than paralysis or weakness; in 4 patients (2%), the primary complaint was related to communication or cognitive problems.

Of all cases labelled as "seizures" at initial triage assessment (645 cases, 12% of total neurological cases), 14% (88/645) were ultimately diagnosed as functional (note that not all functional/dissociative seizures were initially triaged as "seizures"). For other symptom categories, such analyses were not feasible due to the lack of specificity of keywords used in the triage system (e.g. dizziness can be tagged as "unwell adult", "fall", "unspecified neurological problem" or "stroke").

Overall, 154 (77%) received a confirmed or presumptive FND diagnosis; 12 (6%) were seen as functional neurological symptoms in the context of another neurological or psychiatric disorder ("functional overlay"); in 33 cases (17%), FND was considered a possible but not necessarily likeliest diagnosis or symptoms were simply "unexplained".
