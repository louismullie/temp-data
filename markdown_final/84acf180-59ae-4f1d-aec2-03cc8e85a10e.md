A.	Repeat the vaccination series
B.	Give him a second of hepatitis B
C.	Give a booster dose of hepatitis B

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient who, during a routine check-up, is found to have anti-HBs levels below the normal range, specifically whether to give a booster dose, repeat the vaccination series, or take another action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the serologic context with a complete HBV panel. Then, I should verify the quantitative anti-HBs value and what constitutes "protective" versus "adequate" thresholds. Next, I will interpret possible serologic patterns to distinguish vaccine-induced immunity from prior infection or nonresponse. After that, I should decide on management: a single booster versus a full repeat series, with special considerations for immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will outline follow-up timing and counseling, including when to label someone a nonresponder and what to do about exposures or immunosuppression risks.

> Let me first confirm the serologic context because anti-HBs alone is not enough to make a decision. I need HBsAg and total anti-HBc to define whether this is vaccine-induced immunity waning, prior infection with loss of surface antibody, or nonresponse to vaccination, and I should double-check that total anti-HBc is used rather than IgM, which would imply acute infection rather than past exposure or vaccine response [^113Vf5hB] [^114XN4gN].

> Wait, let me verify the quantitative anti-HBs value and the thresholds that matter. A titer of at least 10 mIU/mL is generally considered seroprotective in immunocompetent persons after a completed series, but many high-risk or immunocompromised settings use a higher threshold of 100 mIU/mL to better ensure durable protection, so I need to know the exact number and the clinical context before deciding on a booster versus a full repeat series [^113Vf5hB] [^111TTp3R] [^111a7Xkq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should interpret the serologic pattern carefully: if HBsAg is negative and anti-HBc is negative with low anti-HBs, that supports vaccine-induced immunity that has waned. If HBsAg is negative and anti-HBc is positive with low or absent anti-HBs, that suggests resolved infection with loss of surface antibody. If all three are negative, that indicates susceptibility and likely nonresponse or incomplete vaccination, and I should confirm there is no acute infection window by ensuring IgM anti-HBc is not being used to make this call [^113Vf5hB] [^114XN4gN].

> I will now examine management for waning vaccine-induced immunity. For immunocompetent adults with prior documented response whose anti-HBs has fallen below 10 mIU/mL, a single booster dose is appropriate, and I should recheck anti-HBs 1–2 months later to document restoration of seroprotection, recognizing that immunologic memory often persists even when titers decline, which is why a booster frequently suffices [^113Vf5hB] [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or in a high-risk setting like hemodialysis? I should confirm whether a higher threshold is used locally, because many dialysis and immunocompromised protocols consider anti-HBs less than 100 mIU/mL an indication for a booster, and in some programs routine surveillance every 6–12 months is recommended to catch waning titers early and maintain protection [^111TTp3R] [^116FbfiR].

> Let me consider nonresponders next. If anti-HBs remains less than 10 mIU/mL after a properly administered standard series, I should repeat the entire series, and in adults who failed a conventional series, switching to Heplisav-B (CpG-adjuvanted) can improve seroconversion rates, after which I should recheck anti-HBs 1–2 months after completion to document response. If two complete series fail to achieve seroprotection, I should label the patient a nonresponder and counsel on exposure precautions and HBIG for post-exposure prophylaxis rather than attempting further vaccination cycles [^115UEsC3] [^111TTp3R].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought any anti-HBs below 10 mIU/mL always meant repeating the whole series. Hold on, I should verify that nuance because in previously vaccinated immunocompetent adults a single booster is usually sufficient when titers wane, whereas repeating the entire series is reserved for those who never achieved seroprotection or who remain below 10 mIU/mL after a booster challenge, so I need to ensure I distinguish waning from nonresponse before choosing between options A and C [^113Vf5hB] [^112Xka3b].

> Next, I should review special populations. In people with HIV or other immunocompromised states, isolated anti-HBc warrants a single standard vaccine dose followed by anti-HBs testing, with completion of a full series if the post-dose titer is below 100 mIU/mL, and in children with HIV or other high-risk groups, periodic anti-HBs checks every 5 years with boosters if titers fall below 10 mIU/mL are reasonable given faster waning of memory responses [^111a7Xkq] [^114cpYi7] [^114SWM3u].

> I need to ensure follow-up is planned. After any booster or repeat series, I should recheck anti-HBs in 4–8 weeks to confirm seroprotection, and for high-risk patients such as those on hemodialysis or with ongoing immunosuppression, I should consider periodic titer surveillance and boost when titers fall below the locally defined threshold, balancing assay variability and clinical risk [^111TTp3R] [^114PW1Hv].

> Finally, I should confirm counseling points. If the patient is a confirmed nonresponder after two appropriate series, I will counsel on strict exposure avoidance and ensure a plan for immediate HBIG plus vaccine in the event of a high-risk exposure, and if future immunosuppression is anticipated, I should coordinate HBV reactivation risk assessment and prophylaxis planning with the treating specialist because anti-HBs alone does not reliably prevent reactivation in high-risk regimens [^111TTp3R] [^115FR6Ny].

The correct answer is **C. Give a booster dose of hepatitis B**. For patients with prior HBV vaccination and anti-HBs below 10 mIU/mL, a **single booster dose** is recommended to restore protective immunity, with anti-HBs rechecked 1–2 months later. If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL, repeat the full vaccination series; if still < 10 mIU/mL after two series, manage as a non-responder with risk counseling and HBIG for exposures [^112Xka3b] [^111TTp3R].

---

## Interpretation of anti-HBs levels

Anti-HBs is the protective antibody produced after HBV vaccination or natural infection. In vaccinated individuals, **anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL** indicates seroprotection and long-term immunity [^113Vf5hB]. Over time, anti-HBs may wane below 10 mIU/mL, but immunologic memory typically persists, enabling an anamnestic response to booster dosing [^113Vf5hB].

---

## Clinical significance of low anti-HBs levels

Low anti-HBs (< 10 mIU/mL) in a previously vaccinated patient indicates **waning immunity** but does not necessarily mean loss of protection. Immunologic memory can persist for decades, and a booster dose usually restores protective antibody levels [^113Vf5hB].

---

## Recommended management strategies

### Booster dose (option C)

A **single booster dose** is the recommended approach for patients with prior HBV vaccination whose anti-HBs has declined below 10 mIU/mL. This strategy leverages immunologic memory to rapidly restore protective antibody levels [^112Xka3b]. After the booster, check anti-HBs 1–2 months later; if ≥ 10 mIU/mL, protection is restored and no further action is needed [^112Xka3b].

---

### Repeat vaccination series (option A)

Repeat the full vaccination series only if the **booster fails** to achieve anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL. This approach is reserved for non-responders or those with inadequate immune memory [^112Xka3b].

---

### Second dose of hepatitis B vaccine (option B)

A second dose without completing the series is **not recommended**, as it is unlikely to provide durable immunity and deviates from evidence-based practice.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| CDC | - Booster dose if anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after prior vaccination <br/> - No routine repeat series unless booster fails [^notfound] |
| AASLD | - Booster dose for waning immunity <br/> - Repeat series only if booster fails [^notfound] |
| WHO | - Booster dose for waning immunity <br/> - Repeat series if booster fails |

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require higher vaccine doses or modified schedules; consider Heplisav-B for enhanced immunogenicity [^115UEsC3].
- **Healthcare workers**: Regular monitoring and boosters if anti-HBs declines below institutional thresholds [^notfound].
- **Dialysis patients**: More frequent monitoring and boosters due to rapid antibody decline [^116tfADc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate management for a patient with low anti-HBs on routine check-up is a **single booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine** (option C). This approach is evidence-based, cost-effective, and aligns with current guidelines. Repeat the full series only if the booster fails to restore protective antibody levels [^112Xka3b].

Rationale

We recommend that non-responders to HBV should receive no further immunisation - the likelihood of benefit is low, compared to the cost burden. However there is some evidence that non-responders to a 4 dose 40 μg schedule might subsequently respond to a large dose given intra-dermally. In high risk groups (potential transplant recipients, individuals intending to dialyse away from base in a high risk area) this should be considered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those more likely to respond to second courses include non-smokers, low BMI, age < 40, or high levels of immunosuppressive drugs at the time of the first vaccination.

A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B).

They should also be advised about the risks of overseas travel and dialysis away from base. Patients who are not immune to HBV who dialyse in units where the prevalence of risk of HBV is higher should undergo a period of enhanced surveillance on their return to the UK, and be dialysed on their own machine, ideally in a segregated area. (1C).

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Rationale

Haemodialysis patients who mount a good response to vaccine appear unable to maintain high antibody levels. Fleming et al. showed that 57% of haemodialysis patients who mounted a good response had lost detectable anti-HBs within 6 months of immunisation, and therefore will need a booster dose of the vaccine to maintain their immunity.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^111JT23M]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Serology-based counseling prior to anticancer therapy — patient messages should reflect specific HBV test patterns: Patients who have isolated anti-HBc may need further work-up because the HBV management for these patients depends on the type of anticancer therapy administered, and these patients are not at risk for transmission through sexual or close personal contact. Patients with a detectable anti-HBs but who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc can be counseled that they have protective levels of antibody from previous vaccination. Patients who are positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs have resolved hepatitis B infection and should be counseled that they are at risk, albeit lower than if they had a negative anti-HBs, of HBV reactivation. Patients who are negative for all HBV screening tests (negative HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) are considered not to be immune to HBV, have never been exposed to HBV, and may benefit from HBV vaccination, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing of anticancer therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111a7Xkq]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isolated anti-HBc management in HIV — People with isolated anti-HBc should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HepB vaccine and anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination (BII). If the anti-HBs titer is ≥ 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed; if < 100 mIU/mL, a complete series of the same HepB vaccine should be completed and followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). The cutoff of 100 mIU/mL is used because 100% with a titer of 100 mIU/mL after a booster maintained response for > 18 months compared with only 23% with a titer of 10 to 100 mIU/mL; if quantitative titers are not available, complete the series followed by qualitative anti-HBs testing (BII).

### Advancing patient care: integrating new data [^117Mucfa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Physicians involved in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection are frequently faced with complex clinical issues concerning the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of patients. Guidelines exist within the literature that help with decision making; however, in practice individual nuances are often encountered necessitating decisions that go beyond the current guidelines. Following presentation of the available data, a panel of expert hepatologists and gastroenterologists sought to identify and solve challenges that are faced by clinicians in the daily management of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. The following summary provides an overview of the outcome of these discussions. Because of the complexities of clinical management, the recommendations reflect the opinion of the majority; however, many recommendations were not unanimous. Furthermore, the recommendations that follow are limited to adult patients; the treatment of children was not discussed. A number of issues were identified, and statements concerning possible management strategies that could be applied were developed.

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^111WJjmX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Tdap, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations — ACIP-aligned preventive care in IBD: Vaccination against Tdap, HAV, HBV, and HPV should be administered as per ACIP guidelines (conditional recommendation, with very low level of evidence). All adult patients with IBD should receive non-live vaccines per national guidelines, and for HBV care clinicians should recognize reactivation risk and, before anti-TNF's, perform testing for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb with vaccination of the nonimmune patient. HBV vaccine response is high in healthy individuals (> 95%) but lower in IBD (33–76%); in immunocompromised patients hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be checked 1–3 months after completing the series, some experts advise checking every 12–24 months, there is debate on protective titers (above 10 vs above 100 IU/l), and if titers do not rise appropriately consider administration of another 3 vaccination series at the regular dose.

### Recommendations for screening, monitoring, prevention, prophylaxis and therapy of hepatitis B virus reactivation in patients with haematologic malignancies and patients who underwent haematologic stem cell transplantation-a position paper [^1176MxrK]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Scope

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection reactivation is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematologic malignancy and/or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, information on this issue is limited. The scope of this position paper is to provide recommendations on HBV screening, monitoring, prophylaxis, treatment and vaccination in the patients described above.

Methods

These recommendations were developed from one meeting of experts attended by different Italian scientific societies as well as from a systematic literature review (of articles published through December 31, 2016) on HBV infection in haematologic patients and in patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation published in the same issue of the journal. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess each recommendation's quality.

Questions Addressed

These recommendations provide the answers to the following questions: (a) HBV screening and monitoring: Who should be screened before chemotherapy? Which screening tests should be used? Should HBV-DNA detection be used to monitor HBV reactivation before starting antivirals? What is the best timeline to monitor HBV reactivation? (b) Prophylaxis in HBsAg-positive patients: Which antiviral drugs should be used to treat HBsAg-positive patients? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided to HBsAg-positive patients? (c) Prophylaxis in patients with resolved HBV infection: Which patients with resolved HBV infection should receive antiviral prophylaxis? Which antiviral drug should be used? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided? (d) HBV infection management strategy in autologous (auto-HSCT) and allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT): Which HSCT recipients should receive antiviral prophylaxis? Which antiviral drug should be used? How long should antiviral prophylaxis be provided? (e) Choice of antiviral drugs in the treatment of HBV reactivation: Should third-generation anti-HBV drugs be preferred to first- or second-generation antiviral drugs in the treatment of HBV reactivation with or without hepatitis flare in haematologic patients? (f) Immunization against HBV in patients with haematologic malignancies and/or patients who underwent HSCT: Should these patients be vaccinated? Which HBV vaccination schedule should be adopted?

Recommendations

Haematologic patients should be screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) plus anti-hepatitis B core protein (HBc), and HBV DNA before chemotherapy. HBV DNA levels should be monitored monthly in all HBV-positive patients who do not receive prophylaxis. HBsAg-positive haematologic patients and those undergoing HSCT should receive third-generation antiviral therapy as prophylaxis. Anti-HBc-positive lymphoma patients and those receiving HSCT should receive antiviral prophylaxis. All HBV-negative haematologic patients should be vaccinated for HBV. The acquisition of data from well-designed studies is desirable in the near future.

Guideline 5.6 – BBV infection: identification and management of 'non-responders' to the immunisation programme

We suggest that patients should be regarded as an inadequate-responder if the anti HBs antibody titre is < 100mIU/ml 8 weeks after completing the first complete immunisation schedule. (1C).

We would suggest the following strategies:
If the anti HBs Ab titre is between 10 IU/ml and 100 IU/ml we recommend administering a booster dose of the vaccine. (1C)
If the anti HBs titre is < 10 IU/ml we recommend repeating the entire vaccination course with the high concentration of the vaccine (or the appropriate dose for children age < 16 years). (1C) Follow up with an anti-HBs antibody titre test 4 to 6 weeks following the last injection to ensure it is greater than 10 m IU/l.
If after two full vaccination courses the Anti HBs titre remains < 10mIU/ml we recommend that the patient is labeled as a non-responder to the vaccine, and therefore not immune to HBV.
A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and the recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B)

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Immunisation of staff against Hepatitis B virus (guidelines 6.1–6.2)

Guideline 6.1 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against hepatitis B

We recommend that staff members who have clinical contact with patients should be immunised against HBV and demonstrate that they are immune to, and are not infected with HBV. (1A). Staff members who have current infection with HBV require occupational health clearance and ongoing monitoring in order to perform clinical duties. They would not usually be employed to work clinically on a dialysis unit.

Guideline 6.2 – BBV infection: immunisation of staff against hepatitis B

We suggest that staff that are not immune to HBV and are not HBV infective should not dialyse patients who are HBV infective. (2B).

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114hBctn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

HBV immunity assessment and vaccination around anticancer therapy are outlined. Anti-HBs testing allows for assessing immunity, and individuals who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc, as well as anti-HBs, have never been exposed to HBV, are not immune, and thus are susceptible to HBV infection. Vaccination can be recommended, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing, although insufficient data exist to recommend vaccination specifically for immunocompromised individuals. Some recommendations suggest waiting 3–6 months after cessation of anticancer treatment, and because anticancer therapy can dampen immunogenicity of HBV vaccination, higher doses or more intensive vaccination regimens may be needed to achieve protective levels of anti-HBs. If immunocompromised patients receive vaccination, postvaccination serology testing has been suggested. Among patients who have isolated anti-HBc–positive with negative HBsAg and anti-HBs, studies have shown that protective levels of anti-HBs can decrease risk of HBV reactivation.

### New and old biomarkers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^114BTGsH]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests to detect the presence and activity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the cornerstones of diagnosis and management. Assays that detect or measure serum levels of HB surface antigen, HB surface antibody, and HB core antibody are used to identify patients with exposure to HBV, whereas other tests provide information on the level of virus replication, presence of specific variants, and presence of virus reservoirs. Newer diagnostic tests, used only in research settings so far, aim to quantify levels of intrahepatic HBV replication. Other tests have been developed to detect HBV infection in resource-limited settings. We review point-of-care tests (essential in global screening efforts), standard diagnostic tests used in routine clinical management, and newer tests that might be used in clinical trials of agents designed to cure HBV infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112KLnvY]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination — titer testing and isolated anti-HBc management: Anti-HBs should be obtained 4 weeks after completion of the vaccine series to document response to HepB vaccination, defined as anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL (AIII). Vaccinate individuals with isolated anti-HBc with one standard dose of HepB (BIII) and check anti-HBs titers 1–2 months afterward. If anti-HBs ≥ 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL, then vaccinate with a complete series of HepB (double dose) followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If titers are not available, then give a complete vaccine series followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If a significant delay occurs between doses, there is no need to restart the series.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114XN4gN]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111E5aYJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV/HBV coinfection — proposed chronic HBV monitoring in children outlines phase-specific intervals and general management. Immunotolerant: ALT and CBC 1–2 times per year, HBeAg/Anti-HBe annually, HBV DNA N/A, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. Immunoactive: ALT and CBC every 2 months ×3a, HBeAg/Anti-HBe every 6 months, HBV DNA every 6 months, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. Chronic carrier: ALT and CBC 1–2 times per year, HBeAg/Anti-HBe N/A, HBV DNA N/A, HBsAg/Anti-HBs every 2–3 years. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis: ALT and CBC every 2 months ×3a, HBeAg/Anti-HBe N/A, HBV DNA every 6 months, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. If abnormal ALT persists for 6 months, HBV treatment should be considered. HBV disease activity should be closely monitored with determination of serum ALT every 6 to 12 months depending on disease status, and if serum transaminase levels are persistently elevated (more than twofold the upper limit of normal for ≥ 6 months), HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA levels should be obtained before the initiation or escalation of anti-HBV therapy. Liver biopsy is not required before treatment but may help to determine the severity of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and to exclude other causes of liver disease. Clinical and laboratory exacerbations of hepatitis and hepatic flare also can occur if agents with anti-HBV activity are discontinued; once ARV drugs with anti-HBV activity are begun they should be continued indefinitely unless contraindicated, and if discontinuation of therapy for chronic HBV infection results in hepatic flare, therapy for chronic HBV should be reinstituted.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112XB1jN]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric patients receiving HCV direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — pretherapy screening and monitoring: Testing for active HBV infection (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) is recommended prior to initiating HCV DAA therapy in pediatric patients due to the risk for HBV reactivation during or after treatment, and on-treatment and posttreatment glucose monitoring for hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with diabetes and INR monitoring in those taking warfarin is recommended due to potential alterations in dose–response relationships associated with DAA-related HCV viral clearance.

### The role of HBsAg levels in the current management of chronic HBV infection [^117Lesc3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can result in liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the natural course of the disease is highly dynamic and not every patient requires therapy. The challenges for optimal management are who to treat, which therapeutic regimen to use, and when to begin or stop treatment. Constant monitoring is mandatory to predict the natural course and guide treatment decisions. Surrogate markers for baseline and on treatment decisions are needed. Besides HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen levels also proved to be useful to help judge the natural course and guide treatment. High levels of HBsAg are suggestive of low fibrosis and immune tolerance in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive patients; whereas low levels of HBsAg indicate a lower risk for HCC and inactive carrier state in HBeAg negative patients. Data also support the possible use of HBsAg levels as an on-treatment response marker. So far, the best evidence exists for treatment with interferon (IFN)-α where lack of HBsAg decline after 12 weeks is associated with non-response. Thus, stopping rules after 12 weeks therapy could be established for HBeAg positive as well as for HBeAg negative patients. However, the positive predictive value for achieving sustained response is still vague. The value of HBsAg monitoring is less clear during treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) but it can be a useful marker for new concepts such as stopping NA or add-on IFN strategies. Currently, several studies are underway to validate HBsAg in these settings.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113jMngm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in people with HIV — definition, activity criteria, HDV testing, and isolated anti-HBc — should be approached as follows: Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on two occasions at least 6 months apart, and people with chronic HBV infection should be tested further for HBV e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe), and HBV DNA; "Active" disease can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of both serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations, defined as ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (≥ 70 U/L for males and ≥ 50 U/L for females). Because people with chronic HBV infection are at risk for coinfection with HDV, anti-HDV should be checked once chronic HBV infection is diagnosed, and if positive, then HDV RNA should be obtained to look for chronic infection. In low-prevalence settings, isolated anti-HBc may represent a false-positive, but its presence can signify past HBV infection with subsequent loss of anti-HBs; isolated anti-HBc occurs in 7% to 19% of people with HIV, and among people with HIV and isolated anti-HBc the frequency of HBV viremia typically ranges from 1% to 10%, so routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended. People with HIV — particularly with hepatitis C virus coinfection — have a higher frequency of isolated anti-HBc, and people whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg negative with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc.

### Comparison of nine commercially available assays for quantification of antibody response to hepatitis B virus surface antigen [^114PW1Hv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Quantitative measurement of anti-HBs is used to evaluate the response to hepatitis B vaccination in health care workers and to optimize postexposure management. The different guidelines for hepatitis B vaccination and booster policy imply that the measurement of anti-HBs levels by different assays is accurate and consistent, yielding comparable quantitative results. We measured anti-HBs levels in 200 serum samples from patients and health care professionals by nine different anti-HBs assays and compared the quantitative results and the performance characteristics of the different test systems. The assay specificity ranged between 96.8 and 100% when sera from individuals without a vaccination history and with negative anti-HBc status were defined as true negatives. Sensitivity ranged between 93.5 and 100%. A high number of sera showed discrepancies between measurements by the different systems. The mean coefficient of variation between the different measurements was 47.1% (range, 15.0 to 201.0%), and the factors of multiplication ranged from 2.8 to 105. Hemolysis or lipemia did not seem to influence the measurement, and there was no difference between anti-HBc-positive and -negative individuals. The classical enzyme immunoassays tend to find lower anti-HBs levels than the automated systems, with higher values by the Abbott AXSYM assay. The serial dilution of the international standard preparation was measured accurately by most of the assays. In conclusion, the quantitative measurement of anti-HBs levels is not reliable, even though an international standard is used for the calibration of the systems. Some systems showed specific problems that should be addressed by the manufacturers.

Guideline 3.4 – BBV infection: management of patients who do not consent for BBV testing

We suggest that patients who do not consent to BBV surveillance as described above should have dialysis in a segregated area unless they are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months. If patients who are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months do not consent to BBV surveillance then they should be managed in the same way as patients with HCV infection (see section 4) (2C).

Audit Measure 3: What proportion of prevalent dialysis patients are known to be immune to HBV (anti HBs > 10 mU/mL within the last year). Of the remainder, what proportion has a HBsAg test result from within the last 3 calendar months?

Audit Measure 4: The proportion of incident patients starting regular hospital haemodialysis who have anti HBs antibody titre > 10mIU/mL.

Rationale (for 3.1–3.4)

BBV infections are asymptomatic in the majority of individuals and therefore a surveillance system is required to detect new BBV infection and implement measures to limit the opportunity for nosocomial spread. The frequency of surveillance testing should be determined in part by patient specific risk factors, the local prevalence and incidence of infection. The UK is a low prevalence country for BBV infection in patients with.

Established renal failure and so surveillance can be less frequent than in higher risk countries. Surveillance needs to be enhanced if the patient's overall risk is high or if the individual patient experiences an event that increases the risk. Our previous guidelines have recommended patients on regular hospital haemodialysis who are immune to hepatitis B infection (annual anti HBs antibody titre > 100 mIU/ml) only need to be tested for HBsAg once a year. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In a US study, 8% of chronic haemodialysis patients became unprotected due to a fall in antibody titres over a 12 month period. For this reason, we recommend testing this group of patients on a 6 monthly basis.

The updated EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for its management. Spanning ten thematic sections, the guidelines address diagnostics, treatment goals, treatment indications, therapeutic options, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, management of special populations, HBV reactivation prophylaxis, post-transplant care, HBV prevention strategies, and finally address open questions and future research directions. Chronic HBV remains a global health challenge, with over 250 million individuals affected and significant mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These guidelines emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, risk stratification based on viral and host factors, and tailored antiviral therapy. Attention is given to simplified algorithms, vaccination, and screening to support global HBV elimination targets. The guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimise HBV care and outcomes worldwide.

Best practice advice 7 — hepatitis B vaccination strategy in IBD: All adult patients with IBD should be evaluated for latent hepatitis B infection. Patients who have previously completed a full hepatitis B vaccine series but are not seroprotected (hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] < 10 mIU/mL) should receive a single challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine; Four to 8 weeks after this challenge dose, their anti-HBs levels should be measured to evaluate for an anamnestic response. An anamnestic response, indicated by an anti-HBs level ≥ 10 mIU/mL (seroprotection), suggests immunologic memory, and no further doses are needed; if no anamnestic response is observed, the patient should complete a second full 2- or 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccination.

Clinical Management of Exposed HCP

HCP who have anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL (or who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated) and sustain an exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status should undergo baseline testing for HBV infection as soon as possible after the exposure, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later. Testing immediately after the exposure should consist of total anti-HBc, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later should consist of HBsAg and total anti-HBc (Table 5).
HCP exposed to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status do not need to take special precautions to prevent secondary transmission during the follow-up period; however, they should refrain from donating blood, plasma, organs, tissue, or semen. The exposed HCP does not need to modify sexual practices or refrain from becoming pregnant. If an exposed HCP is breastfeeding, she does not need to discontinue. No modifications to an exposed HCP's patient-care responsibilities are necessary to prevent transmission to patients based solely on exposure to a source patient who is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

Guideline 7.1 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit

Guideline 7.1.1 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit

We recommend that when a new case of HBV infection is identified, the affected patient should be referred to HBV specialist for further evaluation and consideration of antiviral treatment.

Antiviral therapy against HBV is effective in reducing the viral load to undetectable levels and as a result reducing both the infectivity of the patient and the potential for long term sequelae of HBV.

Guideline 7.1.2 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit - surveillance of prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that, whenever a previously unidentified case of HBV infection is identified, units should carry out enhanced HBV surveillance (as described in section 3.6) on all patients who are not adequately immune to HBV (anti HBs titre > 100mIU/mL within the six months) who have had a dialysis session in that unit since the index patient's last negative test. (1B).

Guideline 7.1.3 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis B virus infection within the Haemodialysis unit – immunisation of prevalent Haemodialysis population

We recommend that, whenever a previously unidentified case of HBV infection is found, those patients who have anti-HB titre 10–100mIU/ml in the preceding 6 months, who have had a dialysis session in that unit since the index patient's last negative test should also be given a booster dose of Hep B vaccine. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) should be considered for previous non-responders to Hepatitis B vaccine (anti-HBs < 10mIU/ml) who may have been exposed in the previous 7 days. (1B) (Table 2).

Guideline 7.2 – BBV infection: management of a new case of Hepatitis C virus or HIV infection within the Haemodialysis unit

We recommend that, when a previously unidentified case of HCV is found, enhanced surveillance (as described in section 3.6) should be carried out in all patients who have had a dialysis session in that unit since the index patient's last negative test. (1C).

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112Hquz5]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B natural history and progression risks — Resolved chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is defined by HBsAg clearance with anti-HBs acquisition, and in inactive CHB about 0.5% clear HBsAg yearly. Among untreated adults with CHB, cumulative 5-year incidence of cirrhosis is 8%-20%; among those with cirrhosis, 5-year risks are hepatic decompensation 20% and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2%-5%. HBV DNA levels, ALT levels, and HBeAg status are key determinants; risk stratification has been shown in adults with HBV DNA levels above 2,000 IU/mL, where higher HBV DNA is associated with progressively higher rates of cirrhosis and HCC. Clearance of HBsAg reduces risk of hepatic decompensation and improves survival, and low-level HBV DNA may be transiently detected in a minority after seroclearance.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114SWM3u]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV immunity monitoring after HepB vaccination in individuals with HIV — children and adolescents — states that in individuals who have a response to HepB vaccination (anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL), assessment of anti-HBs titers approximately every 5 years can be considered. If anti-HBs titers fall below 10 mIU/mL, they should be provided a booster, and anti-HBs titers should be checked 4 to 6 weeks after a booster dose (weak, very low); if anti-HBs is still < 10 mIU/mL, completion of the standard three-dose series should be done. Waning of anti-HBs levels below 10 mIU/mL after HBV immunization in children with HIV is common, and only 24% to 46% of patients developed an anamnestic response, as defined as an anti-HBs titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL 4 weeks after one vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Disease recommends annual anti-HBs testing and booster doses when the anti-HBs levels decline to < 10 mIU/mL for hemodialysis patients and other immunocompromised people if they have an ongoing risk for HBV exposure; one study of nonresponders demonstrated that 92% of children had anti-HBs titers of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after completion of the vaccine series, and one study in children with HIV who responded to HepB vaccine found that B-cell memory decreased after 4 years and were below appropriate levels by 6 years post-vaccine. Thus, assessment of anti-HBs approximately every 5 years can be considered in children.

### The HBV drugs work: now what? [^111e4VBK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Chemotherapeutic agents for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression work, but only when administered to the patient. They do not appear to promote durable, long-term immunological control. After 3 years of effective anti-HBV therapy, a small percentage of patients maintained good control, manifest by controlled serum liver enzymes, low-level HBV-DNA, and controlled HBsAg concentrations. However, this did not occur in the majority of patients. We need a better understanding of the defects in HBV immunity and how to induce effective reconstitution that will maintain viral suppression, albeit either through innate or adaptive immunity.

5.3	Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, including life threatening hepatitis B, was observed in the clinical program.

HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication, manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA levels or detection of HBsAg, in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels. In severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur.

Screen patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with TAVNEOS. For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during TAVNEOS treatment.

Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis, or HBV reactivation during and for six months following TAVNEOS therapy.

In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while on TAVNEOS, immediately discontinue TAVNEOS and any concomitant therapy associated with HBV reactivation, and institute appropriate treatment. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming TAVNEOS treatment in patients who develop HBV reactivation. Resumption of TAVNEOS treatment in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing HBV.

Rationale

Response should be assessed by measuring plasma anti HBs antibody 8 weeks after completion of the immunisation schedule. There is on-going debate about what constitutes a response to immunisation.

Conventionally > 100mIU/ml was regarded as conferring immunity but there is evidence that even patients who have a lower peak response (10–100mIU/ml) will not become chronic carriers of HBV.

The significance of this titre was illustrated in a five-year follow-up study of 773 homosexual men vaccinated in 1980; most severe infections occurred among those who never achieved a titre > 9.9mIU/ml. The risk of late infection in those with an initial titre of > 9.9mIU/mL increased markedly when antibody levels decreased below 10mIU/mL, but only 1 of 34 of these late infections resulted in viraemia and liver inflammation.

In a series of haemodialysis patients, with anti HBs antibody titres > 10mIU/ml who received transplants from HBsAg positive donors, 67% seroconverted to anti-HBc positivity - suggesting that such an anti-HBs titre does not always protect against HBV infection in HD patients.

It is worth being aware of the possibility of HBV surface mutants that can cause HBV infection in patients with apparently adequate anti HBs titres and seem to occur in endemic regions with large HBV vaccination programs (vaccine escape mutants).

More than half of haemodialysis patients who respond to immunisation do not maintain detectable antibody. In one of the early randomised controlled studies of immunisation there were 4 cases of hepatitis B infection in dialysis patients who had an apparent response to immunisation in whom the antibody levels had waned, suggesting a strategy of antibody surveillance and booster doses may be worthwhile.

In one small Italian study the monitoring of antibody titres and the administration of additional doses enabled maintenance of protective HBV antibody levels in 96% of patients 4 years after initial immunisation.

Retrospective reviews from the 1990s convincingly demonstrate a higher response in non-dialysis compared to dialysis patients (80% compared to 50% in one analysis). In 2003 Da Rosa et al. prospectively demonstrated that GFR was an independent positive predictive variable of seroconversion in response to the vaccination.

Previous guidelines have also recommended annual testing of patients who have ever achieved a HBV titre > 10mIU/mL with administration of a booster dose of vaccine if titre < 100mIU/ml but we acknowledge that the frequency of surveillance and the titre to trigger a booster dose is debatable.

### EASL 2017 clinical practice guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection [^1118zjpo]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, EASL 2017 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing pegylated IFN-α in patients with no decrease in HBsAg levels and < 2log₁₀ IU/mL reduction in serum HBV DNA levels at 12 weeks of therapy as it predicts no response in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B with genotype D.

### The role of HBsAg levels in the current management of chronic HBV infection [^115D8GrC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The immune tolerant phase is followed by the immune clearance phase, in which the immune system tries to eliminate the virus. This phase is characterized by variable HBV DNA levels, which in general tends to decrease. On liver biopsy, there is marked active hepatitis. ALT levels are fluctuating, but tend to be above the upper normal limit. So far, there is no evidence that HBsAg levels help to predict anti-HBe seroconversion. Nevertheless, HBsAg levels drop and reflect the ongoing immune response. In most patients, the immune clearance phase results in anti-HBe seroconversion, but some patients do have an unsuccessful immune clearance. These patients are at increased risk for development of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The best usual scenario for HBsAg positive patients is the development of HBeAg negative inactive carrier state, where anti-HBe antibodies are present, HBV DNA is low, and there are no marked signs of hepatitis in the liver biopsy. Because of the fluctuating ALT and HBV DNA levels, the differentiation between ongoing HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis and the inactive carrier state may be difficult and requires close monitoring.

To differentiate the latter two phases and estimate the prognosis of the natural course of HBV infection, different markers have been studied. The REVEAL Study showed that the development of HCC depends on the viral load, measured by serum HBV DNA. HBV DNA of > 2,000 IU/mL is associated with a cumulative incidence of HCC of 3.57% after 13 years. The risk becomes more prominent with rising viral loads and surpasses 12% for HBV DNA levels exceeding 20,000 IU/mL.

Hence, the current recommendations for the American and European guidelines use the HBV DNA cut-off of 2,000 IU/mL to define the inactive carrier state, which is correlated with good survival prognosis and low incidence of cirrhosis and HCC.

Further help to discriminate between inactive carriers and chronic HBeAg negative hepatitis B can be provided by assessing the HBsAg levels. Several studies showed that inactive carriers had lower HBsAg levels, with HBsAg levels < 1,000 U/mL having a 87.9% PPV and 96.7% NPV for patients with HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^114u4ARf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isolated anti-HBc in people with HIV during pregnancy — interpretation and vaccination steps are outlined: testing of anti-HBc alone can be a false positive, and the incidence of HBV viremia with the isolated anti-HBc pattern ranges from 1% to 36% in patients with HIV. Most people with HIV with isolated anti-HBc are HBV DNA–negative and not immune to HBV infection; therefore, they would benefit from HBV vaccination. While routinely checking HBV DNA is currently not recommended in other adults with HIV and isolated anti-HBc, it may be considered in pregnancy, and if HBV viremia is identified during pregnancy with isolated anti-HBc, ART should be adjusted to assure control of both HBV and HIV. People with isolated anti-HBc and negative or unknown HBV DNA should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HBV vaccine, anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination, if the anti-HBs titer is > 100 IU/mL no further vaccination is needed, and if the titer is < 100 IU/mL a complete HBV vaccine series should be given followed by anti-HBs testing. Isolated anti-HBc and occult HBV infection are typically associated with very low levels of HBV DNA and therefore extremely low risk of transmitting HBV perinatally.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116sTxoW]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The probability of acquiring HIV infection in UK dialysis units is very low and therefore does not justify regular surveillance for otherwise low risk patients. However, unless there is a robust system of routinely questioning patients to assess for risks of new BBV infection, there is a potential to miss new cases of BBV. Therefore many units routinely screen for HIV antibody on a 6–12 monthly basis. Similarly, in an attempt to reduce complexity with BBV surveillance, many units in the UK routinely screen for HBsAg and HCV on a 3 monthly basis in all patients and this approach is perfectly acceptable.

We recommend that patients planning to dialyse outside the UK should have a risk assessment prior to travel for potential exposure to BBV abroad. Where exposure is considered likely, enhanced surveillance testing for BBV should be planned and instituted and patients should have dialysis in a segregated area as detailed below (1B).

Rationale

Good practice guidelines for renal dialysis and transplant units by DoH provides guidance on classifying countries at low, medium or high risk of BBV exposure for patients dialysing away from base (see Appendix 1). Prior to travel units should review the immunisation status of the patient and administer booster vaccinations if needed.

Individual units may wish to undertake a risk assessment of the planned DAFB unit (accepting that the assessment of risk is subjective), counsel patients regarding the potential risks of BBV infection and the plans for segregation and surveillance on return. The level of risk for BBV exposure will depend on the prevalence of BBV in the country visited, infection control policies in the DAFB unit and lifestyle activities of individual patients.

On return from DAFB, patients should be risk assessed for potential exposure to BBV whilst abroad. Examples of questions to be included in this risk assessment on return are highlighted in Appendix 2.

Depending on the risk of BBV exposure we recommend the following level of surveillance:

Our previous guidelines have suggested that enhanced surveillance for HBV is not required if immune with HBsAb level > 100 mIU/mL in the last 12 months. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In view of this and in an attempt to reduce the level of complexity in the guidelines, which can lead to errors if misinterpreted, we have recommended same level of surveillance irrespective of HBsAb levels.

### Hepatitis B – more treatments, more testing, not enough data [^116TkLcQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Published clinical guidelines, such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the US Treatment Algorithm, and the NIH Consensus Conference, offer recommendations as to the frequency of monitoring of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBeAg for different subgroups of chronic HBV patients. They also give recommendations as to when to initiate antiviral HBV treatment and guidelines as to the choice of drug or combination or drugs. Unfortunately there are several problems with these recommendations. For one, the recommendations are quite complicated. For example, for patients who are HBeAg positive and have ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal, the AASLD recommends monitoring the ALT every 3 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6 months. However, if the patient is HBeAg positive but the ALT is less than the upper limit of normal, then they recommend monitoring the ALT every 3–6 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6–12 months. For patients who are HBeAg negative with an ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA between 2,000–20,000 IU/ml, they recommend checking the ALT every 3 months and the HBV DNA every 3 months. The purpose of this frequent monitoring is to determine when a patient may be transitioning from active to inactive phases of disease or vice versa, or when a patient would become eligible for antiviral treatment. However, the second and more significant problem with these guidelines is that there are no data to support the recommended frequencies for laboratory monitoring. While it is increasingly evident that ALT elevation and HBV DNA level are strong predictors of development of cirrhosis and HCC,–the recommendations for indefinite monitoring of ALT, DNA, and HBeAg every 3 or 6 months have never been studied in any randomized trial or been compared to other frequencies, and there are no data to show that such frequent monitoring leads to an increased use of antiviral treatment or a mortality benefit. The third problem with the current guidelines is that long-term management with this frequency of complex monitoring is an ambitious charge for providers and patients. The intensity of the schedule requires a significant burden of both time and resources for both providers and patients. Finally, as for the guidelines for the use of treatment of HBV, while there are clinical trials to support benefits and safety of each therapy or combination of therapies, the endpoints in HBV treatment trials have largely been surrogate markers, such as suppression of HBV DNA, normalization of ALT, and seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials of anti-HBV therapies have demonstrated a beneficial impact on overall mortality, liver-specific mortality, or development of HCC.

### Hepatitis B vaccine… [^111WVeiu]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination The table below provides recommendations for screening, testing, and vaccination among adults and all persons with risk. Prevaccination testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible people, especially in populations that have less engagement with or access to health care. In settings where testing is not feasible or is refused by the patient, the clinician should offer vaccination and, at future visits, should offer testing again. Population Screening and testing recommendation Vaccination recommendation Adults with no known risk factors for hepatitis B
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Vaccinate §adults aged 19–59 years. People with risk factors, regardless of age.
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- If previously screened, but still unvaccinated, offer testing to people who have ongoing risk for exposure
- Vaccinate. No differences in immunogenicity have been observed when one or 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer are followed by doses from a different manufacturer. Whenever feasible, the same vaccine should be used for the subsequent doses; however, if a different brand is administered, the dose should be considered valid and do not need to be repeated. Engerix-B For persons from birth through adulthood People aged 19 years and younger should receive three doses. People aged 20 years and older should receive three doses. Adults on hemodialysis should receive four doses. See package insert for detailed dosage instructions. See the Engerix-B package insert.

Vaccine effectiveness Each of the HepB vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection. Studies indicate that immunity persists for at least 30 years among healthy people who initiate HepB vaccination at less than 6 months of age. Hemodialysis Providers should vaccinate adult hemodialysis patients needing HepB vaccination with high-dose Engerix-B or Recombivax HB. See package insert for detailed dosage instructions. Pregnancy Providers should vaccinate pregnant patients needing HepB vaccination with Engerix-B, Heplisav-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation risk and monitoring during glucocorticoid therapy: Risk increases with dose and duration; moderate (10–20 mg daily) to high (> 20 mg daily) doses for ≥ 4 weeks have been associated with a risk of reverse seroconversion of 1%-10%, whereas glucocorticoid therapy for < 4 weeks carries a risk (< 1%). Assessments of serum HBV DNA and HBsAg at intervals of 1–3 months has been suggested by the AASLD. Patients with AIH who are HBsAg-negative/ anti-HBc-positive during the diagnostic phase should undergo periodic serological testing (HBsAg, HBV DNA) during conventional therapy with prednisone or prednisolone in conjunction with AZA to detect HBV reactivation and the need for on-demand antiviral therapy, and patients with prior HBV infection treated with high-dose glucocorticoids or other immune modulators, especially B cell–depleting agents, are at moderate risk for HBV reactivation and should be considered for preemptive antiviral therapy.

### Prevention of hepatitis B reactivation in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy: a case series and appraisal of society guidelines [^1116yEsx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

SOCIETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS AT RISK OF HBVR

HBVr is preventable. Identifying patients at risk and initiating adequate treatment or close surveillance is important because a delayed detection of HBVr or the failure to start prophylaxis may lead to severe hepatic injury and liver failure that may not be reversible, even after the initiation of antiviral therapy (such as in cases 1–3). Several major international gastroenterology and hepatology organizations have published recommendations for the testing and management of HBV infection in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy: the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL). Small differences aside, the guidelines agree in the general principles for the prevention of HBVr which include (1) recognizing the need to screen patients prior to the initiation of immunosuppression, (2) stratifying the risk of HBVr based on serostatus and immunosuppressive regimen, and (3) tailoring management strategies based on the risk and including close monitoring with preemptive treatment or antiviral prophylaxis.

Screening

Most guidelines recommend screening for HBV infection in all patients planned to receive immunosuppressive regimens including HBsAg and anti-HBc, followed by a HBV DNA test if either one is positive. The role of anti-HBs screening in addition to HBsAg and anti-HBc is controversial: EASL and APASL recommend anti-HBs as a part of screening, while AGA and AASLD do not. The role of anti-HBs screening is even less clear, since the presence of anti-HBs does not prevent HBVr. However, the level of anti-HBs may provide additional information regarding the risk of HBVr, as a titer > 100 IU/ml has been associated with a decreased HBVr incidence. In addition, the presence of anti-HBs may confirm past infection in HBsAg−/anti-HBc+ patients, and conversely, a loss of anti-HBs may be a predictor of HBVr. APASL furthermore recommends the assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis in all CHB patients and in all patients with resolved HBV infection, since patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are at higher risk of mortality and morbidity in case of HBVr.

### Stratified management based on surface antibody for the prevention of hepatitis B virus reactivation in lymphoma patients [^112f84rC]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to investigate a stratified approach based on hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antibody (anti-HBs) for managing HBV reactivation (HBVr) in lymphoma patients with serological protection against HBV. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 209 lymphoma patients with a baseline anti-HBs titre of ≥ 10iu/L, who were either positive or negative for HBV core antibody (anti-HBc). The results revealed that 15.7% of patients lost serological protection following 6-month anti-lymphoma therapy. With a median follow-up of 28.1months, the cumulative rates of HBVr at 6months, 2years and 4years were 2.9%, 4.7% and 6.3% respectively. Without intervention, the overall rate of reactivation was 2.0% for patients with isolated anti-HBs and 10.5% for those with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc. To identify patients at high risk of losing seroprotection and susceptible to HBVr, a predictive model was developed. The high-risk group had significantly higher rates of serological protection loss (27.8% vs. 2.2%) and cumulative incidence of HBVr (22.0% vs. 0%) compared to the low-risk group. Overall, this study highlights the risk of HBVr in lymphoma patients with positive anti-HBs, with or without positive anti-HBc, and recommends periodic monitoring for low-risk patients and early intervention for high-risk patients.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131TvQM]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — detection and prevention of reactivation of HBV infection — patients on immunosuppressive agents are at risk for reactivation, and guidelines have been developed recommending routine pretreatment screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Based on serological profile and immunosuppression factors, the risk of HBV reactivation during treatment can be estimated as high (≥ 10%), moderate (1%-10%), and low (< 1%); depending on the risk category, a preemptive treatment or monitoring strategy with the intent of on-demand therapy can be developed. Prophylactic antiviral therapy, preferably with high-potency agents, has been recommended for patients at high to moderate risk, while watchful monitoring with intent of on-demand therapy has been recommended for patients at low risk. The risk of HBV reactivation in patients with AIH who are treated with conventional regimens of prednisone or prednisolone in combination with AZA is unknown, and reported risk levels in glucocorticoid-treated patients relate mainly to individuals with HBsAg who are at risk of developing viremia detected by HBV DNA; these patients warrant antiviral prophylaxis but constitute a small percentage of patients with AIH who would be considered for glucocorticoid therapy. HBsAg-negative patients with anti-HBc constitute another risk category for reactivation, but reverse seroconversion has occurred mainly in patients treated with B cell-depleting agents, TNF inhibitors, and chemotherapeutic agents.

### Selecting appropriate management strategies for chronic hepatitis B: who to treat [^114aqTtx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant problem. In the United States estimates indicate that 0.3% of the population (1.25 million individuals) have chronic hepatitis B infection.

Methods

Review of published practice guidelines and literature on management of hepatitis B to determine: 1) Which persons in Western populations are at the highest risk for HBV infection and should be screened for HBV seromarkers to identify those who are chronically infected and those who need to be protected with hepatitis B vaccine; 2) The importance of regular monitoring in persons with chronic hepatitis B, the frequency of monitoring, and which tests should be performed; 3) How to identify the patients who are appropriate candidates for antiviral therapy.

Results

Recommendations for screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection are reviewed. Important differences are discussed between the Practice Guidelines for chronic hepatitis B developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL). In addition, this article reviews which patients who are no covered by these Guidelines might be candidates for antiviral therapy.

Discussion

Established practice guidelines provide direction to providers for the diagnosis and management of chronic HBV infection to reduce the risk of serious sequelae. However, not all patients with chronic hepatitis B are identified, and many of those who are diagnosed do not receive adequate management and follow-up.

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the USA suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

Unvaccinated HCP

For unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated HCP, the source patient should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after the exposure. Testing unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated HCP for anti-HBs is not necessary and is potentially misleading, because anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL as a correlate of vaccine-induced protection has only been determined for persons who have completed an approved vaccination series (Table 5).
If the source patient is HBsAg-positive or has an unknown HBsAg status, the HCP should receive 1 dose of HBIG and 1 dose of HepB vaccine administered as soon as possible after the exposure. HepB vaccine may be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomical injection site (e.g. separate limb). The HCP should complete the HepB vaccine series according to the vaccination schedule. To document the HCP's vaccine response status for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed approximately 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose. Anti-HBs testing should be performed using a method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Because anti-HBs testing of HCP who received HBIG should be performed after anti-HBs from HBIG is no longer detectable (6 months after administration), it might be necessary to defer anti-HBs testing for a period longer than 1–2 months after the last vaccine dose in these situations (Table 5). HCP with anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL after receipt of the primary vaccine series are considered immune. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels. HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after receipt of the primary series should be revaccinated. For these HCP, administration of a second complete series on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than conducting serologic testing after each additional dose of vaccine. So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose.
If the source patient is HBsAg-negative, the HCP should complete the HepB vaccine series according to the vaccination schedule. So the HCP's vaccine response status can be documented for future exposures, anti-HBs testing should be performed approximately 1–2 months after the final vaccine dose (Table 5). HCP with anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL after receipt of the primary vaccine series are considered immune. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology provisional clinical opinion: chronic hepatitis B virus infection screening in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of malignant diseases [^112tc9r5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

PURPOSE An American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provisional clinical opinion (PCO) offers timely clinical direction to ASCO's membership following publication or presentation of potentially practice-changing information. This PCO addresses recommendations for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection screening in patients receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemotherapy for treatment of malignant diseases.

Clinical Context

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued Recommendations for Identification and Public Health Management of Persons with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection, recommending screening for hepatitis B infection (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], antihepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc], and antibodies to HBsAg [anti-HBs]) for "persons receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, chemotherapy for malignant diseases…)".

Provisional Clinical Opinion

The evidence is insufficient to determine the net benefits and harms of routine screening for chronic HBV infection in individuals with cancer who are about to receive cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy or who are already receiving therapy. Individuals with cancer who undergo certain cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapies and have HBV infection or prior exposure to HBV may be at elevated risk of liver failure from HBV reactivation. As such, HBV screening requires clinical judgment. Physicians may consider screening patients belonging to groups at heightened risk for chronic HBV infection or if highly immunosuppressive therapy is planned. Highly immunosuppressive treatments include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic cell transplantation and regimens including rituximab. Screening based on a high risk of prior HBV exposure or risk of reactivation due to planned therapeutic regimens should include testing for HBsAg as a serologic marker for HBV infection. In some populations, testing for anti-HBc should also be considered. There is no evidence to support serologic testing for anti-HBs in this context. When evidence for chronic HBV infection is found, antiviral therapy before and throughout the course of chemotherapy may be considered to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation, although evidence from controlled trials of this approach is limited. Screening and/or treating HBV infection should not delay the initiation of chemotherapy.

Note

ASCO's provisional clinical opinions (PCOs) reflect expert consensus based on clinical evidence and literature available at the time they are written, and are intended to assist physicians in clinical decision-making and identify questions and settings for further research. Due to the rapid flow of scientific information in oncology, new evidence may have emerged since the time a PCO was submitted for publication. PCOs are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence. PCOs address only the topics specifically identified in the PCO and are not applicable to interventions, diseases or stages of disease not specifically identified. PCOs cannot account for individual variation among patients, and cannot be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care provider, relying on independent experience and knowledge of the patient, to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, adherence to any PCO is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its application to be made by the physician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. ASCO PCOs describe the use of procedures and therapies in clinical practice and cannot be assumed to apply to the use of these interventions in the context of clinical trials. ASCO assumes no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of ASCO's PCOs, or for any errors or omissions.

### Management of chronic hepatitis B: an overview of practice guidelines for primary care providers [^1179BT9C]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the introduction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains an important disease burden worldwide and in the United States. A number of clinical practice guidelines are available to assist in the clinical management of CHB by providing recommendations regarding screening and diagnosis, treatment indications, and the choice, duration, and monitoring of treatment. Adherence to these guidelines has proven beneficial in terms of better treatment compliance, improved clinical outcomes, and lower likelihoods of emergency admission. This review summarizes current recommendations from the major clinical CHB practice guidelines and presents a simple algorithm for the treatment of patients with CHB to help primary care providers make informed choices in clinical practice. In general, antiviral treatment should be initiated in patients with CHB who have a high risk of liver-related morbidity and who are likely to respond to treatment, that is, patients with persistently elevated serum HBV DNA and either increased serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations or advanced liver disease. In patients who are eligible for antiviral therapy, treatment should be initiated with one of the recommended first-line therapies (pegylated interferon-α, entecavir, or tenofovir), and treatment efficacy should be monitored regularly for serum HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and serologic responses. Patients who are not immediately considered for treatment should be monitored and started on antiviral therapy in case of disease progression. A number of issues in CHB management remain controversial or unresolved, such as identifying treatment candidates, managing partial or nonresponders, and predicting treatment response; we discuss some of the latest evidence around these topics.

### Management of healthcare personnel living with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus in US healthcare institutions [^1174EpAi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in healthcare personnel (HCP) — vaccination follow-up and transmission data: The current CDC guidelines recommend that negative persons be tested 1–2 months after the last dose of the HBV vaccination series, and the vaccination series be followed by assessment of post-vaccination immunity (anti-HBs). If anti-HBs determination is negative, CDC recommends re-vaccination; if the second course does not produce protective levels of anti-HBs, CDC recommends that HCP be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) to determine infectivity. A report documented 4 instances of chronic HBV infection in HCP who failed to respond to 2 courses of vaccination. Since the previous guidance, only 2 instances of HCP-to-patient transmission of HBV have been reported, and in both events the HCP had viral loads > 10⁸ (ie, ~2.0 × 10⁷ IU/mL).

### Risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation in people with multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab: an observational study from Turkey [^113Ahjgd]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The observation of HBV reactivation in three patients from our cohort, who did not receive regular antiviral prophylaxis, stands in contrast to existing literature. Notably, two of these patients displayed normal ALT levels, while one exhibited only mildly elevated ALT levels. Despite the virological and biochemical changes, all remained clinically asymptomatic. Following the initiation of TDF as an antiviral treatment, a swift and substantial reduction in HBV DNA levels was observed in two patients, indicating a positive response to the intervention. Furthermore, the third patient consistently maintained a negative viral load after achieving full compliance with TDF. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in mitigating HBV reactivation and further emphasize the clinical significance of regular monitoring in patients undergoing treatment with ocrelizumab for MS. A previously reported case from Italy described a 60-year-old male patient with resolved HBV infection (anti-HBs: 10.02 mUI/mL) who encountered HBV reactivation six weeks after receiving the first dose of ocrelizumab. By the 13th week, HBV DNA levels had risen to 184 IU/ml, yet the patient remained asymptomatic with normal liver enzyme levels. Successful treatment with entecavir was administered to manage the reactivation. In this study, two out of the three patients who experienced reactivation had anti-HBs levels below 100 mUI/mL, and one had anti-HBs negativity. In the Spanish study, which included 28 patients (22 rituximab, 6 ocrelizumab), the median anti-HBs level was determined as 105.5 mIU/L (range: 0–609.3), and no instances of reactivation were observed. In the study conducted in Italy, no significant difference in reactivation was observed between patients with anti-HBs titers < 100 and > 100 mUI/mL. However, it was recommended to prioritize prophylaxis for those with anti-HBs levels < 100 mUI/mL. In light of this information, initiating antiviral prophylaxis for patients with anti-HBc total positivity, anti-HBs negativity, or low titers (< 100 mUI/mL) is considered a safer approach. There is a need for multicenter prospective randomized controlled trials to assess the risk of HBV reactivation in patients receiving ocrelizumab for the diagnosis of MS. Despite its valuable contributions, this study is not without limitations. The single-center design introduces potential biases, necessitating validation through multicenter trials. Additionally, the retrospective nature of data collection may not capture all relevant variables, emphasizing the need for prospective studies. The median follow-up duration, while informative, may not fully elucidate long-term trends, necessitating extended monitoring for comprehensive risk assessment.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^113j57qD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination and screening in IBD — Adults with IBD should receive vaccination against hepatitis B if not immune, and reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported in immunosuppressed patients with IBD with serious consequences. Testing for HBV infection (determination of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb], and hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb]) and vaccinating any nonimmune patient is recommended before starting an anti-TNF medication; seroprotection against HBV is determined by measuring the levels of HBsAb in the serum with concomitant negative HBsAg and HBcAb levels, and there is some debate about the titer level that represents adequate protection against hepatitis B, with some groups recommending titers above 10 mIU/mL and others above 100 mIU/mL.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### The role of HBsAg levels in the current management of chronic HBV infection [^114NdsKb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In line with the HBsAg cut-off of < 1,000 IU/mL, the REVEAL study demonstrated that HBsAg level of < 1,000 IU/mL and even more < 100 IU/mL is linked to a lower risk for HCC development in the predominant HBeAg negative study population.

The ultimate goal in HBV infection is HBsAg loss. Patients who underwent anti-HBs and anti-HBe seroconversion had the absolute lowest risk with a cumulative risk for HCC < 1% over 9 years, which shows the huge importance of HBsAg seroconversion and immune control of the virus. Fattovich et al showed that patients with compensated cirrhosis with HBsAg loss had a survival of nearly 100% after 14 years. As a major cofactor to low HBV DNA for anti-HBs seroconversion, HBsAg levels of < 100 IU/mL at baseline corresponded to an increased chance of HBsAg clearance, but further evaluation is needed.

In this regard, attention should be focused on the specific HBV genotype, as highest levels of HBsAg are found in genotype A infected patients, with genotype A and D having overall higher values than genotype B and C. Neglecting these facts could lead to over- and under-estimation of future HBsAg cut-offs in distinct patient populations.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Significance of anti-HBc alone serological status in clinical practice [^1151o2e3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Serum samples identified as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, are referred to as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the donor. The identification of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the window phase, and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6–12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^113AfaGT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with malignancy, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to monitor ALT and HBV DNA levels at baseline before or at the beginning of anticancer therapy, as well as every 6 months during antiviral therapy. Monitor ALT and hepatitis levels frequently, at least monthly for the first 3 months after the cessation of antiviral therapy and every 3 months thereafter. Coordinate care with a clinician experienced in HBV management for patients with chronic hepatitis B, especially to monitor for withdrawal flares, determine monitoring and antiviral therapy after the cessation of anticancer therapy, and evaluate for advanced liver diseases, such as cirrhosis or liver cancer.

### Implementing evidenced-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^111jt352]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In the past 2 years, evidenced-based guidelines and statements on screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from several organizations and experts have been published. The purpose of this article is to take the recommendations from these documents and help guide clinicians — whether they are primary care providers, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, or public health workers — about how to incorporate these guidelines into practice. The first task is for all providers to be involved in identifying persons with chronic HBV infection (CHB). New recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocate screening for the HBV in those at highest risk, especially persons from countries where HBV is endemic. Using information from the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient infected with HBV, especially the hepatitis B e antigen/antibody status, clinicians can classify the patient into 1 of the 4 phases of HBV infection. Because CHB is a dynamic process and patients can move from inactive to active infection status, and vice versa, all patients must be followed with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase monitoring every 3 to 12 months for life. Those with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels (> 2,000 IU/mL) should be referred to a specialist for evaluation for possible treatment. Patients selected for antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogues should be followed every 3 to 6 months to detect emergence of antiviral resistance to the agent chosen. In addition, alpha-fetoprotein should be tested and ultrasound performed on all men aged > 40 years and women > 50 years of age to detect any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an early stage. Algorithms are included for primary care providers providing information on initial evaluation and management and referral of persons with CHB, and for specialists evaluating and treating HBV. Implementing steps to identify, follow, refer, and treat appropriately persons with CHB infection by all primary care and specialist healthcare providers can have a major impact on reducing the occurrence of HCC and cirrhosis in infected persons.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^11566r4Y]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

HBV management — past HBV infection in hematologic malignancy and anti-CD20 or stem-cell transplant settings: Patients with past HBV with hematologic malignancies anticipating anti-CD20 or stem-cell transplantation have a high risk of HBV reactivation and should start antiviral prophylaxis prior to anticancer therapy and continue it at least 12 months after the end of anticancer therapy and even longer, as their cumulative risk of reactivation increases until nearly 2 years after cessation of anticancer therapy. Risk of reactivation is higher with negative anti-HBs than anti-HBs–positive; in one study of 63 HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive lymphoma patients, undetectable anti-HBs at baseline prior to rituximab-containing therapy predicted HBV reactivation (hazard ratio, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.37 to 8.98; p = 0.009). As an alternative to prophylaxis, monitoring without antiviral therapy in 83 HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive patients on anti-CD20 therapy used frequent laboratories every 4 weeks; the rate of reactivation was 25%, and once reactivation developed, follow-up increased to every 2 weeks; active HBV disease was defined as reverse HBsAg seroconversion or an increase in ALT > 2× upper limit of normal; all treated had normalization of ALT with HBV DNA to undetectable levels and there were no cases of clinical hepatitis, liver failure, or death.

Evaluating and managing infants who were exposed to HBV — Infant post-vaccination testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg should be performed after completing the vaccine series, between the ages of 9 months and 18 months, and serologic testing should not be performed before age 9 months. Anti-HBc testing of infants is not recommended because passively acquired maternal anti-HBc might be detected in infants aged ≤ 24 months who were born to mothers with HBV. HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels > 10 mIU/mL are protected and need no further medical management, whereas HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs levels < 10 mIU/mL should be revaccinated with a single dose of HBV vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1 to 2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs levels remain < 10 mIU/mL following single-dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HBV vaccine to complete the second series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing at 1 to 2 months after the final dose.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116QAarU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.
