## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnostic test is most appropriate next for a 68-year-old woman with worsening heartburn, treatment failure on ranitidine, and unintentional weight loss, and to transform the reasoning into a clinical, reference-aware flow. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether alarm features are present that mandate endoscopy. Then, I should verify how treatment failure on an H2 blocker influences the next step. Next, I will consider the patient's risk profile for Barrett's and esophageal adenocarcinoma. After that, I need to check whether empiric PPI therapy is still appropriate or if it would delay necessary evaluation. Finally, I will review the role of pH monitoring and manometry and conclude with the guideline-concordant choice and rationale.

> Let me first confirm the presence of alarm features. Unintentional weight loss is a classic alarm symptom in GERD evaluation and, in this patient, is coupled with treatment failure on ranitidine and microcytic anemia, which together raise concern for complications such as erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, Barrett's esophagus, or malignancy; guidelines consistently prioritize endoscopy when alarm features are present, so I should not delay endoscopic evaluation here [^116tM8YT] [^115vgcgJ] [^111MRBjf].

> Wait, let me verify the implication of treatment failure on an H2 blocker. I initially thought, "If she hasn't had a PPI trial yet, maybe I should start one empirically", but hold on, that would be a mistake in the presence of alarm features; guidelines recommend proceeding directly to endoscopy when alarm symptoms exist, rather than empiric PPI, because endoscopy is needed to detect structural disease and complications that would change management and prognosis [^116tM8YT] [^115vgcgJ] [^113n1fnD].

> I need to check the patient's risk profile for Barrett's and esophageal adenocarcinoma. She is older than 50, female, White, has long-standing GERD, and is a smoker, which places her in a higher-risk category where endoscopic evaluation is favored to assess for Barrett's and related pathology; this further strengthens the case for EGD rather than empiric therapy or physiologic testing at this stage [^115vgcgJ] [^116tM8YT].

> Next, I should review the role of empiric PPI therapy. Empiric PPI trials are appropriate for typical GERD without alarm features, but they are not appropriate when alarm symptoms are present because they can mask symptoms and delay diagnosis of serious disease; here, with weight loss and anemia, endoscopy is indicated first to exclude malignancy and complications, and only after a negative endoscopy would reflux monitoring be considered to phenotype refractory symptoms [^116tM8YT] [^1172ddqh] [^111zeLSJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of 24-hour pH monitoring and esophageal manometry. pH monitoring is useful to confirm or exclude GERD in patients with persistent symptoms after a negative endoscopy or to phenotype refractory disease, and manometry is used to evaluate motility when a motility disorder is suspected; neither test is appropriate as the initial step when alarm features are present, so they should follow, not precede, endoscopy in this scenario [^116tM8YT] [^1172ddqh] [^111MRBjf].

> Let me consider the differential and why endoscopy is time-sensitive. In older adults, severe erosive esophagitis and complications are more common even when heartburn seems "typical", and symptoms can be subtle; thus, early endoscopy allows visualization of mucosa, detection of strictures, grading of esophagitis, and biopsy of suspicious areas or suspected Barrett's, which cannot be accomplished with physiologic testing alone [^112nXnoy] [^115m3dRt] [^115vgcgJ].

> I should double-check the guideline synthesis. Multiple high-credibility sources converge: ACG recommends endoscopy as first test for alarm symptoms such as weight loss and for patients with multiple Barrett's risk factors; ASGE similarly directs to endoscopy when alarm features are present; and AGA advises that when alarm symptoms exist or symptoms fail PPI, endoscopy with subsequent reflux monitoring off therapy is the correct pathway, which fits this patient precisely [^116tM8YT] [^115vgcgJ] [^111zeLSJ].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to directly visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, assess for erosive esophagitis, stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and malignancy, and obtain biopsies as indicated; empiric PPI, pH monitoring, or manometry would be premature and risk delaying diagnosis in the setting of alarm features and treatment failure on an H2 blocker [^116tM8YT] [^115vgcgJ] [^113n1fnD].

---

The most appropriate next step is **esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)** [^116tM8YT] because the patient has alarm features — weight loss, anemia, and refractory symptoms despite ranitidine — which mandate direct visualization to exclude malignancy or complicated GERD [^113n1fnD]. Empiric PPI therapy or pH monitoring is inappropriate in this context, and manometry is not indicated without endoscopic findings [^113n1fnD].

---

## Clinical significance of alarm features

Alarm features — weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, odynophagia, GI bleeding, and persistent vomiting — **warrant urgent endoscopic evaluation** to exclude serious pathology such as malignancy or complicated GERD [^116tM8YT]. This patient has **unintentional weight loss of 10 kg** and **microcytic anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dL, MCV 78 fL)**, both strong predictors of gastrointestinal malignancy and complications of GERD [^114LkXo9]. Refractory symptoms despite ranitidine further increase suspicion for **complicated GERD or malignancy** [^115vgcgJ].

---

## Role of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)

EGD is the **gold standard** for evaluating alarm features in GERD [^116tM8YT]. It allows direct visualization of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa, enabling diagnosis and biopsy of malignancy, Barrett's esophagus, erosive esophagitis, peptic strictures, and other structural abnormalities [^113n1fnD]. Given this patient's alarm features, EGD is indicated to exclude malignancy and assess for complications of GERD [^115vgcgJ].

---

## Inappropriateness of alternative diagnostic options

- **24-hour esophageal pH monitoring**: Useful for diagnosing GERD in patients without alarm features or to differentiate GERD from functional heartburn. Not appropriate in patients with alarm features, as it does not evaluate for malignancy or structural abnormalities [^116tM8YT].

- **Trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)**: Empiric PPI therapy is appropriate for patients with typical GERD symptoms without alarm features. However, in patients with alarm features, empiric PPI therapy may delay diagnosis of malignancy or complicated GERD [^116tM8YT].

- **Esophageal manometry**: Useful for evaluating esophageal motility disorders, but not indicated in patients with alarm features without prior endoscopic evaluation [^115QuZEz].

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting EGD

Current clinical guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) **strongly recommend EGD** as the first-line diagnostic test in patients with alarm features such as weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, odynophagia, GI bleeding, and persistent vomiting [^116tM8YT]. These guidelines emphasize that alarm features necessitate direct visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract to exclude malignancy and other serious pathology [^116kEHrv].

---

## Potential findings on EGD

EGD may reveal:

- **Malignancy**: Esophageal, gastric, or duodenal cancer.

- **Barrett's esophagus**: Intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus, a precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma [^111ShjpY].

- **Erosive esophagitis**: Severe inflammation of the esophageal mucosa.

- **Peptic strictures**: Narrowing of the esophageal lumen due to chronic acid reflux.

- **Hiatal hernia**: A structural abnormality contributing to GERD symptoms [^111ShjpY].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's alarm features — weight loss, anemia, and refractory symptoms despite ranitidine — the most appropriate next step is **esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)** [^116tM8YT]. EGD is the gold standard diagnostic test in this clinical scenario, allowing direct visualization and biopsy of the upper gastrointestinal tract to exclude malignancy and assess for complications of GERD [^notfound]. Alternative diagnostic options, such as 24-hour pH monitoring, empiric PPI therapy, or esophageal manometry, are not appropriate in patients with alarm features [^notfound].

Heartburn is a common, often disabling condition. Twenty percent of adults exhibit symptoms at least once weekly. Few obtain complete satisfactory relief of their symptoms without the simultaneous implementation of significant lifestyle modifications and appropriate pharmacologic intervention. Poor sleep and chronic symptoms impair the QoL in 25% to 30% of such cases. Nocturnal symptoms are more troublesome, more difficult to treat, and are often manifested by extraesophageal symptoms. Several patients, however, unknown to their physicians continue to experience heartburn, despite lifestyle changes and taking prescription drugs. Adequate acid suppression is currently essential to effective management of the condition.

Discussion

A diagnosis of GERD can be made based on symptoms and confirmed by a favorable response to antisecretory medical therapy. If a patient's symptoms are consistent with typical or uncomplicated GERD, an initial trial of empiric medical therapy is appropriate before consideration of endoscopy in most patients. However, the panel believed that endoscopy should be considered in patients with alarm symptoms including dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, persistent vomiting, and/or unexplained iron deficiency anemia because these could be trigged by underlying advanced pathology including cancer or a adverse event related to GERD that would require earlier management to alter disease trajectory. The panel discussed that a high-quality EGD should be performed when alarm symptoms have occurred after a recent endoscopic evaluation in the absence of such symptoms. EGD would be necessary to detect erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture, esophageal cancer, gastric outlet obstruction, and other potentially significant upper GI tract findings. Therefore, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of upper endoscopy. EGD should also be considered in patients with risk factors as detailed in the previous guidelines on BE because early detection and surveillance is beneficial for cancer prevention. Because the existing guidelines provided a conditional recommendation for endoscopy for this population, the panel supported a conditional recommendation as well. Additionally, EGD is often performed as part of the preoperative evaluation of patients being considered for antireflux surgery or for the placement of wireless esophageal pH-monitoring devices and is an inherent part of various endoscopic antireflux procedures. The panel supported these established recommendations, and these were incorporated into the existing indications for endoscopy for GERD. Because these indications are an established clinical practice and already part of prior ASGE guidelines, the panel did not further review the quality of evidence or vote separately for the existing indications for endoscopy. Finally, the panel acknowledged the subtle nature of symptoms that could be suggestive of GERD or adverse events among infants and children. Therefore, the panel voted for a conditional recommendation in favor of endoscopy for this population.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ranitidine oral solution is indicated in:

Short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer. Most patients heal within 4 weeks. Studies available to date have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated duodenal ulcer for periods of more than 8 weeks.
Maintenance therapy for duodenal ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of acute ulcers. No placebo-controlled comparative studies have been carried out for periods of longer than 1 year.
The treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and systemic mastocytosis).
Short-term treatment of active, benign gastric ulcer. Most patients heal within 6 weeks and the usefulness of further treatment has not been demonstrated. Studies available to date have not assessed the safety of ranitidine in uncomplicated, benign gastric ulcer for periods of more than 6 weeks.
Maintenance therapy for gastric ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of acute ulcers. Placebo-controlled studies have been carried out for 1 year.
Treatment of GERD. Symptomatic relief commonly occurs within 24 hours after starting therapy with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily.
Treatment of endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis. Symptomatic relief of heartburn commonly occurs within 24 hours of therapy initiation with ranitidine 150 mg 4 times daily.
Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis. Placebo-controlled trials have been carried out for 48 weeks.

Concomitant antacids should be given as needed for pain relief to patients with active duodenal ulcer; active, benign gastric ulcer; hypersecretory states; GERD; and erosive esophagitis.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^113aLotS]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical history taking in dyspepsia

Clinical history taking in a patient with dyspepsia should commence with the collection of information concerning the duration and nature of the symptoms. The clinician should elucidate the actual commencement of symptoms, as the patient tends to remember only when symptoms got worse. This is particularly important because a longer symptom duration favours FD over organic disease. The patient should be asked about all possible upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including 'red flags', or alarm symptoms and signs. The clinician should enquire about epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, postprandial fullness, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, haematemesis, belching, regurgitation, dysphagia, including the level at which food sticks, and rumination, ensuring the patient understands what he/she means. There is some evidence that using pictograms can facilitate understanding of these terms by patients. Weight loss is reported frequently by patients with FD. Depending on the patient's age, this may be considered an alarm symptom, so attention should be paid to obtaining objective evidence of this. In the context of dyspepsia, guidelines for the assessment of patients with suspected gastro-oesophageal cancer from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that an urgent 2-week wait endoscopy should be offered in patients aged ≥ 55 years old with dyspepsia and weight loss, and non-urgent endoscopy considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years old with treatment-resistant dyspepsia, or aged ≥ 55 years old with dyspepsia with either nausea or vomiting or a raised platelet count. The latter recommendation stems from a significant association between thrombocytosis and gastro-oesophageal cancer in a case–control study of almost 40 000 patients aged over 40 years in UK primary care. All upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms and signs relevant to suspected gastro-oesophageal cancer, as per NICE, are detailed in box 1. However, it is important to point out that these criteria were selected using a threshold of a positive predictive value for gastro-oesophageal cancer of only ≥ 3%.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111MRBjf]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

Esophageal GERD syndromes — Diagnostic testing is invoked in 3 broad scenarios: to avert misdiagnosis, to identify complications of reflux disease, and in the evaluation of empirical treatment failures; in the endoscopic evaluation of dysphagia the endoscopist should have a low threshold for obtaining multiple biopsies, preferably at least 5, to evaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis; for troublesome symptoms not adequately responsive to empirical twice-daily PPI therapy, endoscopy is again the first diagnostic test to consider, followed after a normal endoscopy by esophageal manometry and then by ascertaining whether there is excessive esophageal acid exposure when PPI therapy is withheld; high-quality evidence supporting the broad utility of alarm features as a diagnostic tool is quite limited, but individual alarm features with the best performance include weight loss, dysphagia, and epigastric mass on examination.

### A 32-year-old woman with chronic abdominal pain [^111fULgg]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a highly prevalent disorder that accounts for 5% of visits to primary care clinicians. It frequently coexists with other gastrointestinal tract disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms of functional dyspepsia, including epigastric pain, early satiety, and postprandial nausea, are nonspecific, making its diagnosis difficult. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder involving a number of different pathophysiologic processes, culminating in both gastrointestinal sensory and motor dysfunction. Although functional dyspepsia does not impart any increased risks to long-term health, it significantly affects both individuals and society. The economic burden of evaluating and treating functional dyspepsia is estimated to be at least $1 billion per year, and patients with functional dyspepsia experience a markedly reduced quality of life. Using the case of Ms C, we apply an evidence-based approach to highlight current knowledge in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of functional dyspepsia.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^114GzBeP]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and heartburn — prevalence, timing, and initial treatment are outlined: Heartburn, nausea, and vomiting are common during pregnancy, with frequency ranging from 30%–90%. NVP usually begins at 4–6 weeks and peaks at 8–12 weeks. Diet and lifestyle modification are the initial steps in managing these symptoms in pregnancy. H2-receptor blockers are the most used antireflux medications during pregnancy, and cimetidine and famotidine are administered routinely in pregnancy. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or pantoprazole, can be considered if lifestyle modifications and antacids fail to alleviate symptoms; in a meta-analysis of 26 studies, no significant associations between proton pump inhibitor use and abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, and low birth weight were observed, although a nonsignificant increase in the risk of congenital malformations was seen.

Background & Aims

As many as one-half of all patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not derive benefit from acid suppression. This review outlines a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach to GERD symptoms.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented here were developed from expert review of existing literature combined with extensive discussion and expert opinion to provide practical advice. Formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was not the intent of this clinical practice update. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinicians should develop a care plan for investigation of symptoms suggestive of GERD, selection of therapy (with explanation of potential risks and benefits), and long-term management, including possible de-escalation, in a shared-decision making model with the patient. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should emphasize safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day. When there is adequate response, PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: If PPI therapy is continued in a patient with unproven GERD, clinicians should evaluate the appropriateness and dosing within 12 months after initiation, and offer endoscopy with prolonged wireless reflux monitoring off PPI therapy to establish appropriateness of long-term PPI therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: If troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain do not respond adequately to a PPI trial or when alarm symptoms exist, clinicians should investigate with endoscopy and, in the absence of erosive reflux disease (Los Angeles B or greater) or long-segment (≥ 3 cm) Barrett's esophagus, perform prolonged wireless pH monitoring off medication (96-hour preferred if available) to confirm and phenotype GERD or to rule out GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Complete endoscopic evaluation of GERD symptoms includes inspection for erosive esophagitis (graded according to the Los Angeles classification when present), diaphragmatic hiatus (Hill grade of flap valve), axial hiatus hernia length, and inspection for Barrett's esophagus (graded according to the Prague classification and biopsied when present). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Clinicians should perform upfront objective reflux testing off medication (rather than an empiric PPI trial) in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms and suspicion for reflux etiology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In symptomatic patients with proven GERD, clinicians should consider ambulatory 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring on PPI as an option to determine the mechanism of persisting esophageal symptoms despite therapy (if adequate expertise exists for interpretation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Clinicians should personalize adjunctive pharmacotherapy to the GERD phenotype, in contrast to empiric use of these agents. Adjunctive agents include alginate antacids for breakthrough symptoms, nighttime H2 receptor antagonists for nocturnal symptoms, baclofen for regurgitation or belch predominant symptoms, and prokinetics for coexistent gastroparesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Clinicians should provide pharmacologic neuromodulation, and/or referral to a behavioral therapist for hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, and relaxation strategies in patients with functional heartburn or reflux disease associated with esophageal hypervigilance reflux hypersensitivity and/or behavioral disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with proven GERD, laparoscopic fundoplication and magnetic sphincter augmentation are effective surgical options, and transoral incisionless fundoplication is an effective endoscopic option in carefully selected patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with proven GERD, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective primary anti-reflux intervention in obese patients, and a salvage option in non-obese patients, whereas sleeve gastrectomy has potential to worsen GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Candidacy for invasive anti-reflux procedures includes confirmatory evidence of pathologic GERD, exclusion of achalasia, and assessment of esophageal peristaltic function.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^1135MVLC]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — clinical presentation and patient selection — centers on inadequate symptom relief with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and specifies that functional heartburn should be considered only in patients who report troublesome heartburn symptoms at least 2 times per week for the previous 3 months despite double PPI dose taken appropriately before meals. In a prospective Veterans Affairs cohort of refractory heartburn, 366 patients were studied; 99 (27%) had functional heartburn, 23 (6%) had non-GERD esophageal disorders, and 7 (2%) had esophageal motility disorders. Overlap with functional disorders and other non-GERD mechanisms may contribute to the 40% dissatisfaction rate with PPI therapy in patients with heartburn, and both functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome are frequently associated with functional heartburn and can negatively impact symptom response to therapies.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^112sLYeU]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — prognosis: functional heartburn does not carry potential long-term complications, but is associated with reduced quality of life; because there is overlap between true GERD and functional heartburn and a 24-hour ambulatory reflux monitoring study can miss abnormal esophageal acid exposure because of day-to-day variability, long-term symptom control can be challenging; it is anticipated that the majority of patients with functional heartburn will have compromised quality of life rather than organic complications over time.

Case Presentation

A 51-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and anemia sought treatment at the emergency room for a 2-month history of dry cough and shortness of breath and a 1-week history of substernal chest tightness. One month before her presentation, she was seen at a separate hospital for dyspnea and was found to be anemic. She underwent chest radiography and CT scanning of the chest that was unrevealing to the cause of dyspnea. She received a blood transfusion, although no cause of the anemia was found. One week before presentation, she started experiencing dyspnea on exertion with associated chest pressure, prompting her to seek treatment at the emergency room. On presentation, she reported no fevers, night sweats, joint pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. She noted a 10- to 20-pound involuntary weight loss over 5 to 6 months. Of note, she had never undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. Medications included an oral diabetic medication. She had no significant family history. She never smoked and had no history of illicit drug or alcohol use.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

14.2 Long-Term Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis

Two independent, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled trials of identical design were conducted in adult GERD patients with endoscopically confirmed healed EE to demonstrate efficacy of pantoprazole sodium in long-term maintenance of healing. The two US studies enrolled 386 and 404 patients, respectively, to receive either 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily or 150 mg of ranitidine twice daily. As demonstrated in Table 10, pantoprazole sodium 40 mg and 20 mg were significantly superior to ranitidine at every timepoint with respect to the maintenance of healing. In addition, pantoprazole sodium 40 mg was superior to all other treatments studied.

Note: Pantoprazole sodium 10 mg was superior (p < 0.05) to ranitidine in Study 2, but not Study 1.

Pantoprazole sodium 40 mg was superior to ranitidine in reducing the number of daytime and nighttime heartburn episodes from the first through the twelfth month of treatment. Pantoprazole sodium 20 mg, administered once daily, was also effective in reducing episodes of daytime and nighttime heartburn in one trial, as presented in Table 11.

14.3 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

In a multicenter, open-label trial of 35 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, with or without multiple endocrine neoplasia-type I, pantoprazole sodium successfully controlled gastric acid secretion. Doses ranging from 80 mg daily to 240 mg daily maintained gastric acid output below 10 mEq/h in patients without prior acid-reducing surgery and below 5 mEq/h in patients with prior acid-reducing surgery.

Doses were initially titrated to the individual patient needs, and adjusted in some patients based on the clinical response with time [see Dosage and Administration]. Pantoprazole sodium was well tolerated at these dose levels for prolonged periods (greater than 2 years in some patients).

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Individualized clinical practice guidelines: the next step in the evidence-based health care evolution? [^116h7EJo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are playing an increasing role in the evolution of evidence-based health care. CPGs involve a process in which the best evidence in translated into best practice principles that are then applied on a wide range of patients. Although there are clear benefits in terms of simplicity, applying broad recommendations on a diverse group of patients can lead to wide variations in outcomes on an individual patient level. The individualized guideline (IG) is an approach that builds on the concept of the CPG by specifying treatment recommendation based on important individual baseline characteristics. The IG approach could potentially lead to superior outcomes but necessitates a substantial increase in complexity to the CPG development process.

GERD — antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

Predictors of heartburn resolution during the follow-up period

CI confidence interval, HB heartburn

In a separate mixed model analysis that was conducted to identify predictors of the number of days with heartburn during the follow-up period, the best model included the number of days without heartburn during the entire two-week treatment period. For every additional day without heartburn during the entire two-week treatment period there was a reduction in the number of days with heartburn during the seven-day follow-up period of 0.22 days (95% CI: 0.26–0.18; P < 0.0001). These results indicate that, for example, holding the number of days with heartburn during the run-in as a constant value, if an individual experienced 10 heartburn-free days while on treatment it is estimated that they would have 2.2 fewer days of heartburn during follow-up than if they had experienced zero heartburn-free days while on treatment. The number of days with heartburn during the seven-day run-in period was also predictive of the number of days with heartburn during the follow-up period. For each additional day of heartburn during the run-in period the number of days with heartburn during the follow-up period increased by 0.27 days (95% CI: 0.18–0.35; P < 0.0001).

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS).
Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS: RISK OF ULCERATION, BLEEDING, AND PERFORATION).
Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and " u-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy (see WARNINGS, HEPATIC EFFECTS).
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional heartburn: expert review [^1121KwuE]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Functional heartburn — lifestyle modifications — there is limited evidence that improving night-time sleep can positively impact functional heartburn, and increased stressful activities such as loud noise and sleep deprivation can increase perception of esophageal symptoms. Sleep disturbances have been identified as particularly common as heartburn and regurgitation increase in severity and frequency, and patients with predictable food or activity triggers may benefit from avoiding these, although there is no conclusive evidence that further lifestyle modifications have a role in functional heartburn in contrast to GERD.

In this study, the 40 mg dose was not superior to the 20 mg dose of omeprazole in the percentage healing rate. Other controlled clinical trials have also shown that omeprazole is effective in severe GERD. In comparisons with histamine H2-receptor antagonists in patients with erosive esophagitis, grade 2 or above, omeprazole in a dose of 20 mg was significantly more effective than the active controls. Complete daytime and nighttime heartburn relief occurred significantly faster (p < 0.01) in patients treated with omeprazole than in those taking placebo or histamine H2-receptor antagonists.

In this and five other controlled GERD studies, significantly more patients taking 20 mg omeprazole (84%) reported complete relief of GERD symptoms than patients receiving placebo (12%).

For heartburn and acid regurgitation, studies "suggest modest superiority of antireflux surgery to PPI therapy, on the order of a 10% therapeutic gain", yet "As many as 30% of patients have resumed medical therapy by 5 years after antireflux surgery". Procedure-related adverse effects are noted: dysphagia requiring dilation "occurs in about 6% of patients", with "a significant increase in flatulence, an inability to belch, and increased bowel symptoms after antireflux surgery". Regarding cancer prevention and mortality, available data "fail to substantiate any protective effect of surgery against cancer", and surgery mortality estimates "exceed the low risk of mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma (less than 1 in 10,000 per patient-year)".

For clinicians under a strong recommendation, most individuals should receive the test and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences, while under a conditional recommendation clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. For policy makers, a strong recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and compliance according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator, while under a conditional recommendation policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Treatment of patients with persistent heartburn symptoms: a double-blind, randomized trial [^1148rjru]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Common treatment practices in patients who continue to be symptomatic on proton pump inhibitor once-daily treatment include either increasing the dosage or the use of supplemental medication. This trial's purpose was to compare 2 therapeutic strategies, increasing the proton pump inhibitor dosage to twice daily versus switching to another proton pump inhibitor, in patients with persistent heartburn while receiving standard-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial included patients with persistent heartburn symptoms while receiving therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg once daily. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment for 8 weeks with either single-dose esomeprazole (40 mg once daily) (n = 138) or lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily (n = 144). The primary efficacy variable was the percentage of heartburn-free days from day 8 to the end of treatment.

Results

Single-dose esomeprazole was at least as effective as twice-daily lansoprazole for the primary end point of percentage of heartburn-free days during the study period (54.4% and 57.5%, respectively). Symptom scores improved from baseline in similar numbers of patients for heartburn (83.3% of patients in each group), acid regurgitation (76.8% vs 72.9%, P = 0.58), and epigastric pain (67.4% vs 61.1%, P = 0.32), and rescue antacid use was also similar (0.4 tablets/day vs 0.5 tablets/day, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

Switching patients with persistent heartburn on a standard-dose proton pump inhibitor to a different proton pump inhibitor was as effective as increasing the proton pump inhibitor dosage to twice daily for controlling heartburn symptoms.

(C) In subjects with less frequent heartburn (defined as fewer than 6 days of heartburn during the run-in period). ✱ p < 0.001 versus placebo. †p = 0.004 versus placebo. HB, heartburn.

The greatest therapeutic benefit was observed from day 5 to day 14 of the treatment period (table 2, figure 2A). During this time, subjects treated with esomeprazole 20 mg increased their heartburn-free time over the run-in period by 32.5% compared with 14.3% with placebo (p < 0.001). When the percentage of heartburn-free time for this time period is standardised to a 7-day period, there is an estimated heartburn-free frequency rate of 3.6 days/week vs 2.3 days/week for the esomeprazole 20 mg group versus the placebo group, respectively, compared with an estimated 1.4 days/week for the run-in period. When the percentage of heartburn-free time for the initial 4 days of treatment was standardised to a 7-day period, the estimated frequency of heartburn-free days was 3.0 days/week and 2.0 days/week for esomeprazole 20 mg and placebo, respectively. A similar pattern of results was observed in the subgroup analysis of subjects with more and less frequent heartburn during the run-in period. Significant increases in the percentage of heartburn-free days for all time intervals were observed in both groups.

### How to get started with single cell RNA sequencing data analysis [^115eAkAB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the last 5 years, single cell methods have enabled the monitoring of gene and protein expression, genetic, and epigenetic changes in thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. With the improved measurement and the decreasing cost of the reactions and sequencing, the size of these datasets is increasing rapidly. The critical bottleneck remains the analysis of the wealth of information generated by single cell experiments. In this review, we give a simplified overview of the analysis pipelines, as they are typically used in the field today. We aim to enable researchers starting out in single cell analysis to gain an overview of challenges and the most commonly used analytical tools. In addition, we hope to empower others to gain an understanding of how typical readouts from single cell datasets are presented in the published literature.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114LkXo9]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Initial clinical assessment

6. We recommend taking a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

7. We recommend that initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD) and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

8. CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and we recommend that it should be routinely screened for serologically, or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong).

9. Age, sex, Hb concentration and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

10. There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change. (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak).

11. We recommend that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Service provision

IDA is a common clinical problem with fairly clear diagnostic criteria, a degree of case homogeneity, and straightforward algorithms for treatment and investigation. These features make the condition eminently suitable for streamlined management in dedicated nurse-led IDA clinics, as have been developed in a number of units around the UK. An algorithm for the management approach to IDA is suggested in figure 2.

### Neural networks involved in artistic creativity [^114uMncz]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Creativity has been proposed to be either the result of solely right hemisphere processes or of interhemispheric interactions. Little information is available, however, concerning the neuronal foundations of creativity. In this study, we introduced a new artistic task, designing a new tool (a pen), which let us quantitatively evaluate creativity by three indices of originality. These scores were analyzed in combination with brain activities measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results were compared between subjects who had been formally trained in design (experts) and novice subjects. In the experts, creativity was quantitatively correlated with the degree of dominance of the right prefrontal cortex over that of the left, but not with that of the right or left prefrontal cortex alone. In contrast, in novice subjects, only a negative correlation with creativity was observed in the bilateral inferior parietal cortex. We introduced structure equation modeling to analyze the interactions among these four brain areas and originality indices. The results predicted that training exerts a direct effect on the left parietal cortex. Additionally, as a result of the indirect effects, the activity of the right prefrontal cortex was facilitated, and the left prefrontal and right parietal cortices were suppressed. Our results supported the hypothesis that training increases creativity via reorganized intercortical interactions.

14.2 Active Benign Gastric Ulcer

In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind study of omeprazole 40 mg once a day, 20 mg once a day, and placebo in 520 patients with endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcer, the following results were obtained. (See Table 14.)

Table 14: Treatment of Gastric Ulcer % of Patients Healed (All Patients Treated)

For the stratified groups of patients with ulcer size less than or equal to 1 cm, no difference in healing rates between 40 mg and 20 mg was detected at either 4 or 8 weeks. For patients with ulcer size greater than 1 cm, 40 mg was significantly more effective than 20 mg at 8 weeks.

In a foreign, multinational, double-blind study of 602 patients with endoscopically diagnosed gastric ulcer, omeprazole 40 mg once a day, 20 mg once a day, and ranitidine 150 mg twice a day were evaluated. (See Table 15.)

14.4 EE Due to Acid-Mediated GERD

In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 mg or 20 mg of omeprazole delayed-release capsules in patients with symptoms of GERD and endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis of grade 2 or above, the percentage healing rates (per protocol) were as shown in Table 17.

Table 17: % Patients Healed

In this study, the 40 mg dose was not superior to the 20 mg dose of omeprazole in the percentage healing rate. Other controlled clinical trials have also shown that omeprazole is effective in severe GERD. In comparisons with histamine H2-receptor antagonists in patients with erosive esophagitis, grade 2 or above, omeprazole in a dose of 20 mg was significantly more effective than the active controls. Complete daytime and nighttime heartburn relief occurred significantly faster (p < 0.01) in patients treated with omeprazole than in those taking placebo or histamine H2-receptor antagonists.

In this and five other controlled GERD studies, significantly more patients taking 20 mg omeprazole (84%) reported complete relief of GERD symptoms than patients receiving placebo (12%).

### Management of intractable nausea and vomiting in patients at the end of life: "I was feeling nauseous all of the time… nothing was working" [^116GDxgm]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Nausea and vomiting, symptoms that occur commonly near the end of life, represent a substantial source of physical and psychological distress for patients and families. In the context of the case of Mr Q, a 50-year-old man with metastatic esophageal cancer admitted to the hospital with intractable nausea and vomiting, we review the evaluation and treatment of this symptom complex. A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in the management of these patients because they define the severity of the symptoms and clues to their underlying etiology. Once the most likely cause is determined, the clinician discerns the mechanism, specific transmitters, and receptors by which this etiology is triggering nausea and vomiting. Subsequent pharmacological management focuses on prescribing the appropriate antagonist to the implicated receptors. If symptoms are refractory despite adequate dosage and around-the-clock prophylactic administration, an empirical trial combining several therapies to block multiple emetic pathways should be attempted. Less traditional agents are also discussed, although evidence for their use is limited. Often, oral administration of medication is not feasible and alternate routes such as rectal suppositories, subcutaneous infusions, and orally dissolvable tablets should be considered. Using this step-wise approach, nausea and vomiting can be successfully managed in most patients at the end of life.

### Heartburn severity underestimates erosive esophagitis severity in elderly patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112nXnoy]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in adults of all ages, but its complications are more frequent in elderly patients. Although heartburn is the most common symptom of reflux disease, it is unclear whether the severity of heartburn reliably indicates the severity of erosive esophagitis. We therefore assessed the relationship between age, severe heartburn symptoms, and severe erosive esophagitis.

Methods

This post hoc analysis of baseline data on the severity of both heartburn and erosive esophagitis pooled data from 5 prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that assessed the effect of proton pump inhibitors on healing of erosive esophagitis and symptom resolution. The clinical trials were conducted in 683 private and academic offices and hospital-based gastroenterology practices and involved 11,945 patients aged 18 years and older with gastroesophageal reflux disease and erosive esophagitis.

Results

A progressive increase in the prevalence of severe erosive esophagitis was observed with each decade of age, ranging from 12% in patients aged < 21 years to 37% in patients aged > 70 years. Among patients with severe esophagitis, severe heartburn was less frequent in the older age groups: ranging from 82% of patients aged < 21 years to 34% of those aged > 70 years. Each of these associations was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Although the prevalence of severe erosive esophagitis increases with age, the severity of heartburn is an unreliable indicator of the severity of erosive disease. More aggressive investigation and treatment may be necessary for elderly patients, regardless of the reported severity of heartburn.

### Early heartburn relief with proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^113Hhu1p]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often taken for short-term treatment of heartburn. We performed a systematic review of the efficacy of PPIs for heartburn relief within the first 1–2 days of therapy.

Methods

Bibliographic databases were searched for clinical trials of PPIs in patients with heartburn that provided information about the proportion with heartburn relief at day 1–2. The sample size-weighted pooled proportions of patients with complete or sustained (7 consecutive days) relief were calculated. Meta-analyses of randomized comparisons of PPIs were also performed.

Results

Eighteen trials met inclusion criteria. At day 1 of PPI therapy, complete 24-hour, daytime, nighttime, and sustained heartburn relief occurred in 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.32), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.48–0.50), 0.55 (95% CI, 0.53–0.56), and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.20–0.22) of patients. Up to 37% of the heartburn relief achievable with 28 days of PPIs occurred on day 1. Placebo was significantly less effective than PPIs for 24-hour relief on day 1 (relative risk [RR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.29–0.58), and single-dose PPI therapy was less effective than double-dose therapy (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92).

Conclusions

Complete heartburn relief for the entire day occurs in approximately 30% of patients after their first PPI dose and 9% of patients after their first placebo (RR for relief on day 1 for placebo versus PPI was 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28–0.58]). Although PPIs might provide benefit from the first day of therapy, most patients will not have symptom relief with 1 or 2 days of PPI therapy.

### Interpretation of omics data analyses [^11655LdH]. Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Translation of the outputs into perceptible forms

The raw outputs of statistical and machine learning methods are essentially in the form of numbers, formulae, and symbols. The vast majority of people consider the expressions with numbers, formulae, and symbols to be inappropriate as the methods of interpretation. Intellectual interpretation of inputs is rooted on the physical systems of perception. As humans, we have five senses, two of which (the hearing and visual senses) are mainly used for intellectual communication. Information for the hearing sense takes the form of words and languages and that for the visual sense takes the form of two-dimensional graphics. Therefore, we transform the output numbers, formulae, and symbols into the forms of words/language or two-dimensional graphics.

### Efficient self-organization of informal public transport networks [^113pxGoA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The Global South, encompassing more than 80% of the world population, heavily relies on informal paratransit services with ad-hoc routes. Yet, it remains unclear how efficiently such informal public transport services organize and operate. Here, we analyze and compare the structural efficiency of more than 7000 formal and informal bus service routes in 36 cities across 22 countries globally. Intriguingly, informal transport self-organizes in ways at or above efficiency levels of centralized services. They exhibit fewer detours, more uniform paths, and comparable interconnectivities, all while remaining profitable without the major subsidies common in the Global North. These insights challenge the global perception of informal transport as an inferior alternative to centrally organized services. More generally, analyzing large-scale microscopic transport data and condensing them into informative macroscopic observables may qualitatively improve system understanding and reveal specific options to create more accessible, efficient, and sustainable public transport solutions.

### Clinical features of reflux esophagitis in older people: a study of 840 consecutive patients [^115m3dRt]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare symptoms and other clinical characteristics of reflux esophagitis in patients of different ages.

Design

Observational cross-sectional study of consecutive patients.

Setting

Geriatric Unit, Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico.

Participants

Eight hundred forty patients with endoscopically diagnosed erosive esophagitis divided into four groups according to age (young (< 50, mean 36.7, n = 114), adult (50–69, mean 59.1, n = 126), elderly (70–84, mean 77.3, n = 425), and very elderly (≥ 85, mean 88.4, n = 175)).

Measurements

Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire. Other symptoms were recorded when present as an indication for endoscopy. Severity of esophagitis, presence of Helicobacter pylori infection, presence and size of hiatus hernia, Barrett's esophagus, antrum or corpus gastric atrophy, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use were also evaluated.

Results

Elderly and very elderly patients had a significantly lower prevalence of typical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation (P < .001) and epigastric pain (P < .001)) than young and adult patients. Conversely, the prevalence of other symptoms (anorexia (P < .001), weight loss (P < .007), anemia (P < .001), vomiting (P < .001), and dysphagia (P < .001)) significantly increased with age. The prevalence of severe esophagitis (P < .001), hiatus hernia (P < .005), the size of hiatus hernia (P < .001), antrum and corpus gastric atrophy (P < .05) and NSAID use (P < .005) also significantly increased with age. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that older age (65–84, odds ratio (OR) = 2.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38–5.12; ≥ 85, OR = 4.57, 95% CI = 2.15–9.71), hiatus hernia larger than 3 cm in diameter (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.41–4.01), and male sex (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.72–4.64) are independent risk factors for severe esophagitis, whereas H. pylori infection, gastric atrophy, NSAID use, and the presence of hiatus hernia were not.

Conclusion

Elderly patients with reflux esophagitis had less-typical and more-nonspecific symptoms than young or adult patients. Old age, male sex, and hiatus hernia size greater than 3 cm are significantly associated with severe esophagitis. Clinicians caring for older patients should be aware of the nonspecific presentation and potential severity of reflux esophagitis in this population.

### Determinants of perception of heartburn and regurgitation [^115A3zHm]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

It is not known why some reflux episodes evoke symptoms and others do not. We investigated the determinants of perception of gastro-oesophageal reflux.

Methods

In 32 patients with symptoms suggestive of gastro-oesophageal reflux, 24 hour ambulatory pH and impedance monitoring was performed after cessation of acid suppressive therapy. In the 20 patients who had at least one symptomatic reflux episode, characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic reflux episodes were compared.

Results

A total of 1807 reflux episodes were detected, 203 of which were symptomatic. Compared with asymptomatic episodes, symptomatic episodes were associated with a larger pH drop (p < 0.001), lower nadir pH (p < 0.05), and higher proximal extent (p < 0.005). Symptomatic reflux episodes had a longer volume and acid clearance time (p < 0.05 and p < 0.002). Symptomatic episodes were preceded by a higher oesophageal cumulative acid exposure time (p < 0.05). The proximal extent of episodes preceding regurgitation was larger than those preceding heartburn; 14.8% of the symptomatic reflux episodes were weakly acidic. In total, 426 pure gas reflux episodes occurred, of which 12 were symptomatic. Symptomatic pure gas reflux was more frequently accompanied by a pH drop than asymptomatic gas reflux (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Heartburn and regurgitation are more likely to be evoked when the pH drop is large, proximal extent of the refluxate is high, and volume and acid clearance is delayed. Sensitisation of the oesophagus occurs by preceding acid exposure. Weakly acidic reflux is responsible for only a minority of symptoms in patients off therapy. Pure gas reflux associated with a pH drop ("acid vapour") can be perceived as heartburn and regurgitation.

### Interpretation of omics data analyses [^112ktrv2]. Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Many methods and many tools

There are many data analyses tools available. In addition, multiple combinations of these methods in the form of data processing pipelines have been reported. All of the methods and pipelines return different outputs. These outputs represent aspects of the whole data set, and it is essentially impossible to extract all of the information contained therein. Therefore, all methods and pipelines return their own outputs, which represent their viewpoints, but lack the viewpoints of other methods. In other words, all of the methods and pipelines have advantages and disadvantages. Based on the above-mentioned considerations, the purpose and design of your study should be reconsidered. This will guide your selection and assist interpretation of the results of your analysis.

### Antireflux mucosectomy in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease with large hiatal hernia [^114fmruz]. Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, minimally invasive treatments such as antireflux mucosectomy (ARMS) and antireflux mucosal ablation (ARMA) have shown efficacy in managing proton-pump-inhibitor–refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While surgical treatment is generally preferred for sliding hernias larger than 3 cm, the outcomes of ARMS in such cases remain unclear. We report a case demonstrating the effectiveness of ARMS in treating GERD in a patient with a 3-cm sliding hernia.

A 68-year-old woman with a 15-year history of heartburn and chest pain was referred to our hospital after long-term vonoprazan use failed to alleviate her symptoms, despite ongoing antacid treatment. Upper endoscopy revealed grade C reflux esophagitis (Los Angeles classification) and a 3-cm sliding hiatal hernia (Fig. 1). Although surgical fundoplication is typically recommended for large sliding hernias, this patient's history of multiple laparotomies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary hypertension made her a high-risk candidate for surgery. As a result, ARMS was selected as a less invasive alternative.

Fig. 1
Grade C gastroesophageal reflux disease with a 3-cm sliding hiatal hernia in a 68-year-old woman with a 15-year history of heartburn and chest pain.

Cap-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection was performed from the cardia to the upper gastric body along the lesser curvature, excising four-fifths of the mucosal circumference, including within the hernia sac (Fig. 2, Video 1). The procedure was completed without adverse events, and the patient was discharged 9 days later. One month after the procedure, follow-up endoscopy showed a well-reconstructed gastroesophageal flap valve with no visible evidence of a hernia sac. Erosive GERD improved from grade C to grade M (Fig. 3), and the patient's GerdQ score significantly decreased from 14 before ARMS to 7 at 1 month after, and further to 2 at 2 months after. No postprocedural complications, such as bleeding or stenosis requiring dilation, were observed.

Clinical decisions must be made, often under circumstances of uncertainty and limited resources. Decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis are methodologic tools that allow for quantitative analysis and the optimization of decision-making. These methods can be useful for decisions regarding individual patient evaluation and treatment options or in formulating healthcare policy. We overview the methodology of expected value decision analysis and of cost-effectiveness analysis, including cost-identification, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, and cost-utility analyses. Examples are provided of these methods and a user's guide to cost-effectiveness analysis is outlined.

Adherence

Only 49.3% of patients reported taking their medication as instructed all of the time, and 67.1% of patients agreed that they would be more likely to take their treatment as advised if it worked more quickly.

Overall, 56.8% of patients reported that they independently decided to increase the frequency of their medication (type of medication not captured) at least some of the time. Reasons given by HCPs for patients' changes to dosing frequency without their knowledge are given in figure 3. Sixty-one per cent of HCPs believed that the main reason for patients altering treatment frequency was because the treatment was not working adequately.

In total, 31.5% of patients agreed that they found food-related dosing to be burdensome, while 49.4% of HCPs would prefer a product that did not have a dosing requirement related to food intake.

Symptom burden

Although symptoms improved with treatment, many patients continued to experience a range of symptoms (figure 4A). For example, despite treatment, 57.5% continued to experience heartburn and 30.1% continued to experience regurgitation. Heartburn was the most bothersome symptom, as reported by both patients and physicians (figure 4B).

### Heartburn… [^111W8SbJ]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Heartburn is a burning sensation felt behind the breastbone. It is a symptom that is commonly linked to acid reflux and is often triggered by food. Lying down, bending, lifting, and performing certain exercises can exacerbate heartburn. Causes include acid reflux, gastroesophageal reflux disease, damage to the esophageal lining, bile acid, mechanical stimulation to the esophagus, and esophageal hypersensitivity. Heartburn affects 25% of the population at least once a month. Endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring can be used to evaluate heartburn. Some causes of heartburn, such as GERD, may be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. Potential differential diagnoses for heartburn include motility disorders, ulcers, inflammation of the esophagus, and medication side effects. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and avoiding fatty foods, can improve heartburn. Over-the-counter alginates or antacids can help with mild or occasional heartburn.

Heartburn treatment primarily involves antisecretory medications like H2 receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors. functional heartburn; peristalsis; acid reflux; inflammation of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, and duodenum; esophageal cancer; ischemic pain; hiatal hernia; biliary colic; stomach cancer; gallstones; pancreatic cancer; duodenal ulcer; and mesenteric adenitis. Heartburn can also be caused by certain medications such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphonates, calcium‐channel blockers, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergics. Pathophysiology The exact causes of heartburn are not fully understood, but they likely involve multiple factors, including chemical irritation, pressure on the esophagus, and increased sensitivity to pain.

Acid reflux is a common cause of heartburn but is not the only etiology. A study in 1989 demonstrated this by giving participants acidic and basic solutions; the acidic solutions induced heartburn in all participants, though the more basic solution still invoked heartburn in over 40% of the participants. Ambulatory pH monitoring reveals that just a small percentage of acid reflux episodes trigger heartburn. Factors like high reflux reach, low pH, large pH drops, high reflux volume, and slow acid clearance increase the likelihood of symptoms. When taking PPIs, heartburn may still occur, with 17–37% of cases linked to non-acidic, usually weakly acidic, reflux. Bile acid rising into the esophagus can cause heartburn, though bile acid is slower and less intense than stomach acid exposure. The mechanism behind bile acid causing heartburn symptoms is thought to be due to bile damaging cell membranes and releasing intracellular mediators.

Studies monitoring acid and bile reflux together show that they often occur simultaneously. Esophageal hypersensitivity plays a major role in heartburn, especially in those with GERD who have normal acid levels. As shown in esophageal balloon studies, these individuals are also more sensitive to mechanical pressure. The likely cause is altered brain processing rather than issues with esophageal receptors. Anxiety and stress can further heighten heartburn perception, both through brain mechanisms and possibly by weakening the esophageal lining.

1. Burning sensation or pain behind the chest.
2. Persistent symptoms despite effective acid-suppressing treatment.
3. No signs of GERD or eosinophilic esophagitis as the cause of symptoms.
4. No major oesophageal motility disorders present.

### Heartburn [^1119fBmG]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Heartburn is a burning sensation felt behind the breastbone. Heartburn, often linked to acid reflux, is often triggered by food, particularly fatty, sugary, spicy, chocolate, onions, citrus, and tomato-based products. Lying down, bending, lifting, and certain exercises can exacerbate heartburn. Causes of heartburn include acid reflux, non-acidic or weakly acidic reflux, damage to the esophageal lining, bile acid, mechanical stimulation to the esophagus, and esophageal hypersensitivity. Heartburn affects 25% of the American population every month. Endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring are used to evaluate heartburn. Some causes of heartburn, such as Gastroesophageal reflux disease can be diagnosed based on symptoms alone. Potential differential diagnoses for heartburn include motility disorders, ulcers, inflammation of the esophagus, and medication side effects. Lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and avoiding fatty foods, can improve heartburn symptoms.

Over-the-counter alginates or antacids can help with mild or intermittent heartburn. Heartburn treatment primarily involves antisecretory medications like H2-receptor antagonists and PPIs. Definition and symptoms Heartburn is a burning feeling felt behind the breastbone, rising to the throat, and may be associated with an acidic taste. Heartburn is often associated with acid reflux or regurgitation. Heartburn is sometimes referred to as indigestion, sour stomach, acid regurgitation, or bitter belching. Heartburn is deemed troublesome if mild symptoms occur two or more days each week, or moderate/severe symptoms happen at least once per week. Heartburn often spreads to the neck, throat, or back and is usually triggered by food. It tends to occur within an hour after eating, especially after a large meal. Fatty, sugary, and spicy foods, as well as chocolate, onions, citrus, and tomato-based products, can worsen heartburn.

Heartburn can also be caused by certain medications such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphonates, calcium‐channel blockers, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergics. Pathophysiology The exact causes of heartburn are not fully understood, but they likely involve multiple factors, including chemical irritation, pressure on the esophagus, and increased sensitivity to pain. Acid reflux is an important cause of heartburn but isn't the only cause. A study in 1989 demonstrated this by giving participants acidic and basic solutions. The acidic solutions induced heartburn in all participants, however, the more basic solution still invoked heartburn in over 40% of the participants. Ambulatory pH monitoring reveals that just a small percentage of acid reflux episodes trigger heartburn.

Factors like high reflux reach, low pH, large pH drops, high reflux volume, and slow acid clearance increase the likelihood of symptoms. When taking PPIs twice daily, heartburn can still occur, with 17–37% of cases linked to non-acidic, usually weakly acidic, reflux. Bile acid rising into the esophagus can cause heartburn, though it is slower and less intense than stomach acid exposure. This likely happens due to bile damaging cell membranes and releasing intracellular mediators. Studies monitoring acid and bile reflux together show that they often occur simultaneously. Mechanical stimulation may play a role in heartburn. Esophageal balloon distension, especially in the upper esophagus, can trigger heartburn symptoms. This may be because the upper esophagus has more pressure-sensitive receptors than the lower esophagus. Acid exposure may also make these receptors more sensitive.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease… [^111ShjpY]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

In the long term, and when not treated, complications such as esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and Barrett's esophagus may arise. Risk factors include obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal hernia, and taking certain medications. Medications that may cause or worsen the disease include benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, NSAIDs, and certain asthma medicines. Acid reflux is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus. Diagnosis among those who do not improve with simpler measures may involve gastroscopy, upper GI series, esophageal pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery for those who do not improve with the first two measures. Lifestyle changes include not lying down for three hours after eating, lying down on the left side, raising the pillow or bedhead height, losing weight, and stopping smoking.

Foods that may precipitate GERD symptoms include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Medications include antacids, H₂ receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetics. Signs and symptoms Adults The most common symptoms of GERD in adults are an acidic taste in the mouth, regurgitation, and heartburn. Less common symptoms include pain with swallowing/sore throat, increased salivation, nausea, chest pain, coughing, and globus sensation. The acid reflux can induce asthma attack symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing in those with underlying asthma. GERD sometimes causes injury to the esophagus.

These injuries may include one or more of the following:

- Reflux esophagitis – inflammation of esophageal epithelium which can cause ulcers near the junction of the stomach and esophagus
- Esophageal strictures – the persistent narrowing of the esophagus caused by reflux-induced inflammation
- Barrett's esophagus – intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus
- Esophageal adenocarcinoma – a form of cancer. GERD sometimes causes injury of the larynx. Other complications can include aspiration pneumonia. Barrett's esophagus GERD may lead to Barrett's esophagus, a type of intestinal metaplasia, which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer. The risk of progression from Barrett's to dysplasia is uncertain, but is estimated at 20% of cases.

Due to the risk of chronic heartburn progressing to Barrett's, EGD every five years is recommended for people with chronic heartburn, or who take drugs for chronic GERD. Causes A small amount of acid reflux is typical even in healthy people, but gastroesophageal reflux becomes gastroesophageal reflux disease when signs and symptoms develop into a recurrent problem. Frequent acid reflux is due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter, which is at the junction between the stomach and the esophagus. Factors that can contribute to GERD:
- Hiatal hernia, which increases the likelihood of GERD due to mechanical and motility factors.
- **Obesity**: increasing body mass index is associated with more severe GERD. In a large series of 2, 000 patients with symptomatic reflux disease, it has been shown that 13% of changes in esophageal acid exposure is attributable to changes in body mass index.

### Ranitidine [^111uVS2Q]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Ranitidine, sold under the brand name Zantac among others, is a medication used to decrease stomach acid production. It is used in treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. It can be given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. In 2022, these concerns were confirmed in a Taiwanese nationwide population study finding "significant trends of increased liver cancer risk with an increasing dose of ranitidine" and increased gastric, pancreatic, lung and overall cancer risk. Common side effects include headaches, and pain or burning sensation if given by injection. Serious side effects may include cancer, liver problems, a slow heart rate, pneumonia, and the potential of masking stomach cancer. It is also linked to an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis.

Ranitidine is an H₂ histamine receptor antagonist that works by blocking histamine, thus decreasing the amount of acid released by cells of the stomach. Medical uses
- Relief of heartburn
- Short-term and maintenance therapy of gastric and duodenal ulcers
- With nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce the risk of ulceration Proton-pump inhibitors are more effective for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers.
- Pathologic gastrointestinal hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Erosive esophagitis
- Part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication to minimise the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence
- Recurrent postoperative ulcer
- Upper GI bleeding.
- For prevention of acid-aspiration pneumonitis during surgery, it can be administered preoperatively. The drug increases gastric pH, but generally has no effect on gastric volume.

In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing the net benefit of PPIs and ranitidine to reduce the risk of aspiration before anaesthesia, ranitidine was found to be more effective than PPIs in reducing the volume of gastric secretions. Ranitidine may have an anti-emetic effect when administered preoperatively.
- Prevention of stress-induced ulcers in critically ill patients
- Used together with diphenhydramine as secondary treatment for anaphylaxis; after first-line epinephrine. Contraindication Ranitidine has been discontinued globally, according to the NHS, and is contraindicated due to excess cancer risk and the ready availability of H2 antagonist and PPI alternatives. Cardiovascular Arrhythmias such as tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats have also been reported.

Gastrointestinal All drugs in the H₂ receptor blocker class of medicines have the potential to cause vitamin B₁₂ deficiency, secondary to a reduction in food-bound vitamin B₁₂ absorption. Elderly patients taking H₂ receptor antagonists are more likely to require B₁₂ supplementation than those not taking such drugs. H₂ blockers may also reduce the absorption of drugs that require an acidic stomach. In addition, multiple studies suggest the use of H₂ receptor antagonists such as ranitidine may increase the risk of infectious diarrhoea, including traveller's diarrhoea and salmonellosis. A 2005 study found that by suppressing acid-mediated breakdown of proteins, ranitidine may lead to an elevated risk of developing food or drug allergies, due to undigested proteins then passing into the GI tract, where sensitisation occurs.

with GERD. These clinical vignettes illustrate common clinical questions encountered in caring for patients with GERD, especially as they relate to the issue of cancer risk. Applying data reviewed in the companion article, we propose practical answers to common clinical situations regarding care of patients with reflux. We also present an algorithm for treatment of patients with chronic GERD symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is one of the most common problems confronted by primary care physicians. 1 The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn, but GERD may present with a variety of symptoms. Appropriate recognition and management of GERD relieves symptoms, increases quality of life, and forestalls complications of reflux disease. to identify alternative diagnostic or therapeutic options that could be used when appropriate.

A 36-year-old Asian woman complains of 8 months of intermittent rising substernal chest burning, occurring approximately 3 times a week, worse at night and after large meals. Throughout the last 3 months, she has been taking. nonprescription ranitidine and initially had good symptom relief, but now she is experiencing substantial periods of discomfort. She has been reading about reflux on the Internet and is especially concerned regarding the cancer risk with reflux. This individual displays many of the classic features of uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux. The description of her discomfort, the associated. exacerbating factors, and the partial response of symptoms to H2 receptor antagonists suggest that reflux disease is the most likely diagnosis. Given the prevalence of reflux in the population1, 11, 12 and the typical nature of this patient's symptoms, further testing to confirm. this diagnosis is not recommended.

13 Instead, initiation of appropriate therapy can be used as a diagnostic test and a therapeutic measure. 14, 15 If this patient responds to an empirical trial of proton pump inhibitors with resolution of her symptoms, the diagnosis is confirmed and no further testing is necessary. In typical reflux presentations such as this, further diagnostic testing is. Appropriate treatment for this patient consists of counseling about the pathophysiology of reflux and a review of conservative measures sometimes helpful in avoiding reflux symptoms. These conservative measures, listed in BOX 1, may decrease distal esophageal acid exposures. 23–25 Additionally, adding a pharmacological intervention would be reasonable. Because. the patient has had an incomplete symptomatic response to H2RAs, therapy with a proton pump inhibitor could be initiated at standard daily dosing. Alternatively, in this patient, increasing the dose of H2RA as an initial step is also acceptable.

A discussion of the risk factors and demographics of esophageal adenocarcinoma and the risks and benefits of endoscopic. and pharmacological therapy for patients with classic reflux symptoms. This figure demonstrates a step-down approach to pharmacological therapy, starting with a proton pump inhibitor and decreasing acid suppression to the lowest dosage of either proton pump inhibitor or, preferably, H2RA that keeps the subject symptom free. Step-up approaches, starting with H2RAs and intensifying therapy as necessary, are also acceptable in patients. who have not tried H2RA before evaluation. Elevate the head of the bed on 15-cm blocks. Avoid eating within 4 hours before sleep. Avoid eating large meals and chocolate. Avoid consuming caffeinated products. Avoid peppermint. Avoid fatty foods. Quit smoking. Lose weight if overweight.
