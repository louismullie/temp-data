## Question

Are there any clinical trials investigating the use of combination therapy in pancreatic cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are clinical trials investigating the use of combination therapy in pancreatic cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "combination therapy" in pancreatic cancer across settings like metastatic, locally advanced, and adjuvant/neoadjuvant disease. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence that already establishes combination regimens as standards of care. Next, I will examine ongoing or recently completed trials that add novel agents to backbones like FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel. After that, I should review immunotherapy combinations, including PARP inhibitor plus checkpoint blockade and chemoimmunotherapy. Finally, I will check for perioperative and biomarker-driven strategies and synthesize a concise, reference-supported answer.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't miss anything. Combination therapy in pancreatic cancer includes cytotoxic doublets or quadruplets, chemoradiation, and combinations with targeted agents or immunotherapies; I need to ensure I cover metastatic, locally advanced, and perioperative settings, and distinguish established standards from investigational approaches.

> Next, I should review the foundational evidence that combination chemotherapy is already standard of care, because that frames what counts as "investigational" today. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel improve overall survival versus gemcitabine alone in metastatic disease, and that several gemcitabine-based doublets (for example, with capecitabine or a platinum) also confer modest OS benefits, albeit with more toxicity; these data are reflected in contemporary guidelines and Cochrane reviews, so I need to cite those to anchor the baseline [^732b1803] [^f1680119] [^2a52a064].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "new" combinations; I should verify which regimens are still being tested versus already adopted. NCCN lists modified FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel as preferred first-line options, and also recognizes gemcitabine–capecitabine and certain triplet or platinum-added backbones as reasonable in selected patients; this means many "combinations" are not experimental anymore, though dose modifications and sequencing continue to be refined in practice and trials [^f1680119] [^b0952270] [^569f0757].

> I will now examine truly investigational cytotoxic combinations and backbones. Trials are exploring intensified or modified FOLFIRINOX variants, triplet cytotoxic regimens, and perioperative strategies; for example, a randomized phase II neoadjuvant study compared FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel before surgery, and multiple centers are testing perioperative mFOLFIRINOX with or without radiation, reflecting ongoing efforts to optimize timing and synergy with local therapy [^833f5c82] [^b04c7ccc].

> Wait, let me verify the status of targeted-agent combinations, because many have failed historically. Beyond erlotinib plus gemcitabine, which shows only a small OS benefit and is rarely used, most targeted additions to cytotoxic backbones have not improved outcomes in phase III trials; however, small studies of gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin report high response rates, and NCCN lists this triplet as a category 2A option in selected patients, underscoring that some combinations remain investigational in routine practice despite promising signals [^f1680119] [^bf1e1bb5] [^569f0757].

> Next, I should review immunotherapy combinations, since this is a major area of active investigation. Dual checkpoint blockade with durvalumab plus tremelimumab failed to meet efficacy thresholds in metastatic PDAC, and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab has shown limited activity in heavily pretreated cohorts, reinforcing that checkpoint monotherapy or simple doublets are generally ineffective in this TME; however, maintenance strategies and biomarker-enriched designs are being pursued [^78c09954] [^ac08a73d] [^e8c84b19].

> But wait, what if PARP inhibition changes the calculus in selected patients? I need to check that carefully. In patients with advanced PDAC responding to platinum-based therapy, maintenance niraparib plus ipilimumab achieved the prespecified 6‑month PFS benchmark, whereas niraparib plus nivolumab did not, suggesting a signal for CTLA-4–containing maintenance in HRD or BRCA-mutated subsets; ongoing and completed trials are evaluating PARP inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, with or without radiation, and guidelines acknowledge a role for PARP maintenance in BRCA-mutated PDAC, which intersects with combination strategies in the maintenance window [^d21dff9c] [^7b5b35f9] [^ec46db5c].

> Let me consider chemoimmunotherapy, because synergy hypotheses remain compelling despite early failures. Multiple trials have tested gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel plus PD-1 blockade, with some reporting modest ORRs around 18–20% and PFS near 5.5–9 months; mechanistic rationales include immunogenic cell death and myeloid modulation, but regimen optimization and patient selection are critical, and results have not yet led to regulatory approval in unselected PDAC [^f05b60b8] [^e44fe376] [^5e2fbcfe].

> I should double-check perioperative and locally advanced strategies, since combination therapy there is dynamic. Trials and guidelines support neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based chemoradiation in borderline resectable or locally advanced disease, with studies like PREOPANC-1 and Alliance A021501 informing practice; ongoing work explores SBRT sequencing, radiosensitizer selection, and integration with immunotherapy, reflecting that "combination therapy" in this space spans cytotoxic, radiation, and immune components [^b04c7ccc] [^ef8563bf].

> Next, I should review biomarker-driven combinations, because personalization is a key frontier. TMB-high PDAC is a small subset in whom nivolumab plus ipilimumab has guideline-supported but limited pancreatic-specific evidence, and MSI-H/dMMR PDAC responds to PD-1 blockade per tissue-agnostic approvals; KRAS G12C inhibitors are in early-phase combination studies, and HRD-guided PARP combinations continue to be tested, illustrating that future combinations will increasingly be biomarker-selected rather than one-size-fits-all [^b52e2cd0] [^76bb2984] [^6dae1ac0].

> In summary, yes — there are numerous clinical trials investigating combination therapy in pancreatic cancer across settings, including: cytotoxic intensification and perioperative strategies built on FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel backbones; targeted additions such as platinum triplet therapy; immunotherapy combinations including PARP inhibitor plus checkpoint blockade maintenance and chemoimmunotherapy; and biomarker-enriched approaches targeting TMB-high, MSI-H/dMMR, HRD, and KRAS G12C subgroups, even as FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine–nab-paclitaxel remain established standards in metastatic disease [^f1680119] [^732b1803] [^d21dff9c] [^6dae1ac0].

---

There are **multiple active clinical trials** investigating combination therapies for pancreatic cancer, including cytotoxic combinations (e.g. mFOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel) [^732b1803], immunotherapy combinations (e.g. nivolumab plus ipilimumab, PARP inhibitors with checkpoint inhibitors) [^d21dff9c], and targeted therapy combinations (e.g. KRAS G12C inhibitors with immunotherapy or chemotherapy) [^6dae1ac0]. These trials span metastatic, locally advanced, and adjuvant settings, with many focused on overcoming resistance and improving outcomes in this high-mortality disease [^6dae1ac0].

---

## Cytotoxic combination therapies

Several trials are evaluating **cytotoxic combinations**, including:

- **mFOLFIRINOX**: Modified FOLFIRINOX is a standard regimen for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with ongoing trials exploring its use in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings [^99b7d9f3] [^833f5c82].

- **Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel**: This combination is a standard first-line option for metastatic disease, with trials investigating its use in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings [^732b1803] [^833f5c82].

- **Gemcitabine plus cisplatin**: This combination is being studied, particularly in patients with BRCA mutations or homologous recombination repair deficiencies [^fff765b0] [^7b5b35f9].

---

## Immunotherapy combinations

Immunotherapy combinations are under active investigation, including:

- **Nivolumab plus ipilimumab**: This combination has been studied in metastatic pancreatic cancer, with limited activity in unselected patients but ongoing exploration in biomarker-selected subgroups (e.g. TMB-high) [^78c09954] [^b52e2cd0].

- **PARP inhibitors plus immune checkpoint inhibitors**: Trials are evaluating niraparib combined with nivolumab or ipilimumab in patients with platinum-sensitive disease, with some signals of activity [^d21dff9c] [^7b5b35f9].

- **Chemotherapy plus immunotherapy**: Combinations such as gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel with PD-1 inhibitors are being studied to enhance immune responses [^f05b60b8] [^e44fe376].

---

## Targeted therapy combinations

Targeted therapy combinations are being explored, including:

- **KRAS G12C inhibitors**: Agents like adagrasib are being combined with immunotherapy or chemotherapy in KRAS G12C-mutated pancreatic cancer [^6dae1ac0].

- **EGFR inhibitors**: Although previous trials with erlotinib plus gemcitabine showed modest benefit, ongoing studies explore novel combinations and patient selection strategies [^0beb9570].

- **Stromal-targeting agents**: Trials are investigating agents that target the tumor microenvironment, such as FAK inhibitors, in combination with immunotherapy [^ba7c0809].

---

## Adjuvant and neoadjuvant combination therapies

Adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings are active areas of combination therapy research:

- **Adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX**: The PRODIGE 24 trial established mFOLFIRINOX as a preferred adjuvant regimen, with ongoing studies exploring modifications and sequencing [^99b7d9f3].

- **Neoadjuvant chemoradiation**: Trials are evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation to improve resectability and outcomes [^b04c7ccc].

- **Perioperative combinations**: Studies are investigating perioperative regimens, including mFOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, to optimize surgical outcomes [^833f5c82].

---

## Challenges and future directions

Despite ongoing efforts, pancreatic cancer remains a challenging disease with **limited progress** from combination therapies. Key challenges include:

- **Tumor microenvironment**: The dense stroma and immunosuppressive milieu limit drug delivery and immune responses [^9c03626c].

- **Biomarker development**: There is a need for better biomarkers to predict response to combination therapies [^52a51b65].

- **Toxicity management**: Balancing efficacy with tolerability remains critical, especially in multi-agent regimens [^732b1803].

Future directions include **personalized medicine** approaches, novel targeted agents, and innovative trial designs to overcome resistance and improve outcomes [^6dae1ac0].

---

In summary, **multiple clinical trials** are investigating combination therapies for pancreatic cancer, including cytotoxic, immunotherapy, and targeted approaches. While some regimens have improved outcomes, significant challenges remain, and ongoing research aims to optimize these combinations through better patient selection and novel strategies [^6dae1ac0].

### Current and future strategies for combined-modality therapy in pancreatic cancer [^eb880ed4]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of pancreatic cancer remains a challenging task that often requires a multidisciplinary approach to confer optimal response and, ideally, maximize survival. A combination of locoregional approaches such as surgery and radiotherapy, along with systemic therapies for eradication of micrometastases, should be considered both for patients who are operative candidates and for those with locally advanced, unresectable disease. How best to combine these modalities in terms of schedule, timing, and choice of agents is a question that continues to be actively investigated. Some of these data are equivocal or conflicting; thus standards of care for combined-modality treatment have not been uniformly accepted to date. This article provides an overview of combined-modality therapy, focusing on the major studies that have guided our current approach to the treatment of pancreatic cancer and examining new strategies that are likely to improve outcomes and survival for patients in the future.

### Current standards of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer [^eec83b30]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis due to the early development of systemic metastatic disease. Chemotherapeutic agents are the only systemic therapy that offers patients meaningful benefit.

Methods

This study reviewed the literature for recently published Phase III clinical trials whose results have guided the current standards of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

Findings

Although combination chemotherapy regimens are shown to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for both metastatic pancreatic cancer and adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection, it should be recognized that all combination chemotherapy regimens offer only limited benefits. In addition, there is a paucity of clinical trials that directly compare the various combination chemotherapy regimens.

Implications

With the advancement of systemic cancer treatment beyond chemotherapy, it is important to devote more investigation into better understanding the biology of these chemotherapy regimens, such that we combine them with targeted therapeutics and immunotherapeutics in a rational and scientific manner. For the current treatment of pancreatic cancer, the available chemotherapy regimens have shown modest but statistically significant improvements in survival. However, it is important to avoid cross-comparisons of trials and choose regimens based on patient characteristics and the side-effect profiles of the regimen.

### Treatment for pancreatic cancer: current therapy and continued progress [^7c958a17]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

In the last decade, continued efforts in pancreas cancer research have led to the development of new, more effective therapies. Additionally, progress in understanding the molecular processes underlying the development and progression of this disease provides hope for the development of more effective treatment strategies. Recent clinical trials have provided reason for hope that novel chemotherapy combinations and molecularly targeted agents will lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with this disease. This article will summarize the data that has led to the current standards of therapy for patients with resectable and advanced pancreatic cancer and review new treatment strategies for this disease.

### Gene and cell therapy for pancreatic cancer [^74eb4bf4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer are poor, and the limited success of classical chemotherapy underscores the need for new, targeted approaches for this disease. The delivery of genetic material to cells allows for a variety of therapeutic concepts. Engineered agents based on synthetic biology are under clinical investigation in various cancers, including pancreatic cancer.

Areas Covered

This review focuses on Phase I - III clinical trials of gene and cell therapy for pancreatic cancer and on future implications of recent translational research. Trials available in the US National Library of Medicine (www.clinicaltrials.gov) until February 2014 were reviewed and relevant published results of preclinical and clinical studies were retrieved from www.pubmed.gov.

Expert Opinion

In pancreatic cancer, gene and cell therapies are feasible and may have synergistic antitumor activity with standard treatment and/or immunotherapy. Challenges are related to application safety, manufacturing costs, and a new spectrum of adverse events. Further studies are needed to evaluate available agents in carefully designed protocols and combination regimens. Enabling personalized cancer therapy, insights from molecular diagnostic technologies will guide the development and selection of new gene-based drugs. The evolving preclinical and clinical data on gene-based therapies can lay the foundation for future avenues improving patient care in pancreatic cancer.

### A comprehensive update on the use of chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^18990e56]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Phase II trials of combination chemotherapies have shown encouraging palliative benefit, objective response rates, and survival outcomes. Until ongoing phase III trials confirm these benefits, the current standard treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains single agent gemcitabine. The fixed rate infusion schedule of 10 mg/m2/min is gaining wide acceptance and is a promising investigational priority. A very reasonable alternative to single agent gemcitabine, and our bias, is enrollment into clinical trials evaluating novel gemcitabine-based combinations. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal incorporation of so-called targeted therapy with combination chemotherapy.

### Update on adjuvant trials for pancreatic cancer [^77246f5c]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer remains a controversial topic, with a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this area and various limitations in the trials that have been conducted to date, leaving many questions as to a true "standard of care" for patients with resectable or potentially resectable disease. Several large and well-conducted phase 3 trials have reported results recently and have helped to solidify the role of chemotherapy, with either 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine, as an effective intervention in the adjuvant setting. The role of radiotherapy remains unclear, but it does seem to be feasible and safe, and there are trials in development that may shed more light on this question. Many small trials have pointed to the potential utility of neoadjuvant strategies in selecting the patients who are most likely to benefit from surgery and in improving outcomes by providing systemic therapy early on. Larger trials are ongoing in hopes that they will give more definitive answers as to when this strategy should be used. It is hoped that trials using novel agents, either alone or in combination with more traditional therapies, will better define the best strategy for improving outcomes in patients with resectable disease.

### Consensus report of the national cancer institute clinical trials planning meeting on pancreas cancer treatment [^53404599]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality, despite significant improvements in diagnostic imaging and operative mortality rates. The 5-year survival rate remains less than 5% because of microscopic or gross metastatic disease at time of diagnosis. The Clinical Trials Planning Meeting in pancreatic cancer was convened by the National Cancer Institute's Gastrointestinal Cancer Steering Committee to discuss the integration of basic and clinical knowledge in the design of clinical trials in PDAC. Major emphasis was placed on the enhancement of research to identify and validate the relevant targets and molecular pathways in PDAC, cancer stem cells, and the microenvironment. Emphasis was also placed on developing rational combinations of targeted agents and the development of predictive biomarkers to assist selection of patient subsets. The development of preclinical tumor models that are better predictive of human PDAC must be supported with wider availability to the research community. Phase III clinical trials should be implemented only if there is a meaningful clinical signal of efficacy and safety in the phase II setting. The emphasis must therefore be on performing well-designed phase II studies with uniform sets of basic entry and evaluation criteria with survival as a primary endpoint. Patients with either metastatic or locally advanced PDAC must be studied separately.

### Pancreatic cancer treatment and research: an international expert panel discussion [^d8ea24e0]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer has proven extremely challenging to treat. A collaborative effort is needed to advance research and improve treatment. An expert conference was conducted to elicit perspectives regarding the current treatment and future research of pancreatic cancer.

Methods

The conference comprised an international panel of experts representing five European countries and the United States.

Results

Adjuvant radiotherapy is used more frequently in the United States than in Europe. In locally advanced disease, there is now more emphasis on early chemotherapy in both Europe and the United States. In metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy is commonly used in Europe and the United States. This varies by country. Advancing pancreatic research will require improving biorepositories and developing a roadmap to prioritize therapeutic targets in different models. Small randomized phase II trials of both non-selected and enriched patient populations will help identify activity of new agents. Phase III trials should only be initiated in appropriate patients based on strong clinical and biological signals. Developing drugs in the adjuvant setting may be preferable to eliminate some of the challenges of drug development in the advanced disease setting.

Conclusion

Progress in research combined with encouraging improvements from the past offer hope for the future of pancreatic cancer patients.

### Multimodality approaches for pancreatic cancer [^d3f5e735]. CA (2005). Low credibility.

The role of combined-modality therapy for pancreatic cancer is evolving with the recent development and completion of major, multi-institutional clinical trials. One of the challenges for the busy clinician is to appreciate the variation in staging, surgical expertise, and application of either definitive chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for local and/or regionally advanced disease. Our aim is to summarize the current state-of-the-art management and future directions regarding the multimodality approach to pancreatic cancer.

### Progress in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and the search for next opportunities [^4eb7f2ab]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

A growing number of therapeutic options are now available for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, informed by positive results from recently completed phase III clinical trials. These have led to modest, if not necessarily transformative, improvements in clinical outcomes. Although the standard of care for metastatic disease remains cytotoxic therapy, a variety of novel therapeutic approaches are currently under active investigation, several of which have already demonstrated encouraging results in phase I/II studies. The following three broad categories (with significant overlap among them) are highlighted here: stromal-depleting agents, immunotherapies, and signal transduction inhibitors. The mechanistic rationale, limitations, and promise of each of these strategies specific to pancreatic cancer are discussed, as are the aspects of this disease and this patient population that pose ongoing challenges in terms of both therapeutic management and biomarker-driven trial design.

### Combination therapies for cancer: challenges and opportunities [^cbd72212]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal cancers represent a major challenge to public health. Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal cancer among all gastrointestinal cancers. Most patients cannot meet the criteria of resection at diagnosis, indicating these patients will have dismal prognosis.

Main Text

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy helps some patients regain the opportunity of radical resection. An optimal regimen of chemotherapy is one that maximizes the anti-tumor efficacy while maintaining a relatively manageable safety profile. The development of surgical procedures further improves the outcomes of these patients.

Conclusions

Combination therapies in a multidisciplinary manner that involves modified chemotherapy regimen, radical resection, and intestine auto-transplantation may provide the currently best possible care to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Epigenetic treatment of pancreatic cancer: is there a therapeutic perspective on the horizon? [^5b1c156f]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Table 3
Inhibitors of epigenetic regulators validated in clinical trials in pancreatic cancer (recruiting trials)

As an alternative approach to chemotherapeutic agents, several trials have been conducted to evaluate the combination of HDACi and targeted therapies in PDAC treatment. Unfortunately, many HDACi combinatory treatment regimens with strong and promising mechanistic and functional synergism in preclinical PDAC models failed in first-in-patient studies, thus reflecting the difficulties of translating these findings into the clinical setting (eg, NCT00667082, NCT01056601). Nevertheless, a plethora of preclinical data on synthetic lethal interactions exist in the context of HDACi that can be used to optimise the potential of HDAC inhibition in PDAC treatment. For instance, a combinatory treatment of HDACi with LY294002-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibition has recently been reported to induce apoptosis in renal cancer cellsand in a xenograft model of endometrial cancer. These findings might be of particular interest for PDAC therapy, as dysregulation of PI3-kinase activity occurs in subgroups of PDACand might therefore represent an interesting target for synthetic-lethal approaches in the context of HDAC inhibition. Moreover, one of the neoadjuvant clinical trials investigating the efficiency of epigenetic drugs as a therapeutic option in PDAC treatment combines vorinostat-mediated HDACi with standard therapy (gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine plus radiation) and sorafenib in patients with stage I-III PDAC (NCT02349867). The combination of HDACi with sorafenib-mediated tyrosine-proteinase inhibition has been reported to show additive effects in preclinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models. Until today, the mechanism of the reported synergistic or additive effects of combined HDAC inhibition and tyrosine protein kinase inhibition remains elusive. Nevertheless, the fact that erlotinib-resistant glioblastoma cells could be resensitised for tyrosine kinase inhibition upon blockade of HDAC activityand preclinical data on a vorinostat-driven overcoming of erlotinib resistance in PDAC cells, suggests that HDACi might represent a promising treatment option in combination with erlotinib-mediated inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling in patients with PDAC. However, clinical trials investigating combined EGFR inhibition/HDAC inhibition are currently limited to glioblastoma multiforme (NCT01110876), lung cancer (eg, NCT00251589) and head and neck tumours (NCT00738751).

### Facts and hopes in immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer [^9c03626c]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancers to treat. For patients with advanced and metastatic disease, chemotherapy has yielded only modest incremental benefits, which are not durable. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of other solid tumors by leading to cures where none existed only a decade ago, yet it has made few inroads with PDAC. A host of trials with promising preclinical data have failed, except for in a small minority of patients with selected biomarkers. There is, however, a glimmer of hope, which we seek to cultivate. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC, learnings from completed trials of checkpoint inhibitors, TME modifiers, cellular and vaccine therapies, oncolytic viruses, and other novel approaches. We go on to discuss our expectations for improved preclinical models of immunotherapy in PDAC, new approaches to modifying the TME including the myeloid compartment, and emerging biomarkers to better select patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. We also discuss improvements in clinical trial design specific to immunotherapy that will help us better measure success when we find it. Finally, we discuss the urgent imperative to better design and execute bold, but rational, combination trials of novel agents designed to cure patients with PDAC.

### Chemotherapeutic advances in pancreatic cancer [^db0a8685]. Current Oncology Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Advances in chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer have been limited. In the past decade, the standard therapy for metastatic disease has switched from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to gemcitabine. However, several other cytotoxic agents have shown limited but promising efficacy in pancreatic cancer, and many of these appear to be well suited for combination chemotherapy. Although 5-FU and cisplatin have not demonstrated substantial survival benefits when combined with gemcitabine, results of several phase III trials with other agents are still pending. For locally advanced disease, most recent studies have incorporated gemcitabine into combined-modality therapy. Similarly, in surgically resectable disease, current trials are incorporating gemcitabine into adjuvant therapy. Other trials are using neoadjuvant therapy as a possible means to improve upon current surgical results. However, much hope comes from the development of newer "targeted" therapies for this disease. Although matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and farnesyl transferase inhibitors did not appear to be effective in initial studies, other targeted therapies are beginning to enter clinical trials.

### Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor-related signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer [^0beb9570]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is aggressive, chemoresistant, and characterized by complex and poorly understood molecular biology. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is frequently activated in pancreatic cancer; therefore, it is a rational target for new treatments. However, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib is currently the only targeted therapy to demonstrate a very modest survival benefit when added to gemcitabine in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. There is no molecular biomarker to predict the outcome of erlotinib treatment, although rash may be predictive of improved survival; EGFR expression does not predict the biologic activity of anti-EGFR drugs in pancreatic cancer, and no EGFR mutations are identified as enabling the selection of patients likely to benefit from treatment. Here, we review clinical studies of EGFR-targeted therapies in combination with conventional cytotoxic regimens or multitargeted strategies in advanced pancreatic cancer, as well as research directed at molecules downstream of EGFR as alternatives or adjuncts to receptor targeting. Limitations of preclinical models, patient selection, and trial design, as well as the complex mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR-targeted agents, are discussed. Future clinical trials must incorporate translational research end points to aid patient selection and circumvent resistance to EGFR inhibitors.

### Systemic therapy for pancreatic cancer [^5fc3a8fc]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, at which point systemic therapy becomes the primary modality of treatment. Although gemcitabine monotherapy has remained the standard of care for the past decade, a number of large studies conducted over the past several years have suggested that some advantages may be derived from the use of combination therapy, such as the addition of a platinum agent to gemcitabine. The application of pharmacokinetic principles to drug delivery may confer additional benefit as well. Furthermore, with an increasing understanding of the cellular and stromal events that govern pancreatic tumor maintenance, molecularly targeted agents are under active investigation and may prove to serve a critical role in our therapeutic armamentarium. The combination of standard cytotoxic agents and these newer targeted compounds offers promise that we will be able to make significant inroads in improving clinical outcomes for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Therapeutic advances in pancreatic cancer [^499d7964]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite our improved understanding of pancreatic cancer biology and ability to perform more complex pancreatic cancer surgeries that produce better short-term outcomes, major progress toward increasing survival times has been painstakingly slow. Through the often-repeated, dismal survival statistics, it is easy to lose sight of real progress that has been made in pancreatic cancer therapy. It is particularly interesting to observe the extent to which these advances are interdependent and the effects they have had on practice. For example, during the past 5–10 years, we have seen widespread adoption of pancreatic imaging protocols that allow for objectively defined criteria of resectability. This has led to the definition of "borderline resectable pancreatic cancer" — a new clinical category that has affected the design of clinical trials. A major change in our surgical approach has been the move to minimally invasive pancreatectomy, which continues to gain broader acceptance and use, particularly for left-sided lesions. Although many new agents have been developed aimed at putative molecular targets, recent breakthroughs in therapy for advanced disease have arisen from our ability to safely give patients combination cytotoxic chemotherapy. We are now faced with the challenge of combining multidrug, cytotoxic chemotherapies with newer-generation agents. Ultimately, the hope is that drug combinations will be selected based on biomarkers, and strategies for pancreatic cancer therapy will be personalized, which could prolong patients' lives and reduce toxicity. We review the major advances in pancreatic cancer therapy during the last 5 years, and discuss how these have set the stage for greater progress in the near future.

### More PARP inhibitors in pancreatic cancer? [^ec46db5c]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Medium credibility.

Maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor has demonstrated effectiveness against pancreatic cancer in patients with germline and somatic BRCA mutations alike. Now, trials are testing the drugs in earlier-stage disease, in patients with other homologous recombination repair deficiencies, and in combination with immunotherapy.

### Combination therapies for cancer: challenges and opportunities [^a8ce2bb8]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The modified FOLFIRINOX regimen is currently an optimal treatment option for pancreatic cancer patients. Combination of the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen, radical resection, and intestine auto-transplantation provides the currently best possible survival benefit for those who have otherwise lost the opportunity of surgery. The addition of immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy may further increase the efficacy of the combination therapy.

### Current and emerging therapies in metastatic pancreatic cancer [^13150b57]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

Targeted therapies and immunotherapy have changed the face of multiple solid malignancies, including metastatic melanoma and lung cancer, but no such therapies exist for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) despite the knowledge of key mutations and an increasing understanding of the tumor microenvironment. Until now, most clinical studies have not been biomarker driven in this highly immunosuppressive and heterogeneous cancer. Ongoing basic and translational studies are better classifying the disease in hopes of identifying critical pathways that distinguish the unique PDAC subtypes, which will lead to personalized therapies. In this review, we discuss the current treatment options for metastatic pancreatic cancer and highlight current ongoing clinical trials, which aim to target the stroma and the immune microenvironment either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy. Identifying biomarkers and key resistance pathways and targeting these pathways in a personalized manner in combination with chemotherapy are likely to yield a more immediate and durable clinical benefit.

### Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [^732b1803]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Many anti-cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review synthesises all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision-making. It updates the previous version of the review, published in 2018.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both on overall survival, severe or life-threatening adverse events, and quality of life in people undergoing first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Search Methods

We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CANCERLIT, and handsearched various sources for additional studies. The latest search dates were in March and July 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both with another intervention or best supportive care. Participants were required to have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer not amenable to curative intent treatment. Histological confirmation was required. Trials were required to report overall survival.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 75 studies in the review and 51 in the meta-analysis (11,333 participants). We divided the studies into seven categories: any anti-cancer treatment versus best supportive care; various chemotherapy types versus gemcitabine; gemcitabine-based combinations versus gemcitabine alone; various chemotherapy combinations versus gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel; fluoropyrimidine-based studies; miscellaneous studies; and radiotherapy studies. In general, the included studies were at low risk for random sequence generation, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias, at unclear risk for allocation concealment, and high risk for performance bias. Compared to best supportive care, chemotherapy likely results in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.33; absolute risk of death at 12 months of 971 per 1000 versus 962 per 1000; 4 studies, 298 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse effects of chemotherapy and impacts on quality of life (QoL) were uncertain. Many of the chemotherapy regimens were outdated. Eight studies compared non-gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens to gemcitabine. These showed that 5-fluorouracil (5FU) likely reduces OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27; risk of death at 12 months of 914 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 1 study, 126 participants; moderate certainty), and grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). Fixed dose rate gemcitabine likely improves OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; risk of death at 12 months of 683 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 644 participants; moderate certainty), and likely increase grade 3/4 adverse events (QoL not reported). FOLFIRINOX improves OS (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60; risk of death at 12 months of 524 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; P < 0.001; 2 studies, 652 participants; high certainty), and delays deterioration in QoL, but increases grade 3/4 adverse events. Twenty-eight studies compared gemcitabine-based combinations to gemcitabine. Gemcitabine plus platinum may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08; risk of death at 12 months of 745 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 6 studies, 1140 participants; low certainty), may increase grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely worsens QoL. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improves OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95; risk of death at 12 months of 722 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 10 studies, 2718 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely improves QoL. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitors result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16; risk of death at 12 months of 770 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 3 studies, 839 participants; high certainty), likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events, and likely does not alter QoL. Gemcitabine plus taxane result in a large improvement in OS (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.81; risk of death at 12 months of 644 per 1000 versus 767 per 1000; 2 studies, 986 participants; high certainty), and likely increases grade 3/4 adverse events and improves QoL. Nine studies compared chemotherapy combinations to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Fluoropyrimidine-based combination regimens improve OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.89; risk of death at 12 months of 542 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 6 studies, 1285 participants; high certainty). The treatment arms had distinct toxicity profiles, and there was little to no difference in QoL. Alternative schedules of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel likely result in little to no difference in OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.47; risk of death at 12 months of 663 per 1000 versus 628 per 1000; 2 studies, 367 participants; moderate certainty) or QoL, but may increase grade 3/4 adverse events. Four studies compared fluoropyrimidine-based combinations to fluoropyrimidines alone, with poor quality evidence. Fluoropyrimidine-based combinations are likely to result in little to no impact on OS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.15; risk of death at 12 months of 765 per 1000 versus 704 per 1000; P = 0.27; 4 studies, 491 participants; moderate certainty) versus fluoropyrimidines alone. The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in grade 3/4 adverse events or QoL between the two groups. We included only one radiotherapy (iodine-125 brachytherapy) study with 165 participants. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of radiotherapy on outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination chemotherapy remains standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Both FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus a taxane improve OS compared to gemcitabine alone. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that fluoropyrimidine-based combination chemotherapy regimens improve OS compared to gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. The effects of radiotherapy were uncertain as only one low-quality trial was included. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individuals still remains unpersonalised, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to assist in rationalising treatment selection for patients.

### Pancreatic cancer: molecular pathogenesis and new therapeutic targets [^56a2d3ad]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients with pancreatic cancer normally present with advanced disease that is lethal and notoriously difficult to treat. Survival has not improved dramatically despite routine use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; this situation signifies an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Over the past decade, a large number of studies have been published that aimed to target the molecular abnormalities implicated in pancreatic tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis. This research is of particular importance, as data suggest that a large number of genetic alterations affect only a few major signaling pathways and processes involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Although laboratory results of targeted therapies have been impressive, until now only erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated modest survival benefit in combination with gemcitabine in a phase III clinical trial. Whilst the failures of targeted therapies in the clinical setting are discouraging, lessons have been learnt and new therapeutic targets that hold promise for the future management of the disease are continuously emerging. This Review describes some of the important developments and targeted agents for pancreatic cancer that have been tested in clinical trials.

### Therapeutic approaches for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^4d731f61]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of gemcitabine in 1996, numerous randomized trials have investigated treatment programs to further improve the quality of life and survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. After little progress over the ensuing 15 years, 2 combination treatment programs recently conferred improved survival compared with gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Importantly, our understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer continues to grow. This improved biologic understanding holds great promise for integrating new targeted and immune-modifying therapies into current treatment programs.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — gemcitabine-based therapy evidence pattern: Historically, combination chemotherapy does not appear to be superior to monotherapy in the era of 5-FU–based therapy. Because gemcitabine is superior to bolus 5-FU in the advanced setting using endpoints of survival and symptom relief, it is often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents for patients with good and intermediate PS, including potentially synergistic partners such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, 5-FU, and irinotecan, or in multidrug combinations. Two meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in the advanced setting found that gemcitabine combinations give a marginal benefit in OS over gemcitabine monotherapy with a significant increase in toxicity.

### Barriers and opportunities in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy [^18130a5d]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Both pancreatic cancer cell-intrinsic signaling pathways and the TME play significant roles in immune suppression, contributing to the inherent resistance of pancreatic cancer to immunotherapy. Various therapeutic strategies, when combined with immunotherapy, have shown encouraging results in preclinical studies. However, the translation of these findings into clinical benefits has been challenging thus far. It is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms by which human PDAC evades immune surveillance and to devise approaches that effectively overcome immunotherapy resistance in patients. It should be noted that unrestricted cell death or tissue damage induced by chemotherapy might lead to an immunosuppressive TME. In contrast, radiation therapy was reported to enhance the response to immunotherapy in patients with microsatellite-stable pancreatic cancer.

Improving pancreatic cancer immunotherapy involves exploring various strategies. Some key strategies and future perspectives include: (1) combination therapies: combining different immunotherapeutic agents, including inhibitors of established and newly discovered immune checkpoints, with targeted therapies or other immunomodulators, may enhance the overall anti-tumor response. (2) Stroma-targeted approaches: targeting the dense stroma in pancreatic cancer to reduce fibrosis holds promise for improving drug delivery and enhancing immune cell infiltration. (3) Vaccine development: developing personalized cancer vaccines based on individual tumor profiles has the potential to stimulate a specific and robust immune response against cancer cells. (4) Bispecific antibodies: designing antibodies that can simultaneously target multiple antigens is likely to enhance their specificity and efficacy in engaging immune cells against cancer. (5) Adoptive cell therapies: CAR T-cell therapies, which use genetically engineered T cells directed to specific cancer-associated antigens to elicit cytotoxic activity, represent a promising therapeutic modality, although significant challenges exist for CAR T-cells to infiltrate the immunosuppressive TME of pancreatic tumors. (6) Biomarker identification: identifying reliable biomarkers to predict the response to immunotherapy will allow for better patient stratification and treatment selection. (7) Clinical trial innovation: designing innovative clinical trials to test emerging therapies and combinations can ensure a rapid translation of promising preclinical findings into clinical benefits.

These strategies are active areas of research and development, with the potential to significantly impact the future of pancreatic cancer immunotherapy. In addition, investigating strategies for early detection of pancreatic cancer will enable timely intervention, potentially improving the success of immunotherapeutic approaches.

### Decision-making regarding perioperative therapy in individuals with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^3270857e]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy that is projected to emerge as the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite the critical advances in surgical strategies, radiographic techniques, and systemic therapy, the treatment modality has remained largely unchanged over the past two decades eliciting a dire need for clinical trials in improving quality of life and prolonging survival in this patient population. Emergence of innovative strategies including novel combination chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, small compound drugs, among others is avenues under investigation to improve perioperative outcomes in localized pancreatic cancer.

Combination therapy

Due to the lack of meaningful clinical benefits of cancer vaccines, the potential positive immunological effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the promising outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the focus has shifted towards combining these modalities. Gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapy that is used traditionally to treat pancreatic cancer, has been found to mediate immunological effects such as tumor associated antigen cross presentation by dendritic cells and the induction and expansion of cytotoxic T cells responses in addition to reduce the number of myeloid suppressor cells. Radiation therapy can also increase the immunogenic properties of tumor cells by enhancing MHC class I expression, thereby increasing their vulnerability to CTLs. Another frequent effect of DNA damage inflicted by radiotherapy or chemotherapy is the increase in the expression of death receptors (in particular Fas/CD95 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL] receptors, enabling lysis of the tumor cells by Fas/CD95 ligand and TRAIL-positive immune effectors. As detailed in Table 3, the majority of ongoing trials investigate a combination strategy of the immunotherapy with chemotherapy, radiation or both. Of interest are multiple trials targeting mesothelin and/or GVAX with chemoradiation and multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy. Our group is currently investigating the immunological effect of the combination of chemoradiation and anti-PD-1 as a neoadjuvant treatment in patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer compared to neoadjuvant chemoradiation alone (NCT02305186). This neoadjuvant setting will allow investigators to study the effect of combination therapy on the tumor microenvironment. Another promising combination by the Hopkins group combined GVAX with anti-CTLA-4 and demonstrated a 1-year improvement in OS by 20% compared to GVAX and cyclophosphamide alone.

### Randomized clinical trials in pancreatic cancer [^ee92ed5d]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The management of pancreatic cancer has grown rapidly in the last decade. The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group trial in 1985 supported postoperative chemoradiation, and a more recent study recommended 6 months of adjuvant gemcitabine and capecitabine or monotherapy with gemcitabine or fluorouracil plus folinic acid, in the absence of neoadjuvant therapy. Clinicians are now studying the role of targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable, borderline resectable, and locally advanced pancreatic cancer. This article critically evaluates the evolution of pancreatic cancer management, focussing on level 1a, prospective randomized control trials from 2007 to 2017.

### Current status of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers [^cd468698]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The development of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs has shown remarkable clinical success across several types of malignancies. In the field of gastrointestinal malignancies, however, a small proportion of patients currently benefit from treatment with ICIs. The results of clinical trials are strongly anticipated to lead to the creation of optimal and safe combinations of ICIs and other treatment strategies tailored to the characteristics of each type of cancer. Furthermore, it is necessary to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance and tumor immune evasion, which could lead to an identification of predictive biomarkers and maximize the therapeutic effect of ICIs.

### Cetuximab: still an option in the treatment of pancreatic cancer? [^368795cc]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In this review, we analyzed the current literature about cetuximab to clarify its role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Using single-agent gemcitabine has been the standard treatment for more than 15 years for advanced pancreatic cancer. The attempts at improving the results by combining it with several other drugs, such as fluorouracil, cisplatin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or pemetrexed produced no clear survival benefit. Recently, however, new combination chemotherapy regimens (e.g. FOLFIRINOX, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine) achieved a significant survival benefit compared to gemcitabine alone.

Areas Covered

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transmembrane glycoprotein has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, and it correlates with more advanced disease, poor survival, and the presence of metastases. Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway could be an attractive therapeutic target in this tumor. Although several combinations of EGFR inhibitors with chemotherapy demonstrate inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, tumor cell apoptosis, and regression in xenograft models, these benefits remain to be confirmed.

Expert Opinion

The encouraging results from preclinical and early clinical studies with cetuximab in pancreatic cancer were not confirmed in a Phase III trial. Cetuximab failed to demonstrate improved patient outcome when paired with various chemotherapeutic regimens and/or other biological agents.

### A multicentre randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine alone vs gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer: GEMSAP study [^e4dac790]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present randomised phase II trial, combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 demonstrated a longer median PFS and higher 1-year survival rate with similar severe adverse effects compared with gemcitabine monotherapy. The addition of S-1 to gemcitabine led to a 4.7-month improvement in the median OS; however, this result was not statistically significant.

Combination therapy with gemcitabine and other cytotoxic drugs or molecular-targeted agents has been thoroughly investigated in patients with pancreatic cancer, but no significant improvement in OS has been confirmed in a single, randomised controlled trial, except for combination therapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib. However, the improvement in OS was modest with a median survival of 6.24 months for combination therapy with gemcitabine and erlotinib vs 5.91 months for gemcitabine monotherapy. In a meta-analysis, capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine similar to S-1, in combination with gemcitabine, was shown to improve OS compared with gemcitabine alone with a hazard ratio of 0.86. Recently, reported a significantly longer OS with FORFIRINOX than gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Thus, fluoropyrimidine is currently a key drug in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. In adjuvant settings, the OS with 5-FU plus folinic acid was as effective as gemcitabine. S-1 is also an oral fluoropyrimidine that has been reported to be active against pancreatic cancer. We previously reported promising data for combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 using a 4-week schedule. This subsequent randomised controlled trial demonstrated a significantly longer PFS (the primary end point) and higher 1-year survival rate. Despite an improvement in OS of 4.7 months with a hazard ratio of 0.72 for combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In a post hoc analysis of patients with a KPS of 100, the median OS was significantly longer in patients treated with gemcitabine and S-1 (15.0 vs 8.5 months; P = 0.011). The trend toward improved results with combination therapy in patients with a good performance status was also reported for combination therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine. By contrast, OS with gemcitabine monotherapy showed similar results regardless of the KPS score in our study (8.5 months with KPS = 100 vs 8.8 months with KPS < 100).

Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of pancreatic cancer, the disease remains a clinical challenge. Gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, offers modest improvement of tumor-related symptoms and marginal advantage of survival. New approaches, alone and in combination with gemcitabine, are being developed to combat this cancer. In this article we review the current status of investigations into several classes of agents: matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors; farnesyl transferase inhibitors; epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors; cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and others. The scientific rationale, mechanism of action, and clinical trial data for these novel agents are discussed.

### Association of timing of adjuvant therapy with survival in patients with resected stage I to II pancreatic cancer [^9ea97ece]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest malignant neoplasms in the United States. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with 56 770 new cases estimated for 2019. For early-stage pancreatic cancer, surgery offers patients the best chance of cure, but outcomes remain poor. Despite primary surgery with curative intent, 73% of patients may develop local failure. Multiple clinical trials previously investigated the clinical outcomes of various adjuvant therapy regimens. A 2008 study sponsored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)suggested the combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation for select patients, while trials in 2017and 2018established the current adjuvant chemotherapy regimens as the standard of care. A current trial, RTOG 0848 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) is examining the role of sequential chemoradiation following adjuvant chemotherapy.

Delays in the initiation of adjuvant treatment or total duration of treatment time have been associated with worse survival outcomes, seen in a wide range of cancers including colorectal, head and neck, cervical, and breastcancer. While the benefit of adjuvant therapy to patients with resected pancreatic cancer is accepted, its optimal timing after surgery remains under investigation. Prior studies suggested no benefit to early initiation of adjuvant therapy but only compared survival between arbitrarily assigned time periods.,

This National Cancer Database (NCDB) study compares the outcomes of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation at various time intervals, which were defined by a Cox model with restricted cubic splines (RCS).

### Combination therapies for cancer: challenges and opportunities [^851e2760]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal cancers account for around 25.8% of newly diagnosed cancers annually. Among them, pancreatic cancer is the most lethal cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of only around 12%. There are more than 495,700 new cases of pancreatic cancer each year. Unfortunately, over 80% of these patients lost the opportunity of surgery at diagnosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy helps some patients regain the opportunity of radical resection, the only way for possible cure. Numerous efforts have been made in hopes of increasing the efficacy while decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy. A widely-used chemotherapy agent is gemcitabine, which is usually combined with other drugs as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment option. The first-line chemotherapy regimen is FOLFIRINOX consisting of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. Although this regimen achieved a relatively satisfying anti-tumor effect on metastatic pancreatic cancer, it would inevitably bring undesirable adverse effects, which reduced treatment efficacy. Optimizing the dose of the FOLFIRINOX regimen is critical for the treatment efficacy.

### Recent advances and prospects for multimodality therapy in pancreatic cancer [^96b28d13]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The outcomes for treatment of pancreatic cancer have not improved dramatically in many decades. However, the recent promising results with combination chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease increase optimism for future treatments. With greater control of overt or occult metastatic disease, there will likely be an expanding role for local treatment modalities, especially given that nearly a third of pancreatic cancer patients have locally destructive disease without distant metastatic disease at the time of death. Technical advances have allowed for the safe delivery of dose-escalated radiation therapy, which can then be combined with chemotherapy, targeted agents, immunotherapy, and nanoparticulate drug delivery techniques to produce novel and improved synergistic effects. Here we discuss recent advances and future directions for multimodality therapy in pancreatic cancer.

### A multicentre randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine alone vs gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer: GEMSAP study [^8620de67]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Despite extensive research, the prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer remains poor. Because gemcitabine is superior to bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), with a response rate of 5% and a median overall survival (OS) of 5.7 months, combination therapy with gemcitabine and cytotoxic drugs or molecular-targeted agents has been intensely investigated. Only erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine showed a statistically significant but clinically small improvement in OS, but most phase III clinical trials have failed to demonstrate significant differences in OS. Recently, the efficacy of multiagent regimens was reported in two randomised controlled trials; however, multiagent regimens have potentially increased adverse effects.

S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine consisting of tegafur, a prodrug of 5-FU, and two biochemical modulators, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine and potassium oxonate, with single-agent activity in advanced pancreatic cancer and an objective response rate (ORR) comparable to that for gemcitabine monotherapy. Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 is reportedly well tolerated and active against advanced pancreatic cancer. Initially, combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 was reported as a 3-week regimen, but our modified 4-week regimen demonstrated a time to progression of 10.0 months and OS of 20.4 months with mild adverse effects in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

Here, we conducted a multicentre, randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine alone vs combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

### A multicentre randomised phase II trial of gemcitabine alone vs gemcitabine and S-1 combination therapy in advanced pancreatic cancer: GEMSAP study [^a36dc593]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The problem often encountered with randomised controlled trials of combination therapy with gemcitabine and other drugs is the crossover to experimental drugs in the gemcitabine arm. In our study, 31 patients (58.5%) in the gemcitabine monotherapy arm received S-1 as second-line chemotherapy. In Japan, both gemcitabine and S-1 are approved for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and are widely used in clinical practice. Therefore, patients in gemcitabine arm had easy access to S-1 as second-line treatment. Although second-line chemotherapy has not been established in patients with gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer, S-1 has been reported to be useful in this setting. This crossover might obscure the efficacy of combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 over gemcitabine monotherapy. As S1 improved the prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer using a historical cohort design, the introduction of new effective drugs could lead to improved survival even in patients with pancreatic cancer refractory to gemcitabine. In addition to gemcitabine and S-1, oxaliplatin and irinotecan were administered to refractory patients in the present study. However, drugs other than gemcitabine and S-1 were not approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer and were administered only as clinical trials. As a result, the introduction rate of second-line treatment was lower in gemcitabine and S-1 arm compared with gemcitabine arm (34.0% vs 58.5%). The rate of patients receiving three or four anticancer drugs was higher in the combination therapy arm. As shown for colorectal cancer, the availability of multiple drugs might be associated with prolonged survival in pancreatic cancer. Thus, the development of multiple effective drugs and appropriate combination regimens is as important as randomised controlled trials of first-line chemotherapy.

Background

Preclinical data have suggested a synergistic effect of cetuximab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin and clinical data have shown a substantial improvement in response and survival when gemcitabine is combined with a platinum analogue compared with gemcitabine alone. The aim of this study was to assess the activity and feasibility of a combination of cetuximab with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared with use of gemcitabine and cisplatin alone for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Methods

In a multicentre, randomised phase II trial, 84 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to either 250 mg/m² cetuximab weekly, after a loading dose of 400 mg/m², plus 1000 mg/m² gemcitabine and 35 mg/m² cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle or to the same chemotherapeutic regimen without cetuximab. The primary endpoint was objective response (defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was either partial response or complete response). Secondary endpoints included disease control (defined as the proportion of patients whose best response was either partial response, complete response, or stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival. All assessments of response at each site were done blindly by a local experienced radiologist who was not directly involved in the trial. Responses were measured according to an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with the Clinical Trial registry, number NCT00536614.

Findings

29 men and 13 women were randomly assigned to cetuximab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (median age 61 years [range 38–78]) and 22 men and 20 women were randomly assigned to gemcitabine and cisplatin (median age 64 years [range 40–76]). Seven of 40 (17.5%) patients had an objective response in the cetuximab group (95% CI 7.3–32.8) and five of 41 (12.2%) patients had an objective response in the non-cetuximab group (95% CI 4.1–26.2). No significant difference was noted between the groups both for objective response (5.3% higher in the cetuximab group [95% CI -16.5 to 27.1]; chi2 test = 0.360; p = 0.549) or for disease control (3.5% higher in the non-cetuximab group [-34.0% to 27.0%]; 0.446; p = 0.504). Overall median follow-up was 11.8 months (range 2.5–18.5). No significant differences between the groups were noted in median progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.60–1.52, p = 0.847) or in median overall survival (0.91, 0.54–1.55, p = 0.739): median progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% CI 2.4–5.1) in the cetuximab group and 4.2 months (2.6–5.4) in the non-cetuximab group; median overall survival was 7.5 months (5.1–8.8) and 7.8 months (5.3–15.0), respectively. 33 patients from both groups had at least one grade 3–4 toxic effect.

Interpretation

The addition of cetuximab to a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin does not increase response or survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Although toxic effects were not increased by cetuximab, this combination should not be further assessed in phase III trials.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^52a51b65]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — future clinical trials: recommendations for design emphasize that with the emergence of new agents to treat pancreatic cancer, particularly biologics, clinical trial strategies incorporating principles of molecular biology and new imaging methods as well as results from preclinical studies are important; for patients enrolled in clinical trials, banking of tumor tissue samples should be required along with paired blood and serum samples; biomarkers that serve as surrogate markers of the anticancer effects of investigational agents should be sought, and assays to measure such biomarkers should be well validated; clinical trials should enroll homogeneous patient populations with respect to disease stage and patient PS, and criteria for selecting study populations should take into account the putative differential efficacy of the agent; Phase III trials should not be initiated in the absence of clinically meaningful efficacy and safety signals in the phase II setting; Phase II and III clinical trials should have OS as a primary endpoint; and quality control standards for preoperative imaging interpretation, pathologic assessment of tumor specimens, and surgical selection criteria are critical when evaluating adjuvant therapies.

### New therapeutic directions for advanced pancreatic cancer: targeting the epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways [^ef28fe98]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

In advanced pancreatic cancer, single-agent gemcitabine became the standard therapy approximately 10 years ago. Subsequently, combinations of gemcitabine with fluorouracil, cisplatin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or pemetrexed produced no clear survival benefit. Among the newer approaches, targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-1/EGFR) shows promise. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved erlotinib (a HER-1/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) combined with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. This combination showed a statistically significant survival benefit over gemcitabine alone in locally advanced or metastatic disease (the median overall survival time was 6.24 months versus 5.91 months; hazard ratio, 0.82; p = .038); however, the clinical significance of this survival difference has been questioned. Additionally, a large phase III trial where the addition of cetuximab (an anti-HER-1/EGFR monoclonal antibody [mAb]) to gemcitabine failed to result in a longer overall survival time than with gemcitabine alone has been reported. Targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with bevacizumab (a recombinant, humanized IgG1 mAb that binds to VEGF) in combination with gemcitabine was investigated in a phase II trial, with promising outcomes that were unfortunately not supported by a subsequent phase III study. While the future treatment of pancreatic cancer may be influenced by the potential of certain biomarkers to predict better response to molecular-targeted therapies, allowing individualization of patient therapy, there are currently no clear candidates, and this remains an interesting area for further investigation.

### Paradigms on immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy [^e44fe376]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Medium credibility.

Checkpoint inhibitors are being added to standard-of-care chemotherapy in multiple clinical trials. Success has been reported in non-small and small cell lung carcinomas and urothelial, head and neck, gastric, and esophageal cancers, and promising results are already available in triple-negative breast and pancreatic malignancies. The potential mechanisms of synergy include immunogenic tumor cell death, antiangiogenesis, selective depletion of myeloid immunosuppressive cells, and lymphopenia, which reduces regulatory T cells and makes room for proliferation of effector T cells. However, chemotherapy regimens have not been optimized for such combinations, perhaps explaining some recent clinical trial disappointments. Approaches to make the most of chemoimmunotherapy include neoadjuvant and adjuvant schemes. Significance: Immunotherapy of cancer based on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has prompted a revolution in cancer clinical management. Evidence in phase III clinical trials already supports combinations of immunotherapy with standard-of-care chemotherapy for a number of malignant diseases. This review focuses on such evidence and provides an overview of the potential synergistic mechanisms of action and the opportunities to optimize chemoimmunotherapy regimens.

### Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer [^8ef1f140]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. Over the past few decades, many anti-cancer therapies have been tested in the locally advanced and metastatic setting, with mixed results. This review attempts to synthesise all the randomised data available to help better inform patient and clinician decision-making when dealing with this difficult disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both for first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Our primary outcome was overall survival, while secondary outcomes include progression-free survival, grade 3/4 adverse events, therapy response and quality of life.

Search Methods

We searched for published and unpublished studies in CENTRAL (searched 14 June 2017), Embase (1980 to 14 June 2017), MEDLINE (1946 to 14 June 2017) and CANCERLIT (1999 to 2002) databases. We also handsearched all relevant conference abstracts published up until 14 June 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised studies assessing overall survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination, were the eligible treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently analysed studies, and a third settled any disputes. We extracted data on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL), and we assessed risk of bias for each study.

Main Results

We included 42 studies addressing chemotherapy in 9463 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We did not identify any eligible studies on radiotherapy. We did not find any benefit for chemotherapy over best supportive care. However, two identified studies did not have sufficient data to be included in the analysis, and many of the chemotherapy regimens studied were outdated. Compared to gemcitabine alone, participants receiving 5FU had worse OS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.27, moderate-quality evidence), PFS (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.92) and QoL. On the other hand, two studies showed FOLFIRINOX was better than gemcitabine for OS (HR 0.51 95% CI 0.43 to 0.60, moderate-quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.57) and response rates (RR 3.38, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.65), but it increased the rate of side effects. The studies evaluating CO-101, ZD9331 and exatecan did not show benefit or harm when compared with gemcitabine alone. Giving gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, high-quality evidence) but increased the rate of side effects when compared with bolus dosing. When comparing gemcitabine combinations to gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus platinum improved PFS (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and response rates (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.98) but not OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, low-quality evidence). The rate of side effects increased. Gemcitabine plus fluoropyrimidine improved OS (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95), PFS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87) and response rates (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.47, high-quality evidence), but it also increased side effects. Gemcitabine plus topoisomerase inhibitor did not improve survival outcomes but did increase toxicity. One study demonstrated that gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel improved OS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.84, high-quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.82) and response rates (RR 3.29, 95% CI 2.24 to 4.84) but increased side effects. Gemcitabine-containing multi-drug combinations (GEMOXEL or cisplatin/epirubicin/5FU/gemcitabine) improved OS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.79, low-quality evidence), PFS (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62) and QOL. We did not find any survival advantages when comparing 5FU combinations to 5FU alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Combination chemotherapy has recently overtaken the long-standing gemcitabine as the standard of care. FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel are highly efficacious, but our analysis shows that other combination regimens also offer a benefit. Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult, with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive. Biomarker development is essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients.

### Novel therapeutics for pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^312898b1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen significant developments in the use of combination systemic therapy for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with median survival approaching 1 year for select patients treated with FOLFIRINOX in the metastatic setting. However, it is sobering that these developments have been achieved with the use of traditional cytotoxics rather than from successes in the more modern fields of molecularly targeted therapies or immunotherapy. This article highlights several promising therapeutic approaches to PDAC currently under clinical evaluation, including immune therapies, molecularly targeted therapies, strategies for stromal depletion, and targeted therapy for genetically selected patients.

### Her signaling in pancreatic cancer [^048b84f2]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer remains a treatment-refractory cancer. Standard therapy for metastatic cancer is gemcitabine chemotherapy, with a median survival of 5–6 months. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly expressed in pancreatic cancer and has been evaluated as a therapeutic target. A Phase III trial of gemcitabine with or without the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, demonstrated a modest but significant prolongation of survival with the addition of erlotinib. A Phase II trial of gemcitabine with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab resulted in a 1-year survival of 32%. A Phase III trial of gemcitabine with or without cetuximab and a randomized Phase II trial of the Murren regimen with or without cetuximab are completed; results for both are anticipated in 2007. A Phase I trial of gemcitabine with the EGFR/Her-2 inhibitor, lapatinib, is completed. Improved patient selection and rational combination of targeted therapies will be necessary to optimize the management of patients with this tragic disease.

### Meta-analysis of randomised adjuvant therapy trials for pancreatic cancer [^4fc85784]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the top five causes of cancer death in the Western world. Long-term survival remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of 0.4% to 4%. Resection is associated with improved survival, but this is only possible in approximately 10% of patients. Postoperative adjuvant therapy may further improve long-term survival, but its routine use has yet to be properly established. Adjuvant therapy can be in the form of chemoradiation or chemotherapy or both.

Until the recent European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC)1 trial, studies of adjuvant therapy have either combined patients with both pancreatic and periampullary cancers, have been underpowered to detect the modest survival differences expected of postoperative adjuvant treatment or have been nonrandomised. The ESPAC1 trial was designed and powered to answer two questions: the roles of adjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy, randomising 289 patients into a 2 × 2 factorial design and the recent publication of the final results showed no survival benefit for chemoradiation but a significant survival benefit for chemotherapy (ESPAC1-2 × 2). The results of individual studies can be conflicting in isolation and the recent results of the ESPAC1 trial have highlighted the need to perform this meta-analysis to assess all available worldwide evidence addressing these questions. In particular, the ESPAC group randomised an additional 261 patients outside of the 2 × 2 factorial design (ESPAC1-plus) and the updated evidence from these patients are also presented here for the first time. Also, combining trial results in this meta-analysis increases statistical power and has allowed reliable assessment of all available randomised evidence, in particular, the assessment of the magnitude of treatment effects within predefined prognostic subgroups.

This meta-analysis was an international collaboration collating individual patient data from randomised controlled trials with the primary aim to investigate the roles of adjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy on survival.

### Phase I study of palbociclib with cisplatin or carboplatin in the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [^c283a70f]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

It is unknown if the combination of a selective CDK4/6 + RB pathway inhibitor (palbociclib) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) is safe and effective in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this phase I nonrandomized clinical trial of 71 patients, the combination of palbociclib and platinum chemotherapy was safe, with minimal adverse events. Clinical responses were observed in patients with multiple treatment refractory advanced cancers, but there was no objective response in PDAC. Disease stabilization in 42% of mostly platinum–refractory metastatic PDAC patients suggest that the combination could be an attractive earlier line therapy.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^ba5ac405]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Future clinical trials — recommendations for design in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: With the emergence of new agents to treat pancreatic cancer, particularly biologics, clinical trial strategies incorporating principles of molecular biology and new imaging methods as well as results from preclinical studies are important. For patients enrolled in clinical trials, banking of tumor tissue samples should be required along with paired blood and serum samples. Biomarkers that serve as surrogate markers of the anticancer effects of investigational agents should be sought, and assays to measure such biomarkers should be well validated. Clinical trials should enroll homogeneous patient populations with respect to disease stage and patient PS, and criteria for selecting study populations should take into account the putative differential efficacy of the agent. Phase III trials should not be initiated in the absence of clinically meaningful efficacy and safety signals in the phase II setting, and Phase II and III clinical trials should have OS as a primary endpoint. Quality control standards for preoperative imaging interpretation, pathologic assessment of tumor specimens, and surgical selection criteria are critical when evaluating adjuvant therapies.

### Potentially curable pancreatic adenocarcinoma: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^99b7d9f3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Adjuvant therapy for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma — All patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma who did not receive preoperative therapy should be offered 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy in the absence of medical or surgical contraindications. The modified combination regimen of 5-fluorouracil (FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m², leucovorin 400 mg/m², irinotecan 150 mg/m² D1, and 5-FU 2.4 g/m² over 46 hours every 14 days for 12 cycles) is preferred in the absence of concerns for toxicity or tolerance; alternatively, doublet therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine or monotherapy with gemcitabine alone or fluorouracil plus folinic acid alone can be offered. Type: Evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong. The panel recommends that all patients with resected pancreatic cancer who did not receive preoperative therapy be offered 6 months of chemotherapy postoperatively, assuming complete recovery, and the combination regimen of mFOLFIRINOX has shown significant improvement in survival relative to gemcitabine and is therefore preferred. Clinicians should recognize the restrictive inclusion criteria for enrollment into this trial, including the upper limits on patients' age (79 years) and serum CA 19–9 level (180 U/mL), and although modified doses were used partway through the randomized trial only the modified regimen is therefore recommended. Doublet therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine or monotherapy with gemcitabine alone or FU plus folinic acid alone may be offered if concerns for toxicity or tolerance exist or based on patient preferences, and for patients who receive monotherapy, gemcitabine is favored, given evidence of less toxicity.

### Immunotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma: beyond "Copy / paste" [^ecc01733]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

It is clear that more effective therapies are desperately needed for PDAC. Despite herculean research efforts from the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry to combat this disease, even incremental improvements in terms of toxicity profile and OS remain elusive. However, there are several promising avenues of research which have shown hope in making inroads in the fight against PDAC, including the use of immunotherapy. As Robert Vonderheide, professor and immunologist expert in pancreatic cancer at University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), once stated at a national meeting, "copy–paste of immunotherapy from other cancers to pancreatic cancer will not work". To date, clinical trials in the realm of immunotherapy in PDAC have been disappointing. In a review article, Henriksen and colleagues pointed to over 20 published trials using checkpoint inhibitors in PDAC. A trial of CTLA4 monotherapy showed no responders. Two trials of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy showed no objective response for anti-PD-L1 monotherapy, and combined PD-L1 inhibition with CTLA4 inhibition showed a low disease control rate of only 9%. Trials of combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy have had equally lackluster results. For example, two clinical trials which evaluated combined CTLA4 inhibition and gemcitabine therapy showed similar efficacy rates to gemcitabine monotherapy. Another trial evaluated nivolumab with combination gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for patients with advanced PDAC, and showed a PFS of 5.5 months, identical to PFS seen in the original study from Von Hoff that led to approval of combination gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in 2013. The lack of ongoing trials of checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy point to absence of clinical response or OS demonstrated to date with use of these agents in PDAC.

Here we explore the potential explanations for PDAC tumor resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy and compile strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy in PDAC, an approach that still holds promise for the control of this disease.

### PEGylated IL-10: clinical development in cancer immunotherapy, where to Go? [^2824b233]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purposeof Review

The purpose of this review is to discuss the current understanding of the pegilodecakin (PEGylated interleukin 10) and its role in the inhibition of tumour growth and metastasis. This review also focuses on clinical data published to date that have evaluated the efficacy and safety of pegilodecakin.

Recent Findings

Pegilodecakin has shown significant promise in preclinical models, notable for decreased tumour burden and fewer sites of metastatic disease across various malignancies. It has been most widely assessed in a phase I/Ib clinical trial against several solid tumours, leading to the phase II and III clinical trials containing pegilodecakin and its combination with other current treatments. However, the updated data have not shown higher efficacy in renal cell carcinoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, with respect to the controls, yet the adverse events presented more mixed results. Further investigation into combination therapies including pegilodecakin is ongoing. Pegilodecakin showed promise in preclinical and phase I clinical trials on its efficacy in several solid tumours, with expected regulation of IL-10 signalling pathway observed. However, the phase II and III trials did not justify its application as potential immunotherapy in selected cancers. Further evaluation of pegilodecakin's efficacy in other cancers, either as monotherapy or in combination with the current treatments, is worth investigating clinically, which warrants to better understand its potential clinical utility.

### The role of PARP inhibitors inmutated pancreatic cancer [^7b5b35f9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are three trials investigating niraparib in combination with immunotherapy. NCT04409002 and NCT04493060 are exploring the disease control rate by using an investigational anti-programmed death (PD)-1 agent, dostarlimab, combined with niraparib with or without radiation. Another trial is studying the effectiveness, safety, and anti-tumor activity of niraparib either with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 inhibitor) or nivolumab (anti-PD-1). The primary endpoint of this study is PFS. Harboring genetic mutations in DNA repair genes is not mandatory for participation, but the proportion of tumors with homologous recombination deficit and their response to treatment will be analyzed in subgroup analysis as secondary outcome measures [identifier: NCT03404960] (Table 3).

Talazoparib

Talazoparib is another PARP inhibitor approved by the US FDA for patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutated, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In PDAC, there is one ongoing clinical trial. NCT04550494 is a basket study evaluating the pharmacodynamic effect of talazoparib for patients with various cancer types that harbor somatic or germline mutations in genes involved in the DNA damage repair process. This trial is currently recruiting participants (Table 3).

### Durvalumab with or without tremelimumab for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^78c09954]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

New therapeutic options for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) are needed. This study evaluated dual checkpoint combination therapy in patients with mPDAC.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) antibody using either durvalumab monotherapy or in combination with the anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody using durvalumab plus tremelimumab therapy in patients with mPDAC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Part A of this multicenter, 2-part, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was a lead-in safety, open-label study with planned expansion to part B pending an efficacy signal from part A. Between November 26, 2015, and March 23, 2017, 65 patients with mPDAC who had previously received only 1 first-line fluorouracil-based or gemcitabine-based treatment were enrolled at 21 sites in 6 countries. Efficacy analysis included the intent-to-treat population; safety analysis included patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and for whom any postdose data were available.

Interventions

Patients received durvalumab (1500 mg every 4 weeks) plus tremelimumab (75 mg every 4 weeks) combination therapy for 4 cycles followed by durvalumab therapy (1500 mg every 4 weeks) or durvalumab monotherapy (1500 mg every 4 weeks) for up to 12 months or until the onset of progressive disease or unacceptable toxic effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Safety and efficacy were measured by objective response rate, which was used to determine study expansion to part B. The threshold for expansion was an objective response rate of 10% for either treatment arm.

Results

Among 65 randomized patients, 34 (52%) were men and median age was 61 (95% CI, 37–81) years. Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7 of 32 patients (22%) receiving combination therapy and in 2 of 32 patients (6%) receiving monotherapy; 1 patient randomized to the monotherapy arm did not receive treatment owing to worsened disease. Fatigue, diarrhea, and pruritus were the most common adverse events in both arms. Overall, 4 of 64 patients (6%) discontinued treatment owing to treatment-related adverse events. Objective response rate was 3.1% (95% CI, 0.08–16.22) for patients receiving combination therapy and 0% (95% CI, 0.00–10.58) for patients receiving monotherapy. Low patient numbers limited observation of the associations between treatment response and PD-L1 expression or microsatellite instability status.

Conclusion and Relevance

Treatment was well tolerated, and the efficacy of durvalumab plus tremelimumab therapy and durvalumab monotherapy reflected a population of patients with mPDAC who had poor prognoses and rapidly progressing disease. Patients were not enrolled in part B because the threshold for efficacy was not met in part A.

### Current status of immunotherapy treatments for pancreatic cancer [^585fe83f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal disease representing the seventh most frequent cause of death from cancer worldwide. Resistance of pancreatic tumors to current treatments leads to disappointing survival rates, and more specific and effective therapies are urgently needed. In recent years, immunotherapy has been proposed as a promising approach to the treatment of PC, and encouraging results have been published by various preclinical and clinical studies. This review provides an overview of the latest developments in the immunotherapeutic treatment of PC and summarizes the most recent and important clinical trials.

### Combination chemotherapy or gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab… [^833f5c82]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

This randomized phase II trial studies how well fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin works and compares to gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel before surgery in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. Giving more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel before surgery in treating pancreatic cancer.

Inclusion Criteria
- Patients must have histologically or cytologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma; histologies other than adenocarcinoma, or any mixed histologies, will NOT be eligible
- Patients must have measurable disease in the pancreas; computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging used to assess measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration; all disease must be assessed and documented on the baseline tumor assessment form. See trial information on ClinicalTrials. gov for a list of participating sites. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess 2-year overall survival in each treatment arm FOLFIRINOX] and gemcitabine /nab-paclitaxel) in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Patients achieving stable disease or better undergo pancreatectomy 4–8 weeks after completion of first 3 cycles of treatment.

Within 4–8 weeks following pancreatectomy, patients receive an additional 3 cycles of oxaliplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, and fluorouracil treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or better undergo pancreatectomy 4–8 weeks after completion of first 3 cycles of treatment. Within 4–8 weeks following pancreatectomy, patients receive an additional 3 cycles of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine hydrochloride treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

### Smarter drugs emerging in pancreatic cancer therapy [^47c1dcd4]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the Western world. Owing to a lack of specific symptoms and no accessible precursor lesions, primary diagnosis is commonly delayed, resulting in only 15%-20% of patients with potentially curable disease. The standard of care in advanced pancreatic cancer has improved. Apart from gemcitabine (plus erlotinib), FOLFIRINOX and the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel are novel and promising therapeutic options for patients with metastatic PDAC. A better molecular understanding of pancreatic cancer has led to the identification of a variety of potential molecular therapeutic targets. Many targeted therapies are currently under clinical evaluation in combination with standard therapies for PDAC. This review highlights the current status of targeted therapies and their potential benefit for the treatment of advanced PDAC.

### Nivolumab monotherapy or combination with ipilimumab with or without cobimetinib in previously treated patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (checkMate 032) [^ac08a73d]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types and represents a major unmet medical need. CheckMate 032 investigated safety and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab plus ipilimumab with/without cobimetinib in advanced/metastatic solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

Methods

In the original pancreatic cancer cohort, previously treated patients (≥ 1 prior regimen) with advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were assigned to nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (monotherapy arm) or nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (combination arm). A subsequent modified pancreatic cohort (one or two prior regimens) received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, and cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily for 21 days on and 7 days off (triplet arm). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), PFS rate, overall survival (OS), OS rate, safety, and tolerability. Additionally, ORR, PFS, and duration of response were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the triplet arm.

Results

18 patients received nivolumab monotherapy, 21 received nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and 30 received nivolumab plus ipilimumab plus cobimetinib. In the triplet arm, partial responses were observed in two patients per investigator (ORR 6.7% (95% CI 0.8% to 22.1%)) and in three patients per BICR (ORR 10% (95% CI 2.1% to 26.5%)); no responses were observed in the other arms. Median (95% CI) PFS per investigator was 1.4 (1.3 to 2.0), 1.4 (1.2 to 2.7), and 3.0 (1.5 to 4.1) months for the monotherapy, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and triplet arms, respectively. Median (95% CI) OS was 5.1 (2.0 to 9.0) months, 4.0 (1.9 to 5.6) months, and 6.2 (3.9 to 11.4) months, respectively. Most treatment-related adverse events were grade 2 or less.

Conclusions

Nivolumab with or without ipilimumab did not elicit objective responses in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, although three confirmed partial responses and manageable safety were observed with cobimetinib-containing triplet therapy. The small sample size and differences in baseline disease-specific characteristics between arms limit interpretation of these results.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — gemcitabine plus cisplatin lacks supportive survival benefit in RCTs. Data state that RCTs have not provided support for use of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in advanced pancreatic cancer, and phase III trials versus gemcitabine alone did not show a significant survival benefit; nevertheless, benefit has been observed in selected carriers of a BRCA mutation with breast or ovarian cancers.

### Multimodality therapy for pancreatic cancer [^e60f0081]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy can be administered safely to patients with pancreatic cancer. Complete pathologic responses are rare, however, and the benefits of this approach compared with standard adjuvant therapy are uncertain. The only way to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a prospective trial involving a uniform patient population comparing the results of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy and a cohort receiving surgery alone. Such a study can be designed in an ethically sound manner but requires the collaboration of numerous institutions and careful coordination to achieve statistically conclusive results. The future of pancreatic cancer research rests on the availability and rapid transfer of new therapies from the laboratory to clinical research.

### PARP inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting; A comprehensive overview of the rationale for their use, past and ongoing clinical trials [^ad5af6e0]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purposeof Review

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are enzymes essential for detecting and repairing DNA damage through poly-ADP-ribosylation. In cancer, cells with deficiencies in homologous recombination repair mechanisms often become more dependent on PARP-mediated repair mechanisms to effectively repair dsDNA breaks. As such, PARP inhibitors (PARPis) were introduced into clinical practice, serving as a key targeted therapy option through synthetic lethality in the treatment of cancers with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD). Though PARPis are currently approved in the adjuvant setting for several cancer types such as ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer, their potential role in the neoadjuvant setting remains under investigation. This review outlines the rationale for using PARPi in the neoadjuvant setting and evaluates findings from early and ongoing clinical trials.

Recent Findings

Our analysis indicates that numerous studies have explored PARPi as a neoadjuvant treatment for HRD-related cancers. The majority of neoadjuvant PARPi trials have been performed in breast and ovarian cancer, while phase II/III evidence supporting efficacy in prostate and pancreatic cancers remains limited. Studies are investigating PARPi in the neoadjuvant setting of HRD-related cancers. Future research should prioritize combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and expand outcome measures to include patient satisfaction and quality-of-life metrics.

In this study, we developed a mouse syngeneic orthotopic model of PDAC suitable for the hypofractionated RT experiment. Using this model, we investigated the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapies with radiation and PD-1 blockade or IDO1 inhibition or both. In this era of rapid drug development for cancer therapeutics and enthusiasm for immuno-oncological combination therapies, our results highlight the importance of performing diligent preclinical studies to help ensure that clinical trials are rationally designed and based on strong scientific evidence.

### Advanced pancreatic carcinoma: current treatment and future challenges [^b5743e87]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most lethal of the solid tumors and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in North America. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease that precludes curative resection. These patients have an extremely poor prognosis. In the absence of effective screening methods, considerable efforts have been made during the past decade to identify better systemic treatments. Unfortunately most trials have not shown a survival advantage for most therapies. In tandem with this increased clinical research, there has also been an expansion of preclinical laboratory investigation. These preclinical studies revealed many of the molecular mechanisms involved in pancreatic cancer development, which has provided insights into why current therapies are ineffective. These new discoveries provide some optimism that new agents inhibiting specific targets will improve outcome and overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to most standard treatments. We review the current standards of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and outline some future directions for the development of new treatment strategies.

### Niraparib plus nivolumab or niraparib plus ipilimumab in patients with platinum-sensitive advanced pancreatic cancer: a randomised, phase 1b / 2 trial [^d21dff9c]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Establishing alternatives to lifelong chemotherapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer has been proposed to address chemotherapy resistance and cumulative toxicity. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown efficacy in this setting, and concurrent immune checkpoint blockade could offer synergistic tumour control. The aim of this study was to test the safety and antitumour activity of maintenance with PARP inhibition combined with immune checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who had a stable response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomised, phase 1b/2 study of niraparib plus anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) or anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer whose cancer had not progressed after at least 16 weeks of platinum-based therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via permuted block randomisation (block sizes 2 and 4) to niraparib 200 mg orally per day plus either nivolumab 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks (later changed to 480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks based on manufacturer update) or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for four doses. The primary endpoints were safety and progression-free survival at 6 months. Treatment groups were not compared for activity, which was assessed in each group against a clinically meaningful progression-free survival at 6 months of 44% (null hypothesis). Superiority of a treatment regimen could be declared if 6-month progression-free survival was 60%, and inferiority if 6-month progression-free survival was 27%. All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-treatment assessment of response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 were included in the efficacy population. The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03404960, and enrolment is completed and follow-up is ongoing.

Findings

91 patients were enrolled between Feb 7, 2018, and Oct 5, 2021 and were randomly assigned to niraparib plus nivolumab (n = 46) or niraparib plus ipilimumab (n = 45). Of these patients, 84 were evaluable for the progression-free survival endpoint (niraparib plus nivolumab = 44; niraparib plus ipilimumab = 40). Median follow-up was 23.0 months (IQR 15.0–31.5). 6-month progression-free survival was 20.6% (95% CI 8.3–32.9; p = 0.0002 vs the null hypothesis of 44%) in the niraparib plus nivolumab group; and 59.6% (44.3–74.9; p = 0.045) in the niraparib plus ipilimumab group. Ten (22%) of 46 patients in the niraparib plus nivolumab group and 23 (50%) of 45 patients in the niraparib plus ipilimumab group had a grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse event. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the niraparib plus nivolumab group were hypertension (in four [8%] patients), anaemia (two [4%]), and thrombocytopenia (two [4%]) whereas in the niraparib plus ipilimumab group these were fatigue (in six [14%]), anaemia (five [11%]), and hypertension (four [9%]). There were no treatment-related deaths.

Interpretation

The primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival was met in the niraparib plus ipilimumab maintenance group, whereas niraparib plus nivolumab yielded inferior progression-free survival. These findings highlight the potential for non-cytotoxic maintenance therapies in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Therapeutic developments in pancreatic cancer [^6dae1ac0]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a rising incidence and is one of the most lethal human malignancies. Much is known regarding the biology and pathophysiology of PDAC, but translating this knowledge to the clinic to improve patient outcomes has been challenging. In this Review, we discuss advances and practice-changing trials for PDAC. We briefly review therapeutic failures as well as ongoing research to refine the standard of care, including novel biomarkers and clinical trial designs. In addition, we highlight contemporary areas of research, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, KRAS-targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss the future of pancreatic cancer research and areas for improvement in the next decade.

### Radiation therapy with once-weekly gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer: current status of clinical trials [^195aa1f7]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical trials investigating a variety of gemcitabine-based chemoradiation therapy regimens were initiated several years ago and remain under active investigation for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. These trials are based, in part, on the activity of gemcitabine as a single agent in pancreatic cancer, preclinical studies that demonstrated radiosensitization, and the need for approaches with greater efficacy than that provided by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation therapy. In this review, we describe and compare several Phase I clinical trials investigating dose escalation of once-weekly gemcitabine with concurrent radiation therapy. We also describe a relatively novel approach successfully investigating radiation dose escalation with a standard weekly dose of gemcitabine. Toxicity data from this trial, and the prior trials of gemcitabine dose escalation with more conventional radiation therapy, suggest that the volume of normal tissue radiated in gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens may be the most critical consideration for future trial designs. Finally, we highlight the need to fully consider the design of future trials in the context of both local and distant disease control, given the radiosensitizing potential and systemic activity of gemcitabine.

### WITHDRAWN: chemotherapy and radiotherapy for inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer [^c59994b5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. The benefit of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both as a palliative treatment of advanced or relapsed disease is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in people with inoperable advanced disease.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases (UGPD) Group Trials Register (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 1); CANCERLIT (1975–2002); MEDLINE (1966 to January 2005); and EMBASE (1980 to January 2005). We handsearched reference lists from trials revealed by electronic searches to identify further relevant trials. We searched published abstracts from relevant conference proceedings. We contacted colleagues and experts in the field, and asked them to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (single- or double-blind) in patients with advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer, in which one of the intervention types (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) was contrasted with either placebo or another type of intervention. Studies comparing non-chemotherapy agents such as biological agents, hormones, immunostimulants, vaccines and cytokines were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality. Data were extracted by groups of two independent reviewers, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Study authors were contacted for more information.

Main Results

Fifty trials (7043 participants) were included. Chemotherapy significantly reduced the one-year mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.57, P value < 0.00001) when compared to best supportive care. Also, chemoradiation improved one year survival (0% versus 58%, P value 0.001) when compared to best supportive care. There was no significant difference in one-year mortality for 5FU alone versus 5FU combinations (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.30); single-agent chemotherapy versus gemcitabine (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.02, P value 0.17); or gemcitabine alone versus gemcitabine combinations (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). However, subgroup analysis showed that platinum-gemcitabine combinations reduced six-month mortality compared to gemcitabine alone (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81, P value 0.001). A qualitative overview suggested that chemoradiation produced better survivals than either best supportive care or radiotherapy. Chemoradiation treatment was associated with more toxicity.

Authors' Conclusions

Chemotherapy appears to prolong survival in people with advanced pancreatic cancer and can confer clinical benefits and improve quality of life. Combination chemotherapy did not improve overall survival compared to single-agent chemotherapy. Gemcitabine is an acceptable control arm for future trials investigating scheduling and combinations with novel agents. There is insufficient evidence to recommend chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer as a superior alternative to chemotherapy alone.

### Clinical research in pancreatic cancer: the radiation therapy oncology group trials [^0fb0acab]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2003). Low credibility.

To summarize the clinical research activities of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group program in the treatment of patients with locally advanced, as well as resected, pancreatic cancer. Phase II and III clinical trials are underway, examining novel cytotoxic and targeted agents with irradiation (RT) for patients with locally advanced and resected pancreatic cancer. A Phase II study incorporating concurrent paclitaxel with external beam radiotherapy in the locally advanced setting has been completed and recently analyzed. This experience has served as the foundation of a Phase II study using concurrent paclitaxel and gemcitabine with RT followed by R115777, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, as maintenance therapy. In the adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer, an Intergroup Phase III trial has compared "conventional" postoperative chemoirradiation (5-fluorouracil before, after, and during RT) and gemcitabine before and after RT (with 5-fluorouracil during RT). This study has recently closed, meeting its accrual goal. The successor study will evaluate the use of gemcitabine given concurrently with RT, as well as in a maintenance schedule. This report summarizes current and future Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials in the treatment of patients with localized pancreatic cancer.

### FAK-inhibition opens the door to checkpoint immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer [^ba7c0809]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
FAK inhibition reprograms the immuno-suppressive environment in pancreatic tumors rendering them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade. (1) Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma contains a highly fibrotic and immuno-suppressive microenvironment. (2) Inhibition of FAK kinase activity results in extensive remodeling of the fibrotic and immuno-suppressive tumor niche that results in a modest improvement in survival time. (3) Combining the effects of FAK inhibition with checkpoint blockade and gemcitabine chemotherapy results in a significant improvement in survival time and even long-term survival

FAK inhibition synergises with immune checkpoint blockade to improve survival time

In seeking to explore the therapeutic value of FAK-dependent changes in the immuno-suppressive tumour environment, Jiang and colleagues made excellent use of the KPC and KPPC GEM models of pancreatic cancer. These tumours did not respond to the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, reflecting the outcomes of clinical trials. However, combination with VS-4718, one of a number of FAK kinase inhibitors in clinical development, and gemcitabine, one of the standard of care chemotherapies for pancreatic cancer, led to a synergistic and significant anti-tumour response and even long-term survival of a small number of mice from the cohort receiving this treatment (Fig. 1). These results are extremely encouraging and further support the rationale for FAK/immunotherapy combinations to be tested in the clinic. Furthermore, they provide additional evidence that immunotherapy may yet work in pancreatic cancer, if the right combination of agents can be found. However, clinical translation of this 4-way combination may require to be staged in order to fully understand the contribution of each agent and the potential toxicity each will add. For example, it is already established that the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 can result in potentially severe immune-mediated side-effects that require careful clinical management, prompting exploration of de-escalated dosing and/or scheduling. Clinical trials combining anti-PD-1 with gemcitabine are already underway, and similar trials incorporating FAK inhibitors have either started or are due to start soon. This is the first time FAK inhibitors have been tested in combination with immunotherapy and the preclinical data are very encouraging. However, we do not yet know if this is the optimal combination. Future studies will need to address this in detail, both in terms of efficacy and tolerability, for translation to the clinic.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — nivolumab/ipilimumab in TMB-high tumors is a category 2B option with limited pancreatic-specific data. Checkmate 848, a randomized, open-label, phase II study, was conducted in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of TMB-high (TMB-H) and who were immunotherapy naive. ORR and survival outcomes with the combination improved in patients with TMB-H and who had manageable safety profiles. With limited data on pancreatic cancer, the Panel consensus resulted in nivolumab/ipilimumab being rated a category 2B, subsequent therapy option for patients with good or intermediate PS and those who did not receive prior immunotherapy.

Methods

Study design and treatment

CheckMate 032 (NCT01928394) was a multicenter, open-label, two-stage, phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The pancreatic cancer cohort enrolled patients at 16 sites in four countries (Finland, Spain, the UK, and the USA). Initially, the pancreatic cancer cohort had two arms: nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Enrolment in these two arms began in October 2013. Based on minimal activity observed in the nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy arms, the protocol (online supplemental file 2) was amended to include a third arm: nivolumab plus ipilimumab and cobimetinib (triplet therapy arm). Enrolment into the triplet therapy arm began in January 2017 (at sites in the USA only).

The original arms followed a modified Simon two-stage design to test whether nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab yielded an ORR that was of clinical interest in pancreatic cancer. Only treatment arms that met an ORR threshold of 10% progressed from stage 1 to stage 2; enrolment to stage 2 in a given treatment arm could continue even if the other treatment arm(s) were still at stage 1. After completion of enrolment of the initial 40 patients, additional patients could be assigned to the nivolumab monotherapy arm or nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination arm up to a total of 100 patients (including those from stage 1).

In the monotherapy arm, nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy was administered intravenously every 2 weeks. For combination therapy dose level 1, nivolumab 1 mg/kg intravenously and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously were administered every 3 weeks for four doses followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. For combination therapy dose level 2, nivolumab 1 mg/kg intravenously plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously were administered every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Patients in the nivolumab monotherapy arm who had confirmed progression were allowed to cross over to one of the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination arms.

### Novel therapies for pancreatic cancer [^82d1925d]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) unfortunately remains a highly fatal disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 11%. If surgical resection is not possible, systemic chemotherapy represents the standard-of-care approach to management. Combination chemotherapy regimens using fluorouracil (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and irinotecan; and fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine with albumin-bound paclitaxel have the potential to improve overall survival for patients with advanced disease. With the increasing understanding of the molecular drivers of pancreatic cancer, novel therapeutic approaches have made incremental progress for these patients. The molecular landscape of PDAC has been studied extensively. Approximately 90% of PDACs harbor mutations in the KRAS gene, a driver mutation that has long been considered undruggable. However, novel KRAS inhibitors have shown therapeutic promise in early-phase clinical trials, with larger studies ongoing. Less frequently encountered genomic aberrations that have therapeutic potential include NRG, BRAF, NTRK, HER2, BRCA, PALB2, and claudin. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have unfortunately yielded disappointing efficacy for the majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, except for those with tumors exhibiting deficiency in mismatch repair proteins. Alternative approaches to incorporate immunotherapy have shown more promise such as use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for selected patients in the maintenance setting and potential vaccine therapies in the postsurgery adjuvant setting. It is vital to perform molecular profiling in all patients with PDAC to identify potential treatment targets, and to enroll patients in clinical trials whenever possible.

### FOLFIRINOX for advanced pancreatic cancer: the princess margaret cancer centre experience [^9f846d5e]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal human cancers because of late presentation, early metastases and resistance of tumour cells to conventional treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy. It is the tenth most common cancer in both men and women in Canada; however it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in both sexes. Approximately 10% of patients are diagnosed with operable disease with a 5-year survival rate of around 20%. Unfortunately more than half of patients present with metastases, for which the 5-year survival is only 2%. Until recently, standard chemotherapy used in both adjuvant and palliative settings has been gemcitabine; however treatment with gemcitabine alone has low response rates and minimal effect on survival. Therefore improved chemotherapeutic or targeted therapy regimens are desperately needed.

Recently, two trials investigating combined chemotherapy use in metastatic PDA have reported encouraging results for improving overall survival (OS;). One of these trials used combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin). This was the first chemotherapy regimen tested against standard gemcitabine to significantly improve survival in metastatic PDA. This trial (ACCORD 11) revealed a median overall survival on FOLFIRINOX of 11.1 months compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine arm, producing the longest seen survival advantage observed in a phase III clinical trial for metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. Although there were higher rates of adverse events (AEs) on FOLFIRINOX, patients in this group also reported a better quality of life (QoL;). FOLFIRINOX has also been shown to be a more cost effective first-line treatment compared with first-line gemcitabine.

### Nivolumab monotherapy or combination with ipilimumab with or without cobimetinib in previously treated patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (checkMate 032) [^f05b60b8]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. It is the seventh-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In the USA, the incidence of pancreatic cancer between 2000 and 2019 increased by about 1% annually in both men and women, and over 62,000 new cases and nearly 50,000 deaths from pancreatic carcinoma were estimated in 2022; the 5-year relative survival rate is 12.5% for all pancreatic cancer stages combined. Given the poor survival rate, especially in the advanced or metastatic setting, there is a critical need to investigate and develop new therapeutic options for this malignancy.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab (a fully human monoclonal IgG4 programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody) and ipilimumab (a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody), have changed the treatment paradigm for several solid tumors; however, their clinical application in pancreatic cancer remains under investigation. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, limited activity has been observed with ipilimumab monotherapy and its combinations. In a study of patients with various tumor types who received pembrolizumab monotherapy, objective response rate (ORR) was 18% in 22 patients with advanced microsatellite instability high/mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/dMMR) pancreatic cancer, and median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.1 and 4.0 months, respectively. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, combination therapy with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and either pembrolizumabor nivolumabresulted in an ORR of 20% and 18%, respectively; median PFS of 9.1 and 5.5 months, respectively; and median OS of 15.0 and 9.9 months, respectively.

### Radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^b04c7ccc]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Emerging data/future directions — Pancreatic cancer clinical trials evaluating radiation therapy (RT) and systemic therapy are ongoing and may alter indications for RT. The ALLIANCE trial randomized patients to modified FOLFIRINOX times 8 cycles alone versus 7 cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX plus stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) consisting of 3300 cGy in 5 fractions to evaluate overall survival (OS) at 18 months, and its SBRT arm was closed to accrual. In a phase III adjuvant study, 493 patients were enrolled; with median follow up of 33.6 months, median OS was 35 months with adjuvant gemcitabine compared to 54.4 months in the modified FOLFIRINOX arm. PREOPANC-1 accrued 246 patients randomized to immediate surgery or preoperative chemoradiation; the preoperative regimen consisted of 3600 cGy in 15 fraction with concurrent gemcitabine 1000 mg/m², and for the primary endpoint of OS, median OS was 17.1 months in the chemoradiation arm compared to 13.5 months.

### A novel biweekly pancreatic cancer treatment schedule with gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid [^9f08883f]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most detrimental gastroenteric malignancies and the fourth–fifth leading cause of death from malignancies in Western countries. Radical surgery in the low-stage disease is considered the only chance of cure, but applies to less than 5% of the patients; unfortunately, the majority of them are in an advanced stage at the time of the diagnosis and only palliative therapies can be adopted with minimal or no impact on the survival which remains very poor.

Chemotherapy has long been considered largely ineffective, but a cautious optimism has recently been expressed since the discovery of new drugs such as gemcitabine (GEM), a fluorinated nucleoside, which used alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has been considered effective in terms of antitumour activity and palliation in these patients. Both 5-FU and GEM are fluoropyrimidine prodrugs that need to be converted to cytotoxic metabolites in the tumour cells in order to exert their antitumour activity; several authors have proposed that the two drugs may interact along their respective pathways of activation leading to a synergistic antitumour activity against a number of different malignancies (including pancreatic carcinoma) in vitro and in vivo, and for this reason the combination of the two drugs has been investigated in a number of clinical trials in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma. In previous studies of our groups, we demonstrated that GEM affects 5-FU pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and determines synergic antitumour activity in vitro. The results of a previous phase I–II clinical trial involving patients with different malignancies (including pancreas and colorectal cancer) suggested that the combination is active as a second-line chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

On these bases, we have designed the present phase II clinical trial in order to investigate the antitumour activity and toxicity of a novel biweekly schedule of treatment combining GEM, with 5-FU and FA (FUFA) in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.

### The association of drug-funding reimbursement with survival outcomes and use of new systemic therapies among patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [^1b36b061]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The cornerstone of treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer is palliative chemotherapy. Based on evidence from 3 randomized clinical trials, single-agent gemcitabine, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (GEMNAB), and fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)are the 3 most commonly used first-line palliative chemotherapy regimens.

The 3 randomized trials that demonstrated the efficacy of these agents all enrolled different patient populations. The trial evaluating gemcitabine monotherapy enrolled patients with symptomatic, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, up to age 79 years, with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of 50 to 80. The trial evaluating GEMNAB included patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, up to age 88 years, with a KPS of 70 or higher. The trial evaluating FOLFIRINOX included patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, up to age 76 years, who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 (approximately equal to a KPS of 90 to 100).

### Dendritic cell vaccination and CD40-agonist combination therapy licenses T cell-dependent antitumor immunity in a pancreatic carcinoma murine model [^9d63145e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Here, we investigated the efficacy of DC vaccination in a representative murine model of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We show that vaccination with mesothelioma lysate-loaded DCs yields tumor-specific immune responses against pancreatic cancer and decreases tumor progression. In established tumors, significant prolonged survival was only achieved when DC vaccination was combined with an agonistic CD40 antibody. Extensive analysis of the TME showed that whereas CD40-agonistic antibodies as monotherapy improved intratumoral T-cell infiltration, these cells displayed hallmarks of exhaustion. In the combination treatment, an improved T-cell phenotype lacking the high expression of various inhibitory receptors was observed. Therefore, CD40-agonistic antibody treatment may sensitize pancreatic tumors to tumor-specific immune responses induced by DC vaccination. These translational studies pave the way for future clinical trials investigating DC vaccination in occult disease or as part of combination immunotherapy in inoperable pancreatic cancer patients, some of which have already been initiated (REACtiVe Trial).

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — gemcitabine plus capecitabine: A randomized study in 533 patients with advanced disease found significantly improved progression-free survival and objective response rates with gemcitabine plus capecitabine compared with gemcitabine alone, but the trend toward overall survival improvement did not reach statistical significance and a meta-analysis that included two other studies showed significant survival benefit. Additional trials were mixed: a smaller phase III trial did not demonstrate an OS advantage for the overall population, although a post-hoc analysis showed significantly increased OS in patients with good PS; in another randomized phase III trial, despite greater ORR (43.7% vs. 17.6%, respectively; P = 0.001), gemcitabine with capecitabine did not significantly improve OS compared with gemcitabine alone; however, in a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs, OS was better with gemcitabine plus capecitabine than with gemcitabine alone (HR, 0.87; P = 0.03).

### Combination of bremachlorin PDT and immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 shows response in murine immunological T-cell-high and T-cell-low PDAC models [^c13ff2c9]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is currently at 12% in the United States. The most common form of this malignancy is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; ref.). Surgical resection remains the sole curative option for PDAC, but only a small percentage (about 20%) of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are eligible for this procedure. Furthermore, the long-established treatment options that are still in use have made very little progress in improving outcomes, reflecting the treatment-resistant nature of PDAC. Given the poor therapeutic outcomes of existing treatments, there has been considerable research interest in recent years in developing immunotherapies as an alternative, more effective cancer treatment option for PDAC. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are very effective for certain cancer types, very little improvement has been observed in solid tumors such as pancreatic cancer. The main reason for this is that pancreatic cancer is considered immunologically "cold", meaning that this tumor type has extremely low, or nonexistent, amounts of infiltrating T cells and a high amount of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In addition, immunologically "cold" tumors possess little mutational load in tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME; refs.). Overall, in clinical trials treating PDAC, little or no response has been documented with single or combination ICIs such as those targeting PD-1, its ligand PD-L1, or CTLA-4.

### Current status of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers [^5a06416e]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), or programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) has revolutionized the treatment strategy in various types of cancers. In addition, recent studies have revealed that tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) status and tumor mutation burden (TMB) contribute significantly to the therapeutic response to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), which led to an accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for the treatment of MSI-high or mismatch-repair-deficient solid tumors after conventional chemotherapies in 2017 and for the treatment of TMB-high solid tumors in 2020 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the field of gastrointestinal cancers, many clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of various regimens such as ICI monotherapy, the combination of anti-CTLA-4 mAb and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb, and combination of ICI and conventional chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor have been reported or are in progress. This review summarizes MSI status and TMB in gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers, and provides the results of most relevant clinical trials evaluating ICIs. We also discuss the development of biomarkers required for improving the selection of patients with a high probability of benefiting from treatment with ICIs, and potential therapeutic strategies that could help to enhance anticancer responses of ICIs.

### Chemoradiotherapy with concurrent gemcitabine and cisplatin with or without sequential chemotherapy with gemcitabine / cisplatin vs chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer – a multi-centre randomised phase II study [^82409406]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains a disease with a dismal prognosis: in 2008, 37 680 estimated new cases were diagnosed in the United States, with a nearly identical rate of estimated deaths (34 290) from pancreatic cancer. Since the introduction of the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine, several phase III trials have evaluated the role of a gemcitabine-containing combination treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. So far, only the combination of gemcitabine with the anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib provided a survival benefit compared to single-agent gemcitabine. Promising efficacy results were also obtained with cytotoxic combinations of gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine or a platinum analogue.

Most of the palliative phase III trials that were conducted during the last decade included both patients with non-resectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, based on post hoc subgroup analyses it became evident that LAPC may be characterised by a different disease biology than metastatic pancreatic cancer: patients with LAPC showed a prolonged survival (about 10 months) and in several studies, they obtained no survival benefit from combination chemotherapy (compared to gemcitabine alone). Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) also has been investigated widely in patients with LAPC; were among the first to introduce gemcitabine in CRT protocols for LAPC treatment. Subsequently, several other groups also conducted phase I and II clinical trials to improve CRT protocols for LAPC by including newer cytotoxic agents such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin as concurrent radiosensitising agents in their radiotherapy regimens. More recently, the final results from the first randomised trial comparing systemic chemotherapy alone with CRT (followed by maintenance chemotherapy) in LAPC were reported by: overall survival (OS), the primary study end point, was shorter in the CRT arm (8.6 months) than in the gemcitabine chemotherapy arm (13 months, P = 0.03;). In contrast, the preliminary results of a phase III trial (E4201) comparing gemcitabine in combination with radiotherapy vs gemcitabine alone in LAPC suggested a survival benefit for patients in the radiotherapy arm (11 vs 9.2 months). However, this study with 74 patients was terminated prematurely due to low accrual (targeted sample size, 316), and significant grade 3/4 toxicities were observed in both the arms.

### Current status of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers [^2b30d211]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The development of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has made a breakthrough in the treatment strategies of various cancer types. Immune checkpoints play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity by inhibiting the excessive activation of T cells. However, during the carcinogenic process, immune checkpoint mechanisms are often activated to suppress an anti-tumor immune response, which has led to the development of ICIs. Since an initiation of the first clinical trial of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab in 2000 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) mAb nivolumab in 2006, several mAbs targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, or programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat various types of cancers. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) status and tumor mutation burden (TMB) contribute significantly to the therapeutic response to ICI. The FDA granted accelerated approval to anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-high (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair-deficient (dMMR) solid tumors after prior conventional chemotherapies in 2017, and for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-high (TMB-H) solid tumors in 2020. In the field of gastrointestinal cancers, many clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of various regimens such as ICI monotherapy, the combination of anti-CTLA-4 mAb and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb, and combination of ICI and conventional chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) have been reported or are in progress. In the present manuscript, we review the MSI status and TMB in gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic cancers, report on the results of relevant clinical trials evaluating ICIs, and summarize the prospects of more effective treatment by combining ICI and other therapeutic agents.
