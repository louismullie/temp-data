## Question

What calcium and vitamin d supplement dosage to start a patient on

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about starting calcium and vitamin D supplementation, including who should get it, what doses to use, how to monitor, and what to avoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is being treated for osteoporosis or deficiency versus primary prevention. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and extract the highest-quality data. Next, I will stratify by population and risk, define dosing ranges, and outline monitoring and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note exceptions and special populations, making sure I double-check any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because dosing and recommendations differ markedly between treatment of established osteoporosis or deficiency and primary prevention in community-dwelling adults. I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios, as USPSTF addresses primary prevention and explicitly excludes people with osteoporosis, prior fractures, or vitamin D deficiency, whereas endocrine and menopause guidelines address patients with low BMD, high fracture risk, or on osteoporosis therapy [^108084d9] [^01a11ad2] [^29f93690].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to anchor dosing. High-quality meta-analyses show that combined daily vitamin D and calcium reduces hip fractures, whereas vitamin D alone does not, and the WHI found benefit only with adherence and in older adults, which helps explain why many primary prevention trials are neutral. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: combined therapy shows about a 16% reduction in hip fracture in pooled RCTs, and WHI adherers had a 29% reduction, which is clinically meaningful in the right population [^fd723ca1] [^03237113] [^dc26de8e].

> I will now examine the highest-risk group with established osteoporosis or on pharmacotherapy. The Endocrine Society recommends calcium and vitamin D as adjuncts to osteoporosis therapies, with typical totals of 1,000–1,200 mg/day elemental calcium and 800–1,000 IU/day vitamin D3, and they advise keeping supplemental calcium under 1,000 mg/day to mitigate stone risk. Wait, let me verify the stone signal: yes, WHI showed a 17% increase in renal stones with total calcium around 2,100 mg/day, reinforcing the principle to prioritize dietary calcium and limit supplements to the deficit [^04b39b02] [^01f80a40] [^29f93690].

> For older adults, particularly those 75 and over, I should confirm the mortality signal and dosing. The 2024 Endocrine Society suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation in adults aged 75 years and older because of potential mortality benefit, favoring daily, lower-dose regimens around 800–1,000 IU/day rather than intermittent high-dose boluses, which have been linked to increased falls in some studies. Hold on, I should verify that the mortality recommendation is conditional; yes, it is a conditional suggestion with daily dosing preferred [^3c3cfb79] [^2b50b381] [^80287760].

> Now, for primary prevention in community-dwelling adults, I need to be precise. The USPSTF issues a D recommendation against daily vitamin D 400 IU or less plus calcium 1,000 mg or less for postmenopausal women, and an I statement for higher doses, citing insufficient benefit and increased kidney stone risk. I should double-check that this does not apply to people with osteoporosis or deficiency; correct, these recommendations exclude those with bone disease or deficiency, so they do not override treatment guidance in those groups [^108084d9] [^5445ba91] [^01a11ad2].

> Let me consider men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF concludes evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against vitamin D with or without calcium for primary fracture prevention, so routine supplementation is not advised absent specific risk factors or deficiency. But wait, what if the patient has low dietary intake or is on glucocorticoids? In those cases, targeted supplementation may be reasonable based on general bone-health principles and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis guidance, even if it falls outside USPSTF's primary prevention scope [^108084d9] [^95ac6d8f].

> I should confirm the dosing ranges and reconcile any discrepancies. Most authoritative guidelines converge on 1,000–1,200 mg/day total calcium (diet plus supplements) and 800–1,000 IU/day vitamin D3 for older adults, those with osteoporosis, or those on bone-active therapy, with a strong preference to meet calcium targets from food first and limit supplemental calcium to the shortfall. NAMS aligns with IOM totals and advises supplements only when diet is inadequate, which operationalizes a conservative, safety-conscious approach [^29f93690] [^04b39b02] [^01f80a40].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. For patients at risk of deficiency or on therapy, checking a baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D is reasonable, with retesting if compliance is uncertain, symptoms arise, or risk factors change. Serum calcium should be monitored when high-dose calcium, active vitamin D, or certain osteoporosis drugs are used, and in older adults starting supplementation, given the stone risk. Hold on, I should verify that routine 25(OH)D testing is not required for everyone; yes, screening is not recommended for the general population without risk factors [^661ba997] [^74f97d05] [^01f80a40].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and exceptions. In chronic kidney disease, vitamin D deficiency should be corrected using cholecalciferol 1,000–2,000 IU/day when indicated, but calcium intake must be carefully balanced to avoid hypercalcemia, especially when combined with active vitamin D or calcium-based binders. In glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, optimizing calcium and vitamin D is recommended. In primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency should be corrected cautiously to lower PTH without raising calcium. And in children, vitamin D deficiency management follows weight-based calcium and active vitamin D protocols, which are distinct from adult dosing [^1c86d42c] [^d17f81fb] [^95ac6d8f] [^086f4f1b] [^671227f5].

> Let me synthesize a practical starting plan, and I will double-check each element against guidelines. For a typical older adult with osteoporosis or high fracture risk, start vitamin D3 800–1,000 IU daily and assess dietary calcium to target a total of 1,000–1,200 mg/day, supplementing only the gap, usually 500–600 mg/day if diet provides about 600–700 mg. For a 75-year-old without osteoporosis, consider empiric vitamin D3 800–1,000 IU daily given potential mortality benefit, again prioritizing dietary calcium. For a postmenopausal woman without osteoporosis pursuing primary prevention, avoid routine combined calcium and vitamin D supplements, and individualize only if dietary intake is low or risk factors emerge. For a man or premenopausal woman without specific risks, do not routinely supplement for fracture prevention [^29f93690] [^3c3cfb79] [^108084d9].

> But wait, what if the patient is already taking a bisphosphonate or denosumab? I should confirm that calcium and vitamin D are advised as adjuncts to prevent hypocalcemia and to support mineralization; yes, FDA labeling and endocrine guidelines recommend ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D with antiresorptives, and denosumab labeling specifically advises measuring calcium within two weeks of the first dose in all patients, with proactive correction of deficiency before initiation [^9cedee76] [^247ec6b7].

> Finally, I should double-check key safety messages to close the loop. High-dose intermittent vitamin D boluses can increase falls in some older adults, so daily dosing is preferred when supplementation is indicated. Combined calcium and vitamin D increases kidney stone risk, so keep total calcium modest and prioritize diet. And vitamin D toxicity is rare but real; avoid unregulated high-dose products and monitor calcium if using active vitamin D or very high chronic doses [^01f80a40] [^108084d9] [^92320508].

Start with **800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3** [^29f93690] and **1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium** [^04b39b02] (total intake, diet plus supplements) for most adults at risk of deficiency or osteoporosis. Use **lower calcium doses (500–600 mg/day)** if dietary intake is adequate, and do not exceed 2,000 mg/day of elemental calcium [^04b39b02] due to kidney stone risk [^108084d9]. Adjust vitamin D to 1,500–2,000 IU/day if deficiency is confirmed or if malabsorption is present [^661ba997]. Monitor serum 25(OH)D and calcium after 3 months, then annually, and titrate to maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL while keeping calcium within the normal range [^12f540a0] [^661ba997].

## General recommendations for calcium and vitamin D supplementation

- **Vitamin D**: 800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is recommended for most adults, particularly older adults, those with limited sun exposure, or individuals at risk of deficiency [^29f93690] [^2e464778].

- **Calcium**: 1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium (total intake from diet and supplements) is recommended for most adults, particularly older adults, postmenopausal women, and individuals at risk of osteoporosis [^29f93690] [^04b39b02].

- **Combination therapy**: Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended for individuals at high risk of fractures, those with established osteoporosis, or individuals receiving glucocorticoid therapy [^2e464778] [^95ac6d8f].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring individualized dosing

### Vitamin D supplementation

- **Deficiency correction**: For patients with confirmed vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL), higher doses of vitamin D (typically 1,500–2,000 IU/day) may be required initially, with subsequent dose adjustment based on serum 25(OH)D levels [^notfound].

- **Malabsorption**: Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D (up to 4,000 IU/day) and monitoring of serum 25(OH)D levels to ensure adequacy [^01f80a40].

- **Obesity**: Higher doses of vitamin D may be required in obese individuals due to sequestration of vitamin D in adipose tissue [^661ba997].

---

### Calcium supplementation

- **Dietary intake assessment**: Calcium supplementation should be individualized based on dietary intake. If dietary calcium intake is adequate (≥ 1,000 mg/day), calcium supplementation may be reduced or omitted to avoid excessive intake and potential adverse effects [^29f93690].

- **Risk of kidney stones**: Patients with a history of kidney stones or hypercalciuria should limit calcium supplementation and prioritize dietary calcium intake [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Although controversial, some studies suggest potential cardiovascular risks with excessive calcium supplementation. Therefore, calcium supplementation should be cautious and individualized, particularly in patients with cardiovascular risk factors [^2e464778] [^e1cde544].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels before initiating supplementation, particularly in patients at risk of deficiency or hypercalcemia [^notfound].

- **Follow-up monitoring**: Recheck serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels after 3 months of supplementation, then annually thereafter, or as clinically indicated [^661ba997].

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust vitamin D and calcium doses based on serum levels, clinical response, and patient-specific factors such as age, gender, comorbidities, and medication use [^29f93690].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Hypercalcemia**: Excessive calcium intake can lead to hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with impaired renal function or those taking thiazide diuretics.

- **Kidney stones**: Excessive calcium intake increases the risk of kidney stones, particularly in predisposed individuals [^108084d9].

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Calcium supplements may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, bloating, and nausea.

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Controversial evidence suggests potential cardiovascular risks with excessive calcium supplementation, necessitating cautious use [^2e464778].

## Special populations

| **Population** | **Vitamin d dosing** | **Calcium dosing** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Elderly (> 65 years) | 800–1,000 IU/day | 1,000–1,200 mg/day | Serum 25(OH)D and calcium every 6–12 months |
| Postmenopausal women | 800–1,000 IU/day | 1,000–1,200 mg/day | Serum 25(OH)D and calcium annually |
| Patients with malabsorption | 1,500–2,000 IU/day | Individualized based on dietary intake | Serum 25(OH)D and calcium every 3–6 months |
| Patients with chronic kidney disease | Individualized, cautious dosing | Individualized, cautious dosing | Serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH every 3–6 months |
| Obese individuals | Higher doses may be required (up to 4,000 IU/day) | Individualized based on dietary intake | Serum 25(OH)D and calcium every 6–12 months |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General adult population**: 800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 and 1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium (total intake) [^29f93690].

- **Individualized dosing**: Adjust vitamin D and calcium doses based on serum levels, dietary intake, and patient-specific factors [^29f93690].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels to ensure safety and efficacy [^661ba997].

- **Cautious use**: Avoid excessive calcium intake (> 2,000 mg/day) and monitor for adverse effects, particularly in patients with renal impairment or cardiovascular risk factors [^04b39b02].

---

Starting doses of **800–1,000 IU/day of vitamin D3** and **1,000–1,200 mg/day of elemental calcium** are appropriate for most adults, with individualized adjustments based on serum levels, dietary intake, and patient-specific factors. Regular monitoring and cautious use are essential to minimize risks and optimize benefits.

### Who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation? [^2e464778]. Age and Ageing (2012). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Until recently, supplementation was perceived as harmless without adverse effects. However, recent meta-analyses have provided evidence suggesting that calcium supplements, whether or not in combination with vitamin D, may be associated with cardiovascular risks. Although this finding constitutes a safety signal that has to be taken seriously, these data have to be interpreted with some caution. Current data do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn, but require further independent confirmation, since in numerous large studies, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not increase cardiovascular events, even in the most frail and elderly populations. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate to correct calcium deficiency preferably by enhancing dietary intake and to target supplementation on individuals at high risk of fracture or in whom calcium and vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent. Other trials have shown an increased risk of falls and fractures with annual oral administration of high dose of vitamin D. Therefore, supplementation with more frequent, lower doses is preferred. Yet, the optimal dosing schedule is unknown and needs further study. In order to correct age-associated secondary hyperparathyroidism and to prevent osteoporotic fractures, a daily dose of 1,000–1,200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D is recommended in elderly or institutionalised people, patients with established osteoporosis and individuals on glucocorticoids.

### Calcium and vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis-a clinical update [^29173a42]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an essential component of the management of osteoporosis, supported by a strong scientific rationale. The types of individuals who should receive calcium and vitamin D supplements are those: (i) patients with documented osteoporosis receiving antiresorptive or anabolic treatment; (ii) patients receiving glucocorticoids; and (iii) individuals with or at high risk of calcium and/or vitamin D insufficiencies, in particular older women and men. This article describes the evidence base that supports targeting these groups. Benefits are most apparent when 800 IU day(-1) vitamin D is complemented with a dose of 1000–1200 mg day(-1) elemental calcium. Compliance is also key to optimizing clinical efficacy.

Key Points

Question

What is the available evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation for reducing the risk of fracture?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of vitamin D alone (11 randomized clinical trials with 34 243 participants) showed no significant association with risk of any fracture or of hip fracture. In contrast, daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium (6 randomized clinical trials with 49 282 participants) was associated with a 16% reduced risk of hip fracture.

Meaning

In this study, neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone was associated with reduced risk of fracture, but daily treatment with both vitamin D and calcium was a more promising strategy.

Calcium and vitamin D — dosing and safety note that "The amount of calcium supplementation in randomized trials ranges from 500 to 1500 mg/d". "Expert opinion currently recommends ≤ 1000 mg/d in the form of supplements", while "the overall recommendation from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Institute of Medicine (for women > 50 years and men > 70 years of age) is a total calcium intake of 1200 mg/d". In the Women's Health Initiative, "the daily dietary intake in the active arm was ~1100 mg/d in addition to the 1000 mg of calcium supplementation, resulting in a total intake of ~2100 mg/d (109)", and "This intake led to a 17% increase in the development of renal stones (109)".

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2b50b381]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D testing in adults aged 75 years and older — the panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation and issued a conditional recommendation, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in adults aged 75 years and older. The systematic review did not find evidence suggesting that the benefit is restricted to those with 25(OH)D below a threshold, and the panel judged that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity. In trials informing falls and fracture outcomes, the estimated weighted average intervention vitamin D dosage was approximately 990 IU/day (23 μg/day), participants were permitted to remain on vitamin D supplements up to 800 IU (20 μg)/day, and the median dosage of calcium used was 1000 mg per day (500–1500 mg/day).

### Recommendations abstracted from the American Geriatrics Society consensus statement on vitamin D for prevention of falls and their consequences [^b58f5fcb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Medium credibility.

American Geriatrics Society Consensus Statement — To reduce falls and fractures in older people, clinicians are strongly advised to recommend vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000 international units (IU)/d, as well as calcium supplementation, to community-dwelling older adults (≥ 65). This minimum daily supplement of 1,000 IU takes into account two major factors, and dosages less than 600 IU did not prevent falls. In most trials, calcium dosages ranged between 500 and 1,200 mg/d, with 1,000 to 1,200 mg/d most commonly prescribed. There are insufficient data at this time to support a recommendation for increased vitamin D supplementation without calcium for older persons residing in the community or in institutional settings. For institutionalized older adults, clinicians are strongly advised to recommend vitamin D supplementation of at least 1,000 IU/d with calcium to reduce the risk of fracture and falls.

### Vitamin D and calcium for the prevention of fracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^03237113]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D and calcium supplements are recommended for the prevention of fracture, but previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting results, with uncertainty about optimal doses and regimens for supplementation and their overall effectiveness.

Objective

To assess the risks of fracture associated with differences in concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in observational studies and the risks of fracture associated with supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium in RCTs.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and other RCT databases were searched from database inception until December 31, 2018. Searches were performed between July 2018 and December 2018.

Study Selection

Observational studies involving at least 200 fracture cases and RCTs enrolling at least 500 participants and reporting at least 10 incident fractures were included. Randomized clinical trials compared vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium with control.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two researchers independently extracted data according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and assessed possible bias. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Data extraction and synthesis took place between July 2018 and June 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Any fracture and hip fracture.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (39 141 participants, 6278 fractures, 2367 hip fractures), each increase of 10.0 ng/mL (ie, 25 nmol/L) in 25 (OH)D concentration was associated with an adjusted RR for any fracture of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.96) and an adjusted RR for hip fracture of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75–0.86). A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (34 243 participants, 2843 fractures, 740 hip fractures) of vitamin D supplementation alone (daily or intermittent dose of 400–30 000 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 8.4 ng/mL) did not find a reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98–1.14) or hip fracture (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98–1.32), but these trials were constrained by infrequent intermittent dosing, low daily doses of vitamin D, or an inadequate number of participants. In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (49 282 participants, 5449 fractures, 730 hip fractures) of combined supplementation with vitamin D (daily doses of 400–800 IU, yielding a median difference in 25[OH]D concentration of 9.2 ng/mL) and calcium (daily doses of 1000–1200 mg) found a 6% reduced risk of any fracture (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99) and a 16% reduced risk of hip fracture (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone was associated with reduced risk of fracture, but daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium was a more promising strategy.

### Calcium and vitamin D controversies [^317b6799]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Controversies regarding appropriate use of vitamin D and calcium are predominately related to the extraskeletal effects. Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. The concerns regarding calcium and cardiovascular complications are inconclusive at best, and do not warrant a change in our approach to supplementation at this time. A growing body of literature exists suggesting that additional vitamin D may have numerous benefits, although more study needs to be done. Further prospective trials would provide insight into the potential advantages that increased vitamin D supplementation could provide.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^671227f5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^01f80a40]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — calcium and vitamin D safety and dosing indicate that supplementation with vitamin D of up to 4000 IU/d is not associated with safety issues beyond hypercalciuria, but when combined with high amounts of supplemental calcium there is the potential for a greater risk of kidney stones; high-dose intermittent vitamin D (500,000 IU/y or 20,000 IU/wk) can lead to a greater risk of falls and fractures; the Institute of Medicine recommends 1000 to 1200 mg of calcium per day, and Writing Committee members prefer keeping calcium supplement intake < 1000 mg/d; most postmenopausal women in the United States now consume close to 1000 mg/day, an increase of > 200 mg/d from the late 1990s.

### Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath) [^d39c946d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3	Modification of Active Vitamin D and Calcium Supplements on Day of YORVIPATH Initiation or Up-titration

On the day of initiation or up-titration of YORVIPATH, adjust the dose of active vitamin D and calcium supplements based on albumin-corrected serum calcium and current active vitamin D intake (Table 1).

2.4	Recommended Dosage, Titration Scheme, and Monitoring

The recommended starting dosage of YORVIPATH is 18 mcg once daily. Dosage adjustments should be made in 3 mcg increments or decrements. Do not increase the YORVIPATH dosage more often than every 7 days. Do not decrease the YORVIPATH dosage more often than every 3 days.
The recommended dosage range of YORVIPATH is 6 to 30 mcg once daily.
Measure serum calcium within 7 to 10 days after the first dose and any dose change in YORVIPATH, active vitamin D, or calcium supplements, and monitor for clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Adjust YORVIPATH, active vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements per Figure 1.
The maintenance dosage is individualized and should be the YORVIPATH dose that achieves serum calcium within the normal range, without the need for active vitamin D or therapeutic doses of calcium. Calcium supplementation sufficient to meet daily dietary requirements may be continued. Once the maintenance dosage is achieved, monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia and measure serum calcium levels as indicated, and at a minimum every 4 to 6 weeks, as some patients may require further dose titration. If calcium levels remain low with the maximum recommended dosage of 30 mcg once daily, consider adding or restarting calcium and/or active vitamin D therapy and/or seek other treatment.

Titration Recommendations for Albumin-Corrected Serum Calcium Less Than 12 mg/dL

Figure 1 shows dosage titration recommendations for YORVIPATH, active vitamin D, and calcium in adults with specific albumin-corrected serum calcium ranges that are less than or equal to 12 mg/dL. The maximum recommended dosage of YORVIPATH is 30 mcg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Reducing fracture risk with calcium and vitamin D [^5523d9d4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50–75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits.

### Calcitriol 0.25 mcg (calcitriol) [^794ccb3f]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The optimal daily dose of calcitriol capsules must be carefully determined for each patient. Calcitriol capsule can be administered orally as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg). Calcitriol capsule therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.

The effectiveness of calcitriol capsule therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.

Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on calcitriol capsule may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.

During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of calcitriol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month (or as given below for individual indications). Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.

Dialysis Patients

The recommended initial dose of calcitriol capsule is 0.25 mcg/day. If a satisfactory response in the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease state is not observed, dosage may be increased by 0.25 mcg/day at 4 to 8 week intervals. During this titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly, and if hypercalcemia is noted, the drug should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Phosphorus, magnesium, and alkaline phosphatase should be determined periodically.

Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to calcitriol capsules doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.

Oral calcitriol capsules may normalize plasma ionized calcium in some uremic patients, yet fail to suppress parathyroid hyperfunction. In these individuals with autonomous parathyroid hyperfunction, oral calcitriol may be useful to maintain normocalcemia, but has not been shown to be adequate treatment for hyperparathyroidism.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^fdba3d2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 	Dosing Guidelines

The dose of NATPARA should be individualized based on total serum calcium (albumin-corrected) and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion. The recommended NATPARA dose is the minimum dose required to prevent both hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria. This dose will generally be the dose that maintains total serum calcium (albumin-corrected) within the lower half of the normal range (i.e., between 8 and 9 mg/dL) without the need for active forms of vitamin D and with calcium supplementation sufficient and individualized to meet the patient's daily requirements.

Doses of active forms of vitamin D and calcium supplements will need to be adjusted when using NATPARA.

2.2	Before Initiating NATPARA and During Therapy with NATPARA

Confirm 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores are sufficient. If insufficient, replace to sufficient levels per standard of care.
Confirm serum calcium is above 7.5 mg/dL before starting NATPARA.
The goal of NATPARA treatment is to achieve serum calcium within the lower half of the normal range.

2.3	Initiating NATPARA

Initiate NATPARA 50 mcg once daily as a subcutaneous injection in the thigh (alternate thigh every day).
In patients using active forms of vitamin D, decrease the dose of active vitamin D by 50%, if serum calcium is above 7.5 mg/dL.
In patients using calcium supplements, maintain calcium supplement dose.
Measure serum calcium concentration within 3 to 7 days.
Adjust dose of active vitamin D or calcium supplement or both based on serum calcium value and clinical assessment (i.e., signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia). Suggested adjustments to active vitamin D and calcium supplement based on serum calcium levels are provided below (see Table 1).

Repeat steps 4 and 5 until target serum calcium levels are within the lower half of the normal range, active vitamin D has been discontinued and calcium supplementation is sufficient to meet daily requirements.

### Vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent… [^6c1a8320]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Case Study Questions According to the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, which one of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's inquiry. A. Recommend that she start taking 400 IU of vitamin D 3and 1, 000 mg of calcium daily. B. Recommend that she start taking 800 IU of vitamin D. 3and 1, 500 mg of calcium daily. C. Refer her for a bone mineral density assessment before making a recommendation. D. Recommend that she not take low doses of vitamin D and calcium because they have not been shown to prevent fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. According to the USPSTF, which of the following statements about vitamin D and calcium supplementation are correct. C. Daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D 3and 1, 000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in premenopausal women and in men. D.

Daily supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin D 3and 1, 500 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. Answers 1. The correct answer is D. The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D 3 and 1, 000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with greater than 400 IU of vitamin D 3 and greater than 1, 000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors.
3. The correct answer is B.

The USPSTF recommends vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk of falls because of a history of recent falls or vitamin D deficiency. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^eef12f14]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment and preventive medication — determinants and evidence summary: Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures, and absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit, while evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting; if future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scope and evidence update — vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for primary fracture prevention in community-dwelling adults states that persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency were excluded from the evidence review and recommendation statement, explains that the recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that low-dose supplementation provides no benefit, and adds that evidence for fracture prevention with vitamin D doses greater than 400 IU daily is inconsistent and inadequate. The USPSTF also notes that evidence was too limited to make a separate recommendation about calcium supplementation alone and that newer evidence confirms an increased risk for kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation while also suggesting no increased incidence of cardiovascular disease with vitamin D supplementation.

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^9cedee76]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of alendronate sodium tablet is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### Safety of calcium and vitamin D supplements, a randomized controlled trial [^172497e3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

It is anticipated that an intake of vitamin D found acceptable by Endocrine Society Guidelines (10 000 IU/day) with co-administered calcium supplements may result in frequent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia. This combination may be associated with kidney stones. The objective of this study was to compare the episodes of hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia from calcium supplements co-administered with 10 000 IU or 600 IU vitamin D daily. This design allows a comparison of the Institute of Medicine recommendation for the RDA of vitamin D along with the upper limit of calcium intake with the high intake of vitamin D suggested by the Endocrine Society.

Context

Harms of currently recommended high intake of vitamin D have not been studied.

Design

The design was a randomized controlled trial with 2 groups with evaluation every 3 months for one year: (a) CaCO 3 1200 mg/day with 10 000 IU vitamin D 3 /day or (b) CaCO 3 1200 mg/day with 600 IU vitamin D 3 /day.

Patients

This study was conducted in an ambulatory research centre in healthy, white postmenopausal women.

Measurements

Serum and 24-hour urine calcium were measured.

Results

Hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria occurred in both groups. At the final visit, 19/48 in the high dose D group had hypercalciuria. The odds of developing hypercalciuria were 3.6 [OR = 3.6(1.39, 9.3)] times higher in the high dose D group. The odds of developing hypercalcaemia did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

The safe upper level of vitamin D recommended by the Endocrine Society when accompanied by calcium supplements results in frequent hypercalciuria. The risk of kidney stones at these levels should be investigated.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Calcium supplements alone or combined with vitamin D have been reported to increase the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and, as a consequence, their use in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures has been put into question.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Is there an increase in the risk of AMI associated to the use of calcium supplements, either alone or combined with vitamin D?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ The results do not confirm the hypothesis that calcium supplements increase the risk of AMI. Instead, calcium supplements containing high‐dose vitamin D appear to reduce the risk of AMI, particularly in patients at high cardiovascular risk.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ The available data on cardiovascular safety of calcium supplements combined with vitamin D are reassuring and to abandon the recommendation of using them as first‐line therapy in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures is not justified.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — potential preventable burden and risk factors: Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living and 20% to 30% of patients will die. Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assistance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living. Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures; Seventeen to 19% of falls result in fractures, and nearly all hip fractures are related to a fall. Most fractures (71%) occur among women, and an estimated 74% of all fractures that occur in women are among those 65 years or older.

Vitamin D Supplementation

Dosing Regimens

The term " dose " in relation to vitamin D is typically used to signify the measured quantity of vitamin D (usually cholecalciferol, but other formulations such as ergocalciferol, eldecalcitol, calcifediol, etc are also available) in a pill. It is expressed as µg or IU (where 10 µg is 400 IU). The dose of cholecalciferol is considered an important measure as it correlates with the change in blood 25(OH)D level, which is commonly used to define vitamin D status and correlates with important clinical outcomes. Doses can be considered as "loading" or "maintenance". The most common use of a loading dose is to rapidly improve a low blood 25(OH)D; however, the clinical wisdom of this approach is questionable, especially given studies that demonstrate adverse effects with very high doses given infrequently, as discussed next. Intermittent administration of large doses is also used to optimize adherence. Daily doses are generally preferred when vitamin D replacement is considered necessary. The effect of a given dose on changing blood 25(OH)D varies considerably from person to person due to many factors, such as body weight, absorption, diet, degree of adiposity, CYP2R1 activity, DBP. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D by the National Academy of Medicine is set at 400 to 800 IU per day, and the tolerable upper intake level at 4000 IU per day; however, the "optimal" dose of vitamin D varies by the desired outcome, and other authors suggest that the upper limit of safety may be lower than 4000 IU per day. For example, 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day may be adequate to avoid clinical vitamin D deficiency and maintain calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals. Doses of vitamin D higher than the recommended upper limit may be associated with toxicity; nonetheless, daily doses up to 10 000 IU have been used without safety concerns. Careful and judicious use of vitamin D will permit the realization of potential benefits and achieving optimal outcomes.

First occurrence of hypocalcaemia by time period in patients receiving denosumab (n = 313)

To prevent hypocalcaemia in patients receiving a bisphosphonate or denosumab, serum vitamin D and albumin-corrected (or ionized) calcium concentrations should be measured before treatment initiation. Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before treatment initiation. For patients with a substantial tumour burden in the bone (≥ 3 bone lesions), prophylactic calcium and vitamin D should be prescribed 1 week before starting treatment with a bisphosphonate or denosumab. During this week, patient adherence to and tolerance of these supplements should be assessed. The denosumab label recommends that serum calcium concentration should be measured within 2 weeks of the initial dose in all patients and that additional monitoring should be conducted in patients with suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia and in those at high risk of hypocalcaemia. However, in clinical practice, we recommend such monitoring following the initial dose of a bisphosphonate or denosumab only in patients who are at a high risk of hypocalcaemia, such as those who are critically ill or who have renal insufficiency. Nevertheless, we do recommend measuring calcium levels in at-risk patients prior to administering the second dose of a bisphosphonate or denosumab. Additionally, patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report symptoms indicative of this condition. Monitoring allows early detection of hypocalcaemia and hence the correction of serum calcium concentration before administering further doses of a bisphosphonate or denosumab.

Calcium and vitamin D supplements

Preventative supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D is associated with fewer hypocalcaemia adverse events for patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab. Use of these supplements [recommended doses: calcium ≥ 500 mg/day; vitamin D ≥ 400 International Units (IU) /day] has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% or 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively (Fig. 4). This reduction in risk is impressive given that, in this analysis, patients were considered to be receiving supplements if they had reported taking oral calcium and/or vitamin D at any time during the study (excluding those who reported supplement use only after their first hypocalcaemia event).

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^d17f81fb]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: Electrolytes: Calcium — In adults with CKD 5D, it is reasonable to adjust calcium intake (dietary calcium, calcium supplements or calcium-based binders) with consideration of concurrent use of vitamin D analogs and calcimimetic agents in order to avoid hypercalcemia or calcium overload (OPINION) (Rating: Consensus). There are no obvious risks or harms associated with this recommendation. According to estimates and assumptions made, extracellular fluid calcium increased with an elemental daily calcium intake > 1.5 g and was numerically more positive when patients are given active vitamin D analogs. Hypercalcemia is relatively common in patients on maintenance dialysis, and in the event of hypercalcemia the following adjustments are recommended: in patients taking calcium-based phosphate binders the dose should be reduced or therapy switched to a non-calcium phosphate binding; in patients taking active vitamin D analogs the dose should be reduced or therapy discontinued until serum concentration of calcium return to normal; if hypercalcemia persists, consider using low dialysate calcium (1.5 to 2.0 mEq/L). In KDIGO (CKD-MBD) 2009 and 2017 there is no recommendation regarding calcium intake for patients on maintenance dialysis or with kidney transplantation.

Monitoring vitamin D status during treatment

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementations, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of the cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight. Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing is associated with more variability), and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens and including patients receiving 10 000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded. With regard to recent megatrials results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4000 to 10 000 IU per day in the Calgary study. Furthermore, these studies did not confirm the modestly increased risk of kidney stones observed in the WHI trial (400 IU per day). However, there might be a need for monitoring in case of other vitamin D metabolite use. As discussed earlier, calcifediol acts much more rapidly than cholecalciferol in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels, resulting in greater fluctuation of 25(OH)D levels. For example, supplementation with 20 μg (800 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) increases 25(OH)D concentrations toward 70 nmol/L (28 ng/mL) within 16 weeks, while supplementation with 10 or 15 μg calcifediol (25(OH)D) increases 25(OH)D levels more than 75 nmol/L (> 30 ng/mL) in 8 and 4 weeks, respectively.

### Evidence-based policy on dietary calcium and vitamin D [^c8307d35]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Institute of Medicine's report on calcium and vitamin D makes a positive contribution by grounding its recommendations on the available evidence base. The committee does not substantially change recommended dietary intakes for calcium and modestly increases those for vitamin D based on the need for a median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40 nmol/L. They do not support the suggestion that all adults should have levels > 75 nmol/L. The committee concludes that current evidence does not support nonskeletal benefits for vitamin D or calcium, and notes that higher intakes of both could have adverse health consequences. The present authors are generally in agreement with these conclusions, with some caveats regarding the evidence base used. However, we believe that the central role of sunlight exposure in determining vitamin D status needs to be explicitly reflected in public policy in this area.

### Calcium and vitamin D [^6a71db62]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone maintenance and for treatment-induced bone augmentation. Deficiencies of both nutrients are very common in the age group most afflicted by osteoporosis. Calcium enhancement of estrogen's effects now have been clearly demonstrated. Additionally, all currently approved bone active agents have been tested only in the presence of extra calcium, and newer anabolic agents create a skeletal need for mineral that will require even higher levels of calcium repletion. Prudent nutritional support for osteoporosis prevention and treatment consists of 30 to 40 mmol Ca/d together with sufficient vitamin D to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 80 nmol/L (i.e., approximately 25 microg vitamin D/d).

A new public health report on dietary intake requirements for calcium and vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), released on November 30, 2010, updates the IOM report of 1997. The three central questions addressed by the report, in light of the growing body of research on these nutrients over the past 10–15 yr, are: 1) which health outcomes are influenced by vitamin D and/or calcium intake?; 2) how much calcium and vitamin D are needed to achieve desirable health outcomes?; and 3) how much is too much? This article, authored by the IOM Committee, describes the Committee's process for meeting this charge, reviews the evidence base for both skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes examined by the Committee, summarizes the new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for these nutrients (Table 1), highlights challenges and uncertainties in the process, and summarizes future research priorities. Although this article provides a readily accessible overview of the Committee's work, we encourage readers to review the full report atfor a fuller understanding of the process and the pertinent evidence base.

2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400–800 international units daily. FOSAMAX PLUS D 70 mg/2800 international units and 70 mg/5600 international units are intended to provide seven days' worth of 400 and 800 international units daily vitamin D in a single, once-weekly dose, respectively.

2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of FOSAMAX PLUS D is missed, instruct patients to take one tablet on the morning after they remember. They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^08318cd6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

We suggest supplementing patients with native vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) in case of vitamin D deficiency (grade C, weak recommendation)
We do not recommend routine calcium supplementation in children with XLH, but a dietary evaluation of daily calcium intake should be performed (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend that treatment plans should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team setting before surgery; we also suggest that active vitamin D supplementation should be decreased or stopped if patients are immobilized for a long period; therapy should be restarted as soon as the patient resumes walking (grade D, weak recommendation)

Active and native vitamin D

Active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) is given in addition to oral phosphate supplements in order to counter calcitriol deficiency, prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism and increase phosphate absorption from the gut. The optimal dose varies from patient to patient. Requirements are generally higher during early childhood and puberty (growth phases), and the dose can be adjusted on the basis of serum levels of ALP and PTH and urinary calcium excretion. Large doses of active vitamin D promote growth and bone healing but are associated with an increased risk of hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis –. Conversely, insufficient doses of active vitamin D are usually associated with low intestinal calcium absorption, low urinary calcium excretion, persistent rickets and high ALP and/or PTH levels. Calcitriol can be given in one or two doses per day, whereas alfacalcidol should be give once per day owing to its longer half-life. The equivalent dosage of alfacalcidol is 1.5–2.0 times that of calcitriol on the basis of studies in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease and observations in patients with XLH. This difference is probably because of the roughly twice higher oral bioavailability of calcitriol than alfacalcidol. A single evening dose might help prevent excessive calcium absorption after food intake and thus hypercalciuria. Several other vitamin D analogues are also available. As in healthy children, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in children with XLH should be corrected by supplementation with native vitamin D.

Calcium supplements

Nutritional calcium intake should be kept within the normal range for age. Supplements are not recommended given that bone mass and mineral content are usually not decreased and because of the potential risk of hypercalciuria.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### The effect of vitamin D on calcium absorption in older women [^ee48703d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is often recommended for use with calcium supplements to increase absorption. There are no systematic studies of vitamin D on calcium absorption that indicate what dose should be recommended.

Objective

Our objective was to study the effect of increasing doses of vitamin D3 on calcium absorption.

Design and Setting

We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial at Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

Participants

Participants included 163 postmenopausal Caucasian women with vitamin D insufficiency, defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter).

Intervention

Participants were randomized to receive one of the vitamin D3 doses, 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, or 4800 IU/d, or placebo for 1 yr. Calcium intake was increased to 1200–1400 mg daily by giving daily calcium citrate.

Main Outcome

We evaluated the change in calcium absorption on vitamin D.

Results

Mean serum 25OHD increased from baseline 15.6 ng/ml (39 nmol/liter) to 46.5 ng/ml (112 nmol/liter) in subjects randomized to the highest dose of vitamin D (4800 IU). Calcium absorption was more significantly related to serum 25OHD (R² = 0.50; P = 0.001) than dose (R² = 0.47; P = 0.033). Calcium absorption of a 100-mg dose increased from 52–58% (6 mg) over a serum 25OHD range of 20–66 ng/ml (50–165 nmol/liter).

Conclusions

There was no evidence of a threshold for reduced calcium absorption in the serum 25OHD range of 10–66 ng/ml (25–165 nmol/liter). The increase in absorbed calcium of 6% on high doses of vitamin D is so small that the same amount could be obtained from half a glass of milk (100 ml) or 100 mg elemental calcium. The results challenge assumptions about the value of adding vitamin D to increase calcium absorption except when serum 25OHD is very low that is less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/liter).

2.1	Overview of Dosage and Monitoring

Use only one injection to achieve the once daily recommended dosage. Using two injections to achieve the recommended once daily dosage increases the risk of unintended changes in serum calcium levels, including hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The maximum recommended dosage is 30 mcg subcutaneously once daily. If an adequate response is not achieved with a maximum YORVIPATH dosage of 30 mcg, consider adding or restarting calcium and/or active vitamin D therapy and/or seek other treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
YORVIPATH's once daily subcutaneous dosage is individualized. The recommended starting dosage is 18 mcg once daily and is titrated in 3 mcg increments or decrements with the goal of maintaining serum calcium within the normal range without the need for active vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol) or therapeutic calcium doses (elemental calcium > 600 mg/day). Calcium supplementation sufficient to meet daily dietary requirements may be continued.
Advise patients to monitor daily for clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia.
Measure serum calcium 7 to 10 days after the first YORVIPATH dose and after any dose change in YORVIPATH, active vitamin D, or calcium supplements, and monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Once the YORVIPATH maintenance dosage is achieved, measure serum calcium levels at a minimum every 4 to 6 weeks or as indicated for symptoms of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia.
Adjust YORVIPATH, active vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements per Figure 1. Some patients may require an increase in the YORVIPATH dose over time to maintain the same therapeutic effect [see Clinical Studies (14)].
Refer to the Instructions for Use (IFU) for detailed instructions on the proper preparation and administration of YORVIPATH [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

2.2	Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation of YORVIPATH

Within two weeks before the first dose of YORVIPATH, confirm serum 25(OH) vitamin D is within the normal range and albumin-corrected serum calcium is ≥ 7.8 mg/dL.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^661ba997]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### USPSTF evidence report: vitamin D and calcium for primary prevention of fractures… [^82ee570f]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

At the same time, it is important to understand potential harms of supplementation with these agents. In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against daily supplementation of 400 IU or less of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in noninstitutionalized postmenopausal women. 3 The USPSTF also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation in premenopausal women and in men and at doses greater than 400 IU with or without calcium for noninstitutionalized, postmenopausal women. To inform an updated recommendation, the evidence about the benefits and harms of supplemental vitamin D and calcium, alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in unselected, community-dwelling adult populations relevant to US primary care was reviewed.

Eligible vitamin D interventions included oral or intramuscular vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 at any dosage or frequency. Eligible calcium interventions included oral calcium salt preparations at any dose and frequency. Eligible comparator groups were no treatment, placebo, or lower- or higher-dose vitamin D or calcium regimens. The vitamin D3 doses used included 300 IU, 400 IU, or 700 IU daily or 100 000 IU every month or every 4 months. The calcium doses used included daily doses of 1000 mg, 1200 mg, or 1600 mg alone, or 500 mg or 1000 mg daily in combination with vitamin D. For vitamin D combined with calcium compared with placebo, the WHI CaD trial reported 2102 fractures in the vitamin D with calcium group and 2158 in the placebo group (ARD, −0. 35% [95% CI, −1. 02%.

For calcium alone compared with placebo, only 1 study was eligible, and it compared 600-mg or 1200-mg doses with placebo and reported 1 death in each of the placebo and 2 treatment groups. 22 For vitamin D combined with calcium, 2 RCTs were eligible. Four RCTs examined the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone, 14, 16, 33 calcium alone, 21 or vitamin D with calcium24, 28, 29, 34–37 on incident cancer.

Studies of supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium (alone or combined) showed inconsistent results and were frequently underpowered to detect differences; thus, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium to prevent fractures is inadequate.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Calcium and vitamin D in osteoporosis [^6aac01d3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are useful adjunctive therapies in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Peak BMD is optimally achieved with sustained optimal calcium and vitamin D intakes. Calcium and vitamin D intakes continue to be important after the third decade and into senescence. Although calcium and vitamin D are not therapies to be used alone to prevent early postmenopausal bone loss, they assume more prominent roles in late menopause and in the elderly to preserve bone health with advancing age. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an important adjunctive therapy to use together with antiresorptive therapies.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^74f97d05]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

Uncertainties and Future Research Needs

The Committee identified a large number of uncertainties surrounding the DRI values, as well as extensive research needs. A particular priority is rigorous, large-scale, randomized clinical trials to test the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal outcomes, as well as to identify threshold effects and possible adverse effects where present. Elucidating the biology of the diverse effects of vitamin D, as well as effects of sun exposure, adiposity, body composition, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors on these associations, is also of great importance.

CKD stages 3–5D vitamin D testing and repletion — In patients with CKD stages 3-5D, we suggest that calcidiol (25[OH]D) might be measured, with repeat testing determined by baseline values and therapeutic interventions (2C). We suggest that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency be corrected using treatment strategies recommended for the general population (2C). Substrate vitamin D deficiency has been variably defined as 25(OH)D level < 10–20 ng/mL, and insufficiency as 25(OH)D level higher than the limits for deficiency but < 32–35 ng/mL. A reasonable approach is to periodically measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with CKD and initiate treatment if the level is low, with general-population repletion specifying a cholecalciferol dose of 1,000–2,000 IU/d; however, a more aggressive dosing regimen may be used in patients with CKD. The KDOQI bone guideline provided a recommendation for supplementation in patients with CKD stages 3–4 with ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), orally dosed according to 25(OH)D level; this has not been tested in patients with CKD stage 5, 5D, or T, and monitoring calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH levels can guide subsequent dose adjustments. This represents a change from prior KDOQI guidance that limited measuring 25(OH)D to patients with CKD stages 3–4 and elevated PTH level, and these recommendations are applicable to the United States.

CKD stage 5D — pharmacologic management of increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is guided as follows: In patients with CKD stage 5D and increased or increasing PTH levels, we suggest that calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics, or a combination of calcimimetics and calcitriol or vitamin D analogues be used to decrease PTH levels (2B). It is reasonable that the initial drug selection for the treatment of increased PTH level be based on serum calcium and phosphorus levels and other aspects of CKD-MBD (not graded), and it is reasonable that calcium- or non–calcium-based phosphate binder dosage be adjusted so that treatments to control PTH levels do not compromise phosphorus and calcium levels (not graded). We recommend that in patients with hypercalcemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (1B), and we suggest that in patients with hyperphosphatemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (2D). We suggest that in patients with hypocalcemia, calcimimetics be reduced or stopped depending on severity, concomitant medications, and clinical signs and symptoms (2D), and we suggest that if iPTH levels decrease to less than 2 times the upper reference limit for the assay, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, and/or calcimimetics be reduced or stopped (2C). There are no data supporting the clinical superiority of any vitamin D analogues available in the United States compared with calcitriol or placebo.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8ffee6fe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Single-monthly-dose vitamin D supplementation in elderly patients [^a6682455]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the serum levels of calcidiol and calcitriol in 2 men and in 21 postmenopausal, primarily elderly women receiving hormone replacement therapy, orally administered calcium citrate, and an additional supplement of 50,000 IU of vitamin D (1.25 mg of cholecalciferol) once monthly for various periods.

Methods

We determined plasma calcidiol and calcitriol levels at various times, ranging from -1 to +60 days after intake of a single dose of 1.25 mg of vitamin D in 10 initial or short-term users (1 to 6 months) and in 13 women who had been using this monthly regimen for several years. The primary concerns were the safety and adequacy of the blood levels achieved with a regimen that encouraged compliance.

Results

In long-term users of monthly vitamin D regimens, calcidiol levels were usually slightly in excess of the upper limit of normal (that is, > 52 ng/mL [> 130 nmol/L]) at all times throughout the month; in contrast, calcitriol levels exceeded the normal range (8 to 52 pg/mL [19 to 125 pmol/L]) only once in 18 samplings. In short-term users, calcidiol levels exceeded the normal range only once shortly after intake, and no calcitriol level exceeded the normal range.

Conclusion

Once-a-month dosage of 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) of vitamin D in elderly women receiving hormone replacement therapy plus supplemental calcium and uncontrolled generic multivitamin intake yields calcitriol levels within the normal range, even after years of use of this regimen. Calcidiol levels exceeded the normal range at all times in long-term users but only once in short-term users. Calcidiol concentrations, however, were found to be far below levels (> 150 ng/mL [> 375 nmol/L]) that might produce hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^108084d9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025. Within 1 year of experiencing a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require assistance with activities of daily living, and 20% to 30% of patients will die.

Objective

To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults (defined as not living in a nursing home or other institutional care setting). The review excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture.

Findings

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D or greater than 1000 mg of calcium to prevent fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium increases the incidence of kidney stones.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (D recommendation) These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^3b64c997]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The available scientific evidence supports a key role for calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, providing a sound basis for DRIs. The evidence, however, is not yet compelling that either nutrient confers benefits for, or is causally related to, extraskeletal health outcomes. Moreover, existing evidence suggests that nearly all individuals meet their needs at intake levels (RDAs) provided in this report and, for vitamin D, at 25OHD levels of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) even under conditions of minimal sun exposure. Furthermore, higher levels have not been shown consistently to confer greater benefits, challenging the concept that "more is better". The Committee finds that the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in the North American population has been overestimated by some groups due to the use of inappropriate cut-points that greatly exceed the levels identified in this report. Serum concentrations of 25OHD above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) are not consistently associated with increased benefit, and risks have been identified for some outcomes at 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter). Additional research, including large-scale, randomized clinical trials, is needed. In the meantime, however, we believe that there is an urgent clinical and public health need for consensus cut-points for serum 25OHD inadequacy to avoid problems of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^1c86d42c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 5: Micronutrients — vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines threshold definitions, testing, supplementation, and safety. Some, but not all, guidelines have defined insufficiency of vitamin D by serum 25(OH)D level between 20 and 29 ng/mL, deficiency as 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency as serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL. Both the KDOQI and KDIGO reports recommend checking and supplementing low serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD and dialysis patients. In the most recent update of the KDIGO guideline on MBD, it is suggested based on low-quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 1-5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be individualized according to baseline values and interventions; however, there was no clear suggestion on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed. Current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1-5D and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population, and it has been recommended for 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D repletion for the general population, although KDOQI acknowledges that patients with CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan. Because in CKD there is no clear evidence about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians should use the form commercially available in the context of their clinical practice. The tolerable upper intake level proposed by the IOM for the general population is 4,000 IU/d, there is no recommendation of a safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supplementation to prevent toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in CKD, and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered, especially for patients who are using calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D active analogues.

Box 3 Recommendations for treatment in children

We recommend treating children with overt X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) phenotype with a combination of oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) and active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) as soon as diagnosis is established (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of 20–60 mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0 mmol/kg daily) of elemental phosphorus in infants and preschool children, which should be adjusted according to the improvement of rickets, growth, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend phosphate supplements should be taken as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times daily in young patients with high ALP levels. The frequency can be lowered to 3–4 times daily when ALP has normalized (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend a progressive increase in the dose of phosphate supplements in cases of insufficient clinical response but avoidance of doses > 80 mg/kg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort and hyperparathyroidism. If these adverse effects are present, treatment should be adjusted by decreasing the dose and/or increasing the frequency (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend the use of low doses in patients with mild phenotypes, for instance, infants diagnosed by family screening (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of calcitriol of 20–30 ng/kg body weight daily or alfacalcidol of 30–50 ng/kg body weight daily. Alternatively, treatment can be started empirically at 0.5 μg daily of calcitriol or 1 μg of alfacalcidol in patients > 12 months old and adjusted on the basis of clinical and biochemical responses (grade C, moderate recommendation)
To prevent nephrocalcinosis, we recommend keeping calciuria levels within the normal range and avoiding large doses of phosphate supplements; we suggest measures that decrease urinary calcium concentration, excretion and/or crystallization if necessary, including regular water intake, administration of potassium citrate and limited sodium intake (grade C, moderate recommendation)
With respect to secondary hyperparathyroidism, we recommend the following: Patients on conventional treatment with elevated PTH levels should be managed by increasing the dose of active vitamin D and/or decreasing the dose of oral phosphate supplements (grade C, moderate recommendation) Treatment with calcimimetics might be considered in patients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism despite the above-mentioned measures (grade D, weak recommendation). Cinacalcet should be used with caution in XLH, as it has been associated with severe adverse effects, namely, hypocalcaemia and increased QT interval (grade X, strong recommendation) Parathyroidectomy should be considered in case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (persistent hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism) despite optimized active vitamin D and cinacalcet therapy (grade C, moderate recommendation)

Calcitriol

Calcitriol is the active hormonal form of vitamin D and the natural VDR ligand. It promotes active intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH secretion. Calcitriol has a short half-life of around 5 to 8 hours; therefore, it should be administered daily (or with intermittent regimens) and sometimes in lower doses distributed over a 24-hour period. As calcitriol is not an organic micronutrient, its use in clinical practice requires careful monitoring. Calcitriol increases the activity of CYP24A1, which stimulates the degradation of 25(OH)D. This results in serum 25(OH)D not being useful as a marker of adequate vitamin D supplementation and reduced potential benefits of physiological extrarenal/local production of calcitriol due to reduced substrate availability. Moreover, some studies have reported a more significant incidence of adverse events such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Thus, there is a need to monitor serum and urine calcium and phosphate. Because of these safety and clinical practicality issues, there is consensus that calcitriol use should be limited to hormone replacement for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity, as their capacity to produce calcitriol is severely limited. Indeed, calcitriol was first used to treat patients with vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1. Other indications are X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, chronic hypoparathyroidism, as an alternative to the use of the native missing hormone PTH, and moderate-to-severe kidney failure when calcitriol production is impaired or to suppress excessive PTH secretion. This use helps to control secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone diseases. However, as calcitriol use is associated with frequent hypercalcemia, its use could be replaced by analogues with less calcemic activity approved for use in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure, in particular maxacalcitol (22-oxa-1,25(OH)₂D₃) and falecalcitriol (1,25(OH)₂–26,27-F₆-D₃), which are currently available in Japan, and paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25(OH)₂D₂) and doxercalciferol (1α(OH)D₂), available in the United States. Calcitriol has also been proposed for the treatment of osteoporosis, but it is not approved in this setting.

Conventional treatment in children

Phosphate

Recommendations for conventional treatment in children with XLH are provided in Box 3. Oral phosphate supplements should always be provided together with active vitamin D, as phosphate alone promotes secondary hyperparathyroidism and thereby renal phosphate wasting. Treatment doses vary according to age and severity of phenotype, and no consensus exists on the optimal dose of oral phosphate. However, starting doses of 20–60 mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0 mmol/kg daily) based on elemental phosphorus are recommended on the basis of the severity of the phenotype. Early treatment is associated with superior outcomes. Healing of rickets, as evidenced by the normalization of ALP levels and radiological signs, is the initial aim in children. Treatment also promotes growth, reduces bone pain, progressively corrects leg deformities and improves dental health. In infants diagnosed before they develop bone changes, the goal of treatment is to prevent rickets. Serum phosphate levels increase rapidly after oral intake but return to baseline concentrations within 1.5 hours. Thus, phosphate should be given as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times per day in young patients with high ALP levels, to maintain stable blood levels. Less frequent dosing (2–3 times daily) might improve adherence in adolescents. Fasting phosphate levels are not restored by oral phosphate supplements, and normalization of serum levels of phosphate is not a goal of conventional therapy. Phosphate supplements are available as oral solutions, capsules or tablets containing sodium-based and/or potassium-based salts. Dosages should always be based on elemental phosphorus given that the phosphorus content largely differs between the available phosphate salts. Oral solutions containing glucose-based sweeteners should be used with caution given the dental fragility of these patients. Phosphate should not be given together with calcium supplements or foods with high calcium content, such as milk, as precipitation in the intestinal tract reduces absorption.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^2c7537a3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D and calcium supplementation: The IOM recommends 600 IU for women aged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those aged older than 70 years, stating these intakes were sufficient to achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in most postmenopausal women, but meta-analyses report inconsistent fracture outcomes with most showing no benefit; in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial bone health substudy, 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y; baseline serum 25-OHD 27.6 ng/mL) showed no effect overall or in those with baseline serum 25-OHD less than 30 ng/mL; salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracture risk have been observed most often in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient older adults; the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of daily vitamin D alone to prevent fractures and recommended against vitamin D supplements to prevent falls; women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than those with normal bone mineral density (BMD), there is no convincing evidence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements improves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs, and adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment-induced hypocalcemia.
