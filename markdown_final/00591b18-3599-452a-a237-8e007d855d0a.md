## Question

73 AAM, with history of multiple myeloma, found to have an Anterior mediastinal lymph node seen on CT chest 2.1 x 1.6 cm in size, which has enlarged since prior PET/CT and showed FDG/PET metabolic activity on PET/CT
	whats the appropriate method to obtain tissue biopsy and how soon

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best way to obtain a tissue biopsy from a new, FDG-avid anterior mediastinal lymph node in a 73-year-old with multiple myeloma, including which biopsy method to use, how soon it should be done, and relevant procedural considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of FDG-avid nodal disease in myeloma and whether this mandates tissue confirmation. Then, I should verify the best biopsy approach for an anterior mediastinal node and why EBUS may be insufficient. Next, I will review the role of PET/CT in targeting the most active area and the expected diagnostic yield. After that, I need to determine urgency and timing relative to therapy decisions. Finally, I will outline pre-procedural planning, specimen handling, and contingency steps if the first attempt is non-diagnostic.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance. In multiple myeloma, new FDG-avid extramedullary or nodal disease is clinically meaningful and often represents extramedullary myeloma or transformation, which carries adverse prognostic implications and can alter therapy; therefore, histopathologic confirmation is warranted rather than assuming myelomatous involvement based on imaging alone [^115Ji7AG] [^113NHkcp] [^114EbzWs].

> Wait, let me verify the differential for an anterior mediastinal node in this context. While myeloma-related extramedullary disease is a leading concern, lymphoma and other mediastinal malignancies remain in the differential, and imaging alone cannot reliably distinguish them. Thus, tissue diagnosis is essential to guide treatment selection and prognostication [^116Bgwpw] [^115tdM3K].

> I will now examine the optimal biopsy modality. For an anterior mediastinal node, image-guided core needle biopsy via a percutaneous transthoracic approach is preferred. EBUS is generally insufficient for anterior mediastinal masses because of limited access and suboptimal tissue yield, and excisional biopsy is reserved for cases where percutaneous biopsy is not feasible or is non-diagnostic [^114QCtxw] [^116Bgwpw].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of PET/CT in targeting. PET/CT-directed core needle biopsy to the area of maximal FDG uptake improves diagnostic yield and reduces sampling error. Prospective data in lymphoproliferative disorders show high diagnostic accuracy and yield when targeting the most metabolically active region, which is directly applicable to FDG-avid myeloma extramedullary sites as well [^112APMcQ] [^111mzbfU] [^1138Piqi].

> Next, I should review timing. Given that this node is new, enlarging, and FDG-avid in a patient with myeloma, I need to ensure timely tissue confirmation before initiating or changing systemic therapy. Scheduling the biopsy within 1–2 weeks is reasonable, with expedited pathology review and molecular testing to inform urgent management decisions, consistent with myeloma pathways that rely on advanced imaging and tissue confirmation for extramedullary disease [^113NHkcp].

> Let me consider pre-procedural planning. I should confirm the exact nodal location and safest access route using contrast-enhanced CT or PET/CT fusion, coordinate with interventional radiology for approach planning, and ensure adequate tissue sampling for histology, immunophenotyping, FISH, and next-generation sequencing when indicated. Obtaining at least 3–4 core samples from the most FDG-avid portion mitigates under-sampling and improves diagnostic reliability [^1168UatC] [^112APMcQ].

> I need to ensure specimen handling is optimized. Tissue should be triaged for formalin-fixed paraffin embedding, touch imprints for rapid on-site evaluation if available, and fresh tissue for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular studies. This maximizes the chance of confirming myeloma, excluding lymphoma, and identifying high-risk cytogenetics that influence therapy [^112KpbYx] [^113NHkcp].

> But wait, what if the biopsy is non-diagnostic. If initial cores are inadequate or discordant with imaging, I should double-check the PET/CT to re-target the most active region, consider repeat image-guided core biopsy, or escalate to surgical excision if percutaneous approaches fail; multidisciplinary review of imaging and pathology is essential to reconcile discordant results and decide on next steps [^113YxW96] [^114QCtxw].

> In summary, I should confirm that the recommended approach is percutaneous image-guided core needle biopsy of the FDG-avid anterior mediastinal node, targeted to the area of maximal uptake, performed within 1–2 weeks to secure a timely, definitive diagnosis that will guide therapy. This strategy aligns with myeloma imaging standards, PET/CT-guided biopsy evidence, and anterior mediastinal mass best practices [^116xi3iA] [^112APMcQ] [^116Bgwpw].

---

The best way to obtain tissue from a 2.1 × 1.6 cm FDG-avid anterior mediastinal lymph node in a patient with multiple myeloma is a **CT-guided core needle biopsy** [^1138Piqi] targeting the most FDG-avid area [^112APMcQ] to maximize diagnostic yield [^111mzbfU]. This approach balances safety, accuracy, and timeliness. Given the enlargement and FDG uptake, **biopsy should be performed promptly within 1–2 weeks** to confirm disease progression or extramedullary disease and guide therapy. If CT-guided biopsy is not feasible, consider EBUS-guided biopsy or surgical excision; avoid blind or non-image-guided methods.

---

## Indications for biopsy in multiple myeloma

Biopsy is indicated in multiple myeloma when there is suspicion of **extramedullary disease** [^113NHkcp], **transformation**, or **relapse**. FDG-avid lymph nodes — especially when enlarging — are concerning for extramedullary myeloma or transformation and warrant histopathologic confirmation [^113NHkcp].

---

## Imaging modalities for biopsy guidance

Several imaging modalities can guide biopsy of an anterior mediastinal lymph node, including CT, PET/CT, EBUS, and MRI. Each has distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| CT | - High-resolution anatomic detail <br/> - Real-time guidance <br/> - Widely available | - Limited functional information <br/> - May miss metabolically active areas |
| PET/CT | - Identifies most metabolically active areas <br/> - Improves diagnostic yield <br/> - Guides targeted biopsy | - Limited availability <br/> - Higher cost |
| EBUS | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Useful for central mediastinal nodes | - Limited tissue yield <br/> - May be insufficient for definitive diagnosis |
| MRI | - Excellent soft-tissue contrast <br/> - No radiation | - Limited availability <br/> - Not commonly used for biopsy guidance |

---

## Recommended biopsy method: CT-guided core needle biopsy

CT-guided core needle biopsy is the **preferred method** for anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, offering high-resolution anatomic detail and real-time guidance to safely access deep structures. PET/CT can identify the most metabolically active area within the node, improving diagnostic yield and reducing the need for repeat biopsies [^112APMcQ]. Combining CT guidance with PET/CT targeting yields high diagnostic accuracy and a low complication rate [^111mzbfU].

---

## Alternative biopsy methods

If CT-guided biopsy is not feasible due to patient factors or lesion location, **EBUS-guided biopsy** is a minimally invasive alternative, though its tissue yield may be lower and it may not provide sufficient material for a definitive diagnosis. Surgical excision is another option, but it is more invasive and typically reserved when less invasive methods are not feasible.

---

## Timing of biopsy

Given the enlargement and FDG avidity of the lymph node, **biopsy should be performed promptly** — ideally within 1–2 weeks — to confirm disease progression or extramedullary involvement and guide appropriate therapy.

---

## Potential risks and complications

Biopsy of an anterior mediastinal lymph node carries potential risks, including:

- Bleeding
- Infection
- Pneumothorax
- Damage to adjacent structures (e.g. vessels, nerves)

However, **image-guided techniques** significantly reduce these risks by allowing precise targeting and avoidance of critical structures [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

CT-guided core needle biopsy targeting the most FDG-avid area is the **preferred method** for obtaining tissue from an FDG-avid anterior mediastinal lymph node in a patient with multiple myeloma. This approach provides high diagnostic accuracy, minimizes risks, and allows prompt confirmation of disease progression or extramedullary involvement. If CT-guided biopsy is not feasible, consider EBUS-guided biopsy or surgical excision. Given the clinical urgency, biopsy should be performed within 1–2 weeks.

[¹⁸F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans provide patients and referring physicians with diagnostic PET and CT information in a single imaging session. Because most lymphomas show high glucose metabolic activity and FDG avidity, they can be reliably assessed with FDG-PET/CT. PET/CT has emerged as the modality of choice for treatment strategy assessments in patients with lymphoma. Its ability to characterize masses as benign or malignant and its high sensitivity and specificity for staging, restaging, and treatment monitoring have led to widespread acceptance of PET imaging for managing patients with lymphoma.

Multiple myeloma — advanced imaging follow-up and prognostic markers: Follow-up with advanced whole-body imaging (ie, FDG-PET/CT, low-dose CT, whole-body MRI without contrast) is recommended as needed. Residual focal lesions detected by either FDG-PET/CT or MRI have been shown to be of adverse prognostic significance, with Zamagni et al reporting PFS of 44 months in patients with residual focal lesions on FDG-PET/CT versus 84 months for those without after systemic treatment (P = 0.0009). In the IMAJEM trial, both PFS and OS were significantly better in patients with negative FDG-PET/CT results before initiation of maintenance therapy (P = 0.011 and P = 0.033, respectively). An analysis showed that conventional MRI normalizes over a prolonged period of time making FDG-PET/CT superior in this regard, although in small cohorts diffusion-weighted imaging had superior sensitivity to detect residual disease compared with FDG-PET/CT, and MRI does not expose the patient to radiation.

Mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, yet include a large variety of entities. Some tumors can be diagnosed with confidence based on imaging alone; others when a typical appearance is combined with the right clinical presentation. A structured approach for radiologists is presented to facilitate evaluation of patients with anterior mediastinal tumors. The approach focuses first on the more common tumors and on imaging features that strongly suggest a particular diagnosis. Discussion with the clinician can be very helpful in formulating a presumptive diagnosis. This article also discusses that confirmatory imaging or biopsy tests are most beneficial in particular situations.

### Diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography / computed tomography-driven biopsy for the diagnosis of lymphoma [^1138Piqi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic rate of CT-guided or US-guided core needle biopsy is usually acceptable, as these procedures permit the collection of amounts of tissue adequate to accomplish a specific diagnosis in a significant proportion of cases. Furthermore, the repeated biopsy rate and the incidence of complications are very low. No significant risk in terms of local recurrence along the core needle biopsy tract has been reported.

Despite these advantages, the accuracy of CT- and US-guided core needle biopsies for a specific diagnosis of lymphoma approximates 85–90% for nodal localizations, and it is not clearly established — although markedly reduced — for extranodal sites. In most extranodal areas, in fact, and with particular regard to the skeleton, lymphoma-related morphological changes are hard to be recognized on CT images only, whereas they appear more clearly if a functional imaging technique such as 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is applied. FDG-PET is able to highlight areas of active lymphoma both in lymph nodes and other tissues (including the bone and most of the parenchymas) with a very high sensitivity in comparison with conventional imaging, given the documented — although variable — avidity of the lymphoma tissue for FDG. Importantly, PET can provide pathological results even before lymphoma-related radiological changes occur (e.g. in bones) and can accurately discriminate between residual fibrotic tissue after therapy and disease persistence or relapse. Thus, the possible application of FDG-PET, when combined with CT scan (PET/CT), to drive the biopsy toward the most metabolically active lesion, to the most active area within a bulky mass or directly into a bone or parenchymal focal localization is theoretically of great advantage.

Here, we present the results of a study in which PET and CT fused images were used as a guide to drive the core needle biopsy directly into the most suitable target in case of suspected lymphoproliferative disorder at onset or at relapse.

After additional therapy, restage with FDG-PET/CT; Deauville 1–3 goes to follow-up (HODG-12), Deauville 4–5 prompts biopsy; biopsy negative leads to ISRTt then follow-up, and biopsy positive is managed as Primary Refractory Disease (HODG-13).

### The role of imaging techniques in the management of multiple myeloma [^112t21Y4]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Bone disease is the major feature of multiple myeloma (MM). Imaging is required for correct staging, in the follow-up after treatment and, as recently highlighted, is predictor of prognosis. In the near future, whole-body X-Ray may be replaced by more sensitive techniques, such as whole-body low-dose computerized tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard method for assessing bone marrow infiltration of the spine, predicting the risk of vertebral fracture and distinguishing between benign and malignant osteoporosis. Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET/CT) provides important information about the extent of whole-body disease, including soft tissue masses, and is the best tool to distinguish between active or inactive disease after therapy. Both MRI and PET/CT are predictors of clinical outcome. A prospective use of these newer imaging techniques in both clinical trials and clinical practice may help optimize MM management in the near future.

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^1168UatC]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

PET/CT data analysis underscores the importance for interventional radiologists to remain cautious of potential false-positive findings, including non-malignant FDG uptake and imaging artifacts. For further research, prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed, as well as a standardized protocol for PET/CT data.

The findings of the present study suggest that taking fewer than three biopsy samples may compromise diagnostic accuracy and that the amount of tissue obtained for histopathological evaluation remains crucial, even in cases of high PET-scan uptake. Moreover, biopsy site selection should not be solely based on the most metabolically active lesion, as each clinical scenario presents distinct challenges for the interventional radiologist. While minimal sampling helps to streamline procedures, it remains essential to ensure the quantity of the material collected. Striking a balance between procedural efficiency and diagnostic reliability is key to optimizing bone biopsy practice.

### Comparison of the diagnostic performance and impact on management of 18F-FDG PET / CT and whole-body MRI in multiple myeloma [^115mrDvp]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

WBMRI detects skeletal disease in a higher number of treatment naïve patients than 18F-FDG PET/CT and also detects a higher number of lesions per patient with concordance between 18F-FDG PET/CT and WBMRI in terms of disease positivity and lesion number in only 59% of patients. Imaging impacts on clinical management resulting in a significantly higher proportion of treated patients compared with clinical data alone. However, treatment decisions were not statistically different between modalities and either would be appropriate in initial staging, depending on local availability and expertise.

NDMM patients have intra- and inter-patient tumoral heterogeneity reflected by variable [18 F]FDG PET/CT patterns. In the French prospective multicentric IMAJEM study performed on 134 NDMM patients, [18 F]FDG PET/CT was normal at diagnosis for 9% of patients, 33% showed FLs with a median number of three FLs (0 to > 10) and a median FL SUV max of 4.1 (range 1.5–28.4), 9% had diffuse BM involvement, 49% had combined diffuse infiltration and FLs, and 10% had EMD. In the more recent international prospective multicentric CassioPET study performed on 268 NDMM patients, [18 F]FDG PET/CT was normal at diagnosis for 20% of patients, 67% had FLs with a median SUV max of 6.1 (range 1.9–48.5), 48% had diffuse BM infiltration and 8% had EMD. Moreover, PMD was described for the first time in the CassioPET population and was present in 18%. Approximately 10–20% of NDMM patients are [18 F]FDG PET/CT 'false negative' at baseline, a phenomenon known to be due to low hexokinase-2 expression. These patients cannot be monitored after therapy by [18 F]FDG PET/CT imaging.

### Imaging of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell dyscrasias [^116p9DDJ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy of the bone marrow. MM has 3 components: diffuse marrow infiltration, focal bone lesions, and soft-tissue (extramedullary) disease. The hallmark biomarker in blood or urine is a monoclonal immunoglobulin, the monoclonal protein. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a similar disease with secretion of IgM. Staging is classically performed with the 1975 Durie-Salmon system, which includes conventional radiographs. Recently updated, the Durie-Salmon Plus staging system includes CT, MRI, and (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The hallmark radiographic lesion of symptomatic MM is a well-demarcated, focal osteolytic bone lesion. The number of focal bone lesions correlates inversely with outcome. Extramedullary disease is typically an aggressive, poorly differentiated form of MM that confers inferior outcome, with median survival of less than 1 y if present at diagnosis. Achievement of a complete response on (18)F-FDG PET before stem-cell transplantation correlates with a superior outcome.

TABLE 1.
Elements to Be Specified in 18 F-FDG PET/CT MM Reporting

In symptomatic MM, the sensitivity of 18 F-FDG PET/CT to detect FL is greater than that of the conventional skeletal survey and comparable to or less than that of pelvic–spinal MRI (, –). In the first small series of patients comparing 18 F-FDG PET/CT and MRI, the sensitivity of 18 F-FDG PET/CT was less than that of pelvic–spinal MRI for diffuse medullary involvement but allowed detection of additional FLs, especially outside the field of the MRI view. The French prospective IMAJEM study compared conventional pelvic–spinal MRI and 18 F-FDG PET/CT at initial diagnosis and after therapy. In this cohort of 134 symptomatic newly diagnosed MM patients, pelvic–spinal MRI was positive in 94.7% of cases and 18 F-FDG PET/CT in 91% of cases, revealing an equivalent detection sensitivity. Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI, however, increases the sensitivity of MRI for FL detection, which seemed to be higher than that of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in recent comparative and simultaneous PET/MRI studies.

### Mediastinal tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^116Bgwpw]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Mediastinal tumors are uncommon and often asymptomatic if benign. Tumors have a predilection for arising in one of three mediastinal compartments; anterior, middle, or posterior. If symptoms are present, they are usually compressive in origin. Computed tomography is almost always the imaging modality of choice. Benign-appearing lesions are usually resected for cure. Malignant-appearing lesions usually require biopsy by the least invasive route appropriate for the suspected tumor type.

FDG PET/CT examination request and medical history review — the request should document medical necessity and the medical record should be reviewed with specified focus areas; prior studies and labs are part of preparation. The request for the examination should include sufficient medical information to demonstrate medical necessity and should at least include the diagnosis and questions to be answered. The medical record should be reviewed with a special focus on the diagnosis, oncological history and relevant comorbidity, and a short interview with the patient and/or family can help clarify some issues. Relevant laboratory tests should be considered. Prior imaging results should be available to review, including planar radiography, CT, MRI, bone scanning and FDG PET/CT, and relevant prior studies should be directly compared with current imaging when possible. The review should consider tumour type and known tumour sites.

Abstract

Extramedullary multiple myeloma (EMM) is a subset of multiple myeloma with a poor prognosis. We report a rare case with biopsy-proven concurrent liver and mesentery primary EMM at the time of initial staging after serologic diagnosis of multiple myeloma. 18F-FDG PET/CT is valuable in detection of EMM when the patient has no osseous lesions and a negative bone marrow biopsy.

FDG PET/CT timing after surgery explains that uptake depends on surgical extent and wound status; there are few visible signs of a mediastinoscopy after 10 days but sternotomy signs will remain visible for months, and following surgery, it is recommended to delay the FDG PET/CT for at least 6 weeks if the scan is primarily being done to assess the surgical field.

Routine PET/MRI protocol for staging of patients with lymphoma could include Dixon based attenuation correction sequences, a secondary plane with T2-sequence (with or without fat sat) and a 3D (fat suppressed) post contrast sequence. Overall acquisition time would be 25 min. However, depending on the sequences used, this can be done also < 20 min. Unless contraindicated, there may be added value for contrast enhanced MR-imaging or DWI for better delineation of disease at extranodal sites, especially in bone marrow where MR-imaging has clear advantages over CT-imaging. Also, other extranodal lymphoma manifestations, i.e. brain or liver manifestations can be evaluated with improved accuracy on MR-imaging over CT-imaging.

Also, a special consideration for osseous involvement of hematological malignancies applies to PET/MR imaging in multiple myeloma. The predominant bone marrow involvement in this disease makes PET/MR a well-suited combined imaging method for evaluation of this disease and PET- as well as MR-imaging are now already suggested in multiple myeloma classification.

For response assessment, protocols may be abbreviated even further, if a baseline scan exists. Dixon-based sequences for attenuation correction and the additional T2-sequence or 3D post contrast T1-imaging may suffice in identifying and measuring residual masses and assigning the appropriate Deauville score from the PET datasets. Since a decrease in size of mass along with negative PET has a better predictive of a favorable outcome as compared to either test alone, it is important to note and measure all residual masses along with metabolic response score.

Prostate cancer

PET/MRI imaging is increasingly used in prostate cancer. The two main applications are detection and characterisation of primary disease within the prostate (mostly in high risk or the intermediate unfavorable risk group). Additional whole body imaging may be indicated for primary staging or in patients with biochemical recurrence. PET/MRI acquisition is tailored according to the indication: primary staging, re-staging in cases of biochemical recurrence, and follow up after established diagnosis. For primary staging, a dedicated MRI of the prostate (see below) with adapted PET-acquisition time of the pelvis plus a fast whole-body acquisition should be performed. For cases with biochemical recurrence (post prostatectomy), fast whole-body sequences and similar pelvic sequence types can be used but have to be adapted to the pelvis instead of the prostate. For follow up of cases with established diagnosis, a fast whole-body overview might be sufficient.

(1) Visual analysis: the results of the 18 F-FDG PET/CT were considered positive or negative for MM lesions classifying the results in 4 categories: (a) the presence of a pathological 18 F-FDG uptake was considered an active MM lesion when there was an increased and suspicious 18 F-FDG uptake in the region where there was a lytic lesion suggestive of MM, independently of the intensity, distribution, and extent of the 18 F-FDG uptake, categorizing the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study as positive for an active MM lesion in that location; (b) the presence of a pathological FDG uptake was considered an active MM lesion when there was an increased and suspicious 18 F-FDG uptake even if there were no underlying lytic lesions, independently of the intensity, distribution, and extent of the 18 F-FDG uptake, categorizing the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study as positive for an incipient active MM; (c) the absence of an increased and suspicious 18 F-FDG uptake in the region where there was a lytic lesion suggestive of MM, categorizing the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study as an inactive MM lesion in that location; and (d) the absence of an increased and suspicious 18 F-FDG uptake and no detectable lytic lesions suggestive of MM, categorizing the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study as negative for MM.
(2) Semiquantitative analysis: SUVmax was measured in the increased 18 F-FDG uptake and was compared with the physiological uptake (measured as SUVmax) in 2 regions: (a) the mediastinal blood pool (MBP), calculated measuring a volume of interest (VOI) with a diameter of 3 mm inside the walls of the ascending aorta; and (b) the liver uptake, calculated measuring VOI with a diameter of 3 cm drawn in the right hepatic lobe trying to exclude from the VOI any areas of inhomogeneous or focally increased uptake (physiological, pathological, or due to artifacts). A five-point scale was applied using these references: 0 was considered for the absence of pathological uptake; 1 when the uptake (SUVmax) was lower than the MBP; 2 when the uptake (SUVmax) was higher than the MBP but lower than the liver; 3 when the uptake (SUVmax) was higher than the liver without duplicating the SUVmax; 4 when the uptake (SUVmax) was more than double than the liver uptake.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma… [^112hp9ad]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis now shows a monoclonal protein level measuring 4. 52 g/dL. Serum free lambda chains were elevated at 426. 6 mg/L, with an elevated involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio of
40. A positron emission tomography –computed tomography scan did not show any evidence of bone disease. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of 26% clonal plasma cells, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed monosomy 13 and hyperdiploidy. The patient returns to discuss therapeutic options. The updated criteria emphasize the importance of imaging in SMM to carefully exclude myeloma-defining bone lesions. Conventional skeletal surveys are inadequate for this purpose, because a lytic lesion needs to involve more than 50% of the bone before it can be detected. 12CT is more sensitive than plain radiographs, and whole-body CT protocols using lower doses of radiation have been evaluated.

In one study, low-dose whole-body CT detected lytic lesions in 22. 5% of patients with SMM and MM that were not visualized on conventional skeletal survey. 13The IMWG recently recommended LDWBCT, and if negative, proceeding to whole-body MRI or spine and pelvis MRI. 14PET-CT is an appropriate alternative to LDWBCT. 11, 15–18Elevated circulating plasma cells, 19atypical bone marrow plasma cells defined by flow cytometry, 17and certain FISH abnormalities, such as t and deletion 17p, are more risk factors to consider, 20but these measures were developed before the 2014 update in the MM criteria, and the specialized flow cytometry methods are not widely available. An assumption with all of these models is that there is an inherent relationship between plasma cell burden and progression and that progression is a linear process.

Suggested Approaches to Management Management of a patient with SMM is challenging because the current risk stratification models do not allow us to accurately predict the risk of progression to active disease. Nevertheless, some important tools that can be used in the clinic now are the updated risk stratification with the 20/2/20 criteria, as well as advanced imaging with LDWBCT, MRI, and/or PET-CT. Ongoing studies to identify predictive biomarkers to further refine risk prediction will help select patients who may do well with observation.

FDG PET/CT reporting — additional notes and follow‑up — states under limitations of staging that every diagnostic test has a threshold and that the threshold used may vary depending on the implications for treatment. For indeterminate lesions and management of uncertainty, indeterminate lesions should be the point of clinical–radiological discussion and/or multidisciplinary review, if better characterisation of the lesion will further affect patient management, and the options for resolving uncertainties are discussion, further investigation, intervention and active monitoring (watch and wait). Regarding multidisciplinary team meetings, multidisciplinary team meetings allow a team approach to patient management, it should be possible to review all relevant examinations, the results of the discussions should be recorded with discrepancies noted and, if necessary, reported as an addendum to the imaging report; if additional tests are needed, these should be scheduled as soon as possible; and the presence of a reporting radiologist or nuclear medicine specialist is essential. For imaging the treated patient or follow‑up studies, the format of the report should mirror the one at baseline, reports of follow‑up studies must include clear statements regarding the detection of new disease, and descriptions on the direction of change, indeterminate lesions and mixed responses and findings at variance with one another should be provided.

### Artificial intelligence-based, volumetric assessment of the bone marrow metabolic activity in [F] FDG PET / CT predicts survival in multiple myeloma [^113hJT7r]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is considered an incurable hematological malignancy. The duration and quality of life for patients continue to improve. At the same time, MM is a very heterogeneous disease with wide variations in clinical course and outcome among patients, largely due to the fact that plasma cells display distinct malignant potential, e.g. based on their cytogenetic profile or genetic alterations. The prognosis and patient survival in MM are affected by multiple factors, among which tumor burden plays a key role. Tumor burden is estimated using the Durie-Salmon staging and the International Staging System (ISS), and nowadays the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS).

For an accurate individual assessment of the extent of the disease and its prognosis, imaging has evolved into a key component. Among cross-sectional imaging modalities, which have replaced skeletal radiography, traditionally used in the Durie and Salmon system, [18 F]FDG PET/CT is gradually gaining in importance. Performed at the initial diagnosis of MM, [18 F]FDG PET/CT has been shown to provide significant prognostic information based on the presence and number of focal lesions and diffuse bone marrow (BM) infiltration. In addition, [18 F]FDG PET/CT is considered to be the most appropriate method for assessing treatment response in this disease because of its ability to reliably distinguish metabolically active from inactive myeloma lesions.

However, [18 F]FDG PET/CT does have certain limitations concerning individual MM evaluation. Due to the different patterns of BM involvement as well as the non-negligible incidence of concomitant, myeloma-related events of adverse prognostic impact, such as the development of paramedullary disease (PMD), extramedullary disease (EMD), and pathological fractures, the standardization of assessment and reporting of the PET/CT examinations may be difficult to obtain, which, in turn, negatively affects inter-observer reproducibility in scan interpretation.

One approach to address the issue of standardization of [18 F]FDG PET/CT evaluation involves the volumetric assessment of the metabolic activity in the whole BM compartment — mainly through the calculation of the parameters metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) — which incorporates information both on focal myeloma lesions and diffuse BM infiltration. However, the accurate calculation of these volumetric parameters may prove to be a challenging task, requiring considerable computing power and fast and reproducible computer programs to allow for proper segmentation and correction of background activity and partial volume effect.

### Standardization of 18F-FDG-PET / CT according to deauville criteria for metabolic complete response definition in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma… [^116bAmU2]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography /computed tomography is currently the standard technique to define minimal residual disease status outside the bone marrow in patients with multiple myeloma. This study aimed to define criteria for PET complete metabolic response after therapy, jointly analyzing a subgroup of newly diagnosed transplantation-eligible patients with MM enrolled in two independent European randomized phase III trials. Introduction 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography integrated with computed tomography accurately and sensitively detects myeloma bone or extramedullary disease lesions, assessing tumor metabolic activity and monitoring response to treatment, by distinguishing active and inactive disease.

10As a result of bone marrow plasma cell patchy infiltration, possible EMD escape, and multiple myeloma spatial heterogeneity, 9, 11, 12evaluation of both the extramedullary compartment and BM is required to ensure tumor complete eradication. FDG-PET/CT is currently the preferred imaging technique for evaluating response to therapy. 16Here, we confirm that FDG-PET/CT is a reliable predictor of outcomes in patients with NDMM, particularly those receiving ASCT. Reduction of FDG uptake after therapy, in both FLs and BM, was an independent predictor of durable disease control and prolonged OS. Applying the DS score to both FLs and BM, we found that nearly all patients showed some FDG uptake in the BM, with a low DS score not being associated with survival outcomes, probably indicating BM reconstitution after therapy.

In conclusion, our results confirm that FDG-PET/CT is a reliable predictor of long-term outcomes after therapy in transplantation-eligible patients with NDMM. The DS has been shown to be applicable and representative for the outcomes of patient with MM. On the basis of our results, we propose the liver background as a reference to identify PET CMR after therapy. If validated in independent prospective series of patients, these criteria could refine the definition of PET CMR and PET response criteria proposed by the IMWG in imaging MRD response criteria.

FDG PET/CT modality overview — tracer properties, CT role, and clinical applications are summarized: The most commonly used tracer at present is the 18F-labelled glucose analogue FDG, and FDG accumulation in tissue is proportional to the amount of glucose utilisation, with increased consumption of glucose characteristic of most cancers and related to overexpression of GLUT transporters and increased hexokinase activity. CT uses a combined X-ray transmission source and detector system rotating around the subject to generate tomographic images and allows not only attenuation correction but also the visualisation of morphological and anatomical structures with high spatial resolution. FDG PET has been proven to be a sensitive imaging modality for detection, staging and therapy response assessment in oncology, and FDG PET/CT provides essential information for radiation treatment planning, helping with critical decisions when delineating tumour volumes.

### Report of the 6th international workshop on PET in lymphoma [^1147DJY6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2017). Low credibility.

Two hundred and ten nuclear medicine physicians, radiologists, and hematologists from 26 countries attended the 6th International Workshop on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Lymphoma and Myeloma held in Menton, France, in September 2016. The meeting was under the auspices of the European Lymphoma Institute (ELI), the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA), the Italian Foundation on Lymphoma (FIL) and the Carnot Institute for Lymphoma (CALYM). Forty scientific posters were presented. For the first time, specialists in the field of multiple myeloma (MM) were involved in the expert session. The aim was to establish from the experience of Italian and French studies new guidelines of FDG-PET/CT reporting for myeloma staging and restaging. The meeting dedicated an entire session to MM imaging followed by a session on the role of PET in Peripheral T cell Lymphoma. An entire session addressed the issues of Deauville scale particularly for end treatment assessment and the challenging consequences of immunomodulatory treatments on PET reporting. A specific session presented the potential role of baseline metabolic tumor measurement to predict outcome and identify different risk categories and the main results obtained in different lymphoma entities were described. Whether it could replace clinical staging has been extensively discussed. The more recent results obtained in the H10 trial have been presented and compared to the published data in early stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Finally, the ongoing studies using PET for guiding therapeutic strategies have been reported by the various lymphoma cooperative groups that participated to the meeting.

FDG PET/CT was performed in a 47-year-old man to evaluate possible malignancy of the spine revealed by MRI. The PET images revealed numerous focal FDG activity throughout the skeletal system. In addition, multiple foci of the increased activity in the mediastinal and hilar nodes were noted, suggestive of sarcoidosis, which was proven following biopsy. Therapy for sarcoidosis was initiated. In the subsequent 4 follow-up FDG PET/CT scans, the activity in both the bones and mediastinal/hilar regions fluctuated. However, anatomical abnormality in the bones on the CT images was never visualized during the entire clinical course.

We describe a rare case of myocardial plasmacytoma staged and followed up with FDG PET/CT. A 72-year-old man was incidentally identified with a right ventricular apical mass, which was pathologically confirmed to be a plasmacytoma. A pre-treatment FDG PET/CT scan subsequently showed lesions not only in the right ventricle but also in the bones and mediastinal lymph nodes, which led to the change in treatment plan. Post-therapy PET scan revealed good response. This case demonstrates the value of FDG PET/CT in accurately staging unusually presented plasmacytoma and in monitoring response to treatment.

### Utility of PET / CT in assessing early treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^1176mgSq]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity in the biological background and the clinical presentation of MM dictates a multidimensional approach in disease assessment at diagnosis and at subsequent follow-up. The comprehensive nature of the whole-body PET/CT evaluation can address multiple disease-monitoring lapses for patients with MM and justifies some discrepancies between hematologic and imaging responses. For instance, as also shown in previous studies, differences in OS for patients with CR can be explained by the patchy pattern of malignant plasma cell infiltration into the BM. As a result, blind BM biopsies often miss the niche with the highest plasma cell population, leading to falsely reassuring results and inferior outcomes. PET/CT identifies areas with the highest metabolic activity in the BM and also depicts EMD. Although the typical secretory nature of plasma cells adds an easy-to-measure systematic component for disease monitoring (M-protein and/or serum-free light chain measurement from blood samples), our results, along with those of other studies, suggest inconsistent outcomes with varying levels of concordance between imaging and biochemical responses. These results highlight the diverse secretory behavior of plasma cells, which is especially relevant when early posttreatment changes preferentially alter the secretory kinetics of the malignant clone, when there may still be metabolically active disease detected by PET/CT.

Despite the clear implications of PET/CT for disease prognostication in MM, certain shortcomings need to be addressed. First, PET/CT has limited resolution for detecting FDG-avid lesions that are < 5 mm, which may be important in the posttreatment setting. Second, although PET/CT is very sensitive for monitoring focal lesions and detecting EMD, the sensitivity for diffuse marrow infiltration is lower compared with MRI, which may underestimate the disease burden for these patients. A particular limitation for MM is that a small subgroup of patients may not express the glucose transporters that are needed for radiotracer uptake and, thus, have a false-negative FDG PET/CT. A misleading lack of uptake can also be seen in patients who express low levels of hexokinase-2, which catalyzes the first step in the glycolytic pathway. Lastly, lack of standardization has been a major limitation for accurate disease quantification. Although standardized prognostic factors have been identified (eg, presence of > 3 focal lesions at diagnosis, SUV > 4.2), there is still little consistency in current reporting. A recent study validated the Deauville score, initially used for lymphoma, as an important prognostic indicator, and, hopefully, future studies incorporate more standardized approaches in PET/CT interpretation.

With rapid advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), imaging has become instrumental in detection of intramedullary and extramedullary disease, providing prognostic information, and assessing therapeutic efficacy. Whole-body low dose computed tomography (WBLDCT) has emerged as the study of choice to detect osteolytic bone disease. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) combines functional and morphologic information to identify MM disease activity and assess treatment response.

### Updates and ongoing challenges in imaging of multiple myeloma: expert panel narrative review [^115KT6q1]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Advances in the understanding and treatment of multiple myeloma have led to the need for more sensitive and accurate imaging of intramedullary and extramedullary disease. This role of imaging is underscored by recently revised imaging recommendations of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). This narrative review discusses these recommendations from the IMWG for different disease stages, focusing on advanced whole-body modalities, and addresses related challenges and controversies. In the recommendations, whole-body low-dose CT is central in initial patient assessment, replacing the conventional skeletal survey. Although the recommendations favor MRI for diagnosis because of its superior sensitivity and utility in identifying myeloma-defining events, FDG PET/CT is recommended as the modality of choice for assessing treatment response. Consensus opinions are offered regarding the role of imaging in multiple myeloma for characterization of disease distribution, determination of prognosis, and response evaluation.

### Malignancy rate of biopsied suspicious bone lesions identified on FDG PET / CT [^111ubXfJ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the malignancy rate of bone lesions identified on FDG PET/CT in patients who have undergone CT-guided biopsy because of the suspicion of malignancy.

Methods

This single-centre retrospective study spanned eight consecutive years and included all patients who underwent both FDG PET/CT and CT-guided bone biopsy because of the suspicion of malignancy. The positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy was calculated, and different patient and imaging characteristics were compared between malignant and benign bone lesions.

Results

Of 102 included patients with bone lesions that all showed FDG uptake exceeding mediastinal uptake, bone biopsy showed a malignant lesion in 91 patients, yielding a PPV for malignancy of 89.2% (95% CI 81.7–93.9%). In the 94 patients with bone lesions that showed FDG uptake exceeding liver uptake, bone biopsy showed a malignant lesion in 83 patients, yielding a PPV for malignancy of 88.3% (95% CI 80.1–93.5%). Higher age, bone marrow replacement of the lesion seen on CT, expansion of the lesion seen on CT, and presence of multifocal lesions on FDG PET/CT were significantly more frequent in patients with malignant lesions than in those with benign bone lesions (P = 0.044, P = 0.009, P = 0.015, and P = 0.019, respectively). Furthermore, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of cortical destruction (P = 0.056) and surrounding soft tissue mass (P = 0.063) in patients with malignant bone lesions.

Conclusion

The PPV for malignancy of suspicious bone lesions identified on FDG PET/CT is not sufficiently high to justify changes in patient management without histopathological confirmation. Nevertheless, ancillary patient and imaging characteristics may increase the likelihood of a malignant bone lesion.

Multiple myeloma — response assessment and MRD: All response categories require two consecutive assessments made any time before starting any new therapy; for MRD there is no need for consecutive assessments, but information on MRD after each treatment stage is recommended (eg, after induction, high-dose therapy/autologous HCT, consolidation, maintenance). MRD testing should be initiated at the time of suspected complete response. All categories of response and MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed, and radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG-PET if imaging MRD-negative status is reported. Sustained MRD negativity when reported should also annotate the method used (eg, sustained flow MRD-negative, sustained sequencing MRD-negative).

### Utility of PET / CT in assessing early treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^115Ji7AG]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

As a result, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) has incorporated imaging in the routine work-up of patients with MM to determine the extent of disease at diagnosis and posttreatment. Acceptable methods include whole-body computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, which are complementary to the standard disease assessment because they allow for detection of medullary disease and extramedullary disease (EMD), the latter of which is a known adverse prognostic finding in MM. Additionally, imaging is the only avenue for monitoring disease in patients with oligo-secretory and nonsecretory myeloma.

MRI and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT are sensitive methods for disease assessment in the BM and outside of the marrow (EMD). Although very helpful in the initial evaluation of patients with MM, and especially for diffuse BM infiltration, MRI may have difficulty distinguishing residual disease after treatment.PET/CT relies on the combination of morphologic information provided by CT and the functional metabolic information provided by PET. The CT component determines the presence of lytic lesions, generalized osteopenia, fractures, and extramedullary extension of disease. The PET component highlights the metabolic activity of each lesion and, thus, helps to adjudicate the initial extent of BM involvement and the response to therapy, because lytic lesions can remain stable for prolonged periods, despite a good response to treatment. PET/CT results are commonly reported with the standardized uptake values (SUVs), and the lesion with the most intense uptake is noted. Although the maximum SUV (SUVmax) is an important indicator of disease burden, it is still influenced by patient-specific factors (eg, weight), and more standardized methods are needed for accurate comparisons between patients.

Interpretation issues / pitfalls

There are several factors to consider when encountering metabolically active bone lesions on [18 F]FDG PET/CT:
A significant proportion of patients with MM present with anemia, which may manifest as an increase in BM uptake, reflecting a compensatory mechanism. This diffuse increase in BM uptake firstly, significantly reduces contrast resolution on PET and the ability to detect co-existent FLs, and secondly, makes it difficult to differentiate from diffuse BM infiltration. A DS ≥ 4 in the BM and the involvement of BM in limbs increase the probability of BM infiltration.
The metabolic profile of MM is heterogeneous and with variable [18 F]FDG uptake; 10–20% of patients have absent [18 F]FDG uptake at staging despite histological confirmation of BM infiltration and/or osteolytic lesions on CT. Despite this, a normal [18 F]FDG PET/CT is associated with better outcomes than those with a positive [18 F]FDG PET/CT in line with the well-known phenomenon of increased biological aggressiveness associated with increased glucose metabolism. Consequently, the sensitivity of [18 F]FDG PET/CT is variable and the interpretation of a single post-therapy [18 F]FDG PET/CT examination in the absence of baseline [18 F]FDG PET/CT examination carries the risk of inaccurate assessment response to therapy.
Interpretation of early focal BM uptake in the absence of osteolysis on CT is difficult, particularly in those with low glucose metabolism or anemia; it is good practice to consider focal uptake in two or more adjacent images.
Recent bone fractures can cause false positive [18 F]FDG uptake and can take at least one month to normalize, if related to trauma alone.
Osteosynthetic material can degrade image quality and result in false positive uptake at the bone-osteosynthetic material interface either related to ongoing bone healing or possibly bone infection.
Differentiation of EMD from an unrelated non-malignant pathology, e.g. inflammation, can be difficult and in cases of uncertainty targeted imaging or biopsy should be considered.
Given that the median age for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) is approximately 70 years, interpreting findings can be challenging. Degenerative changes in the skeleton may present abnormalities that resemble MM lesions. For instance, recent Schmorl nodules, which are in direct contact with the intersomatic disk and have an osteosclerotic rim, can exhibit uptake on CT images. Additionally, significant focal inflammatory uptake may be observed in tendons, osteophytes, and arthrosic degeneration. In such cases, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images can be helpful for accurate assessment.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells that accounts for 1% of all cancers and is the second most common hematologic malignancy after lymphoma. The unique secretory nature of plasma cells allows for accurate disease burden monitoring throughout the disease course, because patients who manage to substantially decrease their monoclonal protein (M-protein) levels enjoy prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Hematologic response in the posttreatment setting is determined by a combination of the plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) and the M-protein level in the blood or urine (by protein electrophoresis and immunofixation). As much as these parameters play an important prognostic role, they are restricted in their ability to account for the entire spectrum of possible MM presentations. For instance, the heterogeneous infiltration of the BM from the malignant clone introduces the possibility of a false-negative interpretation, because blind BM biopsies may miss areas of the skeleton with the greatest burden of disease. In addition, MM exhibits variable secretory and biologic behavior, resulting in many patients having suboptimal trajectories, despite achieving deep conventionally defined hematologic responses.

### Role of functional imaging in the management of lymphoma… [^115mq38t]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

PET/CT provides its greatest clinical benefit in the post-treatment evaluation of Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; however, the role of metabolic imaging in other indications and in other histologies remains to be demonstrated. Ongoing risk-adapted studies will hopefully provide evidence for clinical improvement on the basis of altering treatment as a result of interim PET results. Efforts are ongoing to better standardize the conduct and interpretation of FDG-PET scans. FDG-PET has the potential to improve lymphoma patient management; however, its usefulness will likely vary by histology, stage, therapy, and clinical setting. FDG-PET FDG-PET, and subsequently PET-CT, has emerged as the most important advance in the assessment of patients with lymphoma. FDG-PET is a noninvasive, three-dimensional, metabolic imaging technique that uses a radiopharmaceutical to target glucose metabolism.

The most widely used pharmaceutical is the radiolabeled glucose analog FDG, which is transported into cells and phosphorylated in a similar manner to glucose. FDG-PET is generally performed with a CT scan with low radiation dose, noncontrast, and unenhanced for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of lesions. However, scans incorporating a contrast-enhanced CT or a diagnostic CT/PET are associated with higher resolution and improved evaluation of extranodal disease and solid organs. 37–39, 22, 28, 40, 41In 614 patients, primarily with HL, omitting the bone marrow biopsy would only miss 8% of positive occurrences, with no apparent advantage to bilateral over unilateral sampling. 37Moreover, many patients with bone marrow involvement already have advanced disease so that a positive marrow would not influence therapy. PET-positive bone/bone marrow findings should be confirmed by biopsy or MRI if a change in treatment is planned based on these findings.

Bone marrow biopsy is more critical in NHL than HL to provide information as to histology of the involvement, which may be discordant with the primary tumor. PET is more accurate than CT in this setting related to its superiority in distinguishing between viable tumor and necrosis or fibrosis in residual mass. FDG-PET, conversely, relies on the dynamic properties of the tumor both during and after treatment to predict outcome. Numerous earlier studies, in which PET is performed after one to four cycles of a six- to eight-cycle chemotherapy regimen, suggested that midtreatment PET scans predict outcome.

Solitary plasmacytoma — initial imaging and follow-up: Whole-body MRI is the first choice for initial evaluation of solitary osseous plasmacytoma, while whole-body FDG-PET/CT is the first choice for solitary extraosseous plasmacytoma; MRI provides a higher sensitivity for a diffuse infiltration. In retrospective analyses, the risk of progression to multiple myeloma within 2 years of diagnosis has been higher with osseous plasmacytoma (35%) compared with extramedullary lesions (7%). Because the risk of progression into multiple myeloma or relapse is relatively high (14%–38% within the first 3 years of diagnosis), yearly follow-up with the same imaging technique used at first diagnosis should be performed for the first 5 years and subsequently only in case of clinical or laboratory signs or symptoms.

### Role ofF-FDG PET / CT in the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders: a consensus statement by the international myeloma working group [^1149tEJ3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

The International Myeloma Working Group consensus aimed to provide recommendations for the optimal use of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET/CT in patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders, including smouldering multiple myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma. 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be considered a valuable tool for the work-up of patients with both newly diagnosed and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma because it assesses bone damage with relatively high sensitivity and specificity, and detects extramedullary sites of proliferating clonal plasma cells while providing important prognostic information. The use of 18 F-FDG PET/CT is mandatory to confirm a suspected diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma, provided that whole-body MRI is unable to be performed, and to distinguish between smouldering and active multiple myeloma, if whole-body X-ray (WBXR) is negative and whole-body MRI is unavailable. Based on the ability of 18 F-FDG PET/CT to distinguish between metabolically active and inactive disease, this technique is now the preferred functional imaging modality to evaluate and to monitor the effect of therapy on myeloma-cell metabolism. Changes in FDG avidity can provide an earlier evaluation of response to therapy compared to MRI scans, and can predict outcomes, particularly for patients who are eligible to receive autologous stem-cell transplantation. 18 F-FDG PET/CT can be coupled with sensitive bone marrow-based techniques to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) inside and outside the bone marrow, helping to identify those patients who are defined as having imaging MRD negativity.

Literature notes limited sensitivity of skeletal survey, as there must be 30% trabecular bone loss to detect lytic lesions and expert review found additional abnormalities in 23% of cases; modern techniques identified upwards of 80% more lesions, WBCT versus skeletal survey revealed up to 60% more relevant findings leading to treatment changes in up to 20% of patients, IMWG recommends WBCT as the standard diagnostic tool, MRI and FDG-PET/CT have been equivalent for detection rates, and in smoldering myeloma 30% to 50% of patients have bone marrow abnormalities on MRI.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^113SfDCX]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines (orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology and oncology) before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely. These tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients. Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcome. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.

### Use of positron emission tomography for response assessment of lymphoma: consensus of the imaging subcommittee of international harmonization project in lymphoma… [^1137fNaD]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

The use of positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose for evaluation of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has increased dramatically during the last few years. 1, 2The widely used International Working Group criteria for response assessment of lymphoma, published in 1999, are based predominantly on computed tomography and do not include PET as part of response assessment. In contrast, pretreatment PET is mandatory for variably FDG-avid lymphomas, if PET is used to assess their response to treatment. These include aggressive NHL subtypes other than DLBCL, such as T-cell lymphomas, and all subtypes of indolent NHL other than follicular lymphoma, such as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue and small lymphocytic lymphoma reportedly exhibiting modest FDG avidity.

This mild degree of uptake usually is related to post-therapy inflammatory changes with mild macrophage infiltration rather than lymphoma, and may be present several weeks after completion of chemotherapy. However, many residual masses assessed after therapy conclusion do not have FDG uptake greater than background connective tissue. In contrast, patients with persistent lymphoma usually have moderate to intense uptake exceeding the activity of mediastinal blood pool structures.
6. Use of CT and PET or PET/CT for Response Assessment in Lymphoma Clinical Trials. If PET will be used for response assessment, baseline PET is strongly encouraged for lymphomas that are routinely FDG avid, and is obligatory for lymphomas with variable FDG avidity.

Although data from large prospective studies comparing IV contrast-enhanced PET/CT with PET plus a separately performed dedicated CECT are not yet available, IV contrast-enhanced PET/CT likely provides at least equal information to that provided by the sum of the latter two modalities and, therefore, represents an adequate alternative. Whole-body acquisition using a PET or PET/CT system should encompass at least the region between the base of the skull and the mid thigh, and can be acquired in either two- or three-dimensional mode. Whole-body imaging should begin 60 ± 10 minutes after the administration of FDG. The PET projection data should be corrected for random coincidences, scatter, and attenuation in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. The reconstructed PET or PET/CT images must be displayed on a computer workstation so that transaxial, sagittal, and coronal images can be viewed simultaneously.

### Diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography / computed tomography-driven biopsy for the diagnosis of lymphoma [^111mzbfU]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biopsy of affected tissue is required for lymphoma diagnosis and to plan treatment. Open incisional biopsy is traditionally the method of choice. Nevertheless, it requires hospitalization, availability of an operating room, and sometimes general anesthesia, and it is associated with several drawbacks. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) can be potentially used to drive biopsy to the most metabolically active area within a lymph node or extranodal masses.

Methods

A study of diagnostic accuracy was conducted to assess the performance of a PET-driven needle biopsy in patients with suspect active lymphoma.

Results

Overall, 99 procedures have been performed: three (3.0%) were interrupted because of pain but were successfully repeated in two cases. Median SUVmax of target lesions was 10.7. In 84/96 cases, the tissue was considered adequate to formulate a diagnosis (diagnostic yield of 87.5%) and to guide the following clinical decision. The target specimen was a lymph node in 60 cases and an extranodal site in 36. No serious adverse events occurred. The sensitivity of this procedure was 96%, with a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 75%.

Conclusion

Patients can benefit from a minimally invasive procedure which allows a timely and accurate diagnosis of lymphoma at onset or relapse.

### Performance of image-guided bone biopsies in malignant lesions: impact of PET / CT metabolic activity on the number of samples required [^1168inbH]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

However, obtaining high-quality samples can be challenging, as lesion characteristics such as location, size, and density may present technical challenges. Consequently, failing to optimize sample collection or selecting a suboptimal biopsy site can lead to diagnostic errors or inconclusive results, thereby increasing the need for repeat biopsies. In clinical practice, biopsy procedures often require a trade-off between various factors, such as diagnostic performance, procedural safety, and patient comfort. The goal is to achieve the best possible balance, ensuring sufficient tissue sampling while minimizing risks, including radiation exposure, procedural duration, and patient discomfort. Optimizing biopsy techniques, particularly determining the minimum number of samples required to achieve optimal diagnostic performance, remains a key issue in interventional radiology. Moreover, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-based guidance has been associated with enhanced diagnostic performance. FDG uptake is theoretically correlated with the proportion of active tumor cells, suggesting that targeting areas with high uptake could increase the likelihood of obtaining a diagnostic biopsy. Given that a significant number of patients undergo PET/CT as part of their clinical management, the metabolic characteristics of biopsied lesions may improve procedural efficiency and reduce the number of required samples. This could also impact the selection of the biopsy site in cases of multiple suspicious lesions, potentially prioritizing a metabolically active but technically challenging lesion over a more accessible but less active one. To our knowledge, the influence of metabolism on biopsy samples needed has never been studied.

The primary objective was to evaluate whether performing bone biopsies in a more hypermetabolic area would result in a diagnosis with fewer samples. The second objective was to identify additional predictive factors for optimizing biopsies targeting suspicious bone lesions.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: multiple myeloma, version 1.2025 [^112m26vu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — imaging for bone disease and initial diagnostic workup reports that CT alone or combined with FDG-PET has been shown to be significantly superior regarding the sensitivity to detect osteolytic lesions; in an IWMG multicenter analysis of 212 patients, whole-body CT was positive in 25.5% of patients with negative skeletal survey, and in a study of 29 patients, 5 (17%) showed osteolytic lesions in CT while skeletal survey results were negative. FDG-PET/CT identifies more lesions than plain x-rays and detects lesions with negative skeletal surveys; if FDG-PET/CT is chosen instead of whole-body low-dose CT, the CT part should be equivalent to a whole-body low-dose CT and is usually used only for attenuation correction, which may not be sufficient to assess bone disease and stability of the spine; whole-body PET/CT is useful for detecting extramedullary disease outside of the spine. For initial diagnostic workup of suspected MM, the NCCN Panel recommends either whole-body low-dose CT or FDG-PET/CT; skeletal survey including long bones is acceptable where advanced imaging is not available; CT contrast agents are not necessary and should generally be avoided; MRI and PET are useful for discerning smoldering myeloma from MM; and if whole-body low-dose CT or FDG-PET/ CT is negative, consider whole-body MRI without contrast to discern smoldering myeloma from MM.

### Multiple myeloma presenting as disseminated osteoblastic lesions with intense 18F-FDG uptake on PET / CT [^112TovFy]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 42-year-old woman presented with numbness and weakness in the lower limbs. The radiograph, MRI, and 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy revealed multiple bone lesions. The lesions were sclerotic on radiograph. Subsequent 18F-FDG PET/CT showed the lesions were disseminated and had intense 18F-FDG uptake. Monoclonal lambda plasmacytoma was confirmed after CT-guided biopsy of the third lumbar vertebral lesion. The laboratory data also showed a monoclonal immunoglobulin G lambda protein in serum and urine immunofixation. The patient was diagnosed as multiple myeloma finally. Multiple myeloma should be in the differential diagnosis scope of multiple osteoblastic lesions with intense 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT.

### Diagnostic accuracy of positron emission tomography / computed tomography-driven biopsy for the diagnosis of lymphoma [^112APMcQ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Here, we have presented the largest prospective clinical trial specifically involving patients with suspected lymphoma (or lymphoproliferative disorders in general) at onset or at relapse in which a needle biopsy of the affected anatomical structure was driven by fused CT and PET images. Importantly, this study has demonstrated a high diagnostic yield, with 87.5% of specimens being diagnostic, with an accuracy of 96%. This indicates that a PET/CT-driven procedure is reliable in obtaining a ready-to-use histopathological diagnosis, as it helps to select the most clinically meaningful lesion (or the most active area within a mass) in terms of FDG hypermetabolism, thus being adequate to confirm the clinical suspect of an active lymphoproliferative neoplasm. In addition, the rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen we have applied throughout the study further optimizes the performance of the approach by assessing the adequacy of the tissue, thus reducing the incidence of off-target sampling and biopsy repetition. Findings negative for malignancy were described in 14.3% of all the conclusive cases, and a diagnosis of hematological malignancy was overall excluded in 23.8% of all the diagnostic specimens. The negative predictive value was 75% (probability of being free from any neoplastic disease when the biopsy was negative for malignancy), which rose to 85% when referring to the probability of being free of lymphoma instead of any neoplasm in general. For this reason, patients with negative pathological findings, albeit displaying PET findings suspicious of malignancy, require a stringent follow-up and, ultimately, new tissue sampling if diagnostic doubts persist.

PET guidance putatively increases the yield of tissue representative of hematological malignancy, although PET-positive sites may also reflect inflammatory or reactive states or may be indicative of malignancies other than hematological. As far as patients with a clinical suspect of lymphoma are concerned, CT- and ultrasound-guided biopsies have a relatively lower capacity of sampling nodal or extranodal tissue clearly representative of lymphoma. This can be stated by taking into account the few prospective series described in literature, though data are generally hard to be compared: some studies are retrospective and only report outcomes in patients with a known diagnosis of lymphoma, thus with the limitation of a selection bias; other trials are only limited to superficial nodal lesions, in this sense excluding both deep nodes and extranodal sites which are the major indication for a needle biopsy approach.

Multiple myeloma — International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) minimal residual disease (MRD) response categories require a complete response and are defined as follows: Sustained MRD-negative requires MRD negativity in the marrow by next-generation flow (NGF), next-generation sequencing (NGS), or both and by imaging, confirmed minimum of 1 year apart, with subsequent evaluations specifying duration (e.g. MRD-negative at 5 years). Flow MRD-negative is absence of phenotypically aberrant clonal plasma cells by NGF on bone marrow aspirates using the EuroFlow standard operation procedure with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10⁵ nucleated cells or higher. Sequencing MRD-negative is absence of clonal plasma cells by NGS on bone marrow aspirate in which presence of a clone is defined as less than two identical sequencing reads, using a validated equivalent method with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10⁵ nucleated cells or higher. Imaging plus MRD-negative is MRD negativity by NGF or NGS plus disappearance of every area of increased tracer uptake found at baseline or a preceding FDG-PET/CT or decrease to less mediastinal blood pool standardized uptake value (SUV) or decrease to less than that of surrounding normal tissue.

Multiple myeloma — follow-up imaging: Advanced whole-body imaging (ie, FDG-PET/CT, low-dose CT, MRI without contrast) is recommended as needed; residual focal lesions detected by either FDG-PET/CT or MRI have been shown to be of adverse prognostic significance, and patients who do not have measurable levels of M protein or free light chain should be followed using imaging at regular intervals.

Lymphoma — PET/MRI roles in staging and response assessment are summarized: PET/CT-imaging is generally done for staging of FDG avid lymphoma (baseline), interim response assessment, and end of therapy response assessment, and the Lugano classification has incorporated PET in the staging of all FDG-avid lymphomas. PET-imaging based therapy response assessment criteria have a high negative predictive value of 95–100% for HL and 80–100% for aggressive NHL; residual lesions at interim assessment or after therapy are assessed with the Deauville score, and when residual disease remains at end of therapy, PET-positive sites may be used to guide biopsy prior to salvage therapy. Interim PET performed after 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy offers a window in chemosensitivity, and a negative interim PET in Hodgkin's lymphoma has been shown to indicate favorable response at end of therapy; in advanced-stage HL, interim PET can be used to tailor management. A routine PET/MRI staging protocol could include Dixon based attenuation correction sequences, a secondary plan with T2-sequence (with optional diffusion-weighted imaging) for pelvic coverage, and standard diagnostic-station sequences for mainly extra nodal sites, and depending on sequences this can be < 20 min. Unless contraindicated, contrast enhanced MR-imaging or diffusion-weighted imaging may add value for delineating extranodal disease, especially in bone marrow, and other extranodal sites such as brain or liver can be evaluated with improved accuracy on MR-imaging over CT-imaging. For multiple myeloma, PET/MR is described as well suited and PET- and MR-imaging are now already suggested in multiple myeloma classification. For response assessment, protocols may be abbreviated if a baseline scan exists; Dixon-based attenuation correction plus a T2-sequence or 3D post contrast T1-imaging may suffice to identify and measure residual masses and assign the Deauville score, and it is important to note and measure all residual masses along with metabolic response score.

### Utility of PET / CT in assessing early treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma [^111PXP9e]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

At diagnosis, the presence of > 3 metabolically active lesions and an SUV > 4.2 has been consistently associated with inferior outcomes.PET/CT is also relevant in the posttreatment setting, and studies have shown the prognostic significance of decreased metabolic activity after induction therapy (as early as 7 days from the start of treatment). This is also true in the posttransplant setting; Kaddoura et al showed significantly increased PFS and OS for patients who achieve a negative PET/CT (−) response near day 100 (12.4 vs 24 months for PFS, P < .0001; and 47.2 vs 100 months for OS, P < .001). Prognostic significance was also observed for patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, patients are still primarily followed by biochemical methods; despite the general concordance with PFS and OS, unexpected results are often seen. Our study aimed to corroborate these findings and evaluate the additive value of PET/CT in the conventional hematologic response for patients with MM following initial induction treatment.

### Agreement between 18F-FDG PET / CT and whole-body magnetic resonance compared with skeletal survey for initial staging and response at end-of-treatment evaluation of patients with multiple myeloma [^111o9ra4]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we have analyzed lymph node involvement of MM. We found 6 of our MM patients presented with lymphatic involvement, all correctly detected with 18 F-FDG PET/CT but only 1 detected with WB-MR. Figure 5 presents one of these cases.

FIGURE 5
A 72-year-old woman diagnosed with MM who achieved a complete remission following an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant 10 years before. The patient was studied because of suspected relapse. Imaging confirmed a nodal recurrence in the neck and mediastinum, as seen in the WB-MR (A) and in the 18 F-FDG PET/CT. Here we present 18 F-FDG PET/CT images showing the high 18 F-FDG uptake in the right cervical conglomerate lymphadenopathy as can be seen in the axial CT (B), fused 18 F-FDG PET/CT (C), and 18 F-FDG PET (D), as well as in the coronal CT (E), fused 18 F-FDG PET/CT (F), and 18 F-FDG PET (G). The patient was treated with local radiotherapy and corticoid therapy (dexamethasone), achieving a complete remission evidenced by the absence of metabolic tumor activity in the 18 F-FDG PET/CT study, as can be seen in the following coronal images of CT (H), fused 18 F-FDG PET/CT (I), and 18 F-FDG PET (J). Whole-body MR was not done in the follow-up.

Clinical Pearls

1 UCD is generally characterized by asymptomatic slow growth of a lymph node station often located in the mediastinum.
2 For the diagnosis of UCD, an EBUS bronchoscopy is insufficient, and excisional biopsy is typically required.
3 High-contrast CT scan and PET-CT scan are important for ruling out MCD. Typical imaging findings are slow, progressive increase in the size of the mass and a subnormal SUV.
4 The treatment of choice for UCD is surgical excision. Continuous monitoring is essential to rule out recurrence of the disease.

Solitary plasmacytoma — initial evaluation and surveillance imaging: Whole-body FDG-PET/CT is the first choice for initial and continued evaluation of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma, and for solitary osseous plasmacytoma, whole-body MRI (or FDG-PET/CT if MRI is not available) is the first choice for initial evaluation; since the risk of progression of solitary plasmacytoma into MM or relapse is relatively high (14%–38% within the first 3 years of diagnosis), yearly follow-up with the imaging technique used at first diagnosis for the first 5 years and subsequently only in case of clinical or laboratory signs or symptoms.
