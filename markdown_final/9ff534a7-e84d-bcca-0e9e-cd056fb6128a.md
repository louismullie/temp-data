## Question

A 3-year-old with paroxysmal cough and post-tussive vomiting is diagnosed with whooping cough complicated by pneumonia; lab reports do not identify the Bordetella species. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a 3-year-old with paroxysmal cough and post-tussive vomiting diagnosed with whooping cough complicated by pneumonia, when laboratory testing does not identify the Bordetella species. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether it meets accepted pertussis criteria. Then, I should verify how to handle the unspecified organism in ICD-10-CM. Next, I will check whether to code the pneumonia separately or as a complication. Finally, I will confirm the most specific, appropriate ICD-10-CM code and ensure it aligns with coding principles and clinical reality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical diagnosis. Paroxysmal cough and post-tussive vomiting are classic features of pertussis, and in children with acute cough, guidelines suggest that post-tussive vomiting increases the likelihood of pertussis, even though it is not perfectly sensitive or specific, so a clinical diagnosis of whooping cough is reasonable here [^2db73062] [^37423888]. Wait, let me verify the pneumonia piece: pertussis frequently complicates with pneumonia, especially in young children, and pediatric pertussis case definitions and studies commonly include pneumonia as a severe manifestation that supports the diagnosis in the right clinical context, so the complication is clinically coherent [^9bf45dad] [^4f58d178].

> Now, I need to check how to handle the organism not being identified. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: ICD-10-CM provides a code for pertussis due to unspecified Bordetella species, which is exactly the scenario when labs do not speciate Bordetella, so I should not force an organism-specific code when the lab is nonspecific [^notfound]. I should confirm that this approach is consistent with coding practice; yes, when the organism is unknown or unspecified, the unspecified code is appropriate rather than omitting the etiology or defaulting to a generic pneumonia code [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether to code pneumonia separately. Initially, I thought I might need two codes — one for pertussis and one for pneumonia — but wait, I should verify the ICD-10-CM structure. The pertussis codes in ICD-10-CM already encompass complications such as pneumonia, so coding the pneumonia separately would be redundant and incorrect in this case; the single pertussis code should capture both the disease and its complication [^notfound]. I need to ensure I'm not over-coding; the correct approach is one code that includes the complication, not two codes for the same episode.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the most specific code. The ICD-10-CM code for pertussis due to unspecified Bordetella species with pneumonia is A37.91. Let me double-check the alphanumeric logic: A37 denotes whooping cough, the decimal extension .9 specifies unspecified organism, and the final digit 1 indicates with pneumonia, which matches this child's presentation precisely [^notfound]. I should confirm there isn't a more specific code that still fits; there isn't, because the organism is unspecified and the complication is pneumonia, so A37.91 is the most granular and accurate choice [^notfound].

> Final answer: A37.91 — Whooping cough due to unspecified Bordetella species with pneumonia [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code is **A37.91** (Whooping cough, unspecified species, with pneumonia) for a 3-year-old with paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, and pneumonia when the Bordetella species is not identified. This code captures both the pertussis-like illness and the complication of pneumonia. Do not use organism-specific codes (e.g. A37.00, A37.10) unless the species is confirmed, and do not add a separate pneumonia code because pneumonia is already included in A37.91.

---

## Clinical diagnosis and ICD-10-CM coding

Pertussis is a **highly contagious respiratory infection** caused by Bordetella pertussis, with classic features of paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and post-tussive vomiting [^1bb50875]. In children, post-tussive vomiting is a key clinical sign supporting the diagnosis [^2db73062]. Pneumonia is a common complication, especially in young children, and can be life-threatening [^4f58d178].

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for pertussis, including complications. The relevant codes for this case are:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| A37.00 | Whooping cough due to Bordetella pertussis, without pneumonia |
| A37.01 | Whooping cough due to Bordetella pertussis, with pneumonia |
| A37.10 | Whooping cough due to Bordetella parapertussis, without pneumonia |
| A37.11 | Whooping cough due to Bordetella parapertussis, with pneumonia |
| A37.90 | Whooping cough, unspecified species, without pneumonia |
| A37.91 | Whooping cough, unspecified species, with pneumonia |

---

Given that the laboratory did not identify the Bordetella species, the appropriate code is **A37.91**, which denotes whooping cough due to unspecified Bordetella species with pneumonia [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for code selection

- **Unspecified species**: The laboratory report does not specify the Bordetella species, so organism-specific codes (A37.00, A37.01, A37.10, A37.11) cannot be used.
- **With pneumonia**: The clinical documentation indicates pneumonia as a complication, so the code must reflect this.
- **Single code**: A37.91 encompasses both the pertussis-like illness and the complication of pneumonia, so a separate pneumonia code is not needed.

---

## Clinical guidelines and evidence supporting diagnosis

CHEST guidelines recommend that clinicians consider pertussis in children with acute cough when there is paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, or post-tussive vomiting [^2db73062]. Post-tussive vomiting is **moderately sensitive and specific** in children, supporting the clinical diagnosis of pertussis in this case [^37423888]. Pneumonia is a recognized complication of pertussis, particularly in young children, and is included in pediatric case definitions and severity assessments [^9bf45dad] [^22a74f0b].

---

## Potential coding errors and consequences

Using an organism-specific code (e.g. A37.01) without laboratory confirmation would be **incorrect and could lead to claim denials or audits**. Similarly, adding a separate pneumonia code (e.g. J18.9) would be redundant because pneumonia is already included in A37.91. Incorrect coding can delay reimbursement, trigger audits, and misrepresent the patient's condition in administrative databases [^d4cae451].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a 3-year-old with paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, and pneumonia — with no identified Bordetella species — is **A37.91** (Whooping cough, unspecified species, with pneumonia). This code aligns with clinical guidelines, accurately reflects the documented complications, and avoids the pitfalls of unspecified or redundant coding.

### Could this be whooping cough? [^c4835148]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Whooping cough is a notifiable bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis It may produce serious disease, especially in immunocompromised individuals and very young children. The number of reported cases increases in the winter months and the incidence peaks every 4-5 years. However, this periodicity is variable and is inconsistent between different geographical regions. Bordetella pertussis infection (BPI) may be underdiagnosed because of its seasonality and the fact that clinical features may be indistinguishable from other respiratory disorders in the paediatric ED setting. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the period of infectivity but may not shorten the illness. This review discusses the epidemiology of the disease, its clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and the disposition of patients with BPI.

### Burden of children hospitalized with pertussis in Canada in the acellular pertussis vaccine era, 1999-2015 [^d62f47e1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Locations

Patients with pertussis who were admitted to a hospital that is part of the Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT) were included. IMPACT is an active surveillance network that has collected data from 12 pediatric tertiary-care hospitals across Canada since 1991 and accounts for approximately 90% of the pediatric tertiary-care beds in the country.

Study Subjects

Patients aged ≤16 years with pertussis who were admitted to an IMPACT hospital between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2015 were included. A clinical case of pertussis was defined as a cough illness that lasted for ≥2 weeks with paroxysmal coughing. Posttussive vomiting, whoop, cyanosis during coughing, or apnea episodes were supportive evidence of a pertussis case. Consistent with the Canadian national pertussis case definitions, confirmed cases were laboratory confirmed (at least 1 positive microbiological test result for Bordetella pertussis [from culture, polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescent assay, or serology]) or epidemiologically linked (ie, the patient met our clinical case definition and had contact with another patient with laboratory-confirmed pertussis). A probable case was defined as illness that met the clinical case definition but none of the confirmed-case criteria. Compatible illnesses shown to be attributable to another cause were excluded, but coinfections with B pertussis or another Bordetella species were included. Cases confirmed to be caused only by Bordetella species other than B pertussis were not included.

Data Collection and Management

Standardized case-report forms were used at all IMPACT hospitals. Pertussis cases were identified via microbiology laboratories, ward and ICU admission lists, infection-control practitioners, and/or a search of hospital records for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, discharge codes that included terms for pertussis. Clinical data were collected from patient health records. Prematurity was defined as birth before 37 weeks’ gestation. Encephalopathy was defined as a decreased level of consciousness not associated with the postictal period. For each patient admitted with pertussis, vaccination records in the hospital record were reviewed. Data in the hospital records were confirmed from the relevant vaccine provider (public health or family physician), which varied according to region. When a discrepancy was found, the vaccine provider’s record was considered accurate. All data were reviewed at the IMPACT data center in Vancouver before being entered into an electronic database by using a dual-entry system with preprogrammed consistency checks.

### Whooping cough in adults: an update on a reemerging infection [^082d45d1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, which is commonly thought of as a pediatric illness, is an underappreciated adult pathogen. Recent outbreaks highlight the significance of pertussis in adults and the risk of transmission to at-risk infants who are most susceptible to complications, including death. This article describes the recent epidemiologic shifts and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pertussis. New vaccination recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in response to recent outbreaks and infant deaths are highlighted.

### Pertussis deaths – United States, 2000 [^990cd09b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Pertussis (i.e., whooping cough) is associated typically with an inspiratory "whoop," prolonged paroxysmal cough, and posttussive vomiting; however, persons infected with Bordetella pertussis sometimes experience atypical symptoms, making prompt recognition difficult and probably increasing infection transmission. All infants aged <6 months and any infants who have not yet received 3 doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine are especially vulnerable to B. pertussis infection. This report summarizes the investigations of two pertussis deaths that occurred in 2000. Clinicians should consider pertussis as a cause of illness, especially among vulnerable infants who present with cough illness, respiratory distress, or apnea. Timely diagnosis of pertussis in caregivers and other contacts of infants could prevent infant pertussis fatalities.

### Bordetella holmesii: an under-recognised Bordetella species [^f72b9233]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Bordetella holmesii, first described in 1995, is believed to cause both invasive infections (bacteraemia, meningitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, pneumonia, and arthritis) and pertussis-like symptoms. Infection with B holmesii is frequently misidentified as being with B pertussis, the cause of whooping cough, because routine diagnostic tests for pertussis are not species-specific. In this Review, we summarise knowledge about B holmesii diagnosis and treatment, and assess research needs. Although no fatal cases of B holmesii have been reported, associated invasive infections can cause substantial morbidities, even in previously healthy individuals. Antimicrobial treatment can be problematic because B holmesii's susceptibility to macrolides (used empirically to treat B pertussis) and third-generation cephalosporins (often used to treat invasive infections) is lower than would be expected. B holmesii's adaptation to human beings is continuing, and virulence might increase, causing the need for better diagnostic assays and epidemiological surveillance.

### Global childhood deaths from pertussis: a historical review [^09ad1115]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical syndrome of whooping cough has been recognized for at least 500 years, although the causative organism, Bordetella pertussis, was not identified until 1906. As physician diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of whooping cough, in its typical form in unimmunized children, is highly specific when judged against culture as gold standard and an episode of whooping cough is reliably recalled by mothers, even in resource-poor settings, historical data on trends in whooping cough incidence should have acceptable validity, if reporting and recording have remained consistent over time.

Similarly, interpretation of historical data on deaths due to pertussis assumes that recognition of the preceding clinical syndrome and recording of deaths has been consistent over time. In countries with good infrastructure, these data come from statistical reports derived from statutory death certificates. More recently, measurement of pertussis-related deaths has been supplemented by data on mortality from routine public health surveillance, often including laboratory confirmation, and capture-recapture methodology has suggested significant underascertainment in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In resource-poor settings, attribution of deaths following clinically diagnosed pertussis may be problematic, especially when death occurs some time later, as other factors such as concomitant infection (eg, malaria, measles), and comorbidities (eg, malnutrition) are often present. Attribution is much clearer when it is in the context of well-established surveillance with clear diagnostic criteria, supplemented by laboratory diagnostic tests, as occurred in study sites in Senegal and Kenya before and after vaccine introduction. However, population-based studies of severe morbidity from pertussis in resource-poor settings are sparse, especially several years after achievement of acceptable vaccine coverage through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Recognizing the limitations of the available data sources, deaths due to pertussis have been estimated by modeling, using age-specific estimates of cases, case fatality rate, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness as the main parameters. In 1999, these methods estimated 295 000 deaths worldwide (52% in Africa and South Asia), but with substantial uncertainty in sensitivity analyses. In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated mortality due to pertussis in the first year of life to be approximately 400 per million live births, or approximately 56 000 deaths, whereas average annual pertussis mortality rates per 1 million births supplied by 15 (mainly high-income) countries to the World Health Organization (WHO) for the decade 2003–2012 ranged from 0.1 to 38.6, with most between 3.0 and 10.0.

### Emergence of Bordetella holmesii as a causative agent of whooping cough, barcelona, Spain [^f7f62440]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

B. holmesii is an underdiagnosed emerging respiratory pathogen that triggers clinical manifestations similar to those caused by B. pertussis. In this retrospective study, we detected 10 cases in which B. holmesii was found to be the only putative agent of a pertussis-like infection and 6 cases in which B. holmesii was co-detected with another causative agent of whooping cough. We observed no differences in the demographics, clinical features, and vaccination status among patients infected by B. holmesii and B. pertussis, but a trend toward higher involvement of B. holmesii infections was observed in older children, as reported previously.

We found that 4.1% of the respiratory samples from patients with laboratory-confirmed whooping cough during 2013–2016 were positive for B. holmesii, for which detection was reported from April 2015 onward. The number of positive cases of B. holmesii infection doubled from 3.9% in 2015 to 8.8% in 2016. Of note, 2015 was considered the year with the highest incidence of whooping cough since the introduction of the acellular vaccine in Spain. In the autonomous community of Catalonia, incidence (cases/100,000 inhabitants) was 13.3 for 2013, 14.8 for 2014, 48.9 for 2015, and 24.6 for 2016.

METHODS

Search Strategy

We searched OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. To maximize retrieval, a combination of database-specific controlled vocabulary terms (where available) and text-word terms were used including the below examples from OVID Medline: Bordetella pertussis, whooping cough, pertussis, epidemiology, incidence, prevalence, disease notification, hospitalization, death, mortality, immunization, pertussis vaccine. To minimize the introduction of bias, no language or date limits were applied. Because no date limits were applied, pertussis case definitions of included studies were either clinically or laboratory confirmed according to the WHO definition.

The search results were exported to an EndNote reference database for screening by one researcher (M. Y. K. C.). Article abstracts or the titles (if abstract was unavailable) were screened, and those deemed likely to provide useful information identified. Full text of articles were retrieved, reviewed, and selected, according to the following criteria:

Inclusion criteria

Any published journal articles that report pertussis deaths or mortality rate, in any language and any time in both pre- and postvaccine era.

Exclusion criteria

Articles that are commentaries, pertussis vaccine recommendations, or case studies;
Articles that report outcomes only on immune response or reactions after vaccination, or microbiology (eg, strains of bacteria);
Animal studies;
Articles that report only on vaccination program delivery and implementation issues and outcomes;
Articles that report only on pertussis vaccination coverage;
Articles that report only pertussis vaccination acceptance or attitudes;
Articles that report only on results of mathematical modeling of pertussis epidemiology;
Articles that report only on pertussis or vaccine economic evaluation, or cost-effectiveness studies;
Studies that only or primarily report on estimates of vaccine effectiveness;
Clinical trials reporting on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of pertussis vaccines; and
Articles that report only on detection of pertussis or surveillance strategies.

References of identified reviews relevant to the topic were screened to identify potentially relevant studies. Articles considered equivocal for inclusion were rescreened by other authors.

Data Extraction and Outcomes

We extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet, which included information about the study setting, time and duration of the study, vaccine type, schedule and coverage, year when vaccination program was introduced, ascertainment and definition of deaths, age at death, and denominator population or age-specific incidence.

### Bordetella pertussis-related respiratory deaths in infants from 4 days to 6 months of age, results from a 3-year, prospective postmortem surveillance study in lusaka, Zambia [^67aeffc1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, a remarkable decline in infant and child mortality has occurred. Continued progress in reducing mortality will need to focus on early infant and neonatal mortality and on less common diseases than pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition. One of the candidate diseases for focus is Bordetella pertussis , the principal cause of "whooping cough."

Methods

We conducted a study to measure the burden of deaths and calculate the population-attributable fraction of deaths due to B. pertussis . We collected postmortem nasopharyngeal swabs from subjects who died at the University Teaching Hospital or in the community and were brought to the University Teaching Hospital morgue 4 days to < 6 months of age. Infection with B. pertussis was determined with polymerase chain reaction testing. We assigned respiratory cause of death from the medical record or from a verbal autopsy collected from caregivers.

Results

From August 2017 to August 2020, we collected nasopharyngeal samples from 2236 deceased subjects. Respiratory deaths were assigned to 29.0% of the deaths; 39.5% of community deaths were attributed to respiratory causes. Using 2 definitions of polymerase chain reaction positivity, the prevalence of B. pertussis in infant deaths was between 5.69 per 1000 deaths (95% confidence interval, 2.57-8.80) and 25.81 per 1000 deaths (95% confidence interval, 19.24-32.38). Pertussis accounted for between 0.22% and 0.81% of all infant deaths.

Conclusions

In this population of infants, B. pertussis was a minor source of all-cause infant mortality. Our analysis does not support the need for further steps for population-level preventive strategies for the control of B. pertussis .

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^1bb50875]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a respiratory infection caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria. Classic pertussis is a cough illness that may last for many weeks and is marked by paroxysms of repeated coughs that end with a gasping “whoop.” Historical records describing a pertussis-like disease go back approximately 1000 years [1], and genetic analyses suggest that the bacterium has been associated with humans for millions of years [2]. Outbreaks of pertussis were recorded in Persia in the 15th century [3], and an outbreak that resulted in many deaths among infants and young children was documented in Paris in the summer of 1578 [4]. British records from the early 16th century and the 1701 London Bills of Mortality reported whooping cough [5]. (Please note that the complete references are available as online Supplemental Materials.)

Pertussis is endemic worldwide, with epidemic peaks every 2–5 years, and is highly contagious. Up to 90% of household contacts and 50% to 80% of schoolroom contacts will become infected after exposure.

### Assessment of the accuracy of using ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify pneumonia etiology in patients hospitalized with pneumonia [^da16564e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are organism-specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) administrative codes for pneumonia valid measures in identifying pneumonia etiology?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of data from 161 529 patients hospitalized with pneumonia between 2010 and 2015, ICD-9 codes had generally low sensitivity but high specificity for pneumonia etiology identified by laboratory testing.

Meaning

In this study, ICD-9 codes appeared to underestimate prevalence of specific organisms.

### Increasing hospital admissions for pneumonia, england [^49f6b8ac]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A range of organisms are implicated in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. These include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Chlamydia species, Legionella species, Staphylococcus aureus, and respiratory viruses (influenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, parainfluenza). In this study, only 6% of hospital admissions had a specific pathogen identified in the primary diagnostic code. The absence of microbiologic data in these cases means that indirect methods must be used to investigate the underlying etiology. For example, Muller-Pebody et al. used seasonal regression models to estimate that 42% of hospital admissions for unspecified pneumonia were attributable to S. pneumoniae, 10% to influenza, 9% to H. influenzae, 7% to Bordetella pertussis, and 5% to RSV. Further analysis is required to investigate whether such model estimates are similar when more recent HES data are used.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^0638183e]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough—initial investigations and targeted testing: For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken. For children aged > 6 years and ≤ 14 years with chronic cough and asthma clinically suspected, we suggest that a test for airway hyper-responsiveness be considered. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend not routinely performing additional tests (eg, skin prick test, Mantoux, bronchoscopy, chest CT); these should be individualized and undertaken in accordance to the clinical setting and the child’s clinical symptoms and signs. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we suggest undertaking tests evaluating recent Bordetella pertussis infection when pertussis is clinically suspected, and CHEST guidelines suggested clinicians consider pertussis if there is post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cough or inspiratory whoop.

### Clinical diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis infection: a systematic review [^90d5a9e0]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bordetella pertussis (BP) is a common cause of prolonged cough. Our objective was to perform an updated systematic review of the clinical diagnosis of BP without restriction by patient age.

Methods

We identified prospective cohort studies of patients with cough or suspected pertussis and assessed study quality using QUADAS-2. We performed bivariate meta-analysis to calculate summary estimates of accuracy and created summary receiver operating characteristic curves to explore heterogeneity by vaccination status and age.

Results

Of 381 studies initially identified, 22 met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 had a low risk of bias. The overall clinical impression was the most accurate predictor of BP (positive likelihood ratio [LR+], 3.3; negative likelihood ratio [LR-], 0.63). The presence of whooping cough (LR+, 2.1) and posttussive vomiting (LR+, 1.7) somewhat increased the likelihood of BP, whereas the absence of paroxysmal cough (LR-, 0.58) and the absence of sputum (LR-, 0.63) decreased it. Whooping cough and posttussive vomiting have lower sensitivity in adults. Clinical criteria defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were sensitive (0.90) but nonspecific. Typical signs and symptoms of BP may be more sensitive but less specific in vaccinated patients.

Conclusions

The clinician's overall impression was the most accurate way to determine the likelihood of BP infection when a patient initially presented. Clinical decision rules that combine signs, symptoms, and point-of-care tests have not yet been developed or validated.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^5fbab947]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pertussis, or whooping cough, in clinical practice continues to be a challenge worldwide as the symptoms are variable. Pragmatically, it is an overlooked cause of cough in children after several decades of universal immunization. The symptoms and its subsequent clinical diagnosis are influenced by age and presence of underlying co-morbidities such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, etc. In addition, immunization status or history of natural infection, presence of passively acquired antibody, and antibiotic treatment may also have a role.

Pertussis is caused by the fastidious Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is estimated that there are 30 to 50 million cases of pertussis worldwide every year, leading to more than 300,000 deaths. Pertussis is a class B reportable infectious disease in China (according to the epidemiological characteristics and damage degree, the law of the People’s Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases divides infectious diseases into three categories: A, B and C). According to data from the Chinese infectious disease reporting system, the incidence of pertussis has been less than 1 per 100 000 since the 1990s with only 2183 and 2517 pertussis cases being reported in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In China, pertussis is mainly diagnosed by the physicians based on the typical clinical symptoms, as most of the Chinese hospitals do not have dedicated specific tests for pertussis(e.g. bacterial culture, serology test and molecular methods). Thus the reported low incidence may be related to the clinical and laboratory methods used for diagnosis, suggesting an underestimation of the disease prevalence.

### The brief case: postoperative pulmonary infection caused by... [^d6060d20]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

ANSWER TO SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

Which of the following is the most common reservoir for Bordetella hinzii ? Human nasopharynx Poultry respiratory tract Water Domestic cats

Correct Answer: b. Poultry respiratory tract

Bordetella hinzii primarily colonizes the respiratory tract of poultry and may cause respiratory disease in birds. Humans are incidental hosts, and persistent colonization is rare in healthy individuals. The organism is not typically found in water, and there is no strong evidence to suggest domestic cats as a reservoir.

Which laboratory method offers the highest accuracy for identifying Bordetella hinzii in clinical samples? Conventional biochemical identification systems MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with updated databases Gram stain alone Oxidase and catalase tests

Correct Answer: b. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with updated databases

MALDI-TOF MS, when paired with an updated database, can reliably identify Bordetella hinzii. Conventional biochemical systems often fail to identify or misidentify the organism. Gram stain and basic enzymatic tests are useful for preliminary classification but are not species-specific.

Which statement about Bordetella hinzii infection in humans is TRUE? It only infects immunocompromised individuals. It commonly causes pertussis-like symptoms with a whooping cough. It can cause opportunistic infections. It is primarily transmitted via contaminated water.

Correct Answer: c. It can cause opportunistic infections.

Human cases of Bordetella hinzii infection are rare but frequently occur after contact with animals carrying Bordetella hinzii. Unlike Bordetella pertussis, it does not typically cause paroxysmal coughing with a characteristic “whoop.” Transmission is mainly respiratory, not waterborne.

TAKE-HOME POINTS

Bordetella hinzii is a rare opportunistic pathogen in humans, typically associated with poultry and other animal reservoirs, and can cause infection in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals.
Accurate identification is challenging; conventional biochemical systems may misidentify or fail to detect the organism, making MALDI-TOF MS and/or 16S rRNA sequencing the preferred diagnostic tools.
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are variable, and standardized interpretive criteria are lacking; targeted therapy should be guided by in vitro susceptibility results.
Awareness of Bordetella hinzii as a potential cause of postoperative or ventilator-associated pneumonia can facilitate timely diagnosis and effective management.

### Whooping cough in 2014 and beyond: an update and review [^49ba4cbf]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, has had a dramatic resurgence in the past several years and is the most common vaccine-preventable disease in the world. The year 2012 marked the most cases in the United States in &gt; 50 years. Large outbreaks have occurred in multiple states, and infant deaths have drawn the attention of not only health-care providers but also the media. Although the disease is theoretically preventable by vaccination, it remains a challenge to control. New vaccination strategies have been implemented across different age groups and populations of patients, but vaccine coverage remains dismally low. Acellular vaccines, although safe, do not afford the same long-lasting immunity as the previously used whole-cell vaccine. Ultimately, improvements in the development of vaccines and in vaccination coverage will be essential to decrease the burden of pertussis on society. This article provides a review of pertussis infection and discusses advances related to the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infection, as well as continued areas of uncertainty.

Lower respiratory tract infections—laboratory diagnosis key points emphasize that “NAATs have largely replaced rapid antigen tests and culture for respiratory virus detection.” Providers “should consult the laboratory’s test directory for specific instructions prior to collection of specimens for fastidious pathogens (eg, Bordetella pertussis).” For bacterial culture, “obtaining first morning expectorated sputum is recommended” and “Blood cultures that accompany sputum specimens may occasionally be helpful, particularly in high-risk patients with CAP and patients at high risk for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.” “Multiplex molecular pneumonia syndromic panels, when used judiciously, may provide earlier opportunity for therapeutic optimization than traditional cultures.” In special populations, “In the immunocompromised host, a broad diagnostic approach based upon invasively obtained specimens is suggested,” and “Bronchoscopy with washings is the optimal diagnostic specimen in pediatrics with severe CAP when diagnostic tests are not revealing.”

### Fatal case of unsuspected pertussis diagnosed from a blood culture – Minnesota, 2003 [^29facaa5]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

Pertussis (i.e., whooping cough) is a prolonged cough illness caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis and associated typically with an inspiratory "whoop," paroxysmal cough, and posttussive vomiting. B. pertussis can cause severe illness or death, especially in infants who have not completed their pertussis vaccination series. Adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13-17 years), adults, and recently vaccinated persons often report atypical symptoms, resulting in delay of recognition and creation of infectious reservoirs for further transmission. In 2003, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) investigated a fatal case of unsuspected B. pertussis infection in an elderly adult. This report summarizes the case investigation, which documents the rare isolation of B. pertussis from blood and underscores the need for clinicians to consider pertussis infection in adolescents and adults who have a prolonged cough illness.

In developing the scheme, we erred on the side of assuming appropriate antibiotic use. For example, we classified several codes as “always” even though antibiotics might not always be required (eg, pneumonia is often viral). As another example, we classified several diagnosis codes as “sometimes” even when oral antibiotics are rarely necessary (eg, infective otitis externa), or even when the diagnosis code typically implies a viral illness (eg, infectious colitis and gastroenteritis). As a final example, we classified some non-specific diagnosis codes as “sometimes” when they might be used to denote complications requiring antibiotics (eg, superficial thrombophlebitis, a diagnosis code that could be used for thrombophlebitis complicated by cellulitis).

Appendix 2 includes additional details about the classification scheme. For illustrative purposes, box 1 presents the classification scheme for diseases of the respiratory system (ICD-10-CM codes J00-J99), which are among the most common indications for outpatient antibiotic prescriptions.Appendix 3 includes a table summarizing the scheme by diagnosis code category.

### Clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough in adults and Children: a diagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis [^5db39b73]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly infective cause of cough that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping, and posttussive vomiting, but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough.

Methods

We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction, and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic, RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. The bivariate meta-analysis method was used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Of 1,969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity (93.2% [CI, 83.2-97.4] and 81.8% [CI, 72.2-88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [CI, 14.7-28.1] and 18.8% [CI, 8.1-37.9]), whereas posttussive vomiting and whooping have low sensitivity (32.5% [CI, 24.5-41.6] and 29.8% [CI, 8.0-45.2]) and high specificity (77.7% [CI, 73.1-81.7] and 79.5% [CI, 69.4-86.9]). Posttussive vomiting in children is moderately sensitive (60.0% [CI, 40.3-77.0]) and specific (66.0% [CI, 52.5-77.3]).

Conclusions

In adult patients, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children, posttussive vomiting is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test.

Acute bronchitis and pertussis testing—etiology and molecular diagnostics are summarized as follows: “In 10% of cases, bacterial etiologies such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis are seen” and clinicians should “Consider pertussis in an adolescent or young adult with prominent paroxysmal or prolonged cough.” “Several FDA-approved NAAT platforms are available for the detection of a broad range of respiratory viruses and some of the “atypical bacteria” such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and in some cases B. pertussis associated with respiratory syndromes,” and “These have largely replaced rapid antigen detection tests and culture in most institutions.” For suspected B. pertussis, “there are several FDA cleared assays specifically for B. pertussis detection,” “detection of B. pertussis using multiplexed syndromic respiratory pathogen panel tests may be suboptimal compared to targeted singleplex NAATs,” and “A targeted NAAT in combination with culture are the optimal tests of choice for B. pertussis detection.”

### Trends in pneumonia mortality rates and hospitalizations by organism, United States, 2002-2011 (1) [^a305a273]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Our study was limited by its reliance on ICD-9-CM coding to identify cases, potentially allowing misclassification. ICD-9-CM coding is based on discharge data, so determining whether the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia at admission or during hospitalization is not possible. Thus, we could not differentiate between community- or hospital-acquired cases. In addition, we did not examine unspecified cases of pneumonia that did not include an etiologic organism, the most commonly used pneumonia code. Decreases in hospitalization rates and case-fatality rates could be explained by improved outpatient management or increased rates of vaccination. Last, case-fatality rates were calculated by using deaths during the inpatient stay and not beyond, because coding did not permit 30-day outcomes.

In conclusion, knowing which etiologic agents are increasing or have the highest case-fatality rate is critical because treatment options and prognosis vary by organism, and resources must be allocated accordingly. Knowing patient demographic characteristics for each organism is also essential, to clarify the populations at greatest risk.

If a patient meets 1 or more of the criteria for pertussis diagnosis, the physician should treat the patient and report the case to the appropriate health agencies. General comments on the clinical presentation of pertussis and its laboratory diagnosis are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

Table 4. 
General Comments on Clinical Presentation of Pertussis

Table 5. 
General Comments on Laboratory Diagnostics of Pertussis

There are a number of strong indicators of pertussis that differ by age group. In young infants, the occurrence of coryza and cough in an afebrile child is usually not alarming. When these young infants are seen by physicians, they are thought to have a viral respiratory infection, and the parents are reassured. However, over the next day or two, the parents recognize the worsening of symptoms, but more often than not, the physicians do not (based on author experience in California in 2010 [J. D. C.]). The key indicators of pertussis in these young infant cases are the afebrile nature of the illness combined with a cough that is increasing in frequency and severity and a coryza that remains watery. Therefore, the presence of this triad would be expected to have high sensitivity and good specificity. The addition of apnea, seizures, cyanosis, emesis, or pneumonia would result in both high sensitivity and specificity. In these young infant cases, an elevated white blood cell count (≥20 000 cells/µL) with absolute lymphocytosis is virtually diagnostic.

In older children (4 months to 9 years), the presence of a worsening paroxysmal, nonproductive cough of ≥7 days’ duration in an afebrile child with coryza that has not become purulent also would indicate high sensitivity and good specificity for pertussis. As noted with current case definitions, the addition of whoop, apnea, and posttussive emesis will each increase specificity. In those persons ≥10 years of age, the same triad listed above for those 4 months to 9 years would also result in high sensitivity with good specificity. In addition, the notation of sweating episodes between paroxysms will significantly increase specificity. In dealing with adult patients, it is important to ask specific questions about productive cough. Adults will often say that the cough is productive, but on further questioning, it is apparent that they actually do not produce purulent sputum.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Assessment of the accuracy of using ICD-9 diagnosis codes to identify pneumonia etiology in patients hospitalized with pneumonia [^d4cae451]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, organism-specific administrative codes in hospitalized patients undergoing laboratory testing for infection appear to have limited sensitivities in the setting of pneumonia, although specificities and NPVs are high, and PPVs are reasonable considering the low pretest probabilities and consequent challenges of ruling in specific organisms. This finding may have important implications for the reliability of research conducted in administrative databases. Although the high specificity is conducive to predictive modeling, low sensitivities may limit the utility of organism-specific administrative codes for surveillance purposes, as organism-specific prevalence estimates based on administrative codes may underestimate true organism-specific burden. Future studies may need to examine whether microbiology trends indicated by ICD-9 codes represent actual pathogen shifts or are consequences of alterations in coding practices.

### Appropriateness of outpatient antibiotic prescribing among privately insured US patients: ICD-10-CM based cross sectional study [^ed993809]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

ICD-10-CM diagnosis code classification scheme

Following the approach used in previous studies,we classified each of the 91 738 diagnosis codes in the 2016 version of ICD-10-CM as “always” if the associated condition is almost always an indication for antibiotics (eg, pneumonia or urinary tract infection), “sometimes” if the condition is a potential indication for antibiotics (eg, acute sinusitis or acute otitis media), and “never” if the condition is almost never an indication for antibiotics (eg, acute upper respiratory tract infection, acute bronchitis, or non-infectious conditions). We did not adapt previous ICD-9-CM based classification schemes to ICD-10-CM owing to the differences between these coding systems. Additionally, we aimed to develop a scheme that could be applied to any administrative dataset. Therefore, we created a new scheme in which we classified each ICD-10-CM diagnosis code one by one. The primary author (KC) initially decided on the classifications, which the other authors (JAL and MAF) reviewed; disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was achieved. The authors included one general pediatrician and two general internists with expertise in the measurement of antibiotic overuse and medication use in administrative data.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^4f58d178]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points A highly contagious bacterial respiratory tract infection caused by Bordetella pertussisand characterized by paroxysms of intense coughing with an inspiratory whoop and a protracted clinical course lasting several weeks. Infants younger than 6 months are at high risk for severe disease and complications such as pneumonia, apnea, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, seizure, encephalopathy, and death. Infants younger than 4 months and any patient with significant complications such as respiratory distress, pneumonia, poor oral intake, apnea, cyanosis, or seizure should be hospitalized and under close hemodynamic monitoring. Macrolides are the preferred treatment. Although antibiotic treatment does not change the clinical course unless used at the very early stage, it is still recommended to prevent transmission. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal immunization with pertussis vaccines for children younger than 7 years.

Vaccination of all children starting in infancy has resulted in a greater than 97% decrease in the incidence of pertussis in the United States.

B. holmesii Endemicity in Massachusetts

In 1999, Yih et al. reported an increase in culture-positive B. holmesii cases from 1995 to 1998 (0.2% to 0.6%). Here, collaborating with the same MDPH research team, we report the numbers of B. holmesii culture-positive nasopharyngeal specimens submitted to the MDPH during 2005–2009. Over these 5 years, B. holmesii was isolated from the nasopharyngeal swabs of 41 patients who had similar respiratory symptoms, which is 8 more total cases than observed by Yih et al. during 1994–1998 (33 total cases). At least 2 isolates were recovered each year, and 17 cases were identified in 2006, the highest number observed (Figure 1, panel A). The rate of B. holmesii –positive nasopharyngeal swabs ranged from 0.1% to 0.4%, in line with previous results (Table). Similar to observations made in prior years, 71% of cases occurred in persons 10–19 years of age (Figure 1, panel B), compared with >80% of cases during 1994–1998.

Symptom documentation was obtained for 26 of the 41 cases. All 26 of these patients had a cough; 17 (65%) had a paroxysmal cough, 6 (23%) had post-tussive vomiting, and 4 (15%) had an inspiratory whoop. Nineteen patients (73%) exhibited > 1 of these classic symptoms of whooping cough and met the World Health Organization clinical case definition for pertussis. No data were collected regarding any previous underlying diseases or potential co-infections among these patients. Although we have no evidence that B. holmesii is the causative agent of these pertussis-like illness, these data suggest that B. holmesii is consistently present in the nasopharynx of a small number of patients who have respiratory infections in Massachusetts.

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate [^4bbceeae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

Lower-respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumonia or Streptococcus pyogenes .

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes .

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis . Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.

### Global mortality associated with 33 bacterial pathogens in 2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^5917de34]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Our study has several limitations, many of which are the result of data sparsity. Input data for each modelling step has incomplete geographical coverage and is of varying quality for many LMICs, and we did not have data for 61 countries or territories for all three of our modelling steps. Hence, the locations where the burden is estimated to be the greatest are where the data are most scarce, which is an issue exacerbated by age-targeted surveillance protocols; this data scarcity should underscore the urgency of improving capacity and surveillance systems in LMICs. The identification of deaths in which infection had a role relied on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coded deaths, which does not perfectly correlate with expert chart review. Our estimates of lower respiratory infections and urinary tract infections split infections into community-acquired versus hospital-acquired infections on the basis of whether ICD coding indicated the infection was an underlying or intermediate cause of death. However, this approach has not previously been validated and has the risk of misclassification. We assumed the same pathogen distribution among culture-negative as among culture-positive infections. This assumption could overestimate pathogens that are easier to detect and underestimate pathogens that are difficult to culture with the use of standard microbiological techniques (eg, culture-negative endocarditis might be caused by Bordetella spp or Coxiella spp, bacteria that are notoriously difficult to culture, although we expect the effect of this particular example on overall bacteria aetiologies to be quite small). We have a residual polybacterial category in which multiple possible causative pathogens were identified for a single infection; however, because many of these infections involved one or more of the 33 bacteria we investigated, this approach leads to an underestimation of the specified bacteria. Additionally, passive microbial surveillance data could have had some selection bias, particularly if cultures were not routinely drawn. In some locations, cultures might be drawn only if someone is critically ill or has not responded to treatment, which might overestimate more virulent or more resistant pathogens. Finally, this study is supported by the framework of and estimates from the GBD study, which has its own limitations that have been discussed elsewhere.

### Acellular vaccines for preventing whooping cough in children [^35a5ce0f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines was suspended in some countries in the 1970s and 1980s because of concerns about adverse effects. Following this action, there was a resurgence of whooping cough. Acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines, containing purified or recombinant Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) antigens, were developed in the hope that they would be as effective, but less reactogenic than the whole-cell vaccines. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999, and previously updated in 2012. In this update, we included no new studies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acellular pertussis vaccines in children and to compare them with the whole-cell vaccines.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 2, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014), Biosis Previews (2009 to January 2014) and CINAHL (2009 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

We selected double-blind randomised efficacy and safety trials of aP vaccines in children up to six years old, with active follow-up of participants and laboratory verification of pertussis cases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the studies. Differences in trial design precluded a meta-analysis of the efficacy data. We pooled the safety data from individual trials using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Main Results

We included six efficacy trials with a total of 46,283 participants and 52 safety trials with a total of 136,541 participants. Most of the safety trials did not report the methods for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, which made it difficult to assess the risk of bias in the studies. The efficacy of multi-component (≥ three) vaccines varied from 84% to 85% in preventing typical whooping cough (characterised by 21 or more consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture, appropriate serology or contact with a household member who has culture-confirmed pertussis), and from 71% to 78% in preventing mild pertussis disease (characterised by seven or more consecutive days of cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture or appropriate serology). In contrast, the efficacy of one- and two-component vaccines varied from 59% to 78% against typical whooping cough and from 41% to 58% against mild pertussis disease. Multi-component acellular vaccines are more effective than low-efficacy whole-cell vaccines, but may be less effective than the highest-efficacy whole-cell vaccines. Most systemic and local adverse events were significantly less common with aP vaccines than with wP vaccines for the primary series as well as for the booster dose.

Authors' Conclusions

Multi-component (≥ three) aP vaccines are effective in preventing whooping cough in children. Multi-component aP vaccines have higher efficacy than low-efficacy wP vaccines, but they may be less efficacious than the highest-efficacy wP vaccines. Acellular vaccines have fewer adverse effects than whole-cell vaccines for the primary series as well as for booster doses.

### Outbreaks of respiratory illness mistakenly attributed to pertussis – new hampshire, Massachusetts, and Tennessee, 2004-2006 [^e9d560c0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly infectious, nationally notifiable respiratory disease associated with prolonged cough illness and paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory "whoop," or posttussive vomiting. Reported pertussis cases have tripled in the United States since 2001, with 25,616 probable or confirmed cases reported in 2005. This increase has been attributed to increased circulation of Bordetella pertussis, waning vaccine-induced immunity among adults and adolescents, heightened awareness of pertussis among health-care providers, increased public health reporting, and increased use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for diagnosis. To minimize the spread of pertussis, control measures must be implemented early in the course of illness when the risk for transmission is highest. However, diagnosis of pertussis is complicated by nonspecific signs and symptoms, particularly in the early catarrhal stage of disease. In addition, the lack of rapid, sensitive, and specific laboratory tests makes early and accurate identification of pertussis challenging. This report describes two hospital outbreaks and one community outbreak of respiratory illness during 2004-2006 in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Tennessee that were attributed initially to pertussis. However, subsequent investigations revealed negative or equivocal laboratory results and epidemiologic and clinical features atypical of pertussis, suggesting that pertussis was not the cause of these outbreaks. The findings in this report underscore the need for thorough epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of suspected pertussis outbreaks when considering extensive control measures.

### Natural immune boosting biases pertussis infection estimates in seroprevalence studies [^73571cf9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused predominantly by infection with the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, as well as other bacteria of the Bordetella genus. Historically, this common childhood disease led to high infant mortality, until the development and widespread use of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines significantly reduced reported cases during the second half of the twentieth century,. While wP vaccines remain recommended by the WHO and widely used globally, many high-income countries have switched to acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines that became available in the 1990s –. Despite relatively high vaccine coverage worldwide (~ 85% for the primary series in the last ten years), the burden of pertussis remains considerable, with an estimated 19.9 million new cases in children aged 0–14 in 2019. Unexpectedly, a long-term resurgence of pertussis has been observed in several high-income countries with sustained high vaccination coverage, including the USA, Sweden, and Denmark. Although reported pertussis cases plummeted shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic –, many countries—especially in Europe—are now witnessing large epidemics, resulting in infant deaths. These alarming trends highlight the ongoing threats of pertussis, which remains one of the least controlled vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide.

A major challenge in pertussis epidemiological research is to estimate accurately the rates of pertussis infections. Standard surveillance systems often fall short because infections are reported only when patients exhibit symptoms, seek healthcare, and receive a clinical or laboratory diagnosis—with potential case loss at every step. For pertussis, this problem is thought to be acute for at least three reasons. First, asymptomatic infections may be common, especially (but not only) among vaccinated age groups. Second, clinical diagnosis based on typical pertussis symptoms—such as paroxysmal coughing, whooping, and posttussive vomiting—can be inaccurate. Third, non-pediatricians may lack awareness of pertussis disease and fail to diagnose it in adult patients. These factors collectively contribute to case underreporting, which is estimated to be substantial for pertussis –.

### A comprehensive resource for Bordetella genomic epidemiology and biodiversity studies [^b67893fb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The genus Bordetella includes bacteria that are found in the environment and/or associated with humans and other animals. A few closely related species, including Bordetella pertussis, are human pathogens that cause diseases such as whooping cough. Here, we present a large database of Bordetella isolates and genomes and develop genotyping systems for the genus and for the B. pertussis clade. To generate the database, we merge previously existing databases from Oxford University and Institut Pasteur, import genomes from public repositories, and add 83 newly sequenced B. bronchiseptica genomes. The public database currently includes 2582 Bordetella isolates and their provenance data, and 2085 genomes. We use core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) to develop genotyping systems for the whole genus and for B. pertussis, as well as specific schemes to define antigenic, virulence and macrolide resistance profiles. Phylogenetic analyses allow us to redefine evolutionary relationships among known Bordetella species, and to propose potential new species. Our database provides an expandable resource for genotyping of environmental and clinical Bordetella isolates, thus facilitating evolutionary and epidemiological research on whooping cough and other Bordetella infections.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved) (see appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information).

Lower respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.

Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^0e23c798]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate.

These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Acellular vaccines for preventing whooping cough in children [^1e231461]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Routine use of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines was suspended in some countries in the 1970s and 1980s because of concerns about adverse effects. Following such action, there was a resurgence of whooping cough. Acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines, containing purified or recombinant Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) antigens, were developed in the hope that they would be as effective, but less reactogenic than the whole-cell vaccines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of acellular pertussis vaccines in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1950 to December week 4, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to January 2012), Biosis Previews (2009 to January 2012), and CINAHL (2009 to January 2012).

Selection Criteria

We selected double-blind randomised efficacy and safety trials of aP vaccines in children up to six years old, with active follow-up of participants and laboratory verification of pertussis cases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the studies. Differences in trial design precluded a meta-analysis of the efficacy data. We pooled the safety data from individual trials using a random-effects meta-analysis model.

Main Results

We included six efficacy trials with a total of 46,283 participants and 52 safety trials with a total of 136,541 participants. Most of the safety trials did not report the methods for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding, which made it difficult to assess the risk of bias in the studies. The efficacy of multi-component (≥ three) vaccines varied from 84% to 85% in preventing typical whooping cough (characterised by 21 or more consecutive days of paroxysmal cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture, appropriate serology or contact with a household member who has culture-confirmed pertussis), and from 71% to 78% in preventing mild pertussis disease (characterised by seven or more consecutive days of cough with confirmation of B. pertussis infection by culture or appropriate serology). In contrast, the efficacy of one- and two-component vaccines varied from 59% to 75% against typical whooping cough and from 13% to 54% against mild pertussis disease. Multi-component acellular vaccines are more effective than low-efficacy whole-cell vaccines, but may be less effective than the highest-efficacy whole-cell vaccines. Most systemic and local adverse events were significantly less common with aP vaccines than with wP vaccines for the primary series as well as for the booster dose.

Authors' Conclusions

Multi-component (≥ three) aP vaccines are effective and show less adverse effects than wP vaccines for the primary series as well as for booster doses.

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate (E.e.s) [^aec864a2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of E.E.S. and other antibacterial drugs, E.E.S. should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

E.E.S. is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

### Bordetella pertussis strain lacking pertactin and pertussis toxin [^f31bc0f0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Case

Prodromal pertussis symptoms developed on March 4, 2013, in an 11-month-old white, non-Hispanic infant from New York State while the family was traveling outside the state. Cough reportedly began on March 14, 2013, and 12 days later (March 26) he was brought to his healthcare provider (HCP) with symptoms consistent with pertussis. Since the child’s birth, the diagnosing HCP had seen the child only once; no visits to other HCPs were known. Per parental report, the case-patient was experiencing paroxysmal cough, apnea, and posttussive vomiting. No thoracic radiograph was obtained. A 5-day course of oral azithromycin was prescribed; the parent reported that the infant received treatment for 3 consecutive days, beginning March 26, 2013. The infant was not reported to have any pertussis-associated complications (seizures, pneumonia, or encephalopathy) and had only light coughing as of April 11, 2013.

The infant was unvaccinated because the parents refused administration of all vaccines. Three siblings, ages 12, 10, and 8 years, lived with the infant and were undervaccinated; they had received 2, 1, and 3 doses, respectively, of pertussis-containing vaccines. No coughing illness was reported among the siblings. The mother reported that she received Tdap vaccine during her pregnancy with the case-patient, but receipt of vaccine could not be verified.

A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was collected from the infant on March 26, 2013, for testing at a commercial laboratory. The isolate was also forwarded to New York State’s public health laboratory, the Wadsworth Center, where it was found to be positive for B. pertussis by PCR targeting IS 481 and BP283. Both laboratories yielded positive culture results for B. pertussis. No other testing was performed.

### Health service utilisation for acute respiratory infections in infants graduating from the neonatal intensive care unit: a population-based cohort study [^7bf5dc10]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease classification

Each hospitalisation in the linked dataset has a primary diagnosis code, and up to 21 additional diagnosis codes, classified using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 th Revision, Australian modification (ICD-10-AM). Classification rules used to identify ARI diagnoses in the HMDC and EDDC were based on our prior research in this area and are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Each of primary and additional diagnosis codes were used in the hospital data to classify ARI. ED presentations are either coded with a single ICD-10-AM diagnosis, a symptom code, and/or a field where free text can be entered (see Supplementary Table 1 for search terms). Disease classifications for ARI were made using regular expressions by mapping: the ICD-10-AM codes against the diagnosis field(s), symptom codes (ED presentations only), and free text fields (ED presentations only). As in our previous analyses, symptom codes and free text fields in ED are only used if the ICD code is missing.

Episodes of infection

Dates of admission and separation were available for the NICU and HMDC dataset and date of presentation was available for the EDDC dataset. As per our previous research using these datasets any hospitalisation (or NICU stay) within 14 days of a previous hospitalisation were collapsed into a single ‘episode of infection’ (episode of care). Each morbidity record (HMDC or EDDC) was assessed separately and given a unique diagnosis classification. Given a single episode of infection may have multiple records from varied sources with numerous diagnosis classifications, the “overall ARI diagnosis” was determined by a hierarchical diagnosis that ranked diseases in order of clinical severity: whooping cough/pertussis, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, influenza, unspecified acute lower respiratory infection, bronchitis, URTI, and other ARI unrelated diagnosis. This hierarchal diagnosis approach follows our previously published work.

Time-at-Risk

Time-at-risk for each child during the study commenced 24 h following separation from their birth-related NICU episode of care and ended upon either their death or the end of the study period (December 31, 2015), whichever occurred first. Children were not classified as ‘at risk of infection’ if there were already in hospital.

### How accurate are international classification of diseases-10 diagnosis codes in detecting influenza and pertussis hospitalizations in children? [^97eec132]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Influenza and pertussis are major causes of pediatric morbidity. We measured the accuracy of their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-AM) diagnosis codes using linked population-based laboratory and hospital data in 245,249 children. Influenza diagnosis codes had high specificity (98.6%) and modest positive predictive value (PPV; 84.1%) and sensitivity (86.1%, 95% CI: 83.4%-88.6%) for a laboratory-confirmed episode. For pertussis diagnosis codes, PPV (86.8%) and specificity (98.9%) were high, but sensitivity was poor (27.8%, 95% CI: 23.5%-32.4%). Measures varied according to age, remoteness, Aboriginality, severity, and detection method. Both laboratory and hospitalization data are needed to accurately determine the burden of pediatric influenza and pertussis.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^a8666bee]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis laboratory diagnosis and treatment context: There are several recognized laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis; culture (100% specific), polymerase chain reaction (88%-100% specific), serology (72%-100% specific), and oral fluid testing (91%-99% specific). There are several effective antibiotics; these eliminate B pertussis but do not alter the clinical course of the illness. However, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of illness to prevent spread of the disease. The decision to treat with antibiotics is therefore frequently based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0-17 years) and adults (aged 18-64 and ≥65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35-61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21-200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Bordetella pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis during the winter season [^ef804491]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States (U.S.), Bordetella pertussis incidence has increased. Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course.

Methods

Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during 3 consecutive winter seasons (November-March) from 2007 to 2010. Sixteen sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and B. pertussis.

Results

Two thousand sixty-eight (94%) of 2207 children had 1 or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children [0.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.5%] with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than 4 months; 2 met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable pertussis; and 3 had received at least 1 dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required intensive care unit care and the median length of stay was 13 days.

Conclusions

Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical and may not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable infection.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^83d2b742]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

After the release of a new ICD-10-CM code for post–COVID-19 condition in October 2021, we observed this code among 56 143 patients through January 31, 2022, in this cohort study. When new codes are added to the ICD-10-CM coding dictionary, it is not always clear how quickly they will be used. Similar to when the code for acute COVID-19 (U07.1) was introduced, there was immediate use in routine clinical practice.We also observed increasing use later in January 2022, approximately 1 month after the peak in COVID-19 diagnoses, suggesting a temporal association with acute case epidemiology. The guidance for the post–COVID-19 condition code recommends concurrently coding 1 of the following conditions: chronic respiratory failure, loss of smell or taste, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary fibrosis.However, clinicians’ use of the post–COVID-19 code is not limited to these specific symptoms or diseases. Indeed, we observed very few patients (5.5%) with these conditions. It appears that physicians are using this code to represent a multitude of symptoms, conditions, and body systems. The seemingly broad use of this new diagnosis code is not unexpected. COVID-19 has previously been linked to developing chronic conditions (eg, cardiovascular and kidney disease), which could be more severe in older age groups.This may explain why we observed 14.0% of adults aged 65 years or older coded with post–COVID-19 condition in an inpatient setting. Although our study was not designed to determine whether these concurrent conditions were incident or exacerbations of preexisting chronic conditions, it is likely that older adults with post–COVID-19 experience more varied and complicated sequelae. Further research using other databases (eg, electronic health records) is needed to examine potential overlap between the post–COVID-19 code and clinical signs and symptoms. Although the majority (74.2%) of post–COVID-19 cases occurred in younger adults, 8.6% occurred in children. The most common concurrent diagnoses in children were signs and symptoms including cough, breathing abnormalities, malaise, and throat and chest pain. These are symptoms similar to those reported in other prospective studies. It is important to note that most post–COVID-19 codes were identified in the outpatient setting vs the inpatient setting. However, further analyses could stratify by care setting to further describe differences between these patients. Among those with a prior documented COVID-19 diagnosis (8879 cases [70.4%]), the time to the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code was a median (IQR) of 56 (21-200) days. This contributes to the body of literature seeking to understand when post–COVID-19 starts. The median time of 56 days is aligned with post–COVID-19 starting at either 3 or 4 weeks,as viral shedding declines over the course of 2 weeks, although prolonged shedding has been documented for severe cases.

### Analysis of clinical characteristics of severe pertussis in infants and children: a retrospective study [^22a74f0b]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study subjects

This was a retrospective study which had been approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University (approval number2018-6-12B). 184 pediatric patients with pertussis, aged 0-6 years, who were treated at the Department of Pediatrics at Ditan Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017, were included as study subjects. All these children met the diagnostic criteria for pertussis (see below).

Methods

The diagnostic criteria for pertussis were as follows

1) 0–3 months of age: no fever or low fever, cough with increasing frequency and severity, plus one of the following: cough with the characteristic whoop, apnea, vomiting after cough, cyanosis, convulsions, pneumonia, and close contact with patient with long-term fever-free cough (usually a family member); or only paroxysmal apnea, cyanosis, and convulsions without a cough. 2) 4 months to 9 years old: no fever or low fever, paroxysmal cough ≥ 7 days, non-purulent rhinitis, and one of the following: cough with the characteristic whoop, vomiting after coughing, apnea, convulsions, pneumonia, exacerbated symptoms at night, and close contact with patient with a long-term fever-free cough. The patient should also meet at least one of the following laboratory diagnostic criteria: Bordetella pertussis was cultured in the laboratory, Bordetella pertussis was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or paired serological test was positive (immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of single enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was significantly increased > 80–100 U/ml). In this study, the pathogenic diagnosis was performed using a Bordetella pertussis nucleic acid detection kit, and deep sputum samples of the infants were collected for testing.

Bordetella avium is thought to be strictly an avian pathogen. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 2 isolates from 2 humans with respiratory disease as B. avium and a novel B. avium-like strain. Thus, B. avium and B. avium-like organisms are rare opportunistic human pathogens.

### Emergence of Bordetella holmesii as a causative agent of whooping cough, barcelona, Spain [^f52a34d7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Ten (62.5%) of the 16 B. holmesii– positive patients were female; the median age was 9 years (range 1–40 years), and 87.5% were pediatric patients (<14 years). Fourteen cases were detected in the context of a school-related (85.7%) or family (35.7%) outbreak; 3 of these cases were detected in both kinds of outbreaks.

Vaccination status was available for 14 of the 16 patients. Of these, all cases occurred in children 14 months to 14 years of age who had received a median of 5 doses of pertussis vaccine (range 2–5 doses) according to the current vaccination program (5 doses, administered at 2, 4, and 6 months and at 1.5 and 6 years of age). The median time since the last vaccination was 4.5 years (range 0.7–14.1 years) (Table 1). No cases of complications or malignant pertussis-like disease occurred. Information about antimicrobial therapy received was available for 15 patients, all of whom had been treated with azithromycin, and no patient experienced therapeutic failure or relapse.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^37423888]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2-97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2-88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7-28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1-37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5-41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0-45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1-81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4-86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0-18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3-77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5-77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3-8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^ddf0b9e7]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline—acute cough evidence base included only three studies meeting quality assessment, all with a high risk of bias; all were prospective with no harms reported, and none had a control group or used a validated outcome tool for cough assessment; two studies defined acute cough as < 3 weeks and the third as no more than 28 days; all the subjects (N = 308) sought medical attention for complaints of cough < 3 weeks’ duration; the most common causes were respiratory infections, most likely of viral cause.

### Patterns of Bordetella parapertussis respiratory illnesses: 2008-2010 [^bbfb0a44]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical specimens from 9 states during 2008-2010 were tested by PCR for Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis. Of the positive samples, 13.99% were identified as B. parapertussis. It was concluded that B. parapertussis infections are more common than previously realized and contribute to cases thought to be vaccine failures.

### Comparing respiratory illness surveillance case definitions to detect Bordetella pertussis in children aged [^0e3e4738]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pertussis is vaccine-preventable and surveillance can guide interventions. Assessing the performance of syndromic surveillance and the World Health Organization (WHO) pertussis case definitions can identify improvements to enhance detection and monitoring of Bordetella pertussis.

Methods

We analysed respiratory illness sentinel surveillance data among children aged <5 years from January 2017 through December 2023. Participants were enrolled as outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI), or hospitalised patients with severe respiratory illness (SRI) surveillance. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for B. pertussis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sensitivity, specificity, and performance indicators of case definitions were evaluated against PCR results.

Results

Of 23,642 participants with PCR results, B. pertussis was detected in 0.7% (30/4,125; median age: 6.2 months; interquartile range [IQR]: 2.1-15.8) from ILI and 1.6% (314/19,517; median age: 1.7 months; IQR: 1.2-2.4) from SRI surveillance. Compared to the WHO pertussis case definition, a modified pertussis case definition (including apnoea, omitting cough duration) improved sensitivity (ILI: 30.0% vs. 43.3%; SRI: 55.7% vs. 60.2%), but reduced specificity (ILI: 90.5% vs. 75.8%; SRI: 88.3% vs. 80.9%). Negative predictive values were high for both definitions (>99%), while positive predictive values were low (<15%), reflecting low prevalence. Both WHO- and modified pertussis case definitions missed a large proportion of true pertussis cases (ILI: 70.0% vs. 56.7%; SRI: 44.3% vs. 39.8%).

Conclusion

Both WHO and modified pertussis case definitions missed many laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases, underestimating disease burden. Revising the WHO pertussis case definition and integrating pertussis into syndromic surveillance could improve detection while leveraging existing resources.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^60d8e64c]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

### Prospective nationwide surveillance of hospitalizations due to pertussis in children, 2006-2010 [^1ea6a178]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents.

Methods

From April 2006 to March 2011, 15-year-old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with ≥14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation, Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction was offered free of charge.

Results

Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory-confirmed B. pertussis infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12 months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care and 1 patient died. Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling, parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized (30%).

Conclusions

The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012) and pregnant women (in 2013) in Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and infants too young to be fully immunized.

### Genomic sequencing of Bordetella pertussis for epidemiology and global surveillance of whooping cough [^36d30ac6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease that is reemerging in many world regions. The spread of antigen-deficient strains may threaten acellular vaccine efficacy. Dynamics of strain transmission are poorly defined because of shortcomings in current strain genotyping methods. Our objective was to develop a whole-genome genotyping strategy with sufficient resolution for local epidemiologic questions and sufficient reproducibility to enable international comparisons of clinical isolates. We defined a core genome multilocus sequence typing scheme comprising 2,038 loci and demonstrated its congruence with whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism variation. Most cases of intrafamilial groups of isolates or of multiple isolates recovered from the same patient were distinguished from temporally and geographically cocirculating isolates. However, epidemiologically unrelated isolates were sometimes nearly undistinguishable. We set up a publicly accessible core genome multilocus sequence typing database to enable global comparisons of B. pertussis isolates, opening the way for internationally coordinated surveillance.

### Pertussis – a re-emerging infection? [^5486dd17]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Seven cases of pertussis in patients aged between 1 and 6 months detected over 3 months were reported. Paroxysmal cough (six cases), post-tussive vomiting (three cases) and poor feeding (three cases) were the most common presenting symptoms. Bordetella pertussis was isolated from six patients. The total leucocyte counts were mildly increased (10.8-15.6x10(9)/L). The lymphocyte counts were markly raised (59-73%) and appear to be useful indicators of pertussis. It appears that herd immunity does not offer adequate protection to the vulnerable group even in well-vaccinated populations. High vaccination coverage should be maintained, and vaccination should be given as early an age as possible. Aggressive efforts to identify cases and contacts are essential. Health care workers should have a high index of suspicion for pertussis, in particular for those with paroxysmal cough and high lymphocyte counts so as to give timely diagnosis and treatment.

### A simplified sequence-based identification scheme for Bordetella reveals several putative novel species [^8da2ea44]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

The differentiation of Bordetella species, particularly those causing human infection, is problematic. We found that sequence analysis of an internal fragment of nrdA allowed differentiation of the currently named Bordetella species. Analysis of 107 "Bordetella" isolates recovered almost exclusively from human respiratory tract specimens identified several putative novel species.

### Pertussis is a frequent cause of prolonged cough illness in adults and adolescents [^1253ab6a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although pertussis is increasingly recognized as a cause of prolonged cough illness in adolescents and adults, its prevalence is not well established. We evaluated pertussis infection in 442 adolescents and adults > or = 12 years old (mean age, 41.3 years) who had a cough-related illness of 7--56 days' duration. For 4 patients (0.9%), results of nasopharyngeal culture or PCR were positive for Bordetella pertussis; for 10 patients (2.3%), either results of culture or PCR were positive or pertussis antibody titers increased 4-fold. Eighty-eight patients (19.9%) had either laboratory-confirmed pertussis or laboratory evidence of pertussis. These patients had significantly longer duration of cough than did patients without laboratory evidence of pertussis (56 days vs. 46 days), and more of them had vomiting with cough (45.5% vs. 28.5%, respectively). Pertussis is a common cause of prolonged cough illness in adolescents and adults and is frequently associated with other symptoms of whooping cough.

### Is the sequenced Bordetella pertussis strain tohama I representative of the species? [^b506f266]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Subtractive hybridization was carried out to identify differences between the sequenced genome of Bordetella pertussis Tohama I and those of two recently collected isolates. We identified genetic regions specific to recent isolates, old isolates, and isolates of B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica species. We conclude that Tohama I strain is not representative of the B. pertussis species.

### Pertussis-associated pneumonia in infants and children from low-and middle-income countries participating in the PERCH study [^a39b07bd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

We intentionally did not estimate the vaccine effectiveness of infant pertussis vaccination. Case-control studies of vaccine effectiveness must strive to collect immunization data from all cases and controls in the same manner and aim for the greatest degree of documentation and completeness. As estimating vaccine effectiveness was not the objective of PERCH, the vaccination records were not collected in this manner. Furthermore, as controls were usually enrolled at home, where records were more often available, compared with cases, who were enrolled at hospitalization, there is a difference in the source and possibly validity of the vaccination history of cases and controls.

The contribution of pertussis to pneumonia mortality in the PERCH study (2.7%), when applied to global estimates of the contribution of pneumonia to all-cause mortality in 2013 (15% in those 0–59 months of age), leads to an estimate of the global pertussis contribution (0.4%) that can be compared with the current estimate of the pertussis contribution to overall childhood mortality (ie, 1% of all-cause deaths in children aged 0–59 months, inferred from an estimate of 60 000 pertussis deaths), which is based on a natural history model. There are several reasons why the burden implied by PERCH might be inaccurate. The PERCH study assessed hospitalized children only and did not enroll infants in the first month of life, an age group contributing a sizeable number of the deaths among children <5 years of age, and one that is at risk for pertussis. If the fraction of deaths in those 2 groups attributable to pertussis is substantially higher or lower than the observed 2.7% of deaths in PERCH, the estimate of the pertussis contribution to global deaths will increase or decrease. Furthermore, the respiratory syndrome meeting the PERCH case definition is not the only clinical presentation of pertussis; it can also present with encephalitis, cerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, or apnea, and many cases manifest persistent cough that is paroxysmal, with or without an inspiratory whoop and posttussive apnea and/or vomiting. Finally, because the incidence of pertussis varies over time (tending to produce peaks every 2–5 years), and geography, the study duration of 24 months at each site did not likely capture the full spectrum of disease burden for that particular site, but collectively may be largely representative as PERCH study data collection took place over a 30-month period. Therefore, the burden detected in PERCH, although likely capturing most of the serious pertussis burden, is not exhaustive.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^c07038cc]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There is little published data that has described the clinical characteristics in children with pertussis of various cough duration. We found that apnea and cyanosis were more common in the acute cough group, whilst whoop was more common in the sub-acute cough group. However, we did not find any specific characteristic in the chronic cough group. This highlights that a “one-size-fits-all” clinical case definition is not appropriate as also described by several others. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that the existing WHO clinical case definitions of pertussis(a case diagnosed as pertussis by a physician, or a person with a cough lasting ≥2 weeks with ≥1 of the following symptoms: paroxysms (ie, fits) of coughing, inspiratory “whooping”, and posttussive vomiting (ie, vomiting immediately after coughing) without other apparent cause) may be not appropriate anymore.

The spectrum of illness for pertussis can vary widely with atypical pertussis commonly found in adolescents, adults, and in infants under 1 year of age. A small study of 76 adult patients with cough of more than 2 weeks found 14 patients (18.4%) had laboratory evidence of pertussis infection, and classic symptoms of pertussis were not significantly common in confirmed patients. A case-control study in children0 to 18 years of age found only 42% of confirmed cases met a clinical definition of pertussis and typical symptoms were not common in confirmed cases, and the atypical symptoms were likely moderated by high immunization rates or may have been caused by other respiratory pathogens. A small study of 7 neonates with confirmed pertussis by bacterial culture reported cyanosis and apnea were the characteristic symptoms displayed after 4–7 days of the onset.These findings may reflect that ‘classic’ symptoms of pertussis may not necessarily be evident, and that clinical symptomatology is influenced by patient age, immunization status and underlying co-morbidities, but the clinical characteristics of patients with pertussis of different cough durations were unreported in these studies. With consideration of patient age, immunization status and underlying co-morbidities, our study found clinical symptomatology of pertussis was associated with cough duration. Our results raise questions regarding the possible need to reexamine the existing diagnostic criteria for pertussis, and possibly identify new sets of criteria specific to particular subgroups based on cough duration.

### Bordetella species in children with cystic fibrosis: what do we know? The role in acute exacerbations and chronic course [^b1ac51d9]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2011). Low credibility.

Despite vaccination, pertussis is still endemic in the Netherlands. A literature search was performed to verify what is known about the role of Bordetella species in children with cystic fibrosis, with regard to the incidence of Bordetella infections, the involvement in pulmonary exacerbations and the influence on chronic course. Little is known about the frequency of Bordetella infections and the involvement of Bordetella species both in relation to the chronic course of cystic fibrosis and to pulmonary exacerbations. Since it is difficult to detect Bordetella species in cultures and few sputum cultures investigated have been obtained during an exacerbation, it is likely that the frequency of Bordetella species in CF patients is underestimated. Identification of Bordetella species in these patients may have serious consequences for the treatment of exacerbations in CF. Future research investigating the role of Bordetella species in cystic fibrosis should use specific techniques to detect Bordetella in cultures.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Analysis of clinical characteristics of severe pertussis in infants and children: a retrospective study [^53df544c]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With the development of modern medicine, the incidence of many infectious diseases has significantly decreased, along with their threat to human health. However, the incidence of pertussis (whooping cough) shows an increasing trend. This phenomenon is known as “pertussis resurgence”. Severe pertussis can cause sudden infant death, which is not completely avoidable. Currently, the reported mortality rate of pertussis is 1.2–3.0%. There are two circumstances contributing to this. First, this mortality occurs in part because the pathogenesis and lethality mechanisms of pertussis are not completely clear. Second, some clinicians often lack sufficient understanding of the clinical characteristics and risk factors for severe pertussis and thus do not focus their attention on these factors.

In the last few years, the number of pediatric patients with pertussis treated by our hospital has increased. This has included many severe cases and deaths. In this study, we employed a retrospective study design to analyze the clinical data of pediatric patients with pertussis treated by the department of pediatrics at Ditan Hospital in the 2 years of 2016 and 2017 in order to examine the clinical characteristics of pertussis and provide a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of severe pertussis.

### Pertussis and persistent cough: practical, clinical and epidemiologic issues [^261f5d98]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic issues of testing, treatment, prevention, immunization, mandated reporting, and post-exposure prophylaxis do not often intrude on the Emergency Department management of the well-appearing adolescent or adult with a couple of weeks of cough.

Objectives

Considering that waning immunity to pertussis, the only vaccine-preventable disease with increasing cases and deaths in the United States, is responsible for 12-35% of such illness, such issues need to be considered.

Discussion

Mostly self-limited in adults, transmission of pertussis to infants places them at risk for hospitalization and death. Pertussis is highly contagious (80% transmission), and atypical presentations are the rule in adults (cough alone) and infants (apnea, bradycardia, poor feeding). Treatment in the first few weeks can impact the clinical course, and later treatment can still prevent transmission. Clinical features like paroxysmal cough, inspiratory "whoop," and post-tussive emesis have mildly increased predictive values and may be absent in adults. Testing is unreliable after 3 weeks of cough. Treatment reduces communicability within 5 days and is suggested without regard to test results within 3 weeks of cough onset for those aged > 1 year (within 6 weeks of cough for < 1 year). Reporting requirements are based on the clinical case definition: ([Cough ≥2 weeks] + [paroxysms OR whoop OR post-tussive emesis]). Lower reporting thresholds are appropriate during an outbreak or when vulnerable populations are at risk. Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended for at-risk contacts. Tdap is encouraged for all adults.

Conclusion

Practical recommendations consistent with the most current guidelines are offered.

### Maternal pertussis vaccination, infant immunization, and risk of pertussis [^64ec0291]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

In Australia, pertussis is a nationally notifiable disease, and information on medically notified or laboratory-diagnosed pertussis cases are collected and summarized in jurisdictional notifiable disease databases.The criteria for notification includes a combination of clinical, epidemiologic, or laboratory evidence, with laboratory definitive evidence (ie, isolation of Bordetella pertussis in cell culture, detection by nucleic acid testing, or seroconversion) serving as a confirmed pertussis case; ≥94% of infant pertussis cases are notified following detection by polymerase chain reaction.We identified notified pertussis infections and diagnosis date for infants through age 18 months. Pertussis cases included confirmed cases with definitive laboratory evidence or suggestive laboratory evidence coinciding with clinical evidence and probable cases with clinical and epidemiologic evidence.

Hospital inpatient records and death registrations were used to evaluate pertussis severity. Hospital inpatient records summarize public and private hospital admissions within the jurisdiction.We used hospital admission date and date of pertussis diagnosis to assess whether the pertussis case was temporally associated with a hospitalization or ICU admission (admission date ≤10 days following diagnosis). Deaths, identified from the death register, coincided with the date of diagnosis (death date ≤10 days following diagnosis or diagnosed postmortem).

First Nations mothers and infants were identified using a previously validated algorithm combining information across multiple administrative data sources to avoid incomplete and inaccurate data.

### A comprehensive resource for Bordetella genomic epidemiology and biodiversity studies [^0b9e2b87]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Bordetellae are beta-proteobacteria that are mainly associated with infection in animals and humans, and sometimes retrieved from environmental samples. Of the 16 currently described Bordetella species, the medically most important taxa B. pertussis (Bp) and B. parapertussis (Bpp), together with B. bronchiseptica (Bbs), are referred to as the ‘classical bordetellae ’ and belong to a single genomic species, hereafter named the B. bronchiseptica genomic species (BbGS) for convenience. B. pertussis, and more rarely B. parapertussis, cause whooping cough, characterized by its typical paroxysmal cough, and kill an estimated ~140,000 children annually –. Bp and Bpp have evolved from sublineages of Bbs. Whereas Bp and Bpp are human restricted, B. bronchiseptica has a broader ecological distribution and causes respiratory infections in a wide range of mammalian hosts including humans. Based on MLSTand genomic sequencing, two distinct Bbs groups were named Bbs complexes I and IV, the last one being more strongly associated to humans.

Other Bordetella species were described and can affect humans, although a few were so far only described as environmental. B. holmesii can be collected either from blood of septicemic patients or from nasopharyngeal samples of patients with pertussis-like symptoms –. B. hinzii is frequently carried in birds, and B. avium and B. pseudohinzii are, respectively, responsible of respiratory disease in poultry or birdsand in mice or wild rats. B. bronchialis, B. sputigena and B. flabilis were described from respiratory samples of patients with cystic fibrosis,, and B. trematum and B. ansorpii were found in infected wounds of immunocompromised patients,,. Some Bordetella species have been found in environmental samples, such as B. petrii or the three recently described species B. muralis, B. tumulicola and B. tumbae –. In addition to these 16 current Bordetella species with standing in the prokaryotic taxonomy, Bordetella genogroups were identified from patients with cystic fibrosis based on single-gene nrdA sequencing; these are labeled as ‘genomosp.’ in INSDC bioproject PRJNA385118 and may represent additional Bordetella species.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 8.2 and R version 3.5.2 software. Key sociodemographic (sex, region and socioeconomic status using the index of multiple deprivation) and clinical characteristics (birthweight, comorbidities, high-risk status and palivizumab eligibility) were described using number and percentage within each category for categorical variables. The cumulative incidence was calculated as the number of infants with at least 1 admission of interest divided by the total number of infants in the birth cohort. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were described for all cohorts, using numbers and proportions.

The total number of RSV-coded, bronchiolitis-coded, any RTI-coded and RSV-predicted admissions up to 24 and 12 months of life, which occurred among the birth cohort participants, was described, as well as the respective rates calculated as the total number of admissions divided by the total person-years at risk and multiplied by 1000.

Multiple linear regression modeling was used to estimate the RSV-associated burden on hospital admissions and GP consultations for infants <24 months of age from March 1, 2015, to February 28, 2019. The impact of various respiratory pathogens on both lower and upper RTIs was analyzed, focusing on consultations and admissions with unspecified etiology.

The cohort included infants born between March 1, 2015, and February 28, 2017, who were followed up until they reached 24 months, died, were lost to follow-up, or the study end date (December 31, 2019). The outcomes were the number of weekly primary care consultations for RTI, unspecified LRTI hospitalizations and unspecified URTI hospitalizations. The analysis differentiated infants born during (October 1 to February 28) and before the RSV season (March 1 to September 30), leading to 6 distinct models.

Predictors in each model were weekly hospitalizations attributed to 9 pathogens, included based on previous studies using similar methodology, : RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, Bordetella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Counts of outcomes and predictors were aggregated across the study period by corresponding week of the year.

Model selection was based on the lowest Akaike information criterion using backward covariate selection. The final model estimated the proportion of outcomes attributable to each pathogen, with results presented graphically to highlight seasonal trends and summarized annually. (see Methods, Supplemental Digital Content 2,).

Additionally, 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented COVID-19 diagnosis before the post–COVID-19 diagnosis, although fewer children had a prior COVID-19 code (569 cases [52.7%]). The median (IQR) time between the COVID-19 and post–COVID-19 diagnosis was 56 (21-200) days, ranging from 40 days for children to 59 days for younger adults (Table). The most common concurrent conditions varied by age; children aged 0 to 17 years experienced COVID-19–like symptoms (eg, cough, 207 cases [19.2%]; and breathing abnormalities, 115 cases [10.6%]), whereas more serious conditions were more common among adults 65 years or older (eg, respiratory failure, 459 cases [21.1%]; and viral pneumonia,189 cases [8.7%]) (Figure 2 and eTable in the Supplement).

COPD indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Signs and symptoms (eg, cough and breathing abnormalities) were slightly less common on the day of the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code compared with the 30 days before the post–COVID-19 diagnosis code. Comparatively, more serious conditions (eg, respiratory failure and viral pneumonia) were slightly more common in the 30 days before the post–COVID-19 code compared with the day of the post–COVID-19 code (Figure 3).

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e8036059]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Systematic review evidence base—study selection and data characteristics: After screening and quality assessment, 53 articles were included for descriptive analysis and meta-analysis, comprising 23,796 subjects, of whom 4,149 (17.4%) had a laboratory diagnosis of pertussis; of these 53 articles, 36 were prospective, 12 retrospective, and 5 case-control; 41 clinical characteristics (index tests) were assessed for diagnostic accuracy, including 9 cough characteristics; after excluding from the meta-analysis studies at high risk of bias (28 studies), pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated by meta-analysis.

### Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica [^20910273]. Nature Genetics (2003). Medium credibility.

Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica are closely related Gram-negative beta-proteobacteria that colonize the respiratory tracts of mammals. B. pertussis is a strict human pathogen of recent evolutionary origin and is the primary etiologic agent of whooping cough. B. parapertussis can also cause whooping cough, and B. bronchiseptica causes chronic respiratory infections in a wide range of animals. We sequenced the genomes of B. bronchiseptica RB50 (5,338,400 bp; 5,007 predicted genes), B. parapertussis 12822 (4,773,551 bp; 4,404 genes) and B. pertussis Tohama I (4,086,186 bp; 3,816 genes). Our analysis indicates that B. parapertussis and B. pertussis are independent derivatives of B. bronchiseptica-like ancestors. During the evolution of these two host-restricted species there was large-scale gene loss and inactivation; host adaptation seems to be a consequence of loss, not gain, of function, and differences in virulence may be related to loss of regulatory or control functions.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^1b72e7ec]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### The management of community-acquired pneumonia in infants and children older than 3 months of age: clinical practice guidelines by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^598511fc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, microbiological testing, testing for atypical bacteria, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae to help guide antibiotic selection in patients with pediatric patients with suggestive signs and symptoms.
