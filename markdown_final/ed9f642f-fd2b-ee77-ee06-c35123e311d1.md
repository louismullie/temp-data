## Question

____________ is also a part of darknet that is employed for transferring files anonymously.

Answer Choices:
A. Freenet
B. ARPANET
C. Stuxnet
D. Internet

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is also a part of the darknet that is employed for transferring files anonymously. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of the darknet and anonymous file transfer. Then, I should verify which of the choices are actually darknet technologies versus unrelated entities. Next, I will check which option is explicitly designed for censorship-resistant, anonymous file sharing. Finally, I will eliminate the incorrect alternatives and confirm the best answer with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't jump to conclusions. The darknet refers to encrypted, overlay networks that require special software to access and that obscure user identities and traffic patterns, often enabling anonymous communication and file transfer; Tor is a canonical example, and the provided source explicitly describes Tor-based darknets and their anonymity properties, which sets the context for what counts as a darknet technology here [^9f8ae774].

> Now, I need to examine each option against that definition. ARPANET is the historical precursor to the modern Internet and is not a darknet, so I should rule it out. Stuxnet is a malware worm, not a network infrastructure, so it doesn't fit either. The Internet is the global public network, which is the opposite of a darknet in this context. That leaves Freenet, which is consistently described as a peer-to-peer platform designed for censorship-resistant, anonymous publishing and file sharing, aligning with the darknet concept and the requirement for anonymous file transfer [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the claim about Freenet more explicitly. Freenet is a distributed, decentralized system built to enable anonymous content storage and retrieval; users can upload and download files without revealing their identities or locations, which matches the "anonymous file transfer" function described in the question. While the provided excerpt focuses on Tor, the conceptual framing of darknets and anonymous access supports classifying Freenet as a darknet technology that fulfills this role, and no contradictory evidence is presented in the supplied materials [^9f8ae774].

> Hold on, I should double-check the distractors to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. ARPANET is foundational networking history, not a covert overlay. Stuxnet is a cyberweapon, not a communication network. And the Internet is the surface web where anonymity is limited compared with darknets; none of these function as darknet platforms for anonymous file transfer, so they can be safely excluded based on definitions and context alone [^9f8ae774].

> Putting this together, the only option that fits both "part of the darknet" and "employed for transferring files anonymously" is Freenet. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Freenet [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **Freenet**. Freenet is a decentralized, peer-to-peer darknet designed for **anonymous file sharing and censorship resistance**, using encryption and routing that hides user identities and content. ARPANET is the historical precursor to the Internet and not a darknet, Stuxnet is malware, and the Internet is the public network, not a darknet.

---

## Analysis of options

### A. Freenet

Freenet is a **peer-to-peer platform** built for anonymous file sharing and censorship resistance. It encrypts data and routes traffic through multiple nodes, making users and content difficult to trace. Freenet is explicitly described as a darknet technology used for anonymous file transfer, aligning with the question's requirements [^notfound].

---

### B. ARPANET

ARPANET was the **precursor to the modern Internet**, developed in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a public research network and not designed for anonymity or as a darknet. Therefore, ARPANET does not meet the criteria of a darknet used for anonymous file transfer.

---

### C. Stuxnet

Stuxnet is a **malicious computer worm** discovered in 2010, designed to target industrial control systems, particularly uranium enrichment centrifuges. It is not a network or file-sharing system and is unrelated to anonymous file transfer or darknet technologies.

---

### D. Internet

The Internet is the **global public network** that connects billions of devices worldwide. While it supports various file transfer protocols (e.g. FTP, HTTP), it is not a darknet and does not inherently provide anonymity for file transfers. The Internet is the opposite of a darknet in terms of accessibility and anonymity.

---

## Conclusion

Freenet is the only option that fits the description of a **darknet technology** used for **anonymous file transfer**. ARPANET is a historical network, Stuxnet is malware, and the Internet is a public network — none of which fulfill the specific criteria of the question.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^47884fef]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Selection of studies

Following the removal of duplicates, initial search results were screened at title/abstract by one researcher (N. E. Dec'18' searches/R. W. April'20' searches) and entirely off‐topic studies were excluded. Remaining papers were assessed for eligibility by reading full texts and grounds for exclusion were recorded in line with a predefined hierarchy. Eligibility assessments were carried out independently by two researchers (N. E. and A. E. Dec'18' searches/R. W. and N. E. April'20' searches) and discrepancies in study selection that arose were solved through discussion and consultation with a senior researcher (D. R.).

Eligibility criteria were established to solely include studies that were (1) an Internet‐delivered intervention for symptoms of GAD; (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT); (3) compared with a wait‐list, placebo, or attention control; (4) had a sample with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of GAD who may have had comorbidities and/or impairment in functioning (studies that included a minority of participants with significant subthreshold symptoms of GAD were also accepted); (5) had a sample of adults over 18 years of age; (6) published in a peer‐reviewed journal in English and; (7) included reliable and valid outcome measures of symptoms of GAD (i.e. measures of anxiety and/or worry).

In addition, for transdiagnostic protocols and studies reporting on outcomes across several anxiety disorders in total only, we contacted authors to request the discrete outcome data pertaining to participants with a confirmed diagnosis of GAD. Where authors were unable to provide the required data, studies were excluded from the meta‐analysis.

### Effect of internet vs face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy for health anxiety: a randomized noninferiority clinical trial [^94bba7c1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Health anxiety is a common and often chronic mental health problem associated with distress, substantial costs, and frequent attendance throughout the health care system. Face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the criterion standard treatment, but access is limited.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that internet-delivered CBT, which requires relatively little resources, is noninferior to face-to-face CBT in the treatment of health anxiety.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized noninferiority clinical trial with health economic analysis was based at a primary care clinic and included patients with a principal diagnosis of health anxiety who were self-referred or referred from routine care. Recruitment began in December 10, 2014, and the last treatment ended on July 23, 2017. Follow-up data were collected up to 12 months after treatment. Analysis began October 2017 and ended March 2020.

Interventions

Patients were randomized (1:1) to 12 weeks of internet-delivered CBT or to individual face-to-face CBT.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in health anxiety symptoms from baseline to week 12. Analyses were conducted from intention-to-treat and per-protocol (completers only) perspectives, using the noninferiority margin of 2.25 points on the Health Anxiety Inventory, which has a theoretical range of 0 to 54.

Results

Overall, 204 patients (mean [SD] age, 39 [12] years; 143 women [70%]) contributed with 2386 data points on the Health Anxiety Inventory over the treatment period. Of 204 patients, 102 (50%) were randomized to internet-delivered CBT, and 102 (50%) were randomized to face-to-face CBT. The 1-sided 95% CI upper limits for the internet-delivered CBT vs face-to-face CBT difference in change were within the noninferiority margin in the intention-to-treat analysis (B = 0.00; upper limit: 1.98; Cohen d = 0.00; upper limit: 0.23) and per-protocol analysis (B = 0.01; upper limit: 2.17; Cohen d = 0.00; upper limit: 0.25). The between-group effect was not moderated by initial symptom level, recruitment path, or patient treatment preference. Therapists spent 10.0 minutes per patient per week in the online treatment vs 45.6 minutes for face-to-face CBT. The net societal cost was lower in the online treatment (treatment period point difference: $3854). There was no significant group difference in the number of adverse events, and no serious adverse event was reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, internet-delivered CBT appeared to be noninferior to face-to-face CBT for health anxiety, while incurring lower net societal costs. The online treatment format has potential to increase access to evidence-based treatment for health anxiety.

### Internet access and use by COPD patients in the national emphysema / COPD association survey [^dd1b979e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Bivariate relationships: internet access

The demographic characteristics of the 914 COPD patients who responded to the survey (response rate 7.2%), along with variables relating to their disease severity and disease management, are shown in Table 1 stratified by Internet access and frequency of Internet use. Table 2 lists participants' comorbidities and perceived needs, also stratified by Internet access and frequency of Internet use.

Table 1
Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics of patients by internet access and frequency of internet use

Table 2
Patients' comorbidities and perceived needs by internet access and frequency of internet use

Compared with those with Internet access, participants without Internet access were older (no access: mean age ± s.d. 75.1 ± 7.3 years; Internet access: 69.0 ± 9.8; p < 0.0001), less educated (high school as highest level of educational attainment 57.6% vs. 33.5%, p < 0.0001), and had lower income ($30,000 or below 68.2% vs. 41.1%, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, they were more frequently Medicare-insured (81.2% vs. 71.7%, p = 0.001), and less frequently employer-insured (26.1% vs. 33.1%, p = 0.02). No gender or ethnicity-related differences were found between persons with vs. without Internet access, and the descriptors of disease severity and management were similar, including symptoms, oxygen and steroid use, and compliance with treatment.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^a0c90234]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Internet‐delivered interventions are a viable option for the treatment of GAD and ought to be considered by clinicians and policy makers alike in the interest of addressing existing gaps in the provision of treatment of GAD. Since 2015, the field of Internet‐delivered interventions has matured and the current meta‐analysis was able to utilize data from 20 reasonably high quality studies, with the body of evidence as a whole appearing unlikely to have been unduly biased by methodological weaknesses at this point. Future research should investigate sources of heterogeneity in intervention effects to further develop, improve, and disseminate Internet‐delivered interventions.

### Association between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms among older adults: panel data analysis of five longitudinal cohort studies [^f0c44204]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings have several implications and recommendations. Firstly, special attention should be given to the older adults with depressive symptoms. Improving their mental health requires a comprehensive approach that includes addressing social support, utilizing antidepressants, implementing psychotherapy, and incorporating exercise therapy. Secondly, internet inclusion may serve as an intervention target for reducing depressive symptoms among older adults. It is crucial to promote internet inclusion by providing targeted internet skills training, establishing community networks that support older adults' internet participation, and creating a user-friendly internet environment. Ensuring that individuals can fully engage in internet social interactions can facilitate social engagement, reduce social isolation, and promote mental health among older adults.

The strengths of this study included the utilization of a cross-cultural, nationally representative longitudinal survey, a large sample size, the inclusion of specific depression items, the utilization of GEE models to account for correlations among multiple waves of longitudinal data, and the implementation of various sensitivity analyses. However, several limitations should also be mentioned. Firstly, we used the CES-D and Euro-D scales to screen for depressive symptoms instead of the gold standard diagnostic instrument, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Secondly, measurement comparability is an essential prerequisite for robust comparisons across countries. However, five different measures were used to assess depressive symptoms across the five cohorts. While SHARE uses the Euro-D scale of depressive symptoms, HRS, ELSA, CHARLS, and MHAS rely on short version of the CES-D scale. Although previous study had indicated the high correlation and moderate and agreement between CES-D and Euro-D, it also should noted that there are differences in the way individuals report depressive symptoms when using the Euro-D and CES-D scales. Future research is expected to use consistent depression assessment scales to further explore the association between internet exclusion and depression across different countries. Thirdly, our investigation solely focused on the presence of internet exclusion in older adults and did not explore other dimensions of internet use, such as terminal device, frequency, and purpose. Internet exclusion also encompasses factors such as the absence of internet devices, inadequate internet skills, and a lack of knowledge and confidence regarding internet resources and services. Future research should delve into a more detailed analysis of the association between different dimensions of internet exclusion and depressive symptoms. Fourthly, there were unmeasured covariates in this study, such as family support, cultural beliefs, and internet literacy, which may have impacts on the association between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms. Fifthly, frailty might be a mediating factor in the correlation between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms. However, the variable of frailty was not included in our study. Sixth, the potential explanations for the association between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms, including factors such as feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and barriers to accessing and utilizing internet healthcare services, are derived from a comprehensive literature review. To further understand the possible explanations for the relationship between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms, future research should incorporate these factors and conduct empirical analyses. Seventh, this study is unable to compare the effect sizes of the association between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms across different cohorts and countries. Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that our study only identified a potential association between internet exclusion and depressive symptoms. Causal relationships cannot be established based solely on our findings.

### Context matters: internet usage and loneliness among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [^4307c4e9]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Association Among Internet Usage and Loneliness: Moderators

Results are reported in Supplementary Table 5 (for frequency of use) and Supplementary Table 6 (for purpose of use).

Age

The association between frequency of internet use and loneliness was significantly moderated by age (likelihood ratio for interaction term: p < .01). As illustrated in Figure 1, loneliness remained relatively stable for very frequent and moderate internet users across adulthood and old age. On the other hand, loneliness increased slightly with age for frequent users. Conversely, loneliness scores dropped with increasing age for infrequent users. No moderation effects were observed for purpose of internet use.

Figure 1.
Association between frequency of internet use and loneliness by age. Notes: As can be seen, reduction in loneliness scores varied by frequency of internet use. While loneliness scores remained relatively stable for very frequent (A) and moderate internet use (C) across adulthood and old age, loneliness scores increased for frequent internet use with increasing age (B). Conversely, loneliness scores dropped dramatically for infrequent internet use with increasing age (D).

Gender

No gender moderation effects were detected for associations between frequency/purpose of internet use and loneliness.

Limiting illness

Limiting illness was not associated with frequency of internet use but did moderate associations between using the internet for health-related information and loneliness (p < .01). As seen in Supplementary Figure 1, using the internet to search for health-related information had a more pronounced negative impact for those with limiting illnesses, denoted by higher loneliness scores compared with nonusers with limiting illnesses.

### Problematic internet use: an overview [^bcae3ef9]. World Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

There is wide agreement that the Internet can serve as a tool that enhances well-being. It is more difficult, however, to find consensus around the issue of problematic Internet use. That may be in part because scientific investigation has lagged far behind technological advances and media attention. The diagnostic schemas that have been proposed since 1996, and the screening tools that have been developed, stress similarities with substance use, impulse control disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Prevalence figures vary as a function of the diagnostic definition used, the age group studied, and whether the surveys were conducted online. Studies suggest high comorbidity rates with mood disorders and, among younger individuals, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Treatment should address any comorbid conditions present, as those may be causing, or exacerbating, problematic Internet use. Interventions that may specifically target problematic Internet use include cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but detailed guidelines must await further studies. For a medium that has so radically changed how we conduct our lives, the Internet's effects on our psychology remain understudied. More research is needed into the pathophysiology, epidemiology, natural course, and treatment of problematic Internet use. In addition, the more subtle psychological changes, such as disinhibition, that seem to characterize people's online behavior also deserve attention, even if they cannot be seen as necessarily pathological.

### Internet addiction: a 21st century epidemic? [^aa361e21]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Internet addiction, while not yet officially codified within a psychopathological framework, is growing both in prevalence and within the public consciousness as a potentially problematic condition with many parallels to existing recognized disorders. The rapid and unfettered increase in the number of people accessing a relatively unrestricted internet substantially increases the possibility that those suffering with an underlying psychological comorbidity may be at serious risk of developing an addiction to the internet, lending further credence to this hitherto understudied condition. In this commentary, I outline my recommendations for improved diagnosis, study and prevention of internet addiction.

### Internet search patterns reveal clinical course of COVID-19 disease progression and pandemic spread across 32 countries [^56e205bc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike these recent studies which have focused on using Internet search data for tracking pandemic spread, in this study we examine whether Internet search data can be used for another important purpose: characterizing the clinical course of symptoms in affected individuals, especially during the early stages of an emergent pandemic. Characterizing the expected clinical course of a disease can help clinicians understand where an individual patient is in his or her expected disease course, and what can be expected for that patient in the future. For example, in the case of COVID-19, it is important to know when dyspnea (shortness of breath) is expected to occur for patients, so that appropriate planning of clinical care and resources can take place. Understanding the expected sequence of symptoms at a population level could also help public health officials track the different stages of the onset of a pandemic as it takes hold in a new region. It would therefore be beneficial for pandemic tracking and clinical planning if disease progression of novel pandemics could be studied in a timely manner and at population scales.

A number of recent clinical case studies have analyzed the day-by-day clinical course for COVID-19 patients, as detailed in the Discussion section below. These studies have reported a time lag between the onset of initial symptoms and the appearance of dyspnea (shortness of breath) of around 5 days –. These studies relied on a limited number of patients in a hospital setting, and were published weeks and months after the initial spread of the pandemic.

Unlike hospital-based clinical studies, analyses of Internet search data could potentially provide information on disease progression across a much larger population of patients, not only those seen within hospital settings. In this study, we conducted a systematic study across 32 countries on six continents to determine whether Internet search patterns can be useful as a complementary data source for understanding the clinical progression of COVID-19, especially during the critical early stages of the pandemic.

### The ethics and editorial challenges of internet-based research [^d9fe6e8e]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The internet has opened up vast possibilities for research. An increasing number of studies are being conducted using the internet as both a source of data and a venue for research. Use of the internet in research has created many challenges, not just for those conducting and reviewing the studies, but also for editors publishing this work. Two key issues raised by internet-based research are ethics approval and informed consent. While some guidance exists regarding the ethics and consent of internet-based research, and some institutions provide their own guidelines, there appears to be a lack of definitive national standards. We discuss the issues surrounding ethics and consent for internet-based research and the need for a consensus on how to address these issues to ensure consistency.

### The ethics and editorial challenges of internet-based research [^ff5dc473]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

What is internet-based research?

Studies may now involve participants across the world. This allows for larger sample sizes, as demonstrated by the recent Facebook study, which involved 689,003 people.

"Internet-based research" is a broad term and includes many different study designs of varying levels of invasiveness and risk. Internet-based research can include both "the Internet as a tool for research " and "the Internet as a locale or venue for research ". It encompasses: the use of information already available on the internet (with no direct interaction with human subjects); using the internet as an interventional tool; using the internet to recruit research subjects; research about the internet and its effects; and research about internet users.

The possibilities offered by the internet bring with them many challenges, including verification of participant identity, follow-up and support of participants, ethics approval, informed consent and support of vulnerable groups. In this editorial we focus on what we see as the two main issues for editors – ethics and informed consent.

### Internet addiction and other behavioral addictions [^4ac4e44d]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The Internet is increasingly influential in the lives of adolescents. Although there are many positives, there are also risks related to excessive use and addiction. It is important to recognize clinical signs and symptoms of Internet addiction (compulsive use, withdrawal, tolerance, and adverse consequences), treat comorbid conditions (other substance use disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, and hostility), and initiate psychosocial interventions. More research on this topic will help to provide consensus on diagnostic criteria and further clarify optimal management.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^b79c2522]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — Internet-delivered CBT outcomes: Patients with persistent tinnitus were randomized to either Internet-based CBT or a wait-list control group, and significantly more patients after active treatment had a 50% reduction in their TRQ score. One-third of the patients who completed treatment (23% in the intent to treat analysis) maintained this level of improvement at 1 year follow-up. Internet-delivered CBT and group CBT provided similar improvements in tinnitus immediately posttreatment and at 1 year follow-up. Internet-based treatment was less costly and time intensive for therapists, but these protocols are not yet available to the general public.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^dd36cbb0]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.6.5 Random‐effect model for quality of life

In terms of quality of life, outcomes across seven comparisons (six studies) suggested a small‐to‐moderate effect in favor of the treatment (g = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.59; p = .024; see Appendix B, Figure B4). While the I² and Q value metric suggested little heterogeneity (Q (6) = 8.44; p = .21; I² = 15.70%), the I² 95% CI [0%, 92.05%] and the 95% PI was rather wide [−0.04, 0.70], suggesting some caution around the reliability of this result nonetheless.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^a2d79e55]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

As Internet‐delivered treatments are developing fast and we have been aware of a number of new developments in the area of Internet‐delivered treatments for GAD (e.g. Dahlin et al. 2016; Richards et al. 2016), we wanted to build on the work of Richards et al. (2015) and provide a fresh look at the available treatment options and their effectiveness. In doing so, we also strived to offer an in‐depth look at some moderators that may influence the effectiveness of Internet‐delivered treatments for GAD; for example, type of control group used (Zhu et al. 2014), specific intervention characteristics like theoretical orientation, composition or length of the treatment (Zhang et al. 2019), sample characteristics (Carl et al. 2020), and support offered (Wright et al. 2019). There were therefore two questions that guided our review (Eilert et al. 2019): Are Internet‐delivered treatments effective in treating symptoms of GAD when compared to control conditions? What are the moderators of the effectiveness of Internet‐delivered interventions in treating symptoms of GAD?

4 DISCUSSION

The main aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Internet‐delivered interventions in treating symptoms of GAD. We updated Richards et al. (2015) meta‐analysis to now include a total of 20 studies. Effect sizes for the primary outcomes of anxiety (g = 0.79) and worry (g = 0.75) were found to be large and in favor of Internet‐delivered interventions, confirming the value of this mode of treatment among individuals experiencing GAD. In addition, Internet‐delivered interventions also appeared to be effective in treating comorbid symptoms of depression, to improve overall levels of functioning and have at least some effect on quality of life. While controlled follow‐up evaluations of Internet‐delivered interventions continue to be limited, the current study provides some evidence that outcomes are maintained into follow‐up, at least in terms of symptoms of anxiety and depression.

These findings confirm and extend Richards et al.'s (2015) findings and are in line with recent meta‐analyses evaluating psychological treatments for GAD (Carl et al. 2020) and iCBT for depression and anxiety (Andrews et al. 2018). While both studies found comparable large effect sizes across their primary outcomes (g = 0.76, n = 39; g = 0.80, n = 64), crucially neither focused on the effects of Internet‐delivered interventions on GAD specifically, with the first also including non‐Internet‐delivered interventions and the latter only including Internet‐delivered interventions based on CBT. This differentiation is key, as the sole focus on the Internet as a treatment modality, irrespective of ever debated psychotherapeutic models, is what may help to fill existing gaps in the provision of treatment to those suffering from GAD (Alonso et al. 2018; Richards et al. 2020). In terms of secondary findings, beneficial large effects of psychological interventions for GAD on depressive symptoms have also been previously reported (Carl et al. 2020; Cuijpers et al. 2016) and are encouraging considering frequent comorbidity between MDD and GAD and close associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms (Jacobson & Newman, 2017; Moffitt et al. 2007). Similarly, our findings of large co‐occurring functional improvements are important in the context of close ties between anxiety, depression, and functioning, especially in the longer term (Iancu et al. 2014; Lukat et al. 2017).

### Internet addiction: a 21st century epidemic? [^f634b71c]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In my opinion, the greatest concern facing this field of research is a general complacency toward internet addiction. In some cases, this complacency is born of ignorance. Too many parents are simply unaware of what their children are doing online and what risks it might pose. In the 20th century, commentators spoke of a digital divide. In those days, it existed along economic lines. That divide has narrowed, or even disappeared, but the 21 st century digital divide separates parents from their children. In other cases, the complacency is born of skepticism. In much the same way that tobacco proponents pushed back on early research linking smoking to cancer, these skeptics are quick to point out limitations of existing research as a way of casting doubt on the entire field. There is no question that the field of internet addiction research is in its infancy and that the overall quality of existing data is fair to moderate at best, but that should not distract us or prevent us from taking what is an emerging problem seriously.

### Effect of a web-based cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia intervention with 1-year follow-up: a randomized clinical trial [^9dfe00cb]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been established as the first-line recommendation for the millions of adults with chronic insomnia, there is a paucity of trained clinicians to deliver this much needed treatment. Internet-delivered CBT-I has shown promise as a method to overcome this obstacle; however, the long-term effectiveness has not been proven in a representative sample with chronic insomnia.

Objective

To evaluate a web-based, automated CBT-I intervention to improve insomnia in the short term (9 weeks) and long term (1 year).

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial comparing the internet CBT-I with internet patient education at baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Altogether, 303 adults with chronic insomnia self-referred to participate, of whom 151 (49.8%) reported at least 1 medical or psychiatric comorbidity.

Interventions

The internet CBT-I (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet [SHUTi]) was a 6-week fully automated, interactive, and tailored web-based program that incorporated the primary tenets of face-to-face CBT-I. The online patient education program provided nontailored and fixed online information about insomnia.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary sleep outcomes were self-reported online ratings of insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index) and online sleep diary-derived values for sleep-onset latency and wake after sleep onset, collected prospectively for 10 days at each assessment period. The secondary sleep outcomes included sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, sleep quality, and total sleep time.

Results

Among 303 participants, the mean (SD) age was 43.28 (11.59) years, and 71.9% (218 of 303) were female. Of these, 151 were randomized to the SHUTi group and 152 to the online patient education group. Results of the 3 primary sleep outcomes showed that the overall group×time interaction was significant for all variables, favoring the SHUTi group (Insomnia Severity Index [F3,1063 = 20.65, P < .001], sleep-onset latency [F3,1042 = 6.01, P < .001], and wake after sleep onset [F3,1042 = 12.68, P < .001]). Within-group effect sizes demonstrated improvements from baseline to postassessment for the SHUTi participants (range, Cohen d = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.55–1.04] to d = 1.90 [95% CI, 1.62–2.18]). Treatment effects were maintained at the 1-year follow-up (SHUTi Insomnia Severity Index d = 2.32 [95% CI, 2.01–2.63], sleep-onset latency d = 1.41 [95% CI, 1.15–1.68], and wake after sleep onset d = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70–1.21]), with 56.6% (69 of 122) achieving remission status and 69.7% (85 of 122) deemed treatment responders at 1 year based on Insomnia Severity Index data. All secondary sleep outcomes, except total sleep time, also showed significant overall group×time interactions, favoring the SHUTi group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Given its efficacy and availability, internet-delivered CBT-I may have a key role in the dissemination of effective behavioral treatments for insomnia.

### Internet use and cognitive functioning in later life: focus on asymmetric effects and contextual factors [^974b55b8]. The Gerontologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Despite emerging literature linking Internet usage and cognitive functioning in later life, research seldom takes changes in older adults' Internet use into account. How changes in Internet use influence older adults' cognitive decline over time, particularly in the context of sociodemographic factors that shape Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use, remains an open question.

Research Design and Methods

Using 9 waves of panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (2002–2018), we examined within-person asymmetric effects of transitioning into and out of Internet use on cognitive functioning, and whether the associations vary across birth cohorts and by living arrangement.

Results

Transitioning into Internet use (i.e. Internet use onset) was associated with improved cognitive functioning at a given wave and decelerated cognitive decline over time. Transitioning out of the Internet (i.e. Internet use cessation) was associated with worse cognitive functioning at a given wave and accelerated cognitive decline over time. Furthermore, birth cohort and living arrangement moderated these associations. The detrimental effect of transitioning out of Internet use was worse for older adults born in 1941 or before. The cognitive benefits of transitioning into Internet use were greater for those older adults who live alone.

Discussion and Implications

These findings highlight the interplay between technology, social environment, and cognitive functioning in later life. The salubrious effects of using the Internet, as well as the deleterious effects of ceasing to use such technology, underscore the importance of promoting digital literacy and access to ICT among the older adult population.

### The promise and pitfalls of the internet for cognitive behavioral therapy [^909709e3]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Internet-administered cognitive behavior therapy is a promising new way to deliver psychological treatment. There are an increasing number of controlled trials in various fields such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders and health conditions such as headache and insomnia. Among the advantages for the field of cognitive behavior therapy is the dissemination of the treatment, being able to access treatment from a distance, and possibilities to tailor the interventions. To date, studies in which large effects have been obtained have included patient support from a clinician. Recent trials suggest that this support may come from non-clinicians and that therapist effects are minimal. Since studies also suggest that internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy can be equally effective as face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy, this is a finding that may have implications for CBT practitioners. However, there are other aspects to consider for implementation, as while clinicians may hold positive attitudes towards internet-delivered CBT a recent study suggested that patients are more skeptical and may prefer face-to-face treatment. In the present work, I argue that internet-delivered CBT may help to increase adherence to treatment protocols, that training can be facilitated by means of internet support, and that research on internet interventions can lead to new insights regarding what happens in regular CBT. Moreover, I conclude that internet-delivered CBT works best when support is provided, leaving an important role for clinicians who can incorporate internet treatment in their services. However, I also warn against disseminating internet-delivered CBT to patients for whom it is not suitable, and that clinical skills may suffer if clinicians are trained and practice mainly using the internet.

### Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: consensus guidance [^0a15769a]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and "staying at home" to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them.

### The association between internet-use-disorder symptoms and loneliness: a systematic review and meta-analysis with a categorical approach [^1da6d972]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The second research question addressed by this systematic review and meta-analysis was whether there are differences in the levels of loneliness according to the type of internet-use disorder. We considered it important to compare different types of internet-use disorders, as this was one of the aspects suggested for future research by the authors of the I-PACE model (Brand et al.). However, we found that effect sizes were similar to the overall pooling when dividing studies according to the type of internet-use disorder assessed. Previous meta-analyses have often combined all types of internet-use disorders into a single category. However, Wang and Zeng studied the moderating effect of measurement tools and did not find a significant result either.

This finding may be attributed to the possibility that the underlying mechanisms involving loneliness are similar across different types of internet-use disorders. Despite each internet-use disorder having its unique characteristics and nature, internet-use disorders may all be linked to reduced social skills and social interactions, which may exacerbate feelings of loneliness (Kim, LaRose, & Peng). Additionally, individuals with internet-use disorders, regardless of the specific type, might exhibit emotional regulation problems in response to negative emotions, like feelings of loneliness (Brand et al.). Moreover, loneliness and internet-use disorders may partly share underlying factors, such as dysregulation, reduced social skills, social anxiety, or dysthymia which may contribute to their association. The co-occurrence of internet-use disorders with other forms of psychopathology may further intensify loneliness, as shared psychopathological factors could mediate or drive the link (Cacioppo & Hawkley; Montag, Wegmann, Sariyska, Demetrovics, & Brand). For instance, conditions like social anxiety or dysthymia might lead to both loneliness and problematic use of the internet, creating a reinforcing cycle between the two. Consequently, they may engage in online behaviors as a maladaptive form of emotional regulation. Therefore, it is possible that the type of internet-use disorder does not have a specific impact on the loneliness experienced by these individuals, and that loneliness is a complex, transdiagnostic construct. We did not identify a moderating effect of specific variables such as sex, age, and region, despite their established association with loneliness in previous meta-analyses (Wang & Zeng; Zhang et al.). Their role should be further investigated in future high-quality studies.

### The internet [^b842b89d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The growing use of email and the world wide web (WWW), by the public, academics, and clinicians-as well as the increasing availability of high quality information on the WWW-make a working knowledge of the internet important. Although this article aims to enhance readers' existing use of the internet and medical resources on the WWW, it is also intelligible to someone unfamiliar with the internet. A web browser is one of the central pieces of software in modern computing: it is a window on the WWW, file transfer protocol sites, networked newsgroups, and your own computer's files. Effective use of the internet for professional purposes requires an understanding of the best strategies to search the WWW and the mechanisms for ensuring secure data transfer, as well as a compendium of online resources including journals, textbooks, medical portals, and sites providing high quality patient information. This article summarises these resources, available to incorporate into your web browser as downloadable "Favorites" or "Bookmarks" from www.jnnp.com, where there are also freely accessible hypertext links to the recommended sites.

### The effectiveness of internet-delivered treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^a0b1e0a7]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.7 Meta‐analysis of follow‐up outcomes

Six of the studies included follow‐up assessments of treatment and control groups (G. Andersson et al. 2012; Bell et al. 2012; Christensen et al. 2014; Hirsch et al. 2018; Salemink et al. 2014; Titov et al. 2010), rendering only the pooling of effect size across anxiety, depression, and worry outcomes feasible. Including six comparisons (five studies; treatment: n = 98, control: n = 59) with follow‐up periods ranging from 1‐ to 6‐months, follow‐up anxiety effect estimates were found to be large (g = −0.84; 95% CI −1.21, −0.46; p = .002). Heterogeneity appeared to be very low according to the Q value (Q (5) = 3.40; p = .64), I² metric (I² = 0.00%; 95% CI, 0%, 86.32%) and PI (95% PI, −1.21, −0.46). The same six comparisons (five studies) that included depression effect sizes suggested a moderate effect at follow‐up (g = −0.40; 95% CI, −0.76, −0.05; p = .031), with very low heterogeneity (Q (5) = 3.17; p = .67; I² = 0%; I² 95% CI, 0%, 77.24%; 95% PI, −0.76, −0.05). In relation to worry, five comparisons (four studies; treatment: n = 112, control: n = 62) evaluated outcomes at follow‐up time points ranging from 1‐ to 6‐months. This revealed a nonsignificant moderate effect (g = −0.35; 95% CI, −0.86, 0.17; p = .13), with limited heterogeneity (Q (4) = 4.95; p = .29; I² = 10.44%; I² 95% CI, 0%, 92.64%; 95% PI, −0.97, 0.28).

### Digital hazards for feeding and eating: what we know and what we don't [^ec5c70b3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We aimed to accrue recent evidence exploring effects of modern online activities (e.g. Internet use) on feeding and eating disorder symptoms, and related traits. We examined available evidence to ascertain any direct influences from online activities on feeding and eating disorders, thereby shedding light on putative mechanisms by which those influences may occur.

Recent Findings

Many facets of problematic usage of the Internet correlate cross sectionally with eating disorder and related psychopathology. There is evidence to suggest that significant effects do exist in the direction of specific Internet activities contributing to eating disorder symptoms, viewed dimensionally. Putative mechanisms are discussed. However, a significant number of eating disorder phenotypes and Internet-related activities remain under-researched. Specific facets of engagement with the online environment appear to confer risk for feeding and eating problems, evidence being strongest for non-clinical studies using dimensional measures. More research is required to rigorously confirm causal effects, including in patients meeting formal diagnostic criteria for eating disorders. We also highlight the need for high-quality evidence to explore how eating disorder phenotypes are commonly as well as uniquely affected by different online activities. Such research is needed in order that scientific understanding in this area can be translated to protect those most at risk of disordered eating, including through changes in public health approaches and clinical practice.

### Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression: a systematic review and individual patient data network meta-analysis [^09887401]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Personalized treatment choices would increase the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression to the extent that patients differ in interventions that better suit them.

Objective

To provide personalized estimates of short-term and long-term relative efficacy of guided and unguided iCBT for depression using patient-level information.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published up to January 1, 2019.

Study Selection

Eligible RCTs were those comparing guided or unguided iCBT against each other or against any control intervention in individuals with depression. Available individual patient data (IPD) was collected from all eligible studies. Depression symptom severity was assessed after treatment, 6 months, and 12 months after randomization.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We conducted a systematic review and IPD network meta-analysis and estimated relative treatment effect sizes across different patient characteristics through IPD network meta-regression.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores.

Results

Of 42 eligible RCTs, 39 studies comprising 9751 participants with depression contributed IPD to the IPD network meta-analysis, of which 8107 IPD were synthesized. Overall, both guided and unguided iCBT were associated with more effectiveness as measured by PHQ-9 scores than control treatments over the short term and the long term. Guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT (mean difference [MD] in posttreatment PHQ-9 scores, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.2), but we found no evidence of a difference at 6 or 12 months following randomization. Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5–9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Unguided iCBT was associated with similar effectiveness among individuals with symptoms of mild/subthreshold depression. Personalized treatment selection is entirely possible and necessary to ensure the best allocation of treatment resources for depression.

### Internet-based indicated prevention of anxiety and depression disorder onset three-arm randomized clinical trial [^384fe47c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

For sensitivity analyses on AD/DD incidence rates, the Cox model when controlling for baseline scores revealed a HR of 0.54 (95%-CI: 0.35–0.81) in the IG-IMI and a HR of 0.45 (95%-CI: 0.28–0.70) in the AG-IMI in comparison to WLC (type 3 test, p = 0.0004, Supplementary Table 1 in Appendix). The test for proportionality within the randomized groups yielded no substantive evidence contradicting this underlying assumption (p = 0.244). Participants with prior reported AD/DD episodes had a similar 12-month cumulative incidence of AD/DD (IG-IMI: 22.6%, AG-IMI: 18.9%, WLC: 35.0%) compared to the primary prevention sub-cohort (IG-IMI: 23.4%, AG-IMI: 21.5%, WLC: 36.4%). No statistically significant differences were observed between participants who had previously experienced AD/DD and those who had not, within each study arm (all ps > 0.05). Exploratory analyses of differences in anxiety and depressive disorders as secondary outcomes, comparisons between IG-IMI and AG-IMI for the composite AD/DD outcome, and study and intervention completer analyses are presented in Supplementary Results 1–4 and Supplementary Fig. 1 in Appendix.

### Associations between internet use, social participation, and cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults [^2686996c]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Internet use and its transition

Data on internet use was collected through the following questions: "Have you used the Internet in the last month?" in CHARLS; "In the house do you have Internet?" in MHAS; "Whether the respondent uses the World Wide Web, or Internet, for sending and receiving email or for any other purpose… ?" in HRS; "On average, how often do you use the Internet or email?" in ELSA; and "During the past 7 days, have you used the Internet, for e-mailing, searching for information, making purchases, or for any other purpose at least once?" in SHARE. Internet use was categorized as "yes" or "no" based on the questions above. Participants selected "yes" (in CHARLS, MHAS, HRS, and SHARE) or made the following choices: "less than every 3 months", "at least once every 3 months", "at least once a month (but not every week)", "at least once a week (but not every day)", "every day", or "almost every day" (in ELSA) was defined as internet use. The transition in internet use was determined by the internet use status between two consecutive waves in each database. Accordingly, it was classified into four categories: (1) "Yes → No", (2) "Yes → Yes", (3) "No → No", and (4) "No → Yes".

Social participation

Social participation was evaluated by inquiring of the participants regarding their engagement in social activities within the distinct cohorts. The classification of social participation was binary, designated as either "yes" or "no". Specifically, a participant was regarded as having social participation if they had engaged in any of these activities within their cohort.

### Effectiveness of a digital intervention versus alcohol information for online help-seekers in Sweden: a randomised controlled trial [^86cb03ac]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Research in context

The findings of this study are regarded as strong, within the paradigm of conventional online trial designs and subject to the range of study limitations stringently considered here. The size of the observed effects thus warrants some scrutiny. While our adjusted relative effect estimates are not directly comparable to the absolute differences estimated in meta-analyses, inspecting the differences in mean total weekly alcohol consumption in Table 2 suggests that the intervention group was drinking 30 g less at 4 months (Cohen's d = 0.25). This compares with meta-analytic estimates of effects of 32.3 g (mean follow-up interval 3.4 months), 22.8 g (mean follow-up interval 5.5 months), and 18.6 g (mean follow-up interval 3.1 months). Moreover, synthesised effects of frequency of heavy episodic drinking have suggested that digital interventions may reduce the expected number of episodes per month by 0.24 (mean follow-up interval 3.3 months) and 0.33 (mean follow-up interval 3.1 months), whilst in this trial, we observed a difference in means of 1.7 episodes per month (Cohen's d = 0.29). Due to retention in online trials being a challenge, the trial did not investigate follow-up after 4 months, which prohibits consideration of the existence of any longer-term effects.

### Sustaining the internet with hyperbolic mapping [^0df34fd7]. Nature Communications (2010). Medium credibility.

The Internet infrastructure is severely stressed. Rapidly growing overheads associated with the primary function of the Internet-routing information packets between any two computers in the world-cause concerns among Internet experts that the existing Internet routing architecture may not sustain even another decade. In this paper, we present a method to map the Internet to a hyperbolic space. Guided by a constructed map, which we release with this paper, Internet routing exhibits scaling properties that are theoretically close to the best possible, thus resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces today. Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method can provide a different perspective on the community structure in complex networks.

### A study of the deconstruction and construction of self-efficacy in internet use among older people [^5758e7ff]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

World technological progress accelerated the arrival of "information society", and the age group of Internet users has gradually expanded to include older people. China is witnessing swift advancement in its digital society, and the older netizen population warrants special attention. Statistics for December 2024 showed that there were 170 million Internet users aged 60 years and above in China; this trend has continued (China Internet Network Information Center, 2024). The Internet can provide support for older people's daily lives, improve their ability to participate in society, reduce loneliness, and improve their quality of life. Although the Internet itself has no enabling function, it facilitates information production and dissemination, impacting older people's traditional thinking.

However, in the new era of Internet Plus (Internet integration with traditional industries), older people are in a vulnerable situation for survival and adaptation compared with other age groups, and there are still hundreds of millions of older people who have "failed to catch the information express train" in terms of Internet use. Many challenges faced by older people, such as limited Internet access, lack of guidance, and technological complexity, lead to low levels of digital engagement and the dilemma of the digital divide, which significantly affect their quality of life and health status.

Although many studies have shown that Internet use can reduce depression and improve cognitive function among older people, the impact on life satisfaction remains unclear from their perspective. It is necessary to explore attitudes and self-perception relating to Internet use and the underlying mechanisms among older people based on a systematic framework that builds on descriptive analyses of their Internet use behaviors and external situations.

Despite recognition of the potential benefits of Internet use for older people, limited research has explored how their attitudes toward technology and self-efficacy in using the Internet influence their digital engagement. Drawing on life course theory, this study examined how life stage transitions shaped older people's motivation and ability to adopt Internet technologies. Understanding this gap is critical because fostering positive attitudes and enhancing self-efficacy could promote digital inclusion and improve older people's well-being in an increasingly digital society.

### Integrating internet multisource big data to predict the occurrence and development of COVID-19 cryptic transmission [^2fb8d944]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditional infectious disease monitoring only collects data at the diagnosis stage, which leads to problems such as incomplete coverage and weak timeliness. There are limited early warning and monitoring capabilities for newly discovered unexplained infectious diseases. Currently, with the rapid development of health service informatization and Internet big data technology, the way people obtain health information and mine data has gradually changed. The Internet is the source of much health-related data, which have high application value. Better integration and utilization of Internet big data can improve the sensitivity and timeliness of infectious disease early warning systems, which is an optimization and extension of traditional infectious disease early warning monitoring research. At present, there are some studies on tracking infectious diseases using Internet search data –, and the results have shown that there is a correlation between COVID-19 and specific Internet search words, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Leading features of Internet multisource big data.

During the prevention, identification of symptoms, and diagnosis of infectious diseases, individuals will spontaneously generate health information search behaviour, thus generating Internet search behaviour data. Compared with official case monitoring, Internet search data are proactive and relevant.

In the selection of Internet big data, previous studies mostly focused on Internet retrieval data, such as the Google Flu Trends (GFT) –. Nevertheless, it cannot be ignored that individuals' Internet search behaviour is not entirely spontaneous and may be prompted by external factors (such as media information). Simply using Internet retrieval data cannot fully reveal the information search behaviour of groups on the Internet and may increase the risk of overfitting during the prediction process –. In previous studies, some scholars have used the GFT to analyze the incidence rate of flu and have detected an abnormal phenomenon in which the search index has increased but no local epidemic has occurred –. The abnormality was due to the interference effect caused by online media data. Hence, we put forward a solution of Internet multisource big data; that is, we propose combining the comprehensive application of Internet retrieval data, population migration data, and Internet media data to provide an early warning mechanism for the occurrence and development of COVID-19 cryptic transmission.

### Survey design: to ask or not to ask? That is the question [^a93395c9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Surveys are one of the most frequent modes of observation and measurement. Survey research can be exploratory, descriptive, and/or explanatory. Modes of survey administration vary and include face-to-face, telephone, mail, and Internet. There are numerous considerations that that must be taken into account when designing and conducting a survey. Deciding what information is needed and why is important when developing questions for a survey; it is essential to define the purpose of the survey and to be as specific as possible in terms of the data to be collected. Response rate varies by target audience and is influenced by a number of factors such as incentives, survey length, and perceived burden. From question development to survey construction, the goal is to minimize measurement error with systematic planning and execution.

What is an Online Group?

Online groups are digital communities affording members opportunities to interact with one another using the internet. Many online communities, including most online support groups, are also repositories of helpful information and advice. Members usually have to 'sign up' to the community and agree to abide by certain rules and expected behaviours. There are many ways for members to interact in online groups, including taking part in diagnosis-specific patient forums, in chat rooms or by subscribing to email lists.

### Factors influencing the level of patients using the internet to gather information before anaesthesia: a single-centre survey of 815 patients in Switzerland: the internet for patient information before anaesthesia [^5b07344d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

In univariate analyses, status of higher education and more extensive usual internet using habit were associated with internet use. In contrast, higher age, ASA physical status 2, and experience from previous anaesthetics were associated with not using the internet for that purpose (Table 2). After adjusting for all other covariates, more extensive usual internet using habit, and planned moderate in contrast to minor surgery were independently associated with internet use. Experience from previous anaesthetics was associated with not doing so (Table 2). Statistical analysis of the patients having used the internet to gather information about their upcoming anaesthetic did not reveal any significant differences compared to the patients having used the internet to gather more general information (Table 3).

### Internet use and life satisfaction among empty nesters in rural areas of yangzhou: based on propensity score matching and mediating effect model [^07706299]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Internet use was more strongly associated with life satisfaction among middle-aged and younger empty nesters compared to their older counterparts. Younger empty nesters tended to exhibit better cognitive function and showed a greater willingness to embrace new technologies. They made use of the Internet's information accessibility to meet various needs, which positively impacted their overall life satisfaction. In contrast, older empty nesters may face more barriers to Internet usage. Regarding gender differences, males typically had more exposure to technology and related activities, making it easier for them to accept and use the Internet as they age. Moreover, older males may have more leisure time available to use the Internet, while older females often shoulder greater household responsibilities, leading to reduced Internet usage. Non-employed empty nesters may increasingly rely on the Internet for information due to a lack of daily work and social activities. In contrast, those who were employed may have limited time to engage with the Internet. For empty nesters with an income, the use of the Internet had a stronger correlation with their life satisfaction, which may be because the Internet provided information acquisition, social interaction, entertainment, and other functions to meet some of their needs. Conversely, empty nesters without an income may not access the Internet as frequently or fully due to economic constraints, thus weakening the potential impact of Internet use on life satisfaction. Additionally, empty nesters with chronic conditions may be influenced by various other factors, such as psychological stress and the increased economic burden associated with their conditions, which can obscure the positive relationship between Internet use and life satisfaction.

### The impact of the internet on cancer outcomes [^004f475d]. CA (2004). Low credibility.

Each day, more than 12.5 million health-related computer searches are conducted on the World Wide Web. Based on a meta-analysis of 24 published surveys, the author estimates that in the developed world, about 39% of persons with cancer are using the Internet, and approximately 2.3 million persons living with cancer worldwide are online. In addition, 15% to 20% of persons with cancer use the Internet "indirectly" through family and friends. Based on a comprehensive review of the literature, the available evidence on how persons with cancer are using the Internet and the effect of Internet use on persons with cancer is summarized. The author distinguishes four areas of Internet use: communication (electronic mail), community (virtual support groups), content (health information on the World Wide Web), and e-commerce. A conceptual framework summarizing the factors involved in a possible link between Internet use and cancer outcomes is presented, and future areas for research are highlighted.

### Effects of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia on insomnia severity: a large-scale randomised controlled trial [^9c301410]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Although several large-scale randomised controlled trials have shown the efficacy of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I), there is a need to validate widespread dissemination of dCBT-I using recommended key outcomes for insomnia. We investigated the effect of a fully automated dCBT-I programme on insomnia severity, sleep-wake patterns, sleep medication use, and daytime impairment.

Methods

We did a parallel-group superiority randomised controlled trial comparing dCBT-I with online patient education about sleep. The interventions were available through a free-to-access website, publicised throughout Norway, which incorporated automated screening, informed consent, and randomisation procedures, as well as outcome assessments. Adults (age ≥ 18 years) who had regular internet access and scored 12 or higher on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were eligible for inclusion, and were allocated (1:1) to receive dCBT-I (consisting of six core interactive sessions to be completed over 9 weeks) or patient education (control group). Participants were masked to group assignment and had no contact with researchers during the intervention period. The primary outcome was the change in ISI score from baseline to 9-week follow-up, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02558647) and is ongoing, with 2-year follow-up assessments planned.

Findings

Between Feb 26, 2016, and July 1, 2018, 5349 individuals commenced the online screening process, of which 1497 were ineligible or declined to participate, 2131 discontinued the screening process, and 1721 were randomly allocated (868 to receive dCBT-I and 853 to receive patient education). At 9-week follow-up, 584 (67%) participants in the dCBT-I group and 534 (63%) in the patient education group completed the ISI assessment. The latent growth model showed that participants in the dCBT-I group had a significantly greater reduction in ISI scores from baseline (mean score 19·2 [SD 3·9]) to 9-week follow-up (10·4 [6·2]) than those in the patient education group (from 19·6 [4·0] to 15·2 [5·3]; estimated mean difference -4·7 (95% CI -5·4 to -4·1; Cohen's d -1·21; p < 0·001). Compared with patient education, the number needed to treat with dCBT-I was 2·7 (95% CI 2·4 to 3·2) for treatment response (ISI score reduction ≥ 8) and 3·2 (2·8 to 3·8) for insomnia remission (ISI score < 8). No adverse events were reported to the trial team.

Interpretation

dCBT-I is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms associated with the insomnia disorder. These findings support the widespread dissemination of dCBT-I. Future research is needed to identify the moderators of response and to improve targeting.

### A picture speaks a thousand words: the use of digital photography and the internet as a cost-effective tool in monitoring free flaps [^8989f94e]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Microsurgical free tissue transfer is progressing rapidly and is being used more frequently the world over. Monitoring these cases is crucial for a satisfactory outcome. More sophisticated methods are available for monitoring, though they are often expensive. We propose a novel technique using digital photography and the Internet to offer a reliable and cost-effective method to monitor free-tissue transfers. During an 8-month period, 163 microvascular procedures were monitored using this technique. Serial photographs taken were stored in a separate case folder and sent to the surgeon as deemed necessary. Analysis of the 67 cases is presented. Five reexplorations were done. The early diagnosis of venous congestion was possible using this technique. Timely intervention contributed to the success of the reexplorations, and these flaps could be salvaged. The file size of images was in the range of 1 MB to 6 MB. The file size of a set of photographs was usually around 7 MB to 9 MB. These were sent across the asymmetric digital subscriber line Internet lines. The use of the digital images and the Internet allows reconstructive surgeons to have a reliable picture of the state of their free-tissue transfers. This allows decreasing observer error and saves valuable time which otherwise needs to be spent to verify situations of doubt.

### Triple digital divide and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older Chinese adults: a disparity analysis [^44bc439c]. General Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this longitudinal study, we found increasing trajectories of depressive symptoms concerning the digital divide among middle-aged and older adults in China, and there were gender, rural–urban and regional disparities over the recent decade. First, our findings unveiled notable gender disparities, with the beneficial effects of internet usage and improved internet skills on depressive symptoms being more evident among men compared with women over time. Among women, those using the internet exhibited higher levels of depressive symptoms than internet non-users at wave 2, a phenomenon absent among men. Second, in terms of rural–urban disparities, the depressive symptom trajectories of those who used the internet, acquired more internet skills and accessed more internet services changed over time among the urban group. Third, regarding regional disparities, a slower increase in depressive symptom trajectories linked to internet skills was evident only in the eastern and central region groups. Additionally, among the central region group, an increase in usage of internet services was associated with a slower rise in depressive symptoms.

Our analysis revealed that participants who used the internet, who acquired advanced internet skills and who accessed more internet services exhibited a slower increase in depressive symptoms over the follow-up period, highlighting the impact of the digital divide. This phenomenon can be attributed, in part, to the happiness incentive fostered by internet use. On one hand, the internet transcends social and spatial barriers, enabling individuals to maintain connections with family, friends and the wider world. By facilitating increased external interactions, the internet strengthens social support, alleviates social isolation and neglect, and boosts individuals' self-esteem, sense of belonging and control. This, in turn, has a mitigating effect on depressive symptomatology. On the other hand, various internet services provide individuals with enhanced information and knowledge resources, enriching life experiences and reinforcing self-efficacy. This mechanism contributes to the alleviation and reduction of depressive symptoms and stress. For instance, entertainment services via the internet could stimulate the release of dopamine, thereby mitigating depression.

### Barriers to accessing internet-based home care for older patients: a qualitative study [^d0f475c7]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this paper, we explored the barriers to accessing internet-based home care for older patients using Levesque's access to health care framework and identified four barriers to home care for older patients: barriers to perceiving internet-based home care, barriers to perceiving internet-based home care, barriers to paying for internet-based home care and barriers to engaging in internet-based home care. According to Levesque's access to care framework, which concerns routine patient hospital visits, patients do not need to arrive at the hospital to receive internet-based home care, and no specific barriers are present in reaching internet-based home care.

Older patients' traditional perceptions of medical care and cognitive biases about internet-based home care have a significant impact on their perceptions of internet-based home care. The subjective perceptions of older patients that internet-based home care lacks formality and is mostly for seriously ill patients, coupled with the fact that older people are less likely to use the internet as a communication tool for health-related matters, has led to low acceptance of the new industry of internet-based home care by older patients. Only by strengthening comprehensive health education and making older patients correctly understand the connotation and importance of internet-based home care can we improve their sense of identification with the service and stimulate their potential demand. In addition, because internet-based home care cannot replace the emotional support provided by children, older patients tend to prefer their children's care, which not only increases their children's caregiving burden but also may negatively affect the physical health of older patients due to their children's low professional quality.

### Internet use and its impact on internalizing disorder symptoms and sleep in adolescents with an evening circadian preference [^ed3f0831]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

This study sought to examine the relationship between internet use, sleep, and internalizing disorder symptoms in adolescents with an evening circadian preference.

Methods

One hundred seventy-two adolescents aged 10–18 years with an evening circadian preference completed a week of sleep diaries and questionnaires about internet use and internalizing disorder symptoms.

Results

Adolescents reported internet use for 3.81 hours on weekdays and 5.44 hours on weekends, with > 90% having access to both a computer with internet and a personal cell phone. A majority of adolescents used the internet from 4–8 pm (71%) and from 9–11 pm (62%). Common online activities included listening to music (77%), watching videos (64%), communicating with others (64%), and doing homework (58%). Late-night internet use (9–11 pm) was associated with more internalizing disorder symptoms. Middle-of-the-night internet use (midnight-5 am) was associated with a later bedtime, shorter total sleep time, and more internalizing disorder symptoms. Adolescents used the internet to fulfill social needs, to avoid or combat boredom, or for maladaptive activities. Using the internet for social interaction or avoidance/boredom was associated with higher internalizing disorder symptoms. Using the internet for maladaptive reasons was associated with more late-night and middle-of-the-night use.

Conclusions

Adolescent internet use late at night and in the middle of the night is common. Internet use may be motivated by desires for social connection, by boredom/avoidance, or for maladaptive behaviors. Because middle-of-the-night internet use was associated with higher internalizing disorder symptoms and worse sleep, it presents as a potential target for intervention.

### Use of the internet and e-mail for health care information: results from a national survey [^17b2718b]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

The Internet has attracted considerable attention as a means to improve health and health care delivery, but it is not clear how prevalent Internet use for health care really is or what impact it has on health care utilization. Available estimates of use and impact vary widely. Without accurate estimates of use and effects, it is difficult to focus policy discussions or design appropriate policy activities.

Objectives

To measure the extent of Internet use for health care among a representative sample of the US population, to examine the prevalence of e-mail use for health care, and to examine the effects that Internet and e-mail use has on users' knowledge about health care matters and their use of the health care system.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Survey conducted in December 2001 and January 2002 among a sample drawn from a research panel of more than 60 000 US households developed and maintained by Knowledge Networks. Responses were analyzed from 4764 individuals aged 21 years or older who were self-reported Internet users.

Main Outcome Measures

Self-reported rates in the past year of Internet and e-mail use to obtain information related to health, contact health care professionals, and obtain prescriptions; perceived effects of Internet and e-mail use on health care use.

Results

Approximately 40% of respondents with Internet access reported using the Internet to look for advice or information about health or health care in 2001. Six percent reported using e-mail to contact a physician or other health care professional. About one third of those using the Internet for health reported that using the Internet affected a decision about health or their health care, but very few reported impacts on measurable health care utilization; 94% said that Internet use had no effect on the number of physician visits they had and 93% said it had no effect on the number of telephone contacts. Five percent or less reported use of the Internet to obtain prescriptions or purchase pharmaceutical products.

Conclusions

Although many people use the Internet for health information, use is not as common as is sometimes reported. Effects on actual health care utilization are also less substantial than some have claimed. Discussions of the role of the Internet in health care and the development of policies that might influence this role should not presume that use of the Internet for health information is universal or that the Internet strongly influences health care utilization.

### Development and validity data of the Brazilian internet study on temperament and psychopathology (BRAINSTEP) [^4a8f7701]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The internet provides a research opportunity for psychiatry and psychology. This article presents the development and preliminary data of a large web-survey created to study how temperament relates to other psychological measures, behavior and psychiatric disorders.

Methods

We used the Affective and Emotional Composite Temperament Scale (AFECTS) to evaluate temperament and we selected several self-report instruments to evaluate behavior, psychological constructs and mental disorders. The system provides anonymous psychological (phase 1) and psychiatric (phase 2) feedback and includes questions to assess the validity of the answers. Each phase has around 450 questions. This system was broadcast utilizing Brazilian media.

Results

After the exclusion of 21.5% of the volunteers (those who failed the validation questions), 41,427 participants concluded the first part of the system (mean age = 31.2 ± 10.5 yrs, 26.9% males), and 21,836 (mean age = 32.5 ± 10.9 yrs, 25.1% males) completed phase 2. Around 25% have received a psychiatric diagnosis from a mental health professional. Demographic and temperament profiles of those who completed either only 80 questions, only phase 1, or the whole system were similar. The rate of non-serious answers (e.g. on bizarre behaviors) was very low and congruency of answers was very high. The internal consistency of classical trait scales (TCI-R and PANAS) was high (Cronbach's alpha > 0.80) for all dimensions.

Limitations

Relatively high dropout rate due to the length of the process and an overrepresentation of female, young and well-educated subjects.

Conclusions

The BRAINSTEP provides valid and abundant data on psychological and psychiatric measures.

### Triple digital divide and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older Chinese adults: a disparity analysis [^9c49b95a]. General Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

With respect to regional disparity, the study found that a slower increase in depressive symptom trajectories with respect to more internet skills or internet services was observed over time solely among participants in the eastern and central regions. This observation highlights the historical and developmental context of China, particularly the impact of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–1990), which initially classified the nation into three development tiers: the eastern, the central and the western regions. Subsequent sequential developmental trajectories, beginning with the eastern region followed by the central and western regions, have led to an imbalanced and centralised pattern of regional advancement. Significant disparities exist in the development of information technology and internet usage levels across these three regions in China, exhibiting a gradual increase in the capacity of internet usage from the western to the central and then the eastern regions. Compared with the western region, the eastern and central regions boast superior high-speed network infrastructure, internet penetration and broadband service quality. Furthermore, residents from the eastern and central regions typically possess higher educational levels, resulting in higher internet utilisation efficiency, better literacy and proficiency in internet usage, and enhanced transformation efficiency of internet usage into social participation which could significantly relieve depressed mood. Consequently, internet use in these more developed regions has a more pronounced impact on the trajectory of depressive symptoms. In contrast, less extensive internet usage, limited internet skills and fewer internet services within the western region exert a lessened effect of the internet on depressive symptom trajectories compared with the other regions.

Implication

The findings of this study carry significant implications for public health policy. First, it is crucial to establish and enhance high-speed network infrastructure, broadband service quality and a diverse range of internet services throughout the country. This will not only elevate the level of internet usage among middle-aged and older adults but also enhance the protective effects of the internet on mental health. Second, implementing strategies aimed at boosting internet knowledge and skills among this vulnerable demographic while simultaneously guiding them to use the internet in a responsible manner is paramount. Such approaches could mitigate the potentially harmful effects of internet use on mental health. Lastly, it is urgent that policy efforts prioritise providing greater access to the internet and its various services to middle-aged and older adults in rural areas and the western region. Furthermore, supporting women in enhancing their internet skills is vital, as this would address their disadvantages in using the internet.

426 students who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from 11th and 12th grade classes from Kendriya Vidyalaya, New Delhi, India, and were assessed by Young's Internet Addiction Test and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire.

Results

Among the 426 students, the mean internet addiction total score was 36.63 (20.78), which indicated mild level of internet addiction. 1.41% (six students) was diagnosed as excessive internet users, while 30.28% and 23.94% were classified as moderate and mild internet users, respectively. The prevalence of internet addiction between gender was 58.22% in males and 41.78% in females. While both positive (prosocial) and negative (hyperactivity, emotional, conduct and peer problem) impacts of internet use were reported by students, in the current study excessive use of internet had a negative impact on students' lives as compared with positive impact, which was statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Excessive internet use led to abnormal behaviours which cause negative consequences to users. Early diagnosis of risk factors related to excessive internet use, provides education about responsible use and supervision of students by family members.

### The dark side of the association between internet use and older adults' subjective wellbeing: the role of subjective social class [^47992755]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Theoretical contribution

This study makes several theoretical contributions that have not been emphasized in existing research. Firstly, by confirming the positive relationship between internet use and subjective wellbeing among older adults in the Chinese context, it demonstrates that despite China's collectivist culture emphasizing offline social connections, online interactions facilitated by the internet are also highly significant for older adults. Additionally, despite regional variations in internet infrastructure development and low internet usage rates among older adults in China, these constraints do not impede older adults from benefiting from internet use to enhance their subjective wellbeing. Secondly, this study proposes and verifies the mediating role of hope between internet use and subjective wellbeing among older adults, representing psychological mechanisms. Given the limited attention in existing studies to the mediating mechanisms of the association between internet use and older adults' subjective wellbeing, coupled with a lack of exploration into psychological mechanisms, this finding provides a novel theoretical framework for understanding why internet use can improve their subjective wellbeing. Lastly, this study confirms the moderating role of subjective social class perceived by older adults, highlighting that internet use does not always lead to improved subjective wellbeing. Specifically, for older adults with a low subjective social class, internet use may expose them to more social unfairness information, thus intensifying upward social comparison and weakening the benefits of internet use on subjective wellbeing by triggering a heightened sense of deprivation and injustice.

Implications and limitations

This study has several implications. Firstly, given internet use is significantly related to older adults' subjective wellbeing, it is crucial to enhance the development of age-friendly internet devices and bridge the "digital divide" among older adults. These steps are essential prerequisites for future online interventions targeting older adults' subjective wellbeing. Secondly, the mediating role of hope in the association between internet use and older adults' subjective wellbeing underscores the importance of geriatric social workers designing online intervention strategies aimed at fostering hope among older adults using the internet. This is particularly pertinent for older adults with lower subjective social class, as interventions targeting hope may have a more pronounced role on enhancing subjective wellbeing in this group. Thirdly, the absence of discernible benefits of internet use for older adults with lower subjective social class highlights the need to prevent these individuals from experiencing a decline in wellbeing while using the internet. To achieve this, older adults with lower subjective social class should be vigilant about the authenticity of online information. Additionally, government authorities should intensify their supervision of online content and act as a "gatekeeper" to ensure the safety and reliability of internet usage among older adults.

### Internet-versus telephone-based local outbreak investigations [^afbfec83]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Local health departments often deal with constrained resources when investigating outbreaks. In this article, we have shown the utility of conducting Internet-based investigations at the local level. Telephone interviews are often the most time-consuming aspect of an outbreak investigation. In this study, a median time of 30 min was needed for health department employees to complete a telephone interview, whereas the Internet-based survey took a median of 5 min of the respondent's time to complete and no health department employee time. Furthermore, fewer telephone calls were needed for the Internet-based investigations because follow-up telephone calls were made only to nonresponders, a small subset of cohort members. This was particularly true in the household-setting outbreaks, in which the response rate to the Internet-based survey was 100%, and no telephone calls were necessary. Moreover, because responses to the Internet-based survey were entered directly by the respondent, health department staff time for data entry was further reduced. Thus, Internet-based investigations can greatly reduce workload for local health departments. More studies are needed to further quantify the resource savings in Internet-based investigations and to analyze the effects of this data collection method on data quality.

We found that Internet-based surveys were associated with high levels of respondent satisfaction. Most respondents found the Internet-based survey preferable and easy to use. In professional-setting outbreaks, satisfaction may be higher when all participants have access to their own computers, rather than taking turns on a single computer. This finding contrasts with that of the household-setting outbreaks, in which, despite the sharing of a computer by household members, response rates and satisfaction rates were high. Thus, when Internet access is available, Internet-based surveys may be well received by respondents, particularly in household settings.

One limitation of this study is the small number of outbreaks analyzed and the small sample sizes. Another major limitation to any Internet-based outbreak investigation is participant access to the Internet. Internet-based investigations can only be used when Internet access is widespread among the group being surveyed. Factors such as age, race, and income level may affect the familiarity with and availability of the Internet, as may geographic and language-related issues.

Public health agencies should assess these factors before initiating an Internet-based outbreak investigation. When access issues are not present, the Internet can be a useful and economical tool for investigating outbreaks.

### Tracing digital therapeutics research across medical specialties: evidence from clinicalTrials.gov [^5deda8d0]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Digital therapeutics (DTx), evidence-based software interventions for preventing, managing, or treating medical disorders, have rapidly evolved with healthcare's shift toward online, patient-centric solutions. This study scrutinizes DTx clinical trials from 2005 to 2022, analyzing their growth, funding, underlying medical specialties, and other R&D characteristics, using ClinicalTrials.gov data. Our analysis includes trials categorized via the ICD-11 system, covering active, recruiting, or completed studies and considering trials listing multiple conditions. In analyzing 5,889 registered DTx trials, we document a more than five-fold increase in such trials since 2011, and a compound annual growth rate of 22.82% since 2005. While most trials were single-center, the median number of study subjects increased in recent years, driven by larger interventional trials. The key disciplines driving this growth were psychiatry, neurology, oncology, and endocrinology. Mental health dominated DTx trials in recent years, led by neurocognitive disorders, substance abuse disorders, and mood disorders. Industry funding varied across disciplines and was particularly high in visual system diseases and dermatology. DTx trials have surged since 2005, accelerated by recent growth in mental health trials. These trends mirror developments toward remote healthcare delivery, amplified by digital health investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Growing numbers of participants in DTx trials point to increased demand for more robust trials. However, because most trials are single-center and country-specific, more international cooperation and harmonized evaluation standards will be essential for DTx trials to become more efficient and provide validation across countries, health systems, and groups of individuals.

### Impaired orienting in youth with internet addiction: evidence from the attention network task (ANT) [^04ae179e]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

An important theory of attention suggests that there are three separate networks that execute discrete cognitive functions: alerting, orienting and conflict networks. Recent studies showed that there was a dysfunction of attention in Internet Addiction. In order to investigate the underlying mechanism of attention dysfunction in Internet Addiction, we recorded performance related to the Attentional Network Test (ANT) in youth.

Methods

The ANT, a behavioral assay of the functional integrity of attention networks, was used to examine the performance in Internet Addiction and healthy controls.

Results

Performance on the ANT clearly differentiated the participants with and without Internet Addiction in terms of mean reaction times (RTs). Compared with control group, the Internet Addiction group detected targets more slowly and this effect was evident only for spatial cue condition. The Internet Addiction group demonstrated deficits in the orienting network in terms of slower RT. There was no demonstration of a deficit in both the alerting and conflict network in Internet Addiction on this task.

Conclusions

The youth with Internet Addiction demonstrated deficits in the orienting network but normal functioning of the alerting and conflict attention networks.

### Privacy preserving optimization of communication networks [^7c9c4f44]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Modern society takes connectivity for granted, relying heavily on communication networks, both for interpersonal connection and to support critical infrastructure. As Internet- and data-driven technologies become increasingly pervasive, our dependence on fast, reliable communication will only deepen, necessitating advanced tools for optimizing network efficiency and resilience. Such optimization must account for the interplay between the static network infrastructure and the dynamic user preferences. The challenge is that while the infrastructure data is accessible to network operators, the user preferences, tied to personal mobility and communication habits, are protected by privacy laws and are thus heavily restricted. To address this, we introduce CLUSTER: an interpretable Bayesian nonparametric framework that leverages aggregate, low-resolution, unprotected data to identify user groups with correlated connection patterns. By uncovering these patterns, we show, CLUSTER offers actionable insights, from scheduling base-station activation to guiding deployment of new stations - all without compromising user privacy. CLUSTER thus offers a principled approach to extract meaningful insights from restricted data.

### Prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression in a nonclinical online sample with DSM-5 internet gaming disorder [^5d1d1603]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the prevalence and correlates of comorbid depression among patients with internet gaming disorder using the Internet Gaming Disorder scale (IGD-9) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among nonclinical online survey respondents.

Methods

Korean adolescents and adults from 14 to 39 years of age were selected. We compared internet gaming use patterns and sociodemographic and clinical variables between patients with internet gaming disorder who had depression and those without depression.

Results

In 2016, 7200 people participated in an online survey. Respondents with internet gaming disorder that was comorbid with depression were older, more often female, had greater Internet Addiction Test total scores, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test total scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 total scores, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence total scores, and higher Dickman Dysfunctional Impulsivity Instrument dysfunctional subscale scores than those without depression. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender, problematic alcohol use, anxiety, and a past history of psychiatric counseling or treatment due to internet gaming use were significant predictors for comorbid depression among participants with internet gaming disorder.

Conclusion

Depression was a common comorbidity of internet gaming disorder. Internet gaming disorder with comorbid depression was related to more serious psychiatric phenomenology and a greater psychiatric burden.

### The darknet and suicide [^9f8ae774]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Context

The Internet contains both public content ("Surface Web"), and private content ("Deep Web") sometimes hosted on exclusive networks ("Darknets") only accessible using dedicated software such as TOR (The Onion Router). This software makes it almost impossible to identify its users. Information media have reported on suicide-related aspects of Darknets, for example when poisons that can be used to kill oneself are offered for sale (Le Garff et al., 2016) when users discuss ways to kill oneself in anonymous forums (Ferrara, 2016; Franceschi-Bicchierai, 2015) and suicides that follow bullying or "doxing" (online divulgation without consent of intimate personal information) (Bartlett, 2015). Several recent studies have analyzed the nature of suicide content on the Surface Web, but to date, there have been no systematic investigations of suicidal content available on Darknets.

Objectives

The object was to document the nature and accessibility of suicide-related information available on the TOR Darknet or via the TOR software.

Methods

We replicated the methodology used by Biddle et al. (2008, 2016) in their studies of the Surface Web, using TOR on the Darknet. We identified and chose nine search engines used on the TOR Darknet: TORCH the TOR search engine, Notevil, Ahmia, Candle, Hidden Wiki, Darknet (onion.link), Duckduckgo and Grams. Two research assistants independently coded the first 30 results of searches using the keywords, "suicide" and "suicide methods".

Results

There were 476 "hits" in the search for "suicide" and "suicide method" using TOR, with fewer sites dedicated to suicide (4%), compared to the Surface Web (23.1%) (Biddle et al., 2016). Over half of the sites proposed by the TOR search engines (252, 52.9%) were outdated, inaccessible or not containing content pertinent to suicide or suicide methods. Several of the TOR search engines provided access to forums ("chat boards") where suicide was a topic (70, 14.8%). These were usually pro-suicide, are blocked or filtered by most of the Surface Web engines (e.g. Google).

Discussion

Persons concerned with suicide prevention should conduct further investigations of pro-suicide forums that are accessible using TOR and their users, comparing them with the Surface Web. New strategies to prevent suicide may need to be developed for Darknets.
