New onset copd

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing new-onset COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis with spirometry and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify symptom burden and exacerbation risk to assign a GOLD group. Next, I will consider special populations such as young COPD and asthma–COPD overlap. After that, I need to outline initial pharmacologic therapy by GOLD group, followed by non-pharmacologic foundations. Finally, I should address exacerbation management, follow-up and monitoring, and common pitfalls, ensuring each step aligns with current GOLD and related guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis, because I need to ensure we are not anchoring on symptoms alone. COPD requires post-bronchodilator spirometry showing FEV1/FVC less than 0.70, with attention to age-adjusted thresholds in older adults and the lower limit of normal to avoid overdiagnosis, and I should repeat spirometry if results are borderline or if the clinical picture does not fit the obstruction severity [^114bjVtx] [^114QXf45] [^115JnRGF].

> Wait, let me verify the differential before labeling COPD definitively. Asthma, heart failure, bronchiectasis, and interstitial lung disease can mimic COPD, and distinguishing COPD from asthma is particularly challenging in smokers and older adults, so I should review history for atopy, variability, and reversibility patterns, and consider CT if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if bronchiectasis is suspected [^117PBcKe] [^113Qv6Zb].

> I will now examine symptom burden and health status using validated tools. The mMRC and CAT help quantify dyspnea and overall symptom impact, and I should remember that chronic dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom, while cough and sputum may precede airflow obstruction by years, so I need to ask carefully about activity limitation and daily symptom fluctuation [^116v1E3B] [^1136DXyW].

> Next, I should review exacerbation history and risk. I need to ask about prior episodes, oral steroids, antibiotics, and hospitalizations, and I should obtain a baseline blood eosinophil count because an eosinophil level of 300 cells/μL or higher predicts greater benefit from inhaled corticosteroids when added to dual bronchodilation, which will shape initial therapy in higher-risk patients [^1136DXyW] [^1119hVwa].

> Hold on, I should verify the GOLD grouping before jumping to treatment. The current ABE scheme places patients into Group A with low symptoms and low exacerbation risk, Group B with high symptoms and low risk, and Group E with high exacerbation risk regardless of symptoms, replacing the older ABCD model and aligning initial pharmacotherapy to this stratification [^1164Dcbs] [^116FHBjp].

> Let me consider special populations. Young COPD, defined operationally as ages 20–50, is often underrecognized and may have early-life risk factors or family history, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and ensure timely diagnosis and risk-factor modification, while also screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in appropriate patients [^112PrnWX] [^115JnRGF].

> For Group A, I should confirm that a single long-acting bronchodilator is appropriate. GOLD recommends starting with a LAMA or a LABA based on symptom relief, with LAMA preferred if available and affordable, and I should reassess in 3 months to document benefit and adherence before making changes [^117Q63TS] [^116yUJw5].

> For Group B, I need to ensure I am not under-treating. Dual LABA+LAMA is the preferred initial choice because it improves symptoms and lung function more than LAMA alone in symptomatic patients, though if dual therapy is not feasible, either LAMA or LABA monotherapy can be considered with close follow-up to verify response [^117Q63TS] [^116yUJw5].

> For Group E, I should double-check that I am prioritizing exacerbation prevention. Start with LABA+LAMA, and if blood eosinophils are 300 cells/μL or higher, consider adding ICS to make triple therapy, recognizing the increased pneumonia risk and the need to de-escalate if stable for 12 months, and I should avoid ICS monotherapy in COPD [^1119hVwa] [^114v5ExK].

> But wait, what if the patient presents during or just after an acute exacerbation? I should treat the exacerbation acutely with short-acting bronchodilators, consider systemic corticosteroids for about 5 days if indicated, and add antibiotics when bacterial infection is suspected, then transition promptly to long-acting bronchodilator maintenance to reduce recurrence risk [^116SWGkW] [^1139DjP8].

> I need to ensure non-pharmacologic foundations are addressed from the outset. Smoking cessation is the most impactful intervention to slow progression and improve survival, vaccinations including influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 reduce respiratory infections, and structured pulmonary rehabilitation improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and quality of life even in earlier disease, so I should arrange these concurrently with pharmacotherapy [^111gcyKU] [^115JnRGF] [^116sW2mC].

> Let me verify inhaler technique and device selection. Poor technique and adherence are major causes of treatment failure, so I should teach and check technique at every visit, prefer single-inhaler regimens when possible to simplify use, and tailor device choice to the patient's dexterity, cognition, and preference to maximize real-world effectiveness [^115JnRGF] [^116yUJw5].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and what to monitor. Routine visits should track symptoms with CAT or mMRC, exacerbation frequency, smoking status, adherence and inhaler technique, physical activity, and at least annual spirometry to detect rapid decline or alternative diagnoses, and I should adjust therapy based on treatable traits of persistent dyspnea and ongoing exacerbations rather than FEV1 alone [^116ft4Hq] [^114wdfWs] [^1128NkZi].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation and de-escalation principles. If symptoms persist or exacerbations continue despite confirmed adherence and correct technique, I should escalate along the LAMA to LABA+LAMA to LABA+LAMA+ICS pathway when indicated by eosinophils, and conversely, if the patient is stable for 12 months, especially on triple therapy, I should consider stepping down ICS while maintaining dual bronchodilation with close supervision [^116wxaTc] [^1119hVwa].

> I will now examine acute exacerbation management to ensure readiness. Most exacerbations are managed as outpatients with SABA ± SAMA, a short course of systemic corticosteroids if indicated, and antibiotics when purulent sputum or clinical suspicion warrants, while reserving hospitalization for severe symptoms, respiratory failure, or inadequate home support, and I should initiate or optimize long-acting bronchodilators before discharge to reduce recurrence [^1121mfMb] [^1139DjP8] [^111KHUFy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check common pitfalls. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment are widespread, with many patients never receiving spirometry or maintenance therapy at diagnosis, and conversely ICS are frequently overprescribed without indication, so I must anchor decisions to spirometry, symptoms, and exacerbation history, and avoid ICS monotherapy or reflex triple therapy in low-eosinophil, low-risk patients [^115orFE4] [^112tpLmZ] [^114v5ExK].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure coherence. Confirm COPD with post-bronchodilator spirometry, exclude mimics, quantify symptoms and exacerbation risk to assign GOLD A/B/E, start guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy with single bronchodilation for Group A and dual for Groups B and E with ICS reserved for high eosinophil, high-risk phenotypes, implement smoking cessation, vaccinations, and rehabilitation, and schedule structured follow-up every 3–6 months with annual spirometry and therapy adjustments based on treatable traits and patient preferences [^114eRa1Y] [^115JnRGF] [^116ft4Hq].

New-onset COPD is defined by **post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70** [^114bjVtx] with symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic cough, or sputum production, and a history of risk factor exposure (smoking, occupational/environmental pollutants) [^1167xb2g]. Diagnosis must be confirmed by **spirometry** [^114RzSaE], and initial assessment should classify severity using GOLD 1–4, symptoms (CAT or mMRC), and exacerbation history to guide therapy [^115JnRGF]. First-line management is **smoking cessation** [^111gcyKU], vaccinations, and bronchodilator therapy (LAMA or LABA) [^117Q63TS]; add LABA+LAMA for persistent symptoms or exacerbations, and consider triple therapy with ICS only if blood eosinophils are ≥ 300/µL and exacerbations persist [^1128NkZi] [^116yUJw5]. Early intervention improves symptoms, reduces exacerbations, and may slow progression [^113TWLay] [^115aD3ag].

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation

- **Definition**: COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction [^114Zmkou].

- **Diagnostic criteria**: A diagnosis of COPD requires post-bronchodilator spirometry demonstrating FEV1/FVC < 0.70 [^114bjVtx].

- **Clinical presentation**: Common symptoms include chronic dyspnea, cough, sputum production, wheezing, and chest tightness [^114TWoDB]. Symptoms may precede airflow obstruction by years [^116v1E3B].

- **Risk factors**: Smoking is the primary risk factor; other significant exposures include occupational and environmental pollutants, biomass fuel smoke, and genetic factors such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^notfound].

---

## Initial assessment and severity classification

Initial assessment should include:

- **Severity of airflow obstruction**: GOLD grades 1–4 based on post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted [^115JnRGF].

- **Symptom burden**: Assessed using CAT or mMRC dyspnea scale [^115JnRGF].

- **Exacerbation history**: Frequency and severity of previous exacerbations [^1136DXyW].

- **Comorbidities**: Identify and manage coexisting conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, anxiety/depression) [^115JnRGF].

---

## Recommended initial pharmacological management

| **Gold group** | **Symptom burden** | **Exacerbation history** | **Initial pharmacotherapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Low (CAT < 10 or mMRC 0–1) | ≤ 1 moderate exacerbation/year | - LAMA or LABA [^117Q63TS] <br/> - Preferred LAMA if available |
| B | High (CAT ≥ 10 or mMRC ≥ 2) | ≤ 1 moderate exacerbation/year | - LABA + LAMA [^117Q63TS] <br/> - Preferred initial therapy |
| E | Any symptom burden | ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations/year or ≥ 1 hospitalization/year | - LABA + LAMA [^1119hVwa] <br/> - Consider triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) if blood eosinophils ≥ 300/µL |

---

Non-pharmacological interventions include **smoking cessation** — the most effective intervention to slow progression [^1122Przq] — as well as vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19), pulmonary rehabilitation, and patient education on inhaler technique and adherence [^115JnRGF].

---

## Impact of early intervention

Early diagnosis and intervention can **significantly improve patient outcomes** by reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and decreasing exacerbation frequency and severity [^113TWLay]. Early pharmacological treatment may also slow disease progression and reduce healthcare utilization [^115aD3ag].

---

## Potential complications and comorbidities

New-onset COPD is associated with several **complications and comorbidities**, including:

- **Exacerbations**: Acute worsening of symptoms, often triggered by infections or environmental factors [^1151AXqw].

- **Respiratory infections**: Increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections [^notfound].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Common comorbidity, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension [^111KHUFy].

- **Osteoporosis**: Increased risk due to chronic inflammation and corticosteroid use [^notfound].

- **Anxiety and depression**: Common due to chronic disease burden and disability [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring strategies

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression, assess treatment effectiveness, and adjust therapy. Recommended follow-up includes:

- **Symptom assessment**: Regular use of CAT or mMRC [^115JnRGF].

- **Exacerbation monitoring**: Track frequency and severity [^116ft4Hq].

- **Spirometry**: Annual or as clinically indicated [^115JnRGF].

- **Inhaler technique**: Regular assessment and education [^115JnRGF].

- **Smoking cessation support**: Ongoing counseling and pharmacotherapy [^notfound].

---

New-onset COPD is defined by **persistent airflow obstruction** with chronic respiratory symptoms and exposure to risk factors. Early diagnosis with spirometry [^114bjVtx] and guideline-based management — including smoking cessation, vaccinations, and appropriate pharmacotherapy — are essential to reduce symptoms, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life [^113TWLay].

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

The last 50 years have witnessed major progress in our understanding of the underlying nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and approaches to care. During the last 10 years, however, there has been an explosive expansion of knowledge related to this disorder. Large-scale epidemiologic studies show that COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and will be the fifth leading health burden worldwide by the year 2020. We have also learned that COPD is an inflammatory disorder of small airways, which presents new opportunities for therapy involving interfering with the early components of the inflammatory cascade. Unfortunately, most clinicians fail to perform spirometric screening of at-risk individuals, so most patients first present with COPD during a sudden exacerbation of the disease. Worldwide interest is emerging in promoting earlier diagnosis and finding new pharmacologic interventions to halt the progression of airway and parenchymal damage. In this review, evidence is presented that we are on the upward limb of an exponential curve of progress in managing COPD, which will produce major advances in our ability to recognize and treat this disorder in its earliest stages.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (US). COPD is often characterized by periods of intensified disease activity, known as exacerbations. Exacerbations are characterized by a worsening of respiratory symptoms, such as cough, phlegm production, and dyspnea, which normally last for more than 1 or 2 days. As COPD exacerbations are associated with a worsening of the disease, they are often linked with increased morbidity, mortality, and high healthcare costs.

Previous studies, including the ECLIPSE study and a more recent retrospective study from Germany, have concluded that most patients with COPD are not frequent exacerbators in the first years after diagnosis. COPD treatment strategies are tailored based on the severity of symptoms and the frequency and risk of exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations have generally been treated with oral systemic corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics, while severe exacerbations require hospitalization.

Maintenance therapy may aid in preventing exacerbations. In 2011, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report recommended the treatment of patients with COPD using a short-acting bronchodilator, long-acting bronchodilator, or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting bronchodilator, based on severity of the disease. In the 2024 GOLD report, recommendations for maintenance therapy advocated the use of single or dual long-acting bronchodilator combination (long-acting beta-agonist [LABA] + long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA]). Patients with at least two moderate exacerbations or at least one exacerbation per year leading to hospitalization were recommended to be treated with LABA + LAMA, with a consideration to use triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) for those with elevated blood eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/μL) plus a history of moderate/severe exacerbations in the year prior. The use of LABA + ICS for COPD is not recommended in the 2023 guidelines; instead, triple therapy should be considered where indicated.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116SWGkW]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Management of exacerbations — pharmacologic treatment: The goals for treatment of COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events; short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an exacerbation, and maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible, with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to the double bronchodilator regimen considered in patients with frequent exacerbations and elevated blood eosinophil levels; in patients with severe exacerbations, systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time including hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days; antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should be 5 days; methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^117DMbKt]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Exacerbations are important events in COPD. Management of the acute event remains dependent on inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids and antibiotics, with or without oxygen and ventilatory support. Comorbidities should be addressed. Given the importance of these events, effective care should also include deployment of strategies, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, to reduce future exacerbations. Although new approaches are in development, a major current challenge is to understand which strategies to use in which patients at which stage of their disease. COPD exacerbations are heterogeneous events occurring in a heterogeneous disease and there is no 'one size fits all' approach to COPD exacerbation management and prevention.

### Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the primary care setting: how can we achieve more for our patients? [^116i7scy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a debilitating and progressive disease that is both underdiagnosed and undertreated, affecting up to 1 in 10 older adults. Common symptoms, including dyspnea, productive cough, chest tightness, and fatigue, can reduce quality of life, the ability to participate in all types of activities, and overall health status in patients. Minimizing the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life should be a key goal for physicians, and modest changes in current practice could make improvements in patients' lives. Here we review chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, its impact on patients, and how to improve symptom management.

### Treatment patterns in patients with newly diagnosed COPD in the USA [^112tpLmZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prompt and effective management with maintenance therapy (single or dual bronchodilator therapy) is recommended after the initial diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to maintain lung function and prevent exacerbations. Contrary to guideline-based recommendations, most patients are not prescribed maintenance treatment at initial diagnosis. The current study assessed the pharmacologic treatment patterns and outcomes of newly diagnosed patients with COPD in the USA.

Methods

This retrospective, noninterventional study used de-identified data from the Inovalon Insights' database (Commercial, Medicaid Managed Care, and Medicare Advantage-insured individuals) between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2021. The "patient journey" from initial diagnosis was followed over a 4-year period. The primary outcome measure was the number of moderate or severe exacerbations. Secondary outcome measures included the cumulative incidence of exacerbations, mean cumulative count of moderate and severe exacerbations, rates of moderate and severe exacerbations in patients who remained untreated after diagnosis in 12-month time periods for 4 years, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and pharmacologic treatment patterns.

Results

The cohort consisted of 238,158 newly diagnosed patients with COPD (female [52.9%]; mean age 63.8 years). The majority of patients with COPD had Medicaid as their primary insurance (46.2%). Overall, during the 4-year follow-up period, 32.9% of the patients had at least one moderate or severe exacerbation, and 25.8% and 13.8% experienced moderate and severe exacerbations, respectively. At diagnosis, 86.2% of the patients were untreated and most remained untreated by the end of the follow-up (63.8%). Most patients (62.0%) received long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as their initial treatment at diagnosis, and LABA/ICS continued to be the most common initial treatment during the 4-year period (64.0% at year 1; 58.0% at year 4).

Conclusions

Most patients with COPD were not treated at initial diagnosis and remained untreated during follow-up. Our data highlight a lack of adherence to recommendations for clinical practice.

### An update on pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114fkwqh]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease process with important clinical and economic implications. This review will summarize new pharmacotherapy for the treatment of COPD.

Recent Findings

Several recent clinical trials have led to the approval of new inhaler therapies for COPD. Many of these are specifically targeting combination long-acting β-agonists and long-acting muscarinic antagonists for late stage COPD.

Summary

Several new bronchodilators are available on the market, especially in combination form. The new drug combinations have positive data though clinical relevance, and comparisons to available and well established therapies are still needed. Specifically, translating improved forced expiratory volume into meaningful clinical outcomes remains challenging.

Exacerbation diagnosis and treatment

Exacerbations of COPD remain a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and it is necessary to consider (and, where appropriate, rule out) other causes of increased breathlessness in patients with COPD presenting with symptom deteriorations. Conditions mimicking exacerbations include pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus and cardiac failure. Diagnosis of exacerbation therefore requires appropriate clinical assessment and may need further investigation with, for example, chest radiography.

The principles of exacerbation therapy have not changed greatly since the widespread introduction in the 1990s of non-invasive ventilation in preference to doxapram for the treatment of hypercapnoea at exacerbation of COPD. Therapies at exacerbation may be divided into those thought to have a disease-modifying effect, and those aiming to support respiratory function until disease-modifying therapies have had sufficient time to act.

Exacerbation therapy is administered stepwise according to the clinical severity of presentation, and a general scheme is presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that disentangling the concept of exacerbation severity from the severity of the underlying COPD is almost impossible: a patient needing intubation and ventilation at exacerbation may have milder disease with a greater acute deterioration, or more severe underlying disease and a trivial insult.

Figure 1
General scheme for management of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Therapy is added stepwise according to the severity of the presentation. Mild exacerbations may respond to an increase in the dose and/or frequency of inhaled bronchodilators alone. Exacerbations not responding to this require systemic corticosteroids, with the addition of antibiotics if there has been a change in the character of expectorated sputum. Additional interventions such as theophylline may be required where the clinical response is still incomplete. Oxygen and/or ventilatory support may be necessary at any stage in the presence of new or established respiratory failure. Exacerbation management should also include an assessment and management of comorbidities, and the opportunity should be taken to optimise long-term therapies to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112CENvL]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are important events in the natural history of this prevalent and devastating condition. This review provides a concise, state of the art summary on prevention and management of exacerbations. Considerable new data underpins evidence in support of many preventative interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, that are now available. Challenges remain in developing new approaches, and delivering those that already exist to the right patient at the right time. Management of an exacerbation remains stepwise according to clinical severity, but there is now additional focus on addressing comorbidities and taking the opportunity at acute events to optimise preventative strategies for the future. Ultimately, exacerbations are heterogeneous events in a heterogeneous disease, and an individualised approach is paramount.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1139DjP8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation management — key points (Figure 4.6) state that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation (Evidence C). Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should not normally be more than 5 days (Evidence A). Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration, and duration of therapy should normally be 5 days (Evidence B). Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles (Evidence B). Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival (Evidence A).

Initial assessment — Once the diagnosis of COPD has been confirmed by spirometry, assessment to guide therapy must focus on determining five fundamental aspects: severity of airflow obstruction, nature and magnitude of current symptoms, previous history of moderate and severe exacerbations, blood eosinophil count, and presence and type of other diseases (multimorbidity).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Young COPD operational definition and features: "Given that lung function peaks at around 20–25 years, we propose to operationally consider "young COPD" in patients aged 20–50 years". Young COPD may have substantial health impact and "is frequently not diagnosed and thus not treated", and "a family history of respiratory diseases and/or early-life events (including hospitalizations before the age of 5 years) is reported by a significant proportion of young patients with COPD".

Algorithms for initial pharmacological management of COPD — A proposal for the INITIATION of pharmacological management of COPD according to the individualized assessment of symptoms and exacerbation risk following the ABE scheme, and also accounting for blood eosinophil count, is presented as clinical guidance, and there is no high-quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials to support initial pharmacological treatment strategies in newly diagnosed COPD patients. For Group A, all Group A patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment based on its effect on breathlessness; this can be either a short- or a long-acting bronchodilator, and if available and affordable a long-acting bronchodilator is the preferred choice except in patients with very occasional breathlessness; this should be continued if benefit is documented. For Group B, treatment should be initiated with a LABA+LAMA combination; in a randomized controlled trial in patients with ≤ 1 moderate exacerbation in the year before the study and a CAT™ ≥ 10 LABA+LAMA is superior to a LAMA with regard to several endpoints; therefore, providing there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects LABA+LAMA is the recommended initial pharmacological choice; if a LABA+LAMA combination is not considered appropriate, there is no evidence to recommend one class of long-acting bronchodilators over another (LABA or LAMA) for initial relief of symptoms in this group, and in the individual patient, the choice should depend on the patient's perception of symptom relief.

The traditional physiological definition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is of practical use in encompassing the overlapping syndromes of COPD in routine clinical practice, and underpins the continued use of spirometry for diagnosis, screening, staging, and monitoring. However, the diagnostic criteria for COPD have not evolved in step with advances in understanding of pathogenesis, and this approach of including all the components of COPD under one umbrella is under question. The characterization of phenotypic variation is currently recognized to hold the key to better understanding of COPD pathogenesis and the identification of effective novel therapies. COPD demonstrates considerable heterogeneity, and, consequently, patient characterization requires a varied approach and the use of multiple modalities. This review discusses the methodologies that are currently used for patient phenotyping and the approaches that have been advocated for the identification of clinically meaningful phenotypes.

### Characterisation and prognosis of undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients at their first hospitalisation [^111AGRc5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a major public health problem, and its mortality and disability burden is expected to rise in the coming decades. Nonetheless, the majority of studies from general population and primary care have detected that a high proportion of individuals fulfilling COPD diagnosis criteria remain undiagnosed. Interestingly, it has been reported that a high proportion of undiagnosed patients already suffer from respiratory symptoms. A recent population-based study demonstrated that even newly diagnosed COPD patients with mild airflow limitation exhibit a significant impairment in their health-related quality of life and certain activities of daily living, when compared with individuals without COPD. Therefore, both researchers and practitioners advocate for early detection strategies aimed at reducing COPD burden through proven health-care interventions.

There is a lack of specific information regarding COPD under-diagnosis in patients requiring hospitalisation because of an exacerbation of the disease. Two previous studies in a hospital setting highlighted that one-third of patients had never been diagnosed or treated. One of these studies involved patients who went to the emergency room for COPD exacerbation, and the second study was a small retrospective study of patients admitted to the hospital for the first time for a COPD exacerbation. The current study describes the characteristics of COPD patients who were undiagnosed at the time of their first hospital admission because of a COPD exacerbation and their short- and long-term outcomes.

### Current concepts in targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pharmacotherapy: making progress towards personalised management [^1177njLN]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disorder that is responsible for substantial and growing morbidity, mortality, and health-care expense worldwide. Of imperative importance to decipher the complexity of COPD is to identify groups of patients with similar clinical characteristics, prognosis, or therapeutic needs, the so-called clinical phenotypes. This strategy is logical for research but might be of little clinical value because clinical phenotypes can overlap in the same patient and the same clinical phenotype could result from different biological mechanisms. With the goal to match assessment with treatment choices, the latest iteration of guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease reorganised treatment objectives into two categories: to improve symptoms (ie, dyspnoea and health status) and to decrease future risk (as predicted by forced expiratory volume in 1 s level and exacerbations history). This change thus moves treatment closer to individualised medicine with available bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet, future treatment options are likely to include targeting endotypes that represent subtypes of patients defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Specific biomarkers of these endotypes would be particularly useful in clinical practice, especially in patients in which clinical phenotype alone is insufficient to identify the underlying endotype. A few series of potential COPD endotypes and biomarkers have been suggested. Empirical knowledge will be gained from proof-of-concept trials in COPD with emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways. In every instance, specific endotype and biomarker efforts will probably be needed for the success of these trials, because the pathways are likely to be operative in only a subset of patients. Network analysis of human diseases offers the possibility to improve understanding of disease pathobiological complexity and to help with the development of new treatment alternatives and, importantly, a reclassification of complex diseases. All these developments should pave the way towards personalised treatment of patients with COPD in the clinic.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

### Identifying acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using patient-reported symptoms and cough feature analysis [^115shvTT]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory condition worldwide and is increasing in prevalence. It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms due to airflow and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. Patients with COPD are susceptible to acute worsening of their symptoms with additional therapy requirements — an episode known as an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD).

COPD represents a major cause of health care utilization and expense, and healthcare costs rise with each instance of AECOPD a patient experiences. Within the primary care setting in the UK, the average total annual per-patient cost of COPD management, excluding medications, was £3396 for patients experiencing two or more moderate/severe exacerbations annually, the majority of this cost being attributable to the cost of primary care consultations. Similarly, a large study in the US, demonstrated a significant increase in all costs for patients with two or more exacerbations compared with the overall population of COPD patients, predominantly due to an increase in hospitalization. The early identification and prevention of AECOPD such that patients no longer require hospitalization represent a critical juncture in developing a cost-effective disease management strategy.

Rapid identification of AECOPD is imperative to ensure the timely initiation of appropriate and suitable treatment. It has been shown that early initiation of therapy for AECOPD reduces both exacerbation duration and the likelihood of hospitalization with an event. Delays in identifying AECOPD and thus delayed presentation to a hospital (≥ 24 h after symptom onset) result in a more than twofold increase in the odds of hospital admission. An incorrect diagnosis can also result in inappropriate treatment with a deterioration of symptoms before the alternative diagnosis is confirmed.

Current primary-care COPD action plans allow patients to self-manage and initiate therapy for exacerbations without initial medical input. This strategy depends on the patient being able to identify worsening symptoms correctly and for the symptoms to not be attributed to any co-morbidities such as asthma. A formal diagnosis of AECOPD typically requires radiology and may also require lung function tests and clinical assessment, although there are concomitant issues including inequity of access and cost. Alongside the momentum for patient-led care, is the increasing impetus toward incorporating remote-treatment technologies into primary care. This has been spurred on mainly by the reluctance of vulnerable patient populations, including those with pre-existing COPD, to present to healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Treatment setting for COPD exacerbations — the goals of treatment are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

Clinical presentation of COPD symptoms — Chronic dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of COPD. Cough with sputum production is present in up to 30% of patients. These symptoms may vary from day-to-day and may precede the development of airflow obstruction by many years. Individuals, particularly those with COPD risk factors, presenting with these symptoms should be examined to search for the underlying cause(s). Airflow obstruction may also be present without chronic dyspnea and/or cough and sputum production and vice versa.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological management uses a separate follow-up algorithm based on two key treatable traits — persistence of dyspnea and occurrence of exacerbations — and is designed to facilitate management of patients taking maintenance treatment(s), whether early after initial treatment or after years of follow-up; these recommendations incorporate evidence from clinical trials and the use of peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for exacerbation prevention.

### Meeting the GOLD standard: COPD treatment in the UK today [^115PRXn3]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its first report almost 20 years ago, the Global initiative in chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has had a major effect on COPD management. The GOLD system of classifying COPD has been widely adopted both clinically and academically while the regularly updated treatment recommendations has led to their promotion ahead of more formal evidence-based documents like The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Initially GOLD classified COPD severity by the degree of FEV 1 impairment, but now a more sophisticated (and complex) approach stratifies by symptom intensity (commonly using a cut-point of 2 on the modified MRC dyspnoea scale) and on a history of exacerbations. The resultant 4 × 4 classification of clinical phenotypes from minimal symptoms without exacerbations to severe symptoms and frequent/significant exacerbations is graded A-D and has been linked to both initial and subsequent treatment choices.

Management of exacerbations — ventilatory support and recovery course: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival; exacerbation recovery time varies, taking up to 4–6 weeks to recover, with some patients failing to return to the pre-exacerbation functional state, and following an exacerbation appropriate measures for exacerbation prevention should be initiated.

Conclusions

There is little direct evidence about management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that COPD medications should be changed during this COVID-19 pandemic.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

### Clinical assessment, staging, and epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^112G6F4Q]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are initially assessed to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been made and that relevant differential diagnoses are excluded. Although guidelines provide indicators for use, very little systematic research has been done in initial assessment of COPD exacerbations. Next, the assessment should aim at stratifying patients for risk of poor outcome. For this, predictors of poor prognosis as well as knowledge of favorable treatments can be used. However, no formal and validated staging system exists today. Given the frequency and impact of COPD exacerbations, there seems to be a need for systematic research in this area.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^111szwkx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global health problem, and since 2001, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has published its strategy document for the diagnosis and management of COPD. This executive summary presents the main contents of the second 5-year revision of the GOLD document that has implemented some of the vast knowledge about COPD accumulated over the last years. Today, GOLD recommends that spirometry is required for the clinical diagnosis of COPD to avoid misdiagnosis and to ensure proper evaluation of severity of airflow limitation. The document highlights that the assessment of the patient with COPD should always include assessment of (1) symptoms, (2) severity of airflow limitation, (3) history of exacerbations, and (4) comorbidities. The first three points can be used to evaluate level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations, and this is done in a way that splits patients with COPD into four categories-A, B, C, and D. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of COPD match this assessment in an evidence-based attempt to relieve symptoms and reduce risk of exacerbations. Identification and treatment of comorbidities must have high priority, and a separate section in the document addresses management of comorbidities as well as COPD in the presence of comorbidities. The revised document also contains a new section on exacerbations of COPD. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of all relevant shareholders and will hopefully inspire future national and local guidelines on the management of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up triage should help decide: i) whether to offer an in-person as opposed to a remote (telephone or virtual/online) consultation, and ii) who to prioritize. Remote follow-up could be considered when the patient or caregiver can understand the process and provide information clearly, when this is a regular COPD follow-up or the patient is followed for a known condition, when medical records and laboratory test results are accessible to the healthcare professionals, and when prescription and access to medication is possible and follow-up to the prescription can be arranged if necessary. In-person follow-up should be prioritized when the patient and caregiver have difficulty providing information, when the patient needs immediate attention due to the presence of severe medical symptoms, when changes in the patient's symptoms require a differential diagnosis work-up with the need for a physical exam and/or laboratory testing, or when patient treatment can only be given in person and cannot be given at home. Prioritization of in-person visits should take into consideration the COPD patient disease severity (symptom burden and risk of exacerbations), recent emergency department visit and/or hospital admission, associated significant comorbidities, age, and/or living alone at home.

### Characterizing undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137PcFa]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and associated with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Patients with COPD generally seek medical attention when they experience respiratory symptoms, most notably dyspnea that is persistent and progressive. However, owing to under-utilization of lung function measurements and non-specific nature of the symptoms, COPD is often not recognized until late in the disease process. Indeed, many patients do not receive a diagnosis of COPD until after being hospitalized due to a severe exacerbation.

Lamprecht et al. reported an average underdiagnosis rate of 81% in a prevalence study that included 30,874 participants across 44 countries. Reducing risk factors such as smoking and occupational risk factors while the disease is early in its progression is an important component of treatment for COPD. As such, late diagnosis of COPD represents a missed opportunity to modify the course of the disease through evidence-informed risk factor management and treatment. The extent of this missed opportunity is a function of the number of COPD patients who are undiagnosed, and the burden of disease (e.g. symptom burden, lung function status) in this population.

Quantifying the true burden of undiagnosed COPD and the benefit of screening and case detection can be informed by a comparative assessment of patient- and disease-factors between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients. Numerous studies have compared the characteristics of patients with undiagnosed and diagnosed COPD, but to the best of our knowledge, these studies have never been systematically compiled and pooled. We hypothesized that the characteristics of patients, their risk factors, respiratory symptoms, and disease stage influence the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113TWLay]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^1151AXqw]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: diagnosis and management [^116sW2mC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects nearly 6% of Americans. Routine screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults is not recommended. Patients with suspected COPD should have the diagnosis confirmed with spirometry. Disease severity is based on spirometry results and symptoms. The goals of treatment are to improve quality of life, reduce exacerbations, and decrease mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves lung function and increases patients' sense of control, and it is effective for improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations in patients with severe disease. Initial pharmaceutical treatment is based on disease severity. For mild symptoms, initial treatment with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist is recommended. If symptoms are uncontrolled with monotherapy, dual therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta2 agonist combination should be initiated. Triple therapy with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta2 agonist/inhaled corticosteroid combination improves symptoms and lung function more than dual therapy but increases pneumonia risk. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and prophylactic antibiotics can improve outcomes in some patients. Mucolytics, antitussives, and methylxanthines do not improve symptoms or outcomes. Long-term oxygen therapy improves mortality in patients with severe resting hypoxemia or with moderate resting hypoxemia and signs of tissue hypoxia. Lung volume reduction surgery reduces symptoms and improves survival in patients with severe COPD, whereas a lung transplant improves quality of life but does not improve long-term survival.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115fx3bF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Initial Treatment of Patients with Features of Both Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity. It includes several clinical phenotypes that are likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD, with treatment with long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without ICS) recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma because of the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, all patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence and advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

Rationale

The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, more rapid decline in lung function, greater need for healthcare use, and higher mortality than patients with asthma or COPD alone. The recommendation for ICS is because several studies have shown that patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA compared with ICS–LABA.

### Considerations for the correct diagnosis of COPD and its management with bronchodilators [^115qBp6C]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

COPD is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated in many patients. COPD is a distinct disease from adult-onset asthma; however, some patients with COPD may present with several forms of airway disease described as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) both have a place in standard maintenance treatment of COPD and asthma; however, recommendations for use differ widely. In patients with COPD, long-acting bronchodilators are effective initial monotherapy treatment, whereas ICS monotherapy is recommended as initial treatment in patients with asthma. Clinicians need to be confident in their diagnosis to ensure that correct treatment is given because misguided treatment decisions can result in significantly increased safety risks for patients. This review highlights the differences in diagnosis and treatment between COPD, asthma, and ACO and discusses the data supporting guideline recommendations for use of bronchodilators in COPD treatment in contrast to asthma or ACO.

### An update on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2017 guidelines with a focus on classification and management of stable COPD [^113ec6q6]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines offer important changes to the assessment and management of stable COPD of importance to practitioners, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, and nurses who care for patients with COPD. Therapies are now chosen based on the burden of symptoms and the history of COPD exacerbations, and inhaler regimens are modifiable based on continual clinical reassessment. Although identifying the degree of airway obstruction remains important for informing the clinical status of the patient with COPD, FEV 1 is no longer used to direct the therapeutic approach. Therapies and modes of inhaled medication delivery for each GOLD grouping have been modified and reflect the need for reevaluation of patient symptoms and COPD exacerbation history as an indicator to add or withdraw therapies. As the knowledge of this important disease continues to expand, exacerbation and symptom prevention in patients with stable COPD will remain as an important target of COPD therapies and research. Novel drug combinations and delivery devices are sure to positively affect the practitioner's approach to patients with stable COPD. The new 2017 GOLD guidelines represent a step toward personalized care of the patient with COPD.

### Clinical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: review of therapeutic interventions [^116UpyQX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function. Based on clinical evidence, the management of COPD should focus on (1) earlier diagnosis; (2) risk reduction through smoking cessation, decreased exposure to inhaled irritants, and immunization against respiratory pathogens; (3) symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy and pulmonary rehabilitation; (4) decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations and improving pulmonary function; and (5) improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and to reduce mortality — including deaths due to lung cancer, other respiratory disease (including COPD), and cardiovascular disease. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines advocate interventions according to the severity of COPD and recommend initiation of maintenance long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with moderate disease. However, recent evidence from a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials of tiotropium suggests that initiation of long-acting bronchodilator therapy at earlier stages of disease may also provide improvements in lung function and HRQOL. The results of ongoing long-term studies may soon provide evidence that in addition to relieving symptoms and improving patient HRQOL, specific pharmacologic therapies may also alter the clinical course of COPD.

### Preventing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: what is known and what needs to be done to make a difference to the patient? [^1122Przq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up pharmacological treatment (Figure 3.9) presents suggested escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy and safety data and can be applied to any patient already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and when treatment modification, in particular de-escalation, is considered, patients should be under close medical supervision. The report notes that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested and that trials of de-escalation are limited and only include ICS. If response to initial treatment is appropriate, maintain it; if not, check adherence, inhaler technique and possible interfering comorbidities, evaluate whether dyspnea/activity limitation or prevention of exacerbations is the predominant treatable trait, use the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted, then select the corresponding algorithm and identify the box matching the current treatment to follow the suggested algorithm.

Clinical presentation and initial assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include suspicion when patients report cough, sputum production, dyspnea, or recurrent lower respiratory infections, exposure to cigarette smoke or environmental/occupational pollutants, or an acute exacerbation; history should assess evidence that COPD is present versus alternatives, comorbidities, ability to perform activities of daily living, other effects of the condition, and social support; on examination, a normal exam is common in mild COPD with signs emerging as disease progresses, and detection of diminished breath sounds and hyperresonance has a positive likelihood ratio of greater than 5.0, a moderately strong predictor that COPD is present; routinely measured parameters include respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest and with exertion, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), breathlessness using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score [mMRC], and functional capacity, which is best determined by an exercise test such as timed walking distances or walking speed; exercise tests have been shown to predict mortality particularly well in patients with COPD.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations (short-acting bronchodilators), GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to administer inhaled short-acting β-agonists, with or without SAMAs, as the initial bronchodilators for the treatment of acute exacerbations.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1112fPxo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Treatment patterns in patients with newly diagnosed COPD in the USA [^115orFE4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous real-world evidence analyses conducted in 2012, 2014, and 2023 have shown that 59–71% of patients are not prescribed maintenance pharmacological therapy (long-acting agents) at initial diagnosis, and ICS is often overprescribed, in contrast to current guideline-based recommendations. Prompt and effective management with single or dual bronchodilation is recommended after the initial diagnosis of COPD to optimize lung function and prevent exacerbations.

In the US, patients presenting with COPD are typically initially evaluated by primary care physicians and only a subset of patients is referred to specialist care. Generally, most patients with COPD receive care from a primary care provider, and lack of awareness of guidelines may lead to a delay between COPD diagnosis in the primary care setting and progression/referral to secondary care. Although GOLD advocates that spirometry should be undertaken to establish the diagnosis of COPD, only 30–37% of patients are diagnosed with spirometry, with most cases being diagnosed clinically.

The potential impact of delaying optimal treatment on exacerbations and care utilization remains unclear. Here, we report the results of a retrospective inception cohort study in which the frequency of COPD exacerbations was determined in newly diagnosed patients throughout their patient journey in the 4 years after diagnosis. We also report exacerbation outcomes for patients who did not receive guideline-based therapy after the initial diagnosis and the treatment patterns of pharmacological interventions in the 4 years of follow-up.

### COPD advanced patient management [^113tFEss]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, with current rates of both morbidity and mortality persisting and contributing significantly to long-term disability. More than 11 million Americans are diagnosed with COPD, with an additional 13 million people estimated to be living with undiagnosed disease. For patients diagnosed with COPD, the turning point will be hospitalization. It is important, therefore, that new treatment techniques that manage the signs and symptoms of the COPD and impact the prevalence and severity of exacerbations, hospital admissions, quality of life, and activities of daily living, and innovative clinical management strategies that optimize hospital discharge planning, all show promise in improving outcomes for patients with COPD. In particular, readmissions following COPD hospitalization are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs of care, and therefore hospital readmissions are receiving close scrutiny as an opportunity to improve patient care. To this end, programs to assess the presence and severity of dyspnea, and secretion burden and clearance, through implementation of a telemedicine program, use of noninvasive ventilation or supplemental oxygen, and development of a comprehensive self-management program have all been found to be variously effective as elements of a posthospitalization treatment plan. In this series of multi-media presentations and roundtable discussions published in CHEST (available at http://journal.cme.chestnet.org/copd-advanced-patient), leading international faculties discuss some of these specific interventions in detail to provide clinicians with possible solutions to the challenges of managing their patients with advanced COPD.

### Impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations on patients and payers [^115LQ9cp]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not only an established major cause of mortality and morbidity but is increasing in worldwide prevalence despite current medical interventions. The natural history of COPD is punctuated by periods of acute symptomatic, physiologic, and functional deterioration or exacerbations. These events are responsible for considerable additional morbidity and mortality and impact on patients' long-term health status. Despite advances in understanding disease mechanisms and in treatment, exacerbations continue to be the major cause of COPD-associated hospitalization, and provision for their management incurs considerable health care costs. Although pharmacologic therapies may improve clinical outcomes, these benefits must be optimized by prompt diagnosis and delivery. This will require improved understanding of this complex disease by physicians and patients alike.

New opportunities — COPD is a common, preventable, and treatable disease, but extensive under‑diagnosis and misdiagnosis leads to patients receiving no treatment or incorrect treatment, so appropriate and earlier diagnosis can have a very significant public‑health impact; recognition that environmental factors beyond tobacco smoking contribute, that COPD can start early in life and affect young individuals, and that precursor conditions (Pre‑COPD, PRISm) exist opens opportunities for prevention, early diagnosis, and prompt and appropriate therapeutic intervention.

### Strategies to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can they impact disease progression? [^115aD3ag]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preventing disease progression is a key element of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management. COPD exacerbations are adverse events that can result in a decline of lung function that can persevere. Therefore, reducing exacerbation frequency has the potential to affect disease progression and improve health status of COPD patients. This narrative review explores monitoring for disease progression in COPD and its potential association with COPD exacerbations.

Recent Findings

Pharmacotherapy can slow down disease progression, but the effect is mediated only in part by reducing exacerbations. While disease progression is continuous, patients with established airflow obstruction in early stages appear more vulnerable to faster declines in lung function. Longitudinal monitoring of lung function and structure is necessary to identify patients with disease progression.

Summary

Pharmacotherapy is an effective option for preventing disease progression. A holistic approach including longitudinal pulmonary function testing, clinical symptoms and imaging may be necessary to detect disease progression for early intervention.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QXf45]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116aRVSb]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states that the GOLD Report provides a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with COPD, with treatment objectives organized into two groups that relieve and reduce the impact of symptoms and reduce the risk of adverse health events in the future. The original FEV1-based staging system is described, but at an individual level FEV1 alone is an unreliable marker of the severity of breathlessness, exercise limitation, health status impairment, and risk of exacerbation. The report highlights that there are simple and reliable questionnaires designed for routine clinical practice, enabling an assessment system that draws together the impact of symptoms and the patient's risk of a serious adverse health event and can be used in any clinical setting anywhere in the world to move COPD treatment toward individualized medicine.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1119hVwa]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group E — initial pharmacologic therapy favors dual bronchodilation, as LABA+LAMA is the preferred choice for initial therapy in group E patients provided there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects. Use of LABA+ICS in COPD is not encouraged; if there is an indication for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice. Consider LABA+LAMA+ICS in group E if eos ≥ 300 cells/μL (practical recommendation); although there are no direct data on initiating triple therapy in newly diagnosed patients, available studies performed mostly in treated patients provide a rationale for considering this option for patients with a high eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL).

### Asthma-COPD overlap and chronic airflow obstruction: definitions, management, and unanswered questions [^114YbnTi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a common clinical presentation of chronic airways disease in which patients show some features usually associated with asthma, and some usually associated with COPD. There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a "treatable traits" approach to ACO management. Throughout the review, we highlight some of the pressing, unanswered questions surrounding ACO that are relevant to the clinical community. Ultimately, addressing these questions is necessary if we are to improve clinical outcomes for this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^116yybYv]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:

- **Definition**: COPD is a chronic lung disease characterized by non-reversible airflow obstruction and persistent symptoms of dyspnea and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: COPD is caused by airway inflammation and remodeling due to environmental exposures, primarily tobacco smoke. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway, alveoli, and pulmonary microvasculature causes destruction of lung parenchyma, and loss of elastic recoil in the lung tissue.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of the COPD is estimated at approximately 12,000 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: These pathologic changes lead to manifestations of irreversible airflow obstruction, as well as a progressive decline in lung function, which can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality rate of patients with COPD is estimated at 2.7 (95% CI, 2.5–3.0) in men and 4.8 (95% CI, 4.2–5.4) in women, respectively.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116yUJw5]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment of stable COPD — initial pharmacotherapy by GOLD group is defined as follows: Group A with 0 or 1 moderate exacerbations (not leading to hospital admission) and mMRC 0–1, CAT < 10 is treated with A bronchodilator. Group B with 0 or 1 moderate exacerbations (not leading to hospital admission) and mMRC ≥ 2, CAT ≥ 10 is treated with LABA + LAMA*. Group E with ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations or ≥ 1 leading to hospitalization is treated with LABA + LAMA*, and consider LABA+LAMA+ICS* if blood eos ≥ 300. Initial pharmacotherapy should be based on the patient's GOLD group. Single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers; single inhalers improve adherence to treatment.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: developing comprehensive management [^113VFznA]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

The goals of managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include making the correct diagnosis, avoiding further risk (especially by smoking cessation), controlling symptoms (particularly dyspnea), and treating complications. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can obtain substantial symptom relief from medications, including bronchodilators. Prescription of bronchodilators should be guided by the patient's degree of dyspnea, and response to initial therapy. In patients with severe disease and uncontrolled dyspnea, simultaneous use of multiple classes of bronchodilators provides additional benefit. Controlled investigations have found that patient adherence to prescribed therapies is less than optimal even in the best circumstances. Adherence barriers include factors related to the treatment, to the patient, and to the health care practitioner. Understanding these barriers and addressing patient adherence may improve outcomes. Health care practitioners need to develop an optimal working relationship with each patient and focus on their roles as educators and advocates for the patient's health. A collaborative self-management approach recognizes the patient's role in making his or her own health decisions and the physician's role as an educator and facilitator of the patient's health decisions. When multiple therapies are employed, a comprehensive management plan should be developed to help the patient understand and incorporate all the necessary treatments on an ongoing basis. Disease management programs may be useful in assisting health care practitioners and patients in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^115EH1uW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Controversies in treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111zy4JZ]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disorder with substantial comorbidity and major effects attributable to the high morbidity and mortality rates. Despite an increasing evidence base, some important controversies in COPD management still exist. The classic way to define COPD has been based on spirometric criteria, but more relevant diagnostic methods are needed that can be used to describe COPD severity and comorbidity. Initiation of interventions earlier in the natural history of the disease to slow disease progression is debatable, there are many controversies about the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the management of COPD, and long-term antibiotics for prevention of exacerbation have had a resurgence in interest. Novel therapeutic drugs are urgently needed for optimum management of the acute COPD exacerbation. COPD is a complex disease and consists of several clinically relevant phenotypes that in future will guide its management.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: getting it right. does optimal management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease alter disease progression and improve survival? [^111gcyKU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We live in a world where people live longer lives. The standardized mortality rate for many diseases is decreasing. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not following this trend. Over the last 10 years, interventions for COPD have been developed, but have any changed the prognosis or trajectory of this modern epidemic? We review the most recent and classical literature in order to answer this question.

Recent Findings

Recent analyses of data have clarified which interventions are effective in COPD and which are not. New studies have defined what is achievable with the current therapies. Only two interventions have been demonstrated to improve survival: smoking cessation and long-term oxygen therapy. Other treatments do reduce exacerbations, improve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life, but do not affect physiological disease progression or mortality.

Summary

There is much work to do, not only to improve the treatments we have for this disease, but also to diagnose it early, intervene at the right time, reduce the treatment side-effects and most importantly understand the pathophysiology better. Moreover, we are duty bound to look at each patient and review what we are trying to achieve for each one through appropriate phenotyping as well as sometimes taking a more palliative approach.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with a burden of $50 billion in direct health care costs. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines airflow obstruction as spirometry where the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity after bronchodilation is less than 0.70. The guidelines also provided graded recommendations on current therapy for COPD. Treatment can be guided based on severity of disease and severity of symptoms. We review the GOLD guidelines to provide an overview of treatment modalities aimed at improving lung function, reducing hospitalization, and reducing mortality.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^111KzuaQ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 10% of the population over the age of 40 years, the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has reached epidemic proportions. COPD is defined by the presence of poorly reversible airflow obstruction and an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung to noxious particles or gases. Punctuating the decline in lung function are acute deteriorations in respiratory health, termed exacerbations. As discussed further below, exacerbations are important events in the natural history of COPD. This review provides a critical summary of present exacerbation therapies and aims to update the reader on recent developments in the treatment and prevention of exacerbations in COPD.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^1176u5nN]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to assess the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death) in the initial evaluation to guide therapy.

Initial assessment of COPD — The goals of the initial COPD assessment are to determine the severity of airflow obstruction, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), to guide therapy. Additional clinical assessment, including the measurement of lung volumes, diffusion capacity, exercise testing and/or lung imaging may be considered in COPD patients with persistent symptoms after initial treatment.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Pre-COPD definition and trial need: "This term has been recently proposed to identify individuals (importantly, of any age) who have respiratory symptoms and/or other detectable structural and/or functional abnormalities, in the absence of airflow obstruction on forced spirometry". "These patients may (or not) develop persistent airflow obstruction (i.e. COPD) over time", and "a recent publication highlights the need for RCTs, both in patients with 'Pre-COPD', and in young people with COPD".

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

Combined initial COPD assessment — In 2011, GOLD proposed moving from a simple spirometric grading system to a combined assessment based on the level of symptoms (mMRC or CAT™), the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4), and the frequency of previous exacerbations to guide initial pharmacological treatment, incorporating patient-reported outcomes and highlighting exacerbation prevention. The initial version relied on both the severity of airflow obstruction (GOLD grades 1–4) and the frequency of previous exacerbations to assess exacerbation risk, but the severity of airflow obstruction was subsequently removed considering its lower precision at the individual level to predict outcomes and drive treatment decisions, while complexifying the use of the classification by clinicians. In the 2023 GOLD report, GOLD proposed a further evolution of the ABCD combined assessment tool in which the A and B groups remained unchanged and the C and D groups were merged into a single group termed "E", recognizing the clinical relevance of exacerbations; it was acknowledged that this proposal would have to be validated by appropriate clinical research.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

Follow-up of Patients with COPD Who Developed COVID-19

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology that were consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients, thus the follow up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

Patients who developed mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD. Patients who developed moderate COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during/after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at a high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the underlying conditions before they became severely ill.

There are informative candidate models for the comprehensive management of complex care delivery that are already published and undergoing study in a primary care setting, and these may be adapted for application after COVID-19.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the worry of developing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as well as the effects of the pandemic on the basic functions of society and/or social services pertaining to their health imposes additional stressors to their condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has made routine management and diagnosis of COPD more difficult as a result of reductions in face-to-face consultations, difficulties in performing spirometry, and limitations in traditional pulmonary rehabilitation and home care programs. Patients have also faced shortages of medication.

The dramatic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been accompanied by an enormous number of publications on the virus and its consequences. The statements made in this report (Table 1) use the published Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) approach to data review and should be seen as provisional based on the best assessment of the current evidence, including papers published or available up to the September 11, 2020. As new evidence emerges, this report will be updated at regular intervals, and updates will be posted on the GOLD website.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: GOLD executive summary [^114G6Ah7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.

INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS Inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended as monotherapy in COPD. They do not improve mortality or FEV. 1 and increase the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis and pneumonia. 3, 20, 23 In conjunction with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, ICS triple therapy decreases COPD exacerbation frequency and improves quality of life. 3, 23 A meta-analysis reviewing triple therapy with ICS/LAMA/LABA combinations showed an NNT of 16 to reduce one exacerbation in 12 months and a number needed to harm of 64 for one episode of pneumonia in 12 months compared with LAMA/LABA combinations. 24 Triple therapy reduces exacerbations and improves lung function compared with ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA combinations in patients 40 years and older with symptomatic COPD and no more than one moderate or severe exacerbation in the past year. 24, 25 In patients with COPD who have blood eosinophil counts of 300 cells per μL or more, adding an ICS further reduces exacerbations but also increases the risk of pneumonia. Consider discontinuing the ICS if patients have been stable for 12 months.
20. PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4 INHIBITORS Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors reduce pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Roflumilast, a PDE-4 inhibitor used in the treatment of COPD, reduces moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe to very severe COPD who have frequent exacerbations, especially those with a history of hospitalization for acute exacerbation. 3 A 2020 Cochrane review found that PDE-4 inhibitors modestly improved lung function and reduced symptoms and the likelihood of COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 17 to prevent one exacerbation over 39 weeks compared with placebo. 26 Most studies in the review used PDE-4 inhibitors as monotherapy in patients with symptoms of bronchitis.

Although there are limited data for the use of PDE-4 inhibitors in conjunction with LAMA/LABA and LAMA/LABA/ICS combinations, they are recommended for adjunctive therapy after optimizing inhaled medications. 3, 4, 20. PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS The use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with COPD is not common but can be considered on an individual basis to reduce exacerbations. 3, 4, 20 A Cochrane review showed that prophylactic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic reduced COPD exacerbations with an NNT of 8 to prevent one exacerbation over 50 weeks. 27 Antimicrobial resistance to prophylactic antibiotics has been shown. Several studies reported resistance, but no pooled analysis has been completed to demonstrate the amount of resistance developed. 27, 28 The GOLD guidelines caution that macrolides may cause QTc prolongation and antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis with tetracyclines and fluroquinolones shows no benefit and increased harms.

27 Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent exacerbations who have been optimized on inhaled therapies. MUCOLYTICS AND ANTITUSSIVES Mucolytics may reduce exacerbations by approximately one in three years of treatment. Because there are limited data, it may be difficult to identify which patients may benefit. Anti-tussives are not recommended for long-term management of COPD because there is no evidence of benefit.
3. ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Oral corticosteroids have a high adverse effect profile and are used primarily as an adjunctive treatment for acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or those seen in the emergency department. They are not recommended for routine use in the daily management of COPD. 3, 4, 20 Oral corticosteroids do not reduce symptoms, exacerbations, or hospitalizations but increase adverse effects with an NNH of 6.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 7: management of COPD [^112sWKaG]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

A review of the management of COPD is presented, with particular emphasis on the effect on the approach to management of new information which has become available in the 5 years since the BTS guidelines on COPD were published. A major problem is the effective implementation of what is already known, and allocation of the resources necessary to make this available to all who might benefit.
