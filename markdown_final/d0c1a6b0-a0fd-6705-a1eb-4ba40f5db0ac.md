## Question

When to give bicarbonate pills to ckd patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give bicarbonate pills to patients with chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the clinical question in PICO terms. Then, I should verify the current guideline thresholds for initiating bicarbonate therapy. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence, including randomized trials and meta-analyses, to assess benefits and harms. After that, I need to consider special populations and practical dosing and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, individualized recommendation and highlight uncertainties and alternatives like dietary alkali or non-sodium binders.

> Let me first confirm the PICO framing so I don't jump to conclusions: Population is adults with non-dialysis CKD stages 3–5, Intervention is oral sodium bicarbonate, Comparator is placebo or standard care, and Outcomes include kidney endpoints (eGFR decline, kidney failure), patient-centered outcomes (physical function, quality of life), nutritional markers, and safety (blood pressure, fluid status, GI effects) [^notfound].

> Next, I should review current guideline thresholds. KDIGO 2024 advises considering pharmacologic treatment when serum bicarbonate is less than 18 mmol/L to prevent clinically meaningful acidosis, while monitoring to avoid overshooting the upper limit of normal and to watch for adverse effects on BP, potassium, and fluid status; this is a practice point rather than a graded recommendation due to limited high-certainty evidence [^ff562126] [^4592cc16] [^017c3c75]. KDOQI 2020 suggests maintaining serum bicarbonate around 24–26 mmol/L in CKD 3–5D, acknowledging this is consensus-based rather than high-grade evidence [^871d3d13] [^78fd44ec]. Hold on, I should verify the older KDIGO stance: previously, a 2B recommendation supported alkali for bicarbonate less than 22 mmol/L, but 2024 de-emphasizes routine treatment at higher thresholds due to newer neutral or negative trials [^c59b8670] [^3e8dff37].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence. The BiCARB trial in adults aged 60 and older with CKD G3–G4 and bicarbonate less than 22 mmol/L found no benefit on physical function or eGFR decline, more adverse events, and worse cost-effectiveness versus placebo; importantly, the achieved bicarbonate increase was modest (about 1.7 mmol/L), and the population had high comorbidity burden, which may blunt benefits and amplify harms [^b5a181e5] [^f147001d] [^dbbffbff]. Wait, let me verify the kidney outcomes: the hazard ratio for kidney failure was 0.97 (95% CI 0.64–1.49), indicating no significant effect, aligning with the neutral primary and secondary outcomes [^4d42edf0].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses. A 2024 CJASN meta-analysis restricted to placebo-controlled trials found no significant reduction in kidney failure risk with sodium bicarbonate (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.54–1.22), although some subgroup signals suggested possible improvements in eGFR in younger patients or with certain dosing strategies; overall certainty remains low and heterogeneity is substantial [^c59b8670] [^3e8dff37]. Another 2024 meta-analysis reported improvements in kidney function and nutritional markers but also increases in systolic blood pressure and serum calcium/phosphate, reinforcing the need for careful patient selection and monitoring [^de0aeddd] [^635bc720]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are pooled data with variable quality and potential bias, so I should weigh them cautiously against guideline positions [^c59b8670].

> Let me consider earlier positive trials to avoid overgeneralizing. The de Brito-Ashurst study in advanced CKD with bicarbonate 16–20 mmol/L showed slower creatinine clearance decline and fewer patients progressing to ESRD with bicarbonate over 2 years; however, it was single-center and open-label, limiting internal validity and applicability to modern, older, multimorbid populations [^070b1017] [^f909e57e]. Similarly, smaller RCTs in CKD 3–4 reported improved muscle mass and slower eGFR decline with bicarbonate targeting 24–26 mmol/L, but these studies often lacked rigorous blinding or generalizability, so I should interpret them as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^7ec57351] [^3a9a27a0].

> I need to check special populations and safety signals. Older adults with advanced CKD and low-grade acidosis appear to have more adverse effects and no clear benefit, so routine bicarbonate in this group is discouraged by KDIGO 2024 and the BiCARB findings; sodium load may worsen BP and fluid status, and GI intolerance is common, which can reduce adherence and quality of life [^4d42edf0] [^b5a181e5]. But wait, what if we use non-sodium options? Veverimer, a hydrochloric acid binder, increased bicarbonate and improved patient-reported physical function in subgroup analyses, offering a promising alternative when sodium load is a concern, though larger outcome trials are pending and it is not a substitute for all patients [^bdd29ce6] [^9565e4e0].

> Next, I should review practical dosing and monitoring if bicarbonate is used. Typical starting doses are 1.2–1.8 g orally three times daily, titrated to effect and tolerance, with a reasonable target of 22–26 mmol/L in selected patients while avoiding overshooting above 28 mmol/L; monitor serum bicarbonate every 3–6 months, along with BP, weight/edema, and potassium, and reassess ongoing need regularly [^871d3d13] [^78fd44ec] [^ff562126]. Hold on, I should verify tolerability: enteric-coated or gastro-resistant formulations may reduce GI side effects and improve adherence in those who cannot tolerate standard tablets, which can matter for long-term therapy [^ddb6b4fa].

> I should also consider dietary strategies as first-line or adjuncts. Increasing fruits and vegetables can reduce net acid load and raise serum bicarbonate comparably to pharmacologic alkali in some studies, with added benefits on BP and weight, though effects on hard kidney outcomes are less certain and adherence to produce-heavy diets can be challenging; this is reasonable to try before or alongside bicarbonate, especially in patients with sodium-sensitive comorbidities [^480840d9] [^90e98718] [^422d8ab3]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: most dietary data are small and heterogeneous, so shared decision-making about feasibility and expected gains is essential [^480840d9].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is cautious and individualized. Do not routinely give bicarbonate pills to CKD patients; reserve pharmacologic bicarbonate for those with serum bicarbonate less than 18 mmol/L after confirming persistence and excluding reversible drivers, and consider it case-by-case for 18–22 mmol/L if there are compelling reasons such as symptomatic acidosis, rapid eGFR decline, or protein-energy wasting, while monitoring closely for BP, edema, and GI effects; avoid routine use in older adults with advanced CKD and mild acidosis given BiCARB's neutral or harmful signals [^ff562126] [^4592cc16] [^4d42edf0]. If treatment is pursued, use modest, titratable doses with a treat-to-target approach capped at the normal bicarbonate range, and reassess frequently; if sodium load is problematic, consider veverimer where available or prioritize dietary alkali strategies [^871d3d13] [^bdd29ce6] [^480840d9].

> Finally, I should double-check the bottom line and uncertainties. The balance of contemporary evidence shows no consistent benefit of oral bicarbonate on kidney failure or patient-centered outcomes in modern, older, multimorbid CKD populations, and potential harms from sodium load and pill burden are real; therefore, the default should be to avoid routine bicarbonate and reserve it for clearly indicated scenarios with explicit monitoring plans, while we await larger, high-quality RCTs that test dose, target, and patient selection more precisely [^c59b8670] [^3e8dff37] [^1f2f8964].

Give bicarbonate pills to CKD patients when **serum bicarbonate is < 18 mmol/L** [^ff562126] to prevent clinically significant acidosis and slow CKD progression [^d52a7f9e]. Consider treatment at **18–22 mmol/L** if there is rapid eGFR decline, protein-energy wasting, or bone disease, but monitor closely for sodium load effects [^4d42edf0] [^ab86a891]. Do not treat if **bicarbonate is ≥ 22 mmol/L** or if there is uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, or edema [^4d42edf0] [^ade3836c]. Start with 1.2–1.8 g orally three times daily and titrate to maintain 22–26 mmol/L, monitoring bicarbonate, potassium, and blood pressure at regular intervals [^871d3d13] [^78fd44ec].

## Indications for bicarbonate supplementation in CKD

Current guidelines recommend initiating bicarbonate therapy in CKD patients based on **serum bicarbonate levels and clinical context**:

| **Serum bicarbonate level** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| < 18 mmol/L | Strongly recommended | Prevent clinically significant acidosis and slow CKD progression [^ff562126] [^d52a7f9e] |
| 18–22 mmol/L | Consider if rapid eGFR decline, protein-energy wasting, or bone disease | Potential benefit on kidney function and complications [^4d42edf0] [^7ec57351] |
| ≥ 22 mmol/L | Not recommended | No proven benefit; risk of sodium load and adverse effects [^4d42edf0] [^ab86a891] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting bicarbonate supplementation

Several studies and meta-analyses have evaluated the **impact of bicarbonate supplementation** on CKD outcomes:

- **Slowed CKD progression**: Bicarbonate therapy slows eGFR decline and reduces the risk of ESRD in patients with metabolic acidosis [^070b1017] [^d52a7f9e].
- **Improved nutritional status**: Bicarbonate supplementation improves serum albumin and mid-arm muscle circumference, indicating better nutrition [^d774f9aa] [^635bc720].
- **Mixed results in older adults**: The BiCARB trial in patients ≥ 60 years with CKD G3–G4 and bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L showed no benefit on physical function or quality of life and more adverse events, suggesting caution in this group [^b5a181e5] [^4d42edf0].

---

## Potential risks and contraindications

While bicarbonate therapy is generally safe, **clinicians should be aware of the following risks and contraindications**:

- **Sodium load**: Excess sodium can worsen hypertension, edema, and heart failure [^ade3836c] [^ab86a891].
- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort are common [^7c51732e].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor for hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, especially with other medications [^ff562126].

Contraindications include **uncontrolled hypertension**, **heart failure**, or **edema** due to sodium load; use caution in older adults with multimorbidity [^4d42edf0] [^b5a181e5].

---

## Practical approach to bicarbonate supplementation

When initiating bicarbonate therapy, the following practical approach is recommended:

- **Initial dose**: 1.2–1.8 g (15–23 mmol) orally three times daily with meals [^notfound].
- **Titration**: Adjust dose to maintain serum bicarbonate 22–26 mmol/L, avoiding values > 28 mmol/L [^871d3d13] [^78fd44ec].
- **Monitoring**: Check serum bicarbonate, potassium, and blood pressure every 3–6 months, or more frequently if clinically indicated [^notfound].
- **Alternative strategies**: Consider dietary alkali (fruits and vegetables) or non-sodium alkali (e.g. veverimer) in patients sensitive to sodium load [^480840d9] [^bdd29ce6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate bicarbonate therapy** when serum bicarbonate is < 18 mmol/L [^ff562126].
- **Consider therapy** at 18–22 mmol/L if there is rapid eGFR decline, protein-energy wasting, or bone disease, with close monitoring [^4d42edf0].
- **Avoid routine use** when bicarbonate is ≥ 22 mmol/L or if there is uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, or edema [^4d42edf0] [^ade3836c].
- **Titrate to maintain** 22–26 mmol/L and monitor for adverse effects [^871d3d13] [^78fd44ec].

Conclusions

Our data showed a possibility that a high serum bicarbonate level within the normal range may more effectively prevent CKD progression in elderly CKD patients, and suggested that the upper limit of the target serum bicarbonate level may be that of the normal range of serum bicarbonate levels. For the prevention of CKD progression, there are issues that should be resolved: when to start the treatment with sodium bicarbonate and how much sodium bicarbonate should be administered. Clinical trials using a large sample size are required to obtain strong evidence that can help guide therapies with sodium bicarbonate.

### Bicarbonate supplementation slows progression of CKD and improves nutritional status [^070b1017]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Bicarbonate supplementation preserves renal function in experimental chronic kidney disease (CKD), but whether the same benefit occurs in humans is unknown. Here, we randomly assigned 134 adult patients with CKD (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15 to 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) and serum bicarbonate 16 to 20 mmol/L to either supplementation with oral sodium bicarbonate or standard care for 2 yr. The primary end points were rate of CrCl decline, the proportion of patients with rapid decline of CrCl (> 3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)/yr), and ESRD (CrCl < 10 ml/min). Secondary end points were dietary protein intake, normalized protein nitrogen appearance, serum albumin, and mid-arm muscle circumference. Compared with the control group, decline in CrCl was slower with bicarbonate supplementation (5.93 versus 1.88 ml/min 1.73 m(2); P < 0.0001). Patients supplemented with bicarbonate were significantly less likely to experience rapid progression (9 versus 45%; relative risk 0.15; 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.40; P < 0.0001). Similarly, fewer patients supplemented with bicarbonate developed ESRD (6.5 versus 33%; relative risk 0.13; 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.40; P < 0.001). Nutritional parameters improved significantly with bicarbonate supplementation, which was well tolerated. This study demonstrates that bicarbonate supplementation slows the rate of progression of renal failure to ESRD and improves nutritional status among patients with CKD.

ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS RELATING SERUM BICARBONATE INCREASE AND REDUCTION OF ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE DECLINE IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH ORAL BICARBONATE SUPPLEMENTATION

The findings of the above prospective studies and the association of better kidney outcomes with treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD suggest a promising new approach to slowing disease progression, apart from current renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition therapy. There is a clear medical need for new therapies for CKD. In view of this need, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has considered new recommendations for kidney outcome measures used in the evaluation of new therapies. The FDA accepts a 57% decline in eGFR, corresponding to a doubling of serum creatinine, as an endpoint for clinical trials of kidney disease progression because it represents a marked loss of kidney function that is predictive of eventual kidney failure. Recent initiatives coordinated by the National Kidney Foundation and the FDA are evaluating alternative endpoints to shorten the duration of clinical trials, reduce sample size, and include patients with earlier stages of CKD. Based on a series of meta-analyses of cohorts and clinical trials, as well as simulations of trial designs and analytic methods, these efforts have shown that an eGFR decline of 40% is an acceptable surrogate endpoint to assess treatment effects of new therapies designed to slow CKD progression. It is instructive then to see how this endpoint might be used in light of the prospective studies reported above.

Of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 1 new trial has been published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important kidney effect of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

Metabolic acidosis was one of the earliest complications to be recognized and explained pathologically in patients with CKD. Despite the accumulated evidence of deleterious effects of acidosis, treatment of acidosis has been tested very little, especially with respect to standard clinical outcomes. On the basis of fundamental research and small alkali supplementation trials, correcting metabolic acidosis has a strikingly broad array of potential benefits. This review summarizes the published evidence on the association between serum bicarbonate and clinical outcomes. We discuss the role of alkali supplementation in CKD as it relates to retarding kidney disease progression, improving metabolic and musculoskeletal complications.

A focus on single disease outcomes may not always be appropriate for older people with multimorbidity; improvements in a single organ domain may be counterbalanced by harms in other systems. Older people consistently rank physical function and quality of life as the most important outcomes and measurement of these outcomes allows the impact of an intervention to be integrated across multiple organ systems. The primary objective of the BiCARB trial was to determine whether oral bicarbonate therapy improves physical function compared to placebo in older people with CKD and mild acidosis. The secondary objectives were to assess the effect of bicarbonate supplementation on health-related quality of life, biochemical markers of CKD, bone and vascular health, adverse events and healthcare costs.

### Should chronic metabolic acidosis be treated in older people with chronic kidney disease? [^025b9a58]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group of patients.

INCREASING SERUM BICARBONATE SLOWS PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Five studies have examined the impact of metabolic acidosis treatment with oral alkali or base-producing dietary interventions on the progression of kidney disease in CKD stage 3–5 patients with reduced serum HCO 3 (< 22 mEq/l) (Table 1). The study by de Brito-Ashurst et al. represented an important first step in linking correction of low serum HCO 3 and improved outcomes in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. In this single-center, open-label, prospective, parallel-group study, 134 CKD stage 4–5 patients with metabolic acidosis (serum HCO 3 > 16 and < 20 mEq/l) were randomized 1:1 to intervention with oral sodium bicarbonate, administered as 600 mg tablets three times per day and increased as necessary to achieve and maintain serum HCO 3 at least 23 mEq/l, or standard of care for 2 years. The objectives of the study were to assess the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on progression of CKD and on nutritional status in these predialysis patients. The study population had an average baseline creatinine clearance of ∼20 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and an average baseline serum HCO 3 level of ∼20 mEq/l. Study criteria excluded patients with poorly controlled blood pressure (BP; > 150/90 mmHg, despite use of four agents), overt congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, and chronic sepsis, all conditions with potential fluid balance complications that could be worsened with ingestion of ∼500 mg of sodium that accompanied the average oral sodium bicarbonate daily dose administered in this study (1.82 ± 0.80 g/day). At the end of the 2-year study, serum HCO 3 increased in the treated patients by approximately 4 mEq/l compared with the control group (Fig. 1 a); these results were clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Compared with the control group, decline in creatinine clearance was slower with sodium bicarbonate supplementation (−1.88 versus −5.93 ml/min/1.73 m 2; P < 0.0001), a difference of approximately 4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 1 b). Patients who received treatment for their metabolic acidosis were also significantly less likely than controls to experience rapid progression of kidney failure (9 versus 45%; P < 0.0001) or to develop ESKD (6.5 versus 33%; P < 0.001) over the 2-year treatment period (Fig. 2). Thus, this landmark study demonstrated the beneficial effects of increasing serum HCO 3 on slowing the progression of kidney disease to an extent that was both statistically significant and clinically meaningful.

### Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes and mortality in patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: an observational cohort study [^13d33ebb]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large longitudinal cohort study of more than 50,000 community-based individuals with non-dialysis-dependent stage 3‒5 CKD, we found that a higher baseline serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with a lower risk of CKD progression, kidney failure, and all-cause mortality, when considered alone or as a composite outcome.

Each 1-mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate was associated with a significant 7.4% reduction in the risk of the DD40 outcome over a median follow-up of almost 4 years as well as a significant 13% reduction in the odds of the DD40 outcome over a 2-year period. Previous studies examining the association between serum bicarbonate levels and CKD progression have found conflicting results, potentially due to differences in sample sizes, patient populations, baseline risks of end-stage kidney disease, and duration of follow-up as well as the definition and number of events, the prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis, and the degree of adjustment for covariates, all of which influence power and effect size. Our ability to detect an association between small incremental increases in serum bicarbonate level and clinical outcomes was enabled by the large sample size and the high frequency of events in our study.

The results of our study are supported by findings from several clinical trials in which treatment of metabolic acidosis using various interventions led to reductions in adverse renal outcomes. One of these studies was a multicenter, multinational, placebo-controlled trial. The other studies were open-label with standard-of-care controls, of which three were conducted at a single center and one was conducted at multiple centers in one country; interventions included a very low protein diet or sodium bicarbonate.

Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) to treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD with oral bicarbonate supplementation, few patients with metabolic acidosis receive alkali treatment. For example, in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, only 2.7% of patients with serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 22 mEq/L were receiving alkali treatment at baseline, and in the phase 3 veverimer study, less than < 10% of patients with mean serum bicarbonate levels of 17.1 mEq/L were receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment at baseline. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that metabolic acidosis should be treated more aggressively and patients should receive appropriate dietary counseling and pharmacological treatment when appropriate.

### Effects of dietary interventions for metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7c51732e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common public health problem affecting nearly one in eight individuals worldwide. The kidney's capacity to excrete the daily acid load is impaired in people with CKD, which leads to metabolic acidosis, one of the first recognized complications of advanced disease. With a definition of plasma or venous bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L, the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is 20% in people with CKD Stages G3–G5. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can lead to CKD progression, muscle wasting, bone disease, stimulating inflammation and increased mortality.

Oral bicarbonate supplementation has been used to correct metabolic acidosis for decades, and has been hypothesized to delay the progression of kidney failure. A recent meta-analysis, including 3695 participants comparing oral alkali therapy with placebo or standard of care, showed beneficial effects of alkali therapy in delaying kidney failure and preserving function, with no effects on proteinuria, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. Despite these favorable effects, clinical studies have reported a number of notable side effects in regard to alkali therapy, including gastric discomfort, belching and flatulence. The latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline (2024) for the evaluation and management of CKD adopts a more conservative approach regarding alkali therapy in metabolic acidosis. It recommends considering pharmacological treatment for adults with bicarbonate levels < 18 mmol/L, with or without dietary interventions, while closely monitoring to ensure that serum bicarbonate levels do not exceed the upper limit of normal and that the treatment does not negatively impact blood pressure control, serum potassium levels or fluid status.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^308901e2]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) — very low–protein diets with ketoacid analogs: In a trial with fifteen months of strict adherence, very low–protein diets of 0.3 g/kg body weight/d supplemented with 0.125 g/kg body weight/d of ketoacids in people with an average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 18 ml/ min per 1.73 m^2 at baseline slowed the decline in eGFR, increased bicarbonate, and reduced need for kidney replacement therapy versus a mixed-protein diet of 0.6 g/kg body weight/d; however, a recent pragmatic trial was not able to reproduce these findings, and limitations of ketoacid analogs include high pill burden and high cost.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^ae965253]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The importance of normalizing serum HCO 3 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis is reflected in the leading treatment guidelines for CKD. The US-based National Kidney Foundation's KDOQI guidelines state that serum HCO 3 levels should be maintained at 22 mEq/l or greater and recommend the use of oral alkali supplements to attain this goal, whereas maintaining an awareness of the complications related to the use of such supplements. Similarly, guidelines from KDIGO suggest that in patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate less than 22 mEq/l treatment with oral bicarbonate supplementation can be given to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range unless contraindicated. Several large retrospective database analyses show that clinical outcomes for CKD patients with serum HCO 3 levels that are below normal (i.e. < 22 mEq/l) are significantly worse compared with patients with normal serum HCO 3 (i.e. 22–29 mEq/l). In addition, several single-center, prospective studies examining the effects of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or dietary interventions have also elucidated the beneficial effects of treating chronic metabolic acidosis. In four of the seven key interventional studies discussed here, the provision of oral bicarbonate supplementation increased serum HCO 3 in enrolled CKD patients with baseline serum HCO 3 less than 22 mEq/l, often within 6 months of treatment initiation. Further, long-term treatment of metabolic acidosis (1–3 years) or treatment of hypertension-associated nephropathy patients with normal serum HCO 3 belying an increased acid load (5 years), showed direct benefit on reducing eGFR decline and improving kidney outcomes. Importantly, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in the expression of urine biomarkers that reflect continued injury to kidneys exposed to chronic acid loading. A post hoc analysis of data from the Phisitkul et al. study showed that the provision of oral alkali to CKD patients with metabolic acidosis reduced the number of patients who experienced at least 40% decline in eGFR, an accepted surrogate endpoint of kidney disease progression to ESKD. Although 27.6% of control patients in this study showed at least 40% decline in eGFR over the 2-year treatment interval, no patients in the sodium citrate treatment group experienced eGFR declines of this magnitude (Table 3; Fig. 2). A limitation of the studies reviewed here is in the enrollment of patients who did not have severe comorbidities commonly found in CKD (e.g. edema, heart failure, poorly-controlled hypertension), as treatment with sodium-based oral alkali might aggravate fluid homeostasis in such patients. Based on these findings, it seems likely that nutritional and pharmacologic management of metabolic acidosis preserves kidney function, and larger scale, multicenter testing of this hypothesis is warranted.

### High serum bicarbonate level within the normal range prevents the progression of chronic kidney disease in elderly chronic kidney disease patients [^507ed15d]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

As the number of functioning nephrons decreases in chronic kidney disease (CKD), total ammonium excretion level begins to decrease when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 40 to 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2. This results in net retention of hydrogen ions and metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis leads to CKD progression. There is some evidence of the relationship between serum bicarbonate level and CKD progression. Observational studies showed an association between a low serum bicarbonate level and progression of kidney diseases. Intervention studies show that bicarbonate supplementation slowed the progression of kidney diseases.

Kidney function declines with histological changes of the kidney with aging. United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys showed that a decreased GFR is associated with a high prevalence of acidosis in elderly CKD patients. Although elderly CKD patients have a high risk of metabolic acidosis, we were unable to find any reports about the effect of serum bicarbonate level on CKD progression in elderly CKD patients.

At present, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines 2000 and the Care of Australians with Renal Impairment (CARI) guidelines recommend that serum bicarbonate level should be maintained at or above 22 mEq/l. However, the guidelines recommend only this lower limit of the target serum bicarbonate level, but no upper limit in non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients. There have been no confirmatory controlled trials on the therapeutic range of serum bicarbonate levels. For serum bicarbonate level to be clinically useful, in this retrospective cohort study of elderly non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients whose serum bicarbonate levels were controlled within the normal range, we evaluated the relationship between serum bicarbonate level within the normal range and CKD progression, and investigated the upper limit of the target serum bicarbonate level.

Guideline 6: Electrolytes — acid load management and bicarbonate maintenance in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the following statements. In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3-5D, we recommend reducing net acid production (NEAP) through increased bicarbonate or a citric acid/sodium citrate solution supplementation (1C) in order to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function. In adults with CKD 3-5D, we suggest that adults with CKD 3-5D maintain serum bicarbonate levels at 24–26 mmol/ L (OPINION). Eleven studies examined the association between dietary acid load/oral bicarbonate supplements on health outcomes in the CKD population.

### Correction of chronic metabolic acidosis for chronic kidney disease patients [^45613627]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has adverse consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy. Metabolic acidosis may be corrected by oral bicarbonate supplementation or in dialysis patients by increasing the bicarbonate concentration in dialysate fluid.

Objectives

To examine the benefits and harms of treating metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, both prior to reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT), with sodium bicarbonate or increasing the bicarbonate concentration of dialysate.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, issue 4 2005), Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (October 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - October 2005) and EMBASE (1980 - October 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover RCTs and quasi-RCTs investigating the correction of chronic metabolic acidosis in adults or children with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcomes were analysed using relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (MD) for continuous measures.

Main Results

We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta-analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, there was no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.

### Sodium bicarbonate supplements for treating acute kidney injury [^1992f075]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, serious, but potentially treatable condition. Because AKI is often associated with acidosis, it has become common practice to recommend administration of sodium bicarbonate to correct acid imbalance.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcome measures were patients' need for renal replacement therapy; return to baseline kidney function; and overall survival.

Search Methods

In November 2011 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register using keywords relevant to this review. The register is populated using searches of Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and handsearching records from renal-related journals and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of sodium bicarbonate supplements, administered by any route, for the treatment of adults with AKI were to be included. The search strategy did not restrict inclusion based on an upper age limit or publication language. We did not consider inclusion of studies that investigated use of sodium bicarbonate for AKI prevention.

Data Collection and Analysis

All authors planned to independently assess and extracted information. Information was to be collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes. Results were to be expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or as mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Although our literature search identified four studies, none of these met our predetermined selection criteria. Hence, no suitable studies were identified for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCT evidence - supportive or otherwise - for the use of sodium bicarbonate for people with AKI. We concluded that there is an urgent need for well conducted RCTs in this area.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^6beec992]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In another analysis, values of dietary acid generation were obtained from the 24-h dietary recall questionnaire used in the National Health and Nutrition (NHANES III) Trial. In the 1468 adults with CKD participating in this evaluation during 14.2 years, 311 participants developed ESRD. The risk of ESRD was increased in patients expressing higher levels of dietary acid generation yielding a relative hazard ratio of 3.04 (C. I.; 1.58 to 5.86) for patients with the greatest degree of acid production.

Identification of the associations between metabolic acidosis and the progression of CKD has understandably stimulated investigators to examine if progression of CKD could be suppressed by simply supplying alkali supplements. De Brito-Ashurst and colleagues evaluated this possibility in a controlled trial of 134 adult patients with metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate, 16–20 mM) and CKD (basal creatinine clearances (Ccr), 15 to 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2). In that study, patients were randomly assigned to standard care or to administration of bicarbonate supplements; their Ccr levels were examined repeatedly over 2 years. The patients assigned to bicarbonate supplements experienced a slower decline in Ccr (−1.88 vs −5.93 ml/min/1.73 m 2; P < 0.0001) and fewer of the patients treated with sodium bicarbonate developed ESRD (P < 0.001). The investigators also uncovered nutritional benefits of correcting acidosis in patients with CKD, including evidence for increasing protein stores. Other investigators have examined patients with hypertension, CKD and relatively preserved levels of eGFR (mean, 75 ml/min/1.73 m 2) during a 5 year period. Enrolled patients were treated with ACEi and then randomly assigned to receive sodium bicarbonate, an equimolar amount of sodium chloride or a placebo. The authors found that the rate of decline of eGFR (estimated from plasma cystatin C levels) was slower while eGFR values remained higher in the group of patients treated with oral supplements of sodium bicarbonate compared to results from patients treated with sodium chloride or placebo. These and other reports demonstrate that the correction of metabolic acidosis not only slows the rate of loss of kidney function but also can improve hormonal metabolism as well as values of protein turnover. Although it is possible that measurements obtained in a larger clinical trial might uncover different results, these clinical measurements were collected in randomized, controlled trials and hence, they offer overwhelmingly relevant reasons for correcting metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD.

### Relationship between mortality and use of sodium bicarbonate at the time of dialysis initiation: a prospective observational study [^f280bd9f]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8–16% of the population worldwide and is often under-recognised by both patients and clinicians. CKD is the 16th leading cause of years of life lost worldwide. In patients with CKD, the risk of death increases as kidney function worsens and such deaths are largely attributable to cardiovascular disease, although cancer incidence and mortality are also increased in these patients. Moreover, patients with CKD often experience metabolic acidosis resulting from a fundamental disturbance of acid-base balance. As serum bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) is below the normal range in patients with CKD, generally considered as 22–29 mEq/L, the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death is higher compared to those with CKD but without metabolic acidosis. The treatment for metabolic acidosis in CKD is oral alkali supplementation, which has been shown to slow CKD progression. When the bicarbonate level is below 22 mmol/L, prescription of sodium bicarbonate is recommended. However, the available evidence only provides general guidance for clinicians and has substantial variability in clinical practice.

Oral sodium bicarbonate has been used for decades to counteract metabolic acidosis. Oral sodium bicarbonate may have a residual renal function-preserving effect in peritoneal dialysis patients. Moreover, bicarbonate supplementation modestly improved renal function and serum bicarbonate levels compared to placebo or conventional CKD management in non-haemodialysis dependent CKD patients. In contrast, there are concerns that the sodium content might increase blood pressure or circulatory overload, leading to the deterioration of heart failure. Nonetheless, it is unknown how oral bicarbonate supplementation can affect patients who start dialysis therapy both positively and negatively.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy on mortality in patients with ESKD who were initiated on dialysis therapy. Our study is novel and significant because we focused on the efficacy of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy in patients before dialysis therapy initiation.

### Metabolic acidosis and kidney disease: does bicarbonate therapy slow the progression of CKD? [^c28076c3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication associated with progressive loss of kidney function. The diminishing ability of the kidneys to maintain acid-base homeostasis results in acid accumulation, leading to various complications such as impairment in nutritional status, worsened uremic bone disease and an association with increased mortality. In addition to these adverse effects which are related to acid retention, metabolic acidosis may also cause kidney damage, possibly through the stimulation of adaptive mechanisms aimed at maintaining acid-base homeostasis in the face of decreasing kidney function. Recent clinical trials have suggested that correction or prevention of metabolic acidosis by alkali administration is able to attenuate kidney damage and to slow progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and may hence offer an effective, safe and affordable renoprotective strategy. We review the physiology and pathophysiology of acid-base homeostasis in CKD, the mechanisms whereby metabolic acidosis may be deleterious to kidney function, and the results of clinical trials suggesting a benefit of alkali therapy, with special attention to details related to the practical implementation of the results of these trials.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^f09021f9]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — research gaps in diet and activity are highlighted: there is controversy about accuracy of assessing sodium intake using random spot urine, and additional research is required on sodium-intake assessment methods and health impacts of very low-sodium intakes in chronic kidney disease (CKD); small single-center trials of chronic oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo have not found changes in blood pressure (BP), raising the possibility that the accompanying anion may influence the BP response and that future research is required to determine such relationships; in the general population, potassium-containing salt substitutes lower BP, but persons with CKD have been systematically excluded from these trials and some observational CKD data associate higher potassium intake with higher risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular (CV) disease, so whether potassium-containing salt substitutes have health benefits or unique risks in CKD requires future study; persons of African ancestry are disproportionately represented in CKD, and reviews suggest larger BP reductions from sodium restriction in African and Asian ancestry compared to Caucasians, yet whether such racial differences apply in CKD is uncertain and should be evaluated; there is a paucity of data to identify which CKD patients gain the greatest or least BP benefit — or risk harm — from physical activity interventions, and algorithms to tailor physical activity intensity and supervision are needed; in countries where iodine supplements are added to salt, future studies are required to determine whether sodium restriction in CKD may contribute to iodine deficiency.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) metabolic acidosis — adult oral sodium bicarbonate: In adults with CKD G3–G4 aged ≥ 60 years and serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l, the BICARB trial found "no evidence of benefit on nonkidney outcomes" and reported kidney failure outcomes with "HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64–1.49", while "allocation to oral sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs and lower… EQ-5D-3L… QoL over 1 year". For treatment thresholds, "It is generally accepted that a serum bicarbonate of < 18 mmol/l in adults is desirable to avoid", and because "correction of bicarbonate to the normal range has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidney failure", "lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/l could be considered".

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^de0aeddd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, we found that sodium bicarbonate was associated with more patients achieving an improvement in eGFR from baseline, particularly in patients of Asian ethnicity, those age < 65 years, those with treatment duration between 6 and 12 months, those receiving standard of the care as control group, and having post-treatment serum bicarbonate levels ≤ 24 mEq/L. Moreover, sodium bicarbonate treatment was associated with lower hospitalization rates and greater serum albumin levels but did not demonstrate survival benefit. Nevertheless, there was a nonsignificant decrease in hospitalization rates among patients receiving sodium bicarbonate compared with those without in sensitivity analyses. Correcting MA with sodium bicarbonate also improved MAMC. However, treatment was also associated with a statistically significant increase in in both serum calcium and phosphate. Patients receiving sodium bicarbonate had a relatively high risk of rise in SBP. For other potential adverse effects, no statistically significant differences were observed in body weight gain or serum potassium levels between the two groups.

According to the 2024 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, individuals with CKD should consider pharmacological treatment of MA to levels of serum bicarbonate at or below 18 mmol/L because of its potential clinical implications. The Clinical and Cost-effectiveness of Oral Sodium Bicarbonate Therapy for Older Patients with CKD and Low-grade Acidosis trial observed no significant improvement in nonkidney outcomes for patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD age > 60 years with sodium bicarbonate levels below 22 mmol/L, following oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation. Moreover, this treatment was associated with higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version over 1 year. Consequently, it is recommended that bicarbonate therapy for patients with CKD should only commence when serum bicarbonate levels fall below 18 mmol/L to prevent more severe acidosis while awaiting further large-scale RCTs to determine the exact thresholds for clinical benefit.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^55a5e1a9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

Fig. 1
Diet enriched in fruits and vegetables in amounts was administered in order to reduce dietary acid load by 50%. Patients with stage 2 CKD who received this dietary intervention for 30 days experienced significant improvements in the potential renal acid load, 8-h urine net acid excretion, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine TGF-β. Abbreviations: CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β. Results from Goraya et al.

These reports are encouraging for several reasons. Firstly, there is evidence that simply supplying alkali to patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis will result in important clinical benefits that include slowing of progressive renal insufficiency and reversing the loss of protein stores. Secondly, the dose of sodium bicarbonate supplements or the amounts of dietary fruits and vegetables needed to block the development of metabolic acidosis can be simply assessed by measuring the serum bicarbonate (or total CO 2). Thirdly, these outcomes should stimulate new hypotheses to design methods of correcting metabolic acidosis or creating other dietary strategies.

### Treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD [^feba6f03]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and is believed to contribute to a number of sequelae, including bone disease, altered protein metabolism, skeletal muscle wasting, and progressive glomerular filtration rate loss. Small trials in animal models and humans suggest a role for alkali therapy to lessen these complications. Recent studies support this notion, although more definitive evidence is needed on the long-term benefits of alkali therapy and the optimal serum bicarbonate level. The role of dietary modification also should be given greater consideration. In addition, potential adverse effects of alkali treatment must be taken into consideration, including sodium retention and the theoretical concern of promoting vascular calcification. This teaching case summarizes the rationale for and benefits and complications of base therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

Implications and future research

Our results suggest that at least for patients aged 60 and over with CKD GFR categories 4 and 5, 1.5 to 3 g per day of oral bicarbonate does not produce any health benefits and may be associated with net harms. Whilst other indications for control of acidosis exist (for example high potassium concentrations), evidence from the current trial suggests that the additional cost, treatment burden and side effects of oral bicarbonate may not justify its use in older people with advanced CKD and mild degrees of metabolic acidosis (i.e. serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L). Raising bicarbonate levels by an amount sufficient to produce useful clinical effects will require larger doses than we used in this trial and is likely to require a 'treat-to-target' strategy. However, such doses may not be tolerated by many older people. Alternative strategies, such as the use of hydrochloric acid binders, may provide a way round this issue, but such agents need to be tested against current practice in representative groups of patients, using a range of outcomes relevant to older people including physical function, quality of life and deterioration of renal function.

### Acidosis and progression of chronic kidney disease [^dd435ab2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease progressively impairs the ability of kidneys to excrete hydrogen ions owing to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesize ammonia resulting in metabolic acidosis. There is good experimental evidence that metabolic acidosis contributes to protein energy wasting disorder and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there was a lack of robust clinical evidence to support these experimental observations.

Recent Findings

Three recent publications have confirmed the experimental evidence and the only randomized controlled study of its kind has suggested that the correction of acidosis by sodium bicarbonate in patients with advanced CKD is associated with attenuation of the rate of decline of renal function, reduction in the incidence of end stage renal disease and improvement of nutritional parameters.

Summary

In light of these recent studies, it appears that this cheap and simple strategy, which is in line with current renal recommendations, has the potential of translating into significant economic, quality of life and clinical outcome benefits in an expanding pool of patients with CKD.

Dietary protein restriction in chronic kidney disease — very low–protein diets and ketoacid analog supplementation: Fifteen months of strict adherence to vegetarian very low–protein diets of 0.3 g/kg body weight/d supplemented with 0.125 g/kg body weight/d of ketoacids in people with an average eGFR of 18 ml/ min per 1.73 m2 at baseline slowed the decline in eGFR, increased bicarbonate levels, and reduced the need for KRT compared with a mixed-protein diet of 0.6 g/kg body weight/d; however, a recent pragmatic trial was not able to reproduce these findings. In a meta-analysis, 12 studies reported no evidence of malnutrition while 3 studies reported small numbers with worsening nutritional status, and the estimated average requirement for adults is approximately 0.5–0.6 g/kg body weight/d. Malnutrition may arise if protein reduction is accompanied by reduced energy intake, which may be preventable with adequate patient education on food choices and close supervision by renal dietitians or accredited nutrition specialists.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with metabolic acidosis — adult oral sodium bicarbonate and dietary strategies are characterized as follows: The BiCARB trial contributed 33 of 152 versus 33 of 148 kidney failure outcomes to the meta-analysis in its bicarbonate versus placebo arms, respectively (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.64–1.49), and in CKD G3–G4 aged ≥ 60 years with sodium bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/l found no evidence of benefit on nonkidney outcomes; allocation to oral sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs and lower EQ-5D-3L associated QoL over 1 year. Placebo-controlled trials have found no good evidence that correcting sodium bicarbonate levels has good effects on clinical outcomes, but the intervention is clearly effective at increasing serum bicarbonate concentration and is associated with a reduced tendency to severe acidosis with sodium bicarbonate therapy; because correction to the normal range has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidney failure, lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/l could be considered. Dietary modifications that limit acid-rich foods and/or increase alkaline-rich foods serve as an effective additional strategy to control metabolic acidosis, and several small RCTs of alkaline-rich plant-based diets in adults with CKD demonstrate a comparable benefit to oral sodium bicarbonate in controlling metabolic acidosis.

### Bicarbonate therapy for prevention of chronic kidney disease progression [^c059d8b6]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Kidney injury in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is likely multifactorial, but recent data support that a component is mediated by mechanisms used by the kidney to increase acidification in response to an acid challenge to systemic acid-base status. If so, systemic alkalization might attenuate this acid-induced component of kidney injury. An acid challenge to systemic acid-base status increases nephron acidification through increased production of endothelin, aldosterone, and angiotensin II, each of which can contribute to kidney inflammation and fibrosis that characterizes CKD. Systemic alkalization that ameliorates an acid challenge might attenuate the contributions of angiotensin II, endothelin, and aldosterone to kidney injury. Some small clinical studies support the efficacy of alkalization in attenuating kidney injury and slowing glomerular filtration rate decline in CKD. This review focuses on the potential that orally administered NaHCO₃ prevents CKD progression and additionally addresses its mechanism of action, side effects, possible complications, dosage, interaction, galenic form description, and contraindications. Current National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend oral alkali, including NaHCO₃(-), in CKD patients with serum HCO₃(-) < 22 mmol/l. Although oral alkali can be provided by other medications and by base-inducing dietary constituents, oral NaHCO₃ will be the focus of this review because of its relative safety and apparent efficacy, and its comparatively low cost.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) becomes increasingly common with older age, with approximately 2% of the population aged 70 years and over suffering from advanced (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) chronic kidney disease. Impaired ability to excrete hydrogen ions means that advanced CKD is accompanied by metabolic acidosis in approximately 20% of cases, with rates higher at lower levels of renal function. Metabolic acidosis has been associated in observational studies with a range of adverse health outcomes in patients with CKD, including worse cardiovascular health, lower bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, impaired muscle function and more rapid progression of kidney disease. The extent to which acidosis causes these phenomena remains unclear.

Oral sodium bicarbonate has been used for decades to counteract metabolic acidosis. Few trials have tested whether sodium bicarbonate is effective at preventing adverse outcomes from advanced CKD, and is safe in the context of increased sodium load, as opposed to merely increasing the concentration of circulating bicarbonate. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of small trials of moderate quality suggested a modest beneficial effect on estimated GFR and serum bicarbonate, an uncertain effect on progression to end-stage kidney disease and contrasting effects on blood pressure (no effect in one review, and a small increase in the risk of hypertension in the other), and found no data on the effect of bicarbonate on physical function or quality of life. The mean age of participants in included trials was young, ranging from 41 to 65 years. Sodium bicarbonate carries risks of gastrointestinal side effects, the large tablets and large number of tablets required are awkward for patients to take long term, and there are concerns that the sodium content might increase blood pressure or circulatory overload. These issues are of particular relevance for older people, who make up the majority of people in the UK with advanced kidney disease and are more likely to suffer side effects due to coexisting multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Current guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease recommend using oral sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis but acknowledge the dearth of evidence in this area.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1065133c]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A number of other trials of bicarbonate therapy are currently in progress or have just been published. These trials target a range of severities of CKD (categories 3b to 5), a range of entry serum bicarbonate concentrations and for two of the trials, a strategy of dose adjustment to keep serum bicarbonate > 24 mmol/L is employed. None of these trials targets older people as a specific group however. The large UBI trial, based in Italy, randomised 795 individuals with CKD stage 3b or 4 to usual care or a strategy of bicarbonate treatment to a target of 24–28 mmol/L. The mean dose required to reach this serum bicarbonate concentration (some 3–4 mmol/L higher than in the usual care arm) was 6 g/day of sodium bicarbonate — much higher than used in the BiCARB trial. The UBI trial showed a significant reduction in the rate of progression of CKD, death and dialysis commencement in the bicarbonate arm compared to usual care. Patients in this trial were slightly younger (mean age 67 years) and had considerably better renal function (mean eGFR of 36 mL/min/1.73 m 2), but the trial was not placebo-controlled or blinded. In contrast, a smaller (n = 149) placebo-controlled randomised trial in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 with similar baseline eGFR found a 1–2-mmol/L increase in serum bicarbonate concentration in the treatment arm compared to placebo, using a dose equivalent to between 2 and 2.5 g per day of sodium bicarbonate. Similar to the findings of the BiCARB trial, there was no effect of bicarbonate supplementation on eGFR, muscle function, blood pressure or quality of life.

Recent trial data suggests that the new hydrochloric acid binder veverimer can successfully increase serum bicarbonate concentrations; a mean 3-mmol/L increase compared to placebo was observed over 12 weeks. In addition, veverimer improved disease-specific quality of life measured using the KDQoL tool, and improved chair stand time relative to placebo over 1 year of treatment, albeit in a younger population (mean age 61 years) than studied in the current trial.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^f4a75bd3]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The original target for recruitment for this trial (380 participants) was not reached despite recruiting from 27 UK sites. This was in part due to a lack of clinical equipoise; surveys performed by the trial team during the trial suggested that most UK nephrologists were treating patients with serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L with bicarbonate already, thus reducing the pool of eligible participants. It is possible that those most likely to respond to bicarbonate supplementation were already taking bicarbonate as part of routine clinical practice, thus further diluting the effect of the intervention. The dropout rate in the trial was considerable and slightly higher than the 10% per 6-month follow-up that we anticipated. Such a dropout rate is not unexpected given the high levels of multimorbidity and frailty in this patient population. Although dropout reduces the power of the trial to detect significant treatment effects, this is mitigated to some extent by our use of mixed models with repeated measures for the secondary analyses, which use all available data and effectively impute missing values. Thus, despite the lower than planned sample size, and the lower than anticipated availability of primary outcome data at 12 months, our results exclude the minimum clinically important improvement in the primary outcome with a high degree of confidence. Some investigators have proposed a smaller minimum clinically important difference of 0.5 points for the SPPB; our results also exclude this improvement with a high degree of confidence. Although the trial was designed to have adequate power for the primary outcome and for the EQ-5D outcome, it was not powered to detect clinically important differences in the rate of deterioration of renal function, or for rates of commencing dialysis. We were unable to include the costs of every other medication used in the cost-effectiveness analysis, which could potentially lead to over- or underestimation of cost-effectiveness. Given the higher number of adverse events in the bicarbonate group (which would be expected to require additional drugs to treat), it is more likely that additional medication costs would be higher in the bicarbonate arm, further reducing the likelihood that bicarbonate is cost-effective.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^b5a181e5]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis is common in older people, but the effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy in this group is unclear. We tested whether oral sodium bicarbonate provides net health benefit for older people with advanced chronic kidney disease and serum bicarbonate concentrations < 22 mmol/L.

Methods

Pragmatic multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. We recruited adults aged ≥ 60 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, not receiving dialysis, with serum bicarbonate concentration < 22 mmol/L, from 27 nephrology and geriatric medicine departments in the UK. Participants received oral sodium bicarbonate (up to 3 g/day) or matching placebo given for up to 2 years, randomised in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 12 months, adjusted for baseline values, analysed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes included generic and disease-specific quality of life (EQ-5D and KDQoL tools), anthropometry, renal function, walk distance, blood pressure, bone and vascular health markers, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained.

Results

We randomised 300 participants between May 2013 and February 2017, mean age 74 years, 86 (29%) female. At 12 months, 116/152 (76%) participants allocated to bicarbonate and 104/148 (70%) allocated to placebo were assessed; primary outcome data were available for 187 participants. We found no significant treatment effect for the SPPB: bicarbonate arm 8.3 (SD 2.5) points, placebo arm 8.8 (SD 2.2) and adjusted treatment effect − 0.4 (95% CI − 0.9 to 0.1, p = 0.15). We found no significant treatment effect for glomerular filtration rate (0.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 95% CI − 0.8 to 2.0, p = 0.39). The bicarbonate arm showed higher costs and lower quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-3L tool over 1 year (£564 [95% CI £88 to £1154]); placebo dominated bicarbonate under all sensitivity analyses. Adverse events were more frequent in those randomised to bicarbonate (457 versus 400).

Conclusions

Oral sodium bicarbonate did not improve physical function or renal function, increased adverse events and is unlikely to be cost-effective for use by the UK NHS for this patient group.

### A basic solution for a complex problem: does treatment of metabolic acidosis slow CKD progression? [^610a6357]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of This Review

Metabolic acidosis is frequently encountered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with increasing prevalence as kidney function worsens. Treating electrolyte disturbances is the sine qua non of Nephrologists, and alkali therapy to normalize serum bicarbonate levels and slow progression of kidney disease has been embedded in clinical practice guidelines for decades on the basis of animal models and controversial clinical trials. This review will critically appraise the literature base for this recommendation and determine whether the available evidence supports this common practice, which is a timely endeavor considering the impending demotion of metabolic acidosis treatment from recommendation to practice point in forthcoming KDIGO guidelines.

Recent Findings

Earlier, open-label, studies supporting the utility of sodium bicarbonate therapy to slow progression of chronic kidney disease have been challenged by more recent, blinded, studies failing to show benefit on CKD progression. This was further demonstrated in the absence of concomitant sodium administration with the hydrochloric acid binder veverimer, which failed to demonstrate benefit on renal death, end stage kidney disease or 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate in a large multicenter trial.

Summary

The current body of literature does not support the routine treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD and the authors agree with the forthcoming KDIGO guidelines to de-emphasize this common practice.

Management of metabolic acidosis covers the entire spectrum from oral bicarbonate therapy and dietary modifications in chronic kidney disease to delivery of high doses of bicarbonate-based dialysate during maintenance haemodialysis (MHD). Due to the gradual depletion of the body's buffers and rapid repletion during MHD, many potential problems arise as a result of our current treatment paradigms. Several studies have given rise to conflicting data about the adverse effects of our current practice patterns in MHD. In this review, we will describe the pathophysiology and consequences of metabolic acidosis and its therapy in CKD and ESRD, and discuss current evidence supporting a more individualized approach for bicarbonate therapy in MHD.

### Short-and long-term effects of alkali therapy in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^1f070bc5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend alkali therapy in patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic acidosis to prevent complications from metabolic acidosis. We systematically reviewed the effect of sodium bicarbonate on benefits and harms in patients with CKD.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials in MEDLINE (through July 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and scientific abstracts. We included trials that compared sodium bicarbonate to standard-of-care therapy or placebo that reported on kidney-related outcomes. We performed random-effects model meta-analyses to compute net changes (for continuous variables) and risk ratios (for binary variables).

Results

Two short-term (≤ 7 days) crossover trials and 4 long-term (≥ 2 months) parallel-design randomized controlled trials met eligibility (312 patients). All 6 trials prescribed sodium bicarbonate in the alkali-treated group. In the long-term studies, alkali therapy was associated with a net decrease in serum creatinine (-0.07 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.09, -0.05; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0), a net improvement in GFR (3.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI 1.6, 4.7; p < 0.001; I(2) = 0), and a lower incidence of dialysis initiation (risk ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.08, 0.54; p = 0.001; I(2) = 0). No benefit was observed on the serum creatinine or GFR in short-term studies. Alkali therapy was not associated with a higher likelihood of initiating or escalating anti-hypertensive medications.

Conclusions

Alkali therapy is associated with an improvement in kidney function, which may afford a long-term benefit in slowing the progression of CKD. However, differences in study protocols and small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions.

A number of limitations require further comment. Given the modest increase in serum bicarbonate seen with the dosing schedule used in this trial, it is possible that larger doses of oral bicarbonate are required to increase serum bicarbonate in older people with CKD, although the mechanisms that might underpin such a hypothesis are unclear. Whilst such an approach would be of mechanistic interest, we do not believe that higher doses (more than the six tablets per day) would be well tolerated by older people; the adherence rate would likely be even lower than the moderate adherence rate observed in the current trial. The higher rate of adverse events in the bicarbonate arm, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, slightly lower physical function measures and lack of a relationship between adherence and treatment effect size, all argue that a higher dose of bicarbonate is unlikely to produce health benefits in this patient group. We cannot exclude a potentially beneficial effect of bicarbonate in different groups of patients with CKD, however. In particular, the current trial enrolled an overwhelmingly white European population. CKD of different aetiologies may respond differently and may explain some of the heterogeneity seen in one recent systematic review.

Moreover, sodium bicarbonate supplementation significantly increased serum albumin and MAMC. MA accelerates protein catabolism and decreases muscle mass. Correction of MA would attenuate protein degradation, thereby facilitating an increase in serum albumin level and MAMC, an index of muscle mass.

Furthermore, treating with sodium bicarbonate notably raised serum calcium and phosphate, with a concurrent elevated trend in iPTH level. MA detrimentally affects calcium–phosphate metabolism in patients with CKD, leading to a 50%–74% incidence of hyperphosphatemia. Progression of CKD also elevates fibroblast growth factor-23 and reduced 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, stimulating iPTH secretion, triggering bone calcium release, and leading to hypercalcemia. These findings indicate that alkali therapy may not reverse this condition.

The current meta-analysis has some strengths. First, we specifically targeted CKD concurrent with MA, which is different from the previous meta-analyses. Second, our study conducted subgroup analyses and interaction tests to assess treatment effect variables based on participants' baseline characteristics, offering comprehensive insights for treatment approach and enhancing result reliability. Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, some studies were associated with high heterogeneity, which may be attributable to the variation in therapeutic dosage, modality, treatment duration, and baseline kidney function. Despite conducting subgroup analyses to address confounding factors, observed associations may be subject to residual confounding. Second, the forest plot for CV event rates with sodium bicarbonate supplementation could not be performed as several of the included studies reported no incidence of CV events. Third, there is an absence of efficacy data for sodium bicarbonate therapy across different etiologies of CKD, detailed in. Fourth, concerns must be raised regarding bias from the lack of double-blind designs and inconsistent control groups definitions. Fifth, dietary adjustments stand as a valuable alternative or adjunctive alkali treatment for patients with CKD with MA. However, studies focusing on dietary interventions were excluded to maintain our study's homogeneity. Hence, the evidence-based findings presented herein should be interpreted cautiously.

In conclusion, oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation may improve kidney function and enhance nutritional status along with muscle mass on patients with CKD with MA. Notably, physicians should be aware that administering sodium bicarbonate could negatively impact SBP. Further large-scale RCTs and more rigorous studies are necessary to definitively determine the benefits and potential harms of bicarbonate therapy in patients with CKD with MA.

### Approach to the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis in CKD [^1876d09c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical practice guidelines suggest that clinicians administer alkali to maintain serum bicarbonate level at a minimum of 22 mEq/L to prevent the effects of acidosis on bone demineralization and protein catabolism. Small interventional studies support the notion that correcting acidosis slows CKD progression as well. Furthermore, alkaline therapy in persons with CKD and normal bicarbonate levels may also preserve kidney function. Observational studies suggest that targeting a serum bicarbonate level near 28 mEq/L may improve clinical outcomes above and beyond targeting a value ≥ 22 mEq/L, yet values > 26 mEq/L have been reported to be associated with incident heart failure and mortality in the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study. Furthermore, correcting acidosis may provoke vascular calcification. This teaching case discusses several uncertainties regarding the management of acidosis in CKD, such as when to initiate alkali treatment, potential side effects of alkali, and the optimum serum bicarbonate level based on current evidence in CKD. Suggestions regarding the maximum sodium bicarbonate dose to administer to patients with CKD to achieve the target serum bicarbonate concentration are offered.

Discussion

Key findings

Our study is the first to examine the effect of oral bicarbonate therapy on physical function, health-related quality of life and healthcare costs in older people with advanced CKD. In this trial, administration of oral sodium bicarbonate using a dose regime similar to that currently used in UK practice did not improve physical function or quality of life, increased adverse events and had no impact on the rate of progression of CKD compared to placebo in older people with CKD category 4 or 5 and serum bicarbonate concentrations of < 22 mmol/L. Consistent with these findings, health economic analysis showed that bicarbonate was less cost-effective than placebo.

Strengths and weaknesses

Important strengths of this trial were its large size in comparison to previous trials in this area, the fact that it enrolled the age group most likely to suffer the consequences of CKD; clinically relevant follow-up time; participant, clinician and researcher masking; and broad inclusion criteria. In contrast to almost all previous trials, our use of a placebo control reduced the opportunities for bias. An additional strength was the broad range of outcome measures examined, with a particular focus on physical function and quality of life. These are the outcomes that older people report being most important to them, and this focus is of particular importance in this group of patients with extensive multimorbidity. A narrow focus on a single disease — even in patients with advanced CKD — may not be helpful for holistic decision-making; considering physical function and quality of life enables an assessment of the overall benefit of treatment to patients in a way that organ-specific measures do not.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) metabolic acidosis — In dialysis, the oral bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 weeks (p-value < 0.0003). In CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, the oral sodium bicarbonate group had significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05) and significant higher serum albumin at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05). In a group of CKD 5 hemodialysis patients, there was no significant difference in serum albumin among time points (p > 0.05), whereas in CKD 5 hemodialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin level (p = 0.01). It should also be noted that high dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Among CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased both serum albumin and prealbumin levels between before and after intervention (p < 0.05). Among CKD 1–2 compared to control and HCO3, the fruit and vegetable group had significantly greater decrease in body weight at the end of the intervention for both individuals with CKD 1–2 (p < 0.05 for both), with no difference between HCO3 and control. Thus there does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2. In CKD 4 compared to CKD 3, the FV group had lower weight at 1-year follow up (p < 0.01), and baseline weight did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.24). In CKD 3, fruits and vegetables had greater net body weight loss than both HCO3 and control (p < 0.05), and the control group had greater net body weight loss than the HCO3 group (p < 0.05). The evidence supporting the recommendations on dietary management of NEAP with fruits and vegetables and bicarbonate supplementation is based on Grade III /Grade C evidence, and the recommendation regarding bicarbonate maintenance based on Consensus/expert opinion.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^a1eddd11]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review the growing clinical evidence that metabolic acidosis mediates chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and that treatment to increase the associated low serum bicarbonate (HCO3) in CKD is disease-modifying.

Recent Findings

Seven prospective studies of patients with wide ranges of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) and serum HCO3 examined the effect on CKD of increasing serum HCO3 using dietary acid reduction with either oral alkali (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate), a vegetarian diet very low in acid-producing protein (0.3g/kg/day) supplemented with ketoanalogues or added base-producing fruits and vegetables. Clinical outcomes included slower kidney function decline (using eGFR measurements) and fewer patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that: treatment of metabolic acidosis for 2 years decreased the number of patients with at least a 40% eGFR decline, a validated surrogate for progression to end-stage kidney disease and across four studies, treatment to increase serum HCO3 by 4–6.8mEq/l in acidotic patients with CKD was associated with a ∼4ml/min/1.73m reduction in the rate of eGFR decline over 6–24 months compared with controls.

Summary

Metabolic acidosis appears to enhance CKD progression and its treatment should be studied further as a potential disease-modifying intervention.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

Given the association between metabolic acidosis and a range of adverse outcomes seen in CKD, it would be expected that amelioration of acidosis (i.e. increasing serum bicarbonate) could improve physical function, lessen deterioration in renal function and improve measures of cardiovascular health and bone and mineral metabolism in patients with CKD. A recent systematic review found no randomised controlled trial evidence around the effect of bicarbonate on physical function or quality of life; the current trial therefore provides an important test of the effect of bicarbonate on these important patient-centred outcomes. A previous single-centre trial of bicarbonate versus usual care found progressive increases in serum bicarbonate over a 2-year period in the bicarbonate group; measures of anthropometry were better in the bicarbonate group, and fewer participants progressed to end-stage renal disease in the bicarbonate group (4/67 vs 22/67). However, this trial did not use placebo, and thus, healthcare providers and participants were aware of group allocation. It is possible that the lack of masking could inflate the effect size seen in this trial, perhaps by an impact on decision-making around renal replacement and on other treatment decisions driven by knowledge of whether a participant was receiving bicarbonate. Participants in this previous trial were recruited from a single centre and were much younger (mean age 55 years), and a high percentage were of south Asian or black origin.

### Tolerance to sodium in patients with CKD-induced metabolic acidosis: does the accompanying anion matter? [^ade3836c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continue to produce endogenous acids but have a reduction in net acid excretion, resulting in a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration, which is termed chronic metabolic acidosis. Recent prospective studies, along with retrospective cohort analyses, demonstrate a higher risk for CKD progression with untreated metabolic acidosis. To normalize serum bicarbonate levels, acidemic patients are often treated with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) or sodium citrate, which have been shown to slow the progression of CKD. However, studies using this approach have routinely excluded patients with common sodium-sensitive comorbid conditions, such as poorly controlled hypertension, congestive heart failure, volume overload, or edema. This article examines the effect of the anion that accompanies sodium delivered with these therapies. Do the negative effects on blood pressure (BP) and sodium retention, as measured by an increase in edema, weight gain, and congestive heart failure, observed with oral administration of sodium chloride (NaCl) differ when a similar amount of sodium is given with bicarbonate or citrate in this patient population? A review of the literature suggests that NaHCO 3 does not increase BP or sodium retention when administered to patients with CKD during a concurrent severe NaCl dietary restriction (∼10 mEq/d). However, this degree of NaCl restriction is feasible only under strict control in clinical research environments. In contrast, when NaHCO 3 is given to patients without severe dietary NaCl restriction, there is an increase in BP and sodium retention. Thus, unless patients with CKD can tolerate a diet virtually devoid of NaCl, additional sodium, regardless of the accompanying anion, appears to increase BP and sodium retention.

### The choice of dialysate bicarbonate: do different concentrations make a difference? [^3effe810]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease; it is typically caused by the accumulation of sulfate, phosphorus, and organic anions. Metabolic acidosis is correlated with several adverse outcomes, such as morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality. Thus, correction of metabolic acidosis is fundamental for the adequate management of many systemic complications of chronic kidney disease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, acid-base homeostasis depends on many factors including the following: net acid production, amount of alkali given by the dialysate bath, duration of the interdialytic period, and residual diuresis, if any. Recent literature data suggest that the development of metabolic alkalosis after dialysis may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes. Our review is focused on the potential effects of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations on hard outcomes such as mortality. Unfortunately, no randomized studies exist about this issue. Acid-base equilibrium is a complex and vital system whose regulation is impaired in chronic kidney disease. We await further studies to assess the extent to which acid-base status is a major determinant of overall survival in patients undergoing hemodialysis. For the present, the clinician should understand that target values for predialysis serum bicarbonate concentration have been established primarily based on observational studies and expert opinion. Based on this, we should keep the predialysis serum bicarbonate level at least at 22 mmol/l. Furthermore, a specific focus should be addressed by the attending nephrologist to the clinical and nutritional status of the major outliers on both the acid and alkaline sides of the curve.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in women with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: a subgroup analysis from a randomised, controlled trial [^bdd29ce6]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in patient with CKD is currently managed on the principles of decreasing metabolic acid production by increasing dietary base-producing (e.g. vegetables and fruits) and/or by neutralizing acid with supplemental alkali salts such as sodium bicarbonate. Based on evidence that chronic metabolic acidosis is harmful to multiple organs and systems including muscle, bone, kidneys, and heart, the international practice guidelines for nephrology (KDIGO) recommends treating patients with CKD when the serum bicarbonate is < 22 mmol/L. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) also states that a reasonable target for serum bicarbonate is between 24 and 26 mmol/L. Even with these guideline suggestions, the percentage of patients currently treated with alkali salts is low. As an example, in the well-described cohort from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, only 2.7% of patients were treated with alkali despite a serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L. Sodium bicarbonate treats metabolic acidosis by entering the systemic circulation to supply bicarbonate that neutralizes retained acid. This causes a systemic sodium load that may be contraindicated in patients with CKD as these patients often have inadequate blood pressure control, edema, or heart failure. It is important to note that women comprise the majority of patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.

A limitation of this study is that it involved a subgroup analysis that, although pre-specified, should still be considered as hypothesis generating. Further, the study population lacked significant racial heterogeneity and sex was classified by self-report. Strengths of this study include its randomized multicenter design and pre-specification of the subgroup. Previous placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of metabolic acidosis on muscle function all used sodium bicarbonate as the intervention and did not find any differences in the overall population or by sex. This study, using a novel method to remove acid, is therefore the first to find a positive effect on measured physical function and physical function related quality of life.

### Urinary citrate: helpful to predict acid retention in CKD patients? [^fcdf134a]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Acid retention occurs early during the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies conducted in patients with CKD suggest that alkali supplementation may slow CKD progression. However, the diagnosis of acid retention is challenging when plasma bicarbonate concentration is still normal. In this issue, Goraya et al. suggest that urinary citrate may predict acid retention in eubicarbonatemic patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD. Although interesting, this claim yet requires confirmation by further studies.

### Effect of sodium bicarbonate on systolic blood pressure in CKD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab86a891]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor in the development of CKD and associated cardiovascular disease. As kidney function declines, systolic BP progressively increases. The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study suggests that adults with stage G3–5 CKD are up to three times more likely to suffer from hypertension compared with the general population. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidance focuses on the treatment of systolic BP to manage cardiovascular risk in CKD and recommends systolic BP treatment targets of < 120 mm Hg for nondiabetic individuals with high BP and CKD. Clinical strategies to achieve these BP targets include dietary sodium chloride (salt) restriction.

Metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate level < 22 mmol/L) is associated with poorer health outcomes. Metabolic acidosis results from an inability to maintain acid-base balance by excreting organic acids and hydrogen ions while conserving bicarbonate ions. This increases dependency on generating bicarbonate ions by ammoniagenesis, an inflammatory process that has been linked with deterioration of kidney function. The prevalence of metabolic acidosis varies from 7% in CKD stage G2 to 37% in CKD stage G4. For acidotic individuals with CKD, KDIGO guidancerecommends supplementation with sodium bicarbonate, unless there is a clinical concern that the associated sodium load will exacerbate hypertension and/or fluid overload. A large body of evidence supports a direct relationship between sodium consumption and hypertension, which is exacerbated in individuals with CKD. This relationship has raised clinical concerns regarding the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy in CKD. However, research suggests that sodium salts have varying effects on BP depending on their anion base. Indeed, some studies suggest that sodium chloride has a detrimental effect on BP, whereas sodium bicarbonate may improve BP. Large trials supporting these findings are lacking, and recent meta-analyses did not analyze changes in antihypertensive medication or diuretics, which may mask BP changes. – In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy (or its precursor sodium citrate) on systolic BP in CKD stage G1–5 non–dialysis-dependent population and analyze antihypertensive and diuretic medication changes.

### Fatigue in CKD: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment [^dc13737b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fatigue is a commonly reported and debilitating symptom among patients with CKD, yet little is known about its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. Various measurement tools have been used in published studies to identify and quantify fatigue. These include several single-item measures embedded in longer questionnaires for assessing depression, quality of life, or symptom burden in patients with kidney disease. Approximately 70% of patients with CKD report fatigue, with up to 25% reporting severe symptoms. Patient-reported fatigue is associated with death, dialysis initiation, and hospitalization among individuals with CKD. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and likely includes decreased oxygen delivery and increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism, thus generating lactic acidosis in response to exertion; the effects of chronic metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia on skeletal muscle myocytes; protein-energy wasting and sarcopenia; and depression. Physical activity has been shown to improve fatigue in some small but promising trials, and so should be recommended, given the additional benefits of exercise. Targeting higher hemoglobin levels with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may improve fatigue, but potential adverse cardiovascular effects preclude their use to solely treat fatigue without the presence of another indication. Current guidelines recommend cautious individualization of hemoglobin targets for those at low cardiovascular risk who still experience fatigue or functional limitation despite a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dl. Sodium bicarbonate supplementation for the treatment of metabolic acidosis may also improve functional status. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not been consistently shown to improve fatigue in patients with kidney disease, but an ongoing trial will evaluate the effect of alternative antidepressant drug and behavioral activation therapy on fatigue in patients with CKD. Overall, more research is needed to further clarify underlying mechanisms of fatigue and identify effective, targeted treatments for patients with CKD.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^d1fe7e17]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

We review the growing clinical evidence that metabolic acidosis mediates chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and that treatment to increase the associated low serum bicarbonate (HCO 3) in CKD is disease-modifying.

Recent findings

Seven prospective studies of patients with wide ranges of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) and serum HCO 3 examined the effect on CKD of increasing serum HCO 3 using dietary acid reduction with either oral alkali (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate), a vegetarian diet very low in acid-producing protein (0.3 g/kg/day) supplemented with ketoanalogues or added base-producing fruits and vegetables. Clinical outcomes included slower kidney function decline (using eGFR measurements) and fewer patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that: treatment of metabolic acidosis for 2 years decreased the number of patients with at least a 40% eGFR decline, a validated surrogate for progression to end-stage kidney disease and across four studies, treatment to increase serum HCO 3 by 4–6.8 mEq/l in acidotic patients with CKD was associated with a ∼4 ml/min/1.73 m 2 reduction in the rate of eGFR decline over 6–24 months compared with controls.

Summary

Metabolic acidosis appears to enhance CKD progression and its treatment should be studied further as a potential disease-modifying intervention.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: subgroup analysis from a randomized, controlled trial [^4846095d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Current strategies for treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD include decreasing metabolic acid production through increasing base-producing dietary fruits and vegetables and neutralizing accumulated acid with alkali supplements such as sodium bicarbonate. Based on evidence that chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with increased protein catabolism, muscle wasting, uremic bone disease, chronic inflammation, impaired glucose homeostasis, impaired cardiac function, progression of CKD and increased mortality, the International Nephrology Clinical Practice guidelines: KDIGO recommends treating patients with CKD whose serum bicarbonate is < 22 mmol/L, and Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests that it is reasonable to maintain serum bicarbonate between 24 and 26 mmol/L. However, despite these guidelines, only a minority of patients are currently treated with alkali supplements. In the US-based prospective Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study, for example, only 2.7% of patients with a serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L and CKD were receiving treatment with oral alkali. Sodium bicarbonate treats metabolic acidosis by entering the systemic circulation to supply bicarbonate that neutralizes retained acid. However, there is an obligatory sodium load delivered that may be absolutely or relatively contraindicated in the many patients with CKD, especially those whose blood pressure is above target levels, have edema and/or have heart failure. Compared with patients without diabetes, the risk of heart failure in patients with diabetes is doubled and cardiovascular outcomes, hospitalization and prognosis are worse. Thus, patients with diabetes may have greater susceptibility to adverse consequences of excess sodium intake. The current KDOQI nutrition guideline for sodium intake is < 2.3 g/day and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association target is < 1.5 g/day. To increase serum bicarbonate by 3–4 mmol/L with sodium bicarbonate in an 80 kg individual, for example, requires 6–8 g/day of sodium bicarbonate, which has a sodium content of 1.7–2.2 g. The mechanism of action of veverimer represents an alternative strategy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in which acid is bound and removed from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to a net increase in serum bicarbonate. Because veverimer is not an ion-exchange resin, unwanted ions such as sodium are not introduced.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^5ee3c420]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We randomised 300 participants into the trial between 1 May 2013 and 28 February 2017. Figure 1 depicts the flow of participants through the trial; the mean length of follow-up per participant was 16.4 months (16.6 (SD 8.9) months in the bicarbonate arm (median 24, IQR 12 to 24 months) and 16.3 (SD 9.4) months in the placebo arm (median 24, IQR 6 to 24 months)). Data for the primary outcome analysis were available for 274 participants at baseline (140 in the bicarbonate arm and 134 in the placebo arm) and for 187 participants at 12 months (97 in the bicarbonate arm and 90 in the placebo arm). One hundred sixty-one participants completed the full 24-month follow-up period. Loss to follow-up was due to a combination of deaths and illness; most participants who commenced dialysis chose to withdraw from the trial due to the added burden of dialytic treatment, although this was not mandated by the protocol. Twenty-two participants had their follow-up truncated due to termination of the trial.

Baseline details for randomised participants in both arms of the trial are given in Table 1. Only four participants underwent the 3-month washout option prior to randomisation. Adherence by tablet count was moderate: 73% (95% CI 67 to 78) in the bicarbonate arm and 73% (95% CI 67 to 80) in the placebo arm. Forty-six of 152 participants in the bicarbonate arm had a serum bicarbonate concentration of < 22 mmol/L and were uptitrated at the 3-month visit, compared to 83/148 in the placebo arm. A modest but significant increase in serum bicarbonate concentration of 1.7 mmol/L (95% CI 1.0 to 2.4, p < 0.001) was seen in the intervention arm compared to placebo at 3 months; this difference attenuated with time and was no longer significant by 24 months, as shown in Fig. 2. During the course of the trial, 18 participants in the placebo group stopped taking study medication on the advice of the clinical team in order to start taking prescribed sodium bicarbonate. These individuals were retained in follow-up and analysed as per their initial randomised allocation.

### Correction of metabolic acidosis improves muscle mass and renal function in chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4: a randomized controlled trial [^7ec57351]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis (MA) is associated with a loss of muscle mass and faster deterioration of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A few single-centre randomized trials have reported favourable outcomes following correction of MA. Additional good quality evidence on the safety and efficacy of alkali supplementation is required in epidemiologically different patient subsets with CKD.

Methods

A single-centre, open-label, randomized, prospective parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of correction of MA on body composition and kidney function. A total of 188 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, with venous bicarbonate levels < 22 mEq/L were randomized. The intervention arm received standard care as per Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines along with oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation to maintain venous bicarbonate levels at 24–26 mEq/L, whereas the control group received standard care alone. The mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), lean body mass (LBM) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared between the groups at the end of 6months.

Results

The intervention arm showed a higher LBM {36.8 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) 36.5–37.1] versus 36 [35.7–36.4]; P = 0.002} and MAMC [22.9 cm (95% CI 22.8–23) versus 22.6 (22.5–22.7); P = 0.001] when compared with the control group. The GFR in the intervention arm was higher [32.74 mL/1.73m2 (95% CI 31.5–33.9) versus 28.2 (27–29.4); P ≤ 0.001]. A rapid decline in GFR was documented in 39 (41.5%) patients in the control arm and 19 (20.2%) patients in the intervention arm (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Alkali supplementation to increase venous bicarbonate levels to 24–26 mEq/L is associated with preservation of LBM and kidney function in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.

### Clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for older patients with chronic kidney disease and low-grade acidosis (BiCARB): a pragmatic randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^dbbffbff]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In our trial, oral bicarbonate produced only a modest increase in serum bicarbonate concentration relative to placebo; this difference was maximal at 3 months and converged with the placebo group by 24 months. Bicarbonate concentrations in the placebo group rose gradually over time, which again limited the contrast between the two groups; this may be due in part to the pragmatic nature of the trial design, where physicians were free to switch participants to bicarbonate therapy if this was felt to be clinically indicated. The effect seen in both recent systematic reviews was greater than that observed in the current trial, with a mean 3 mmol/L higher serum bicarbonate in the treatment arm compared to control by the end of follow-up; restricting analyses to 1-year follow-up gave similar results. It is likely that the combination of a modest dose of bicarbonate (in comparison to some other trials) and suboptimal adherence contributed to this finding, but as this dosing regimen reflects current UK practice, patients in the real world are likely to sustain similarly modest increases in serum bicarbonate concentrations. A recent dose-ranging pilot trial (the BASE trial) suggested that higher dose (approximately 5 g/day) of bicarbonate was more effective than lower dose (approximately 3 g/day) of bicarbonate in increasing serum bicarbonate concentrations in patients with CKD 3 or 4; the higher dose provided an additional 1.3-mmol/L increase in mean serum bicarbonate concentration compared to the lower dose. Most trials included in the systematic review used a 'treat-to-target' approach. This would allow participants with lower bicarbonate concentrations to receive higher doses but could also potentially increase adverse events. Although previous small trials have used such an approach successfully without evidence of significant harm, harms have not been well reported in bicarbonate trials to date, and our more comprehensive approach to adverse event reporting revealed an excess of events in the bicarbonate arm. Our ability to titrate doses to the levels used in some previous trials was limited; we made the decision at the design stage to limit titration to doubling of the dose at 3 months, which was performed only if serum bicarbonate concentrations were still < 22 mmol/L. Although this decision was taken to reflect the state of usual UK bicarbonate prescribing practice, practice is heterogeneous and higher doses of bicarbonate may have greater effects for some patients. In addition, for participants in the treatment group with only modest degrees of acidosis, only a small improvement in serum bicarbonate was required to cross this threshold, which limited the number of participants for whom a higher dose of bicarbonate was prescribed.

Fig. 3
Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome (Short Physical Performance Battery). Values are mean and 95% CI

Adjusted treatment effects for secondary outcomes are given in Table 2. A total of 66/300 (22%) of participants commenced dialysis or underwent renal transplantation during the trial, with no difference between the bicarbonate and placebo arms (33 vs 33; p = 1.0). Time to event analysis showed no significant difference in the risk of commencing renal replacement therapy (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.02; p = 0.43) (values greater than 1 indicate higher risk in the intervention arm), or for reaching a composite outcome of time to either doubling of serum creatinine, a 40% reduction in eGFR, or commencing renal replacement therapy (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.84; p = 0.53). More participants in the bicarbonate arm reported at least one fall than in the placebo arm but this did not reach significance (49 vs 39; p = 0.26); the incident rate in each arm was not significantly different (bicarbonate arm, 0.99 per year [95% CI 0.61 to 1.38]; placebo arm, 0.72 per year [95% CI 0.25 to 1.19]; p = 0.38). Median time to first fall amongst those who fell was shorter in the bicarbonate arm (130 days vs 194 days). Cox proportional hazards modelling of time to first fall, adjusted for age, sex and CKD category, showed a HR of 1.43, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.20, p = 0.09. Fragility fracture numbers were low: 5/152 in the bicarbonate arm and 2/148 in the placebo arm.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^109ae271]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — sodium assessment and salt substitution evidence highlights that data derive from studies using spot urine sodium measurements and there is current controversy about the accuracy of random "spot" urine specimens with potential increased risk of adverse health outcomes at the low-sodium intake range when assessed by this method; additional research is required in both sodium-intake assessment methodology in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to evaluate health impacts of very low-sodium intakes. Recent small, single-center trials of chronic oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo have not found changes in blood pressure (BP), raising the possibility that the anion associated with sodium intake may influence the BP response; future research is required to determine if relationships of sodium intake with BP are influenced by the accompanying anion. In the general population, potassium-containing salt substitutes have been demonstrated to lower BP, but persons with CKD have been systematically excluded from such trials; some, albeit not all, observational data in CKD populations demonstrate that higher potassium intake is associated with higher risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular (CV) disease, and whether potassium-containing salt substitutes have health benefits or unique risks in CKD requires future study.

### Recent evidence on the effect of treatment of metabolic acid on the progression of kidney disease [^ff25086e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Preclinical and epidemiological studies have shown an association between acidosis and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney fibrosis. This review discusses the recent trials evaluating the effect of treatment of metabolic acidosis on kidney outcomes.

Recent Findings

The emerging evidence suggests that bicarbonate treatment may slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of kidney failure. However, high-certainty evidence on the efficacy and safety of alkali therapy is still lacking. Ongoing studies are evaluating the effect of veverimer, a novel nonabsorbable polymer, on clinical kidney outcomes.

Summary

Recent studies indicate a potential benefit from reduction in acid load in patients with CKD. Whilst it is reasonable that clinicians institute acid-lowering interventions in CKD patients with acidosis, adequately powered trials are required to evaluate the benefit of correction of metabolic acidosis to delay kidney disease progression.

### Effect of bicarbonate on net acid excretion, blood pressure, and metabolism in patients with and without CKD: the acid base compensation in CKD study [^e4a510cf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Patients with CKD are at elevated risk of metabolic acidosis due to impaired net acid excretion (NAE). Identifying early markers of acidosis may guide prevention in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study compared NAE in participants with and without CKD, as well as the NAE, blood pressure (BP), and metabolomic response to bicarbonate supplementation.

Study Design

Randomized order, cross-over study with controlled feeding.

Setting & Participants

Participants consisted of 8 patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-59mL/min/1.73m 2 or 60-70mL/min/1.73m 2 with albuminuria) and 6 patients without CKD. All participants had baseline serum bicarbonate concentrations between 20 and 28 mEq/L; they did not have diabetes mellitus and did not use alkali supplements at baseline.

Intervention

Participants were fed a fixed-acid-load diet with bicarbonate supplementation (7 days) and with sodium chloride control (7 days) in a randomized order, cross-over fashion.

Outcomes

Urine NAE, 24-hour ambulatory BP, and 24-hour urine and plasma metabolomic profiles were measured after each period.

Results

During the control period, mean NAE was 28.3 ± 10.2 mEq/d overall without differences across groups (P = 0.5). Urine pH, ammonium, and citrate were significantly lower in CKD than in non-CKD (P < 0.05 for each). Bicarbonate supplementation reduced NAE and urine ammonium in the CKD group, increased urine pH in both groups (but more in patients with CKD than in those without), and increased; urine citrate in the CKD group (P < 0.2 for interaction for each). Metabolomic analysis revealed several urine organic anions were increased with bicarbonate in CKD, including 3-indoleacetate, citrate/isocitrate, and glutarate. BP was not significantly changed.

Limitations

Small sample size and short feeding duration.

Conclusions

Compared to patients without CKD, those with CKD had lower acid excretion in the form of ammonium but also lower base excretion such as citrate and other organic anions, a potential compensation to preserve acid-base homeostasis. In CKD, acid excretion decreased further, but base excretion (eg, citrate) increased in response to alkali. Urine citrate should be evaluated as an early and responsive marker of impaired acid-base homeostasis.

### Bicarbonate supplement restores urinary klotho excretion in chronic kidney disease: a pilot study [^44babe53]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We tested the hypothesis that correcting acidosis may improve urinary Klotho excretion and serum α-Klotho.

Design

This is a prospective, interventional, nonrandomized, open-label trial study. In this study setting, metabolic acidosis is commonly observed during chronic kidney disease (CKD). We reported a positive relationship between serum bicarbonate (Sbicar) and serum α-Klotho in these patients.

Subjects

The study involved 20 patients with a known kidney disease referred for renal checkup. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, CKD stage 3–5 non dialysis, Sbicar < 22 mmol/L, and not receiving bicarbonate supplementation.

Intervention

Patients were then prescribed 1 g of oral sodium bicarbonate 3 times per day for 4 weeks.

Main Outcome Measure

Patients were evaluated at two and 4 weeks by blood and urine measurements.

Results

Mean serum Klotho was 615 ± 287 pg/mL, and mean serum Sbicar was 19.3 ± 1.7 mmol/L at baseline. Sbicar increased from baseline at two (23.9 ± 2.9 mmol/L, P < .001) and 4 weeks (23.4 ± 1.9 mmol/L, P < .001). There was no change in serum Klotho at two (630 ± 333 mmol/L) and 4 weeks (632 ± 285 mmol/L). By contrast, urine Klotho/creatinine ratio, which was very low at baseline (34.6 ± 31.6 pg/mmoL), increased by 320% at two weeks (P < .005) and by 280% at 4 weeks (P < .01).

Conclusions

Correcting acidosis by oral administration of sodium bicarbonate rapidly increases the urine excretion of soluble α-Klotho in CKD patients. However, a 4-week bicarbonate treatment was not able to increase serum α-Klotho. A longer study may confirm this pilot observation and increase serum Klotho, which has been shown to exert a protective cardiovascular effect during CKD.

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^4fe0f72f]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This meta-analysis was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelinesand registered in the prospective register of systematic reviews database (registration number ID: CRD42023443212).

Search Strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library from their inception up to November 11, 2023, without restrictions regarding language or geographic locations. Detailed information is shown in.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Alkali therapy for CKD-related MA is typically delayed until serum total carbon dioxide drops below 22 mEq/L, leading to only 15% of patients with CKD receiving it, potentially overlooking those with subclinical acidosis who may benefit. Previous studies, show that patients with CKD with total carbon dioxide of 20–24 mEq/L can safely receive sodium bicarbonate, improving quadriceps strength and preserving GFR. Our study thus targets patients with CKD with bicarbonate levels under 24 mEq/L to address subclinical acidosis. Therefore, studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) Participants: adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CKD and MA, in which CKD was defined as persistently reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and MA was defined as a baseline serum bicarbonate level ≤ 24 mEq/L; (2) intervention: alkali therapy with oral sodium bicarbonate; (3) comparators: placebo, standard care (routine biochemical laboratory measurements with/without diet intervention suggested by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline), or those receiving rescue therapy; (4) outcomes: assessed one of the following outcomes: change in eGFR, systolic BP (SBP), the risk of hospitalization rate, all-cause mortality, CV event rates, body weight change, 24-hour urine sodium excretion rates, serum potassium, creatinine clearance, bicarbonate, albumin, calcium, phosphate, iPTH level, and mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included (1) trials that included animals or pregnant women; (2) research designs other than RCTs, such as protocols and conference abstracts; (3) trials evaluating interventions for MA other than sodium bicarbonate (such as veverimer); (4) those adopting other interventions as a control group (e.g. fruit and vegetable-based diet); (5) studies focusing on populations with dialysis-dependent kidney failure or kidney transplant recipients; (6) participants with serum bicarbonate level more than 24 mEq/L; or (7) those without explicitly mention MA.–

An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) met every 6 months to review unmasked reports. The DMC examined trial safety, data quality and study conduct and provided advice to the Sponsor, Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and funder on the appropriateness of continuing the trial. No interim efficacy analyses were planned or conducted. The independent TSC recommended closure of recruitment to the trial after 300 participants had been randomised, based on a review of declining recruitment rates and informed by revised sample size calculations that showed that a sample size of 300 had 87% power to detect a 1-point difference in the primary outcome of the short physical performance battery. The independent TSC also recommended that follow-up be truncated after the final 12-month (primary outcome) visit for the last participant to facilitate earlier dissemination of results. The decision to close the trial to further recruitment was made by the trial funder.

### Optimising acid-base balance in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a quality improvement initiative [^ddb6b4fa]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Although the clinical relevance of serum bicarbonate levels in patients with CKD has recently been debated, correction of metabolic acidosis still features in both national and international CKD guidelines as an area for consideration by nephrologists. Multiple intervention studies, though limited by small sample sizes, have consistently demonstrated that maintaining serum bicarbonate levels within the normal physiological range is associated with slower decline in kidney function and reduced likelihood of progression to end-stage renal failure. Furthermore, correction of metabolic acidosis contributes to the prevention of other CKD complications, including hyperkalaemiaand mineral bone disorders. A recent retrospective observational study of over 24 000 patients with CKD stages 3–5 in the USA again demonstrated that increasing serum bicarbonate with medication was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of CKD progression. Given the size and scope of this study, it has added further weight to the rationale for targeting metabolic acidosis as a modifiable risk factor in CKD management.

Sodium bicarbonate remains the most commonly used pharmacological agent for this purpose. It is affordable, widely available and has a good safety profile. Studies have shown no significant increase in gastrointestinal disorders compared with placebo in controlled settings. However, in clinical practice, some patients do report gastrointestinal side effects, particularly bloating, abdominal pain and nausea. A gastro-resistant formulation of sodium bicarbonate is now available in the UK, which offers an alternative for patients who are unable to tolerate standard preparations.

The UK Renal Registry collects national-level data on serum bicarbonate levels for patients on all forms of dialysis and with a kidney transplant. However, to our knowledge, there is no national or Midlands region-level data collection for CKD patients not on RRT. A brief review of the published literature identified no recently published audits or QI projects on optimising serum bicarbonate levels in adults not yet on RRT. It is possible that some units may be collecting this data locally but have not disseminated outcomes or formalised efforts to improve practice. Consequently, there is limited shared knowledge on effective strategies for addressing metabolic acidosis in this patient group. Given this knowledge gap and the existing clinical evidence supporting the correction of serum bicarbonate levels in advanced CKD, we felt it was both timely and necessary to explore potential interventions in our centre.

### Effect of dietary protein intake on serum total CO ₂ concentration in chronic kidney disease: modification of diet in renal disease study findings [^cbc8e6b2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but whether serum bicarbonate concentration is influenced by variations in dietary protein intake is unknown. For assessing the effect of diet, data that were collected in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study were used. In this study, patients with CKD were enrolled into a baseline period, then randomly assigned to follow either a low- or a usual-protein diet (study A, entry GFR 25 to 55 ml/min) or a low- or very low-protein diet, the latter supplemented with ketoanalogs of amino acids (study B, entry GFR 13 to 24 ml/min). Serum [total CO2] and estimated protein intake (EPI) were assessed at entry (n = 1676) and again at 1 yr after randomization, controlling for changes in GFR and other key covariates (n = 723). At entry, serum [total CO2] was inversely related to EPI (1.0 mEq/L lower mean serum [total CO2]/g per kg body wt increase in protein intake/d; P = 0.009). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the reduction in mean EPI in the low-protein group as compared with the usual-protein group (0.41 g/kg body wt per d) was independently associated with a 0.9-mEq/L increase in serum [total CO2], after adjustment for covariates (P < 0.001). No such effect was evident in study B, in which the very low-protein diet group received dietary supplements. Serum [total CO2] is inversely correlated with dietary protein intake in patients with CKD. A reduction in protein intake results in an increase in serum [total CO2].

### Sodium bicarbonate treatment and clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis: a meta-analysis [^d91a1f30]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Advanced CKD impairs the ability to excrete acid loads, leading to acid retention and metabolic acidosis (MA).MA is linked with several complications, including CKD progression, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and an increased risk of mortality.

Sodium bicarbonate has emerged as a therapeutic option for MA in CKD populations, with several studies suggesting its clinical benefits in preventing kidney function deterioration. – However, some studies have not identified the benefits of sodium bicarbonate in slowing eGFR decline. Previous research indicated improved eGFR with sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD with low to normal bicarbonate levels, but its effects in patients with MA have not been specifically studied, leaving its role in CKD with concurrent MA controversial. In addition, there is currently no clear evidence regarding the effects of sodium bicarbonate on serum albumin, muscle mass, calcium and phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in CKD populations with MA.

To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis to provide definitive evidence concerning the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate on prognostic markers and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD and MA.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can accelerate CKD progression, bone demineralization and muscle protein catabolism;
patients with diabetes are prone to metabolic acidosis and functional limitations; and
few interventions for patients with diabetes and CKD have successfully improved quality of life or physical functioning.

What this study adds?

Veverimer effectively treated metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetes and CKD; and
veverimer significantly improved how patients with diabetes and CKD felt and functioned.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

This study shows that treatment of metabolic acidosis is among the very few clinical interventions other than kidney replacement therapy that improves how patients with CKD feel and function. As a result, clinicians might more aggressively look for and treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, a complication that is highly under-treated presently; and
improved physical function from treating metabolic acidosis holds promise to allow patients with CKD to better perform activities of daily living and increase their employability, a recognition that might encourage policy makers to incentivize treatment of metabolic acidosis.

### Correction of metabolic acidosis improves insulin resistance in chronic kidney disease [^c0d4ab8d]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In patients of treatment group assuming Biguanides (45 subjects), bicarbonate administration was higher (not significant) compared to other oral antidiabetic drugs (0.79 ± 0.4 mmol/kg).

Although further work is needed to validate these results in diabetic as well as non-diabetic CKD patients, the clinical relevance of these findings should be evaluated in light of the prevalence of insulin resistance and its associated complications such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia; the widespread use of sodium bicarbonate or alkali supplementation, low protein or vegetarian diet for CKD care as well as the safety and relative inexpensiveness of the treatment tested. Aside of confirming the link of bicarbonate and insulin resistance, current results also provide with some guidance for CKD patient care.

Our analyses suffer of a few limitations worth noting. We investigated the relationship of insulin sensitivity and metabolic acidosis in a subgroup of patients (diabetic patients on oral antidiabetic medications) randomized into the Use of Bicarbonate in Chronic Renal Insufficiency (UBI) study (NCT NCT01640119). This study aims at testing the impact of alkali administration and acidosis correction in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients on renal function decline. Although we analyzed a subgroup of patients, the analyses were carried out in the first 145 consecutive diabetic patients who completed at least 1 year of follow-up. This selection criterion as well as the random assignment to treatment at study inception are independent of the investigators' beliefs and influences and we can argue that current findings are similar to a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The well balance of demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between groups, further corroborates this point. No power assumption or sample size calculation was performed in light of the exploratory nature of these analyses and the lack of similar data in this domain. Insulin resistance is calculated rather than measured. However, the HOMA test is widely accepted as a reliable and reproducible tool to assess insulin sensitivity in clinical and epidemiological studies.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^90e98718]. AND (2020). High credibility.

High fruit and vegetable dietary pattern in CKD stages 3–4 — eGFR, body weight, and blood pressure: In adults with stages 3–4 CKD, fruits and vegetables dietary pattern has mixed effects/uncertain effects on eGFR compared with oral bicarbonate supplementation. For body weight, the fruit and vegetable dietary pattern yielded greater net body weight loss than both oral bicarbonate and standard care groups (p-value < 0.05) and lower body weight at 1-year follow up (p < 0.01). (MD = - 5.09 kg, 95% CI -7.73, -2.44; I2 = 56%). Regarding blood pressure (BP), three studies (2 RCT, 1 NRCT) reported that increased fruit and vegetable intake had a significant effect on lowering systolic BP compared to oral bicarbonate supplementation.

### Impact of serum bicarbonate levels on muscle mass and kidney function in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients [^3a9a27a0]. American Journal of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of metabolic acidosis to target the higher serum bicarbonate level than guideline recommendation may downregulate muscle protein degradation and improve renal function among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We conducted a study to test the effects of increased serum bicarbonate level on muscle parameters, nutrition, and renal function in pre-dialysis CKD patients.

Methods

This was a randomized, controlled study. CKD stage 3–4 patients with serum HCO3- < 22 mEq/L were randomized to either receive oral sodium bicarbonate with high target bicarbonate level of 25 ± 1 or standard level of 22 ± 1 mEq/L as control group using protocol-based titration of dosage adjustment. The changes of muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength by hand grip dynamometer, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration equation, nutritional markers, and muscle-related biomarkers were determined. Data at baseline and after 4 months of sodium bicarbonate supplementation were compared between groups using Student t test or chi-square test as appropriate.

Results

Forty-two patients completed the study (n = 21 per group). The mean age and eGFR were 61.2 ± 9.8 years and 32.4 ± 14.1 mL/min respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels at baseline were 21.0 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Baseline data including sex, diabetes, serum bicarbonate level, creatinine, and blood pressure were similar. After 4 months of treatment, the average serum bicarbonate levels in both groups were 24.0 ± 1.4 and 20.7 ± 2.3 mEq/L (p < 0.001). Both BIA-derived total-body muscle mass and appendicular lean balance were increased at 4 months in the higher bicarbonate group (26.0 ± 5.3 to 26.7 ± 5.5 kg, p = 0.04 and 19.8 ± 4.1 to 20.7 ± 4.4 kg, p = 0.06, respectively) despite comparable body weight and protein intake. Patients in the high bicarbonate group had a significant reduction of plasma myostatin levels, a surrogate of muscle degradation, at the study exit after adjusting for baseline values (-3,137.8; 95% CI -6,235.3 to -40.4 pg/mL, p = 0.04), but unaltered insulin-like growth factor-1 level, as the mediator of muscle cell growth, (141 [106–156] to 110 [87–144] ng/mL, p = 0.13) compared to the control group. Muscle strength, eGFR as well as serum prealbumin were not significantly different between 2 groups (p > 0.05). Neither worsening hypertension nor congestive heart failure was found throughout the study.

Conclusion

Bicarbonate supplementation to achieve the serum level ∼24 mEq/L demonstrates better muscle mass preservation in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. The impact of alkaline therapy on renal function may require a longer period of study.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^685ef2c2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The relationship between decreasing serum HCO 3 levels and worsening clinical outcomes appears to be a continuum. As serum HCO 3 decreases from the normal range in patients with CKD, generally considered as 22–29 mEq/l, the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or mortality increases compared to patients with CKD but without metabolic acidosis. Indeed, observational studies associate serum HCO 3 with kidney disease progression outcomes and show that each 1 mEq/l increase in serum HCO 3 from levels below the normal range reduces the risk of kidney outcomes [e.g. initiation of dialysis, 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)] by 3–8%. Interestingly, risk reduction continues for serum HCO 3 increases within the low normal range. Findings from these observational studies are supported by recent prospective interventional studies that show that treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD stage 3–5 patients can slow the rate of kidney function decline. In addition, provision of sodium bicarbonate or a diet rich in base-producing fruits and vegetables to CKD stage 3 patients with serum HCO 3 in the low normal range (22–24 mEq/l) also slowed the rate of kidney function decline. Post hoc analysis of treatment effect in CKD stage 3–5 patients with overt metabolic acidosis (serum HCO 3 < 22 mEq/l) showed that fewer patients treated with oral alkali supplementation, in comparison to untreated patients, reached at least 40% eGFR reduction, an endpoint recognized to be a validated surrogate endpoint for ESKD. Thus, data from these prospective studies suggest the intriguing possibility that interventions that increase or normalize serum HCO 3 in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis or low normal serum HCO 3 may further slow deterioration of the diseased kidney.
