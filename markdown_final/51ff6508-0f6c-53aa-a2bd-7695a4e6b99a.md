## Question

Can I give Lasix to a patient who is in CHF exacerbation but have acute kidney injury

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether furosemide (Lasix) can be given to a patient with acute decompensated heart failure who also has acute kidney injury, and how to dose and monitor safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the cardiorenal physiology. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about furosemide in renal impairment. Next, I will review guideline positions on diuretics in AKI and in acute heart failure. After that, I need to examine randomized and observational evidence on efficacy and safety, including dose-response and AKI outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated approach to dosing, monitoring, and when to escalate or avoid therapy, making sure I double-check key thresholds and caveats along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: acute decompensated heart failure with congestion is the indication for loop diuretics, and AKI in this setting often reflects hemodynamic congestion rather than primary tubular injury, so decongestion can paradoxically improve renal perfusion even if creatinine transiently rises, which reframes how we interpret "worsening renal function" during diuresis [^11355ghS] [^111bnCzv] [^117W2pND].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory position before jumping ahead. The FDA labeling indicates furosemide for edema associated with congestive heart failure and for renal disease, and it advises caution with impaired renal function and dose adjustment, but it does not list AKI as a contraindication, which supports that use is permissible with vigilance rather than prohibited outright [^116upV7c] [^113RFydL] [^115wfWb3].

> Next, I should review guidelines. KDIGO advises against using diuretics to treat AKI itself, but allows diuretics for volume overload management, which fits this scenario of CHF congestion with AKI. Contemporary heart failure guidance emphasizes aggressive decongestion with loop diuretics as first-line in ADHF, accepting that creatinine may rise if congestion resolves, and recommends structured dosing and monitoring rather than withholding therapy [^113CGoBy] [^114LP4C4] [^114DeRrU] [^113Z49sd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about harm. I need to check the evidence on safety signals. Observational and trial data show that higher loop diuretic doses correlate with transient creatinine rises, yet patients who achieve adequate decongestion despite AKI have similar or better long-term outcomes than those who remain congested, and biomarker studies suggest these creatinine increases are not due to tubular injury, supporting a hemodynamic mechanism rather than nephrotoxicity [^112suZwJ] [^113Y5EMV] [^112AMcuK] [^11355ghS].

> I will now examine dosing strategy and diuretic responsiveness. For patients already on oral loop diuretics, converting to IV at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily oral dose is reasonable. For diuretic-naïve patients, 40–80 mg IV daily is typical, with escalation based on response. Urine sodium measured about 2 hours after dosing helps gauge responsiveness, with values below 50 mEq/L indicating poor response and prompting dose or strategy changes. I should double-check that this aligns with DOSE and ACC guidance, which it does [^114DeRrU] [^113Z49sd].

> But wait, what if the patient is diuretic resistant or has severe AKI? I need to ensure I escalate thoughtfully. Sequential nephron blockade with a thiazide-type agent can overcome resistance, and in truly refractory cases with persistent congestion, ultrafiltration is a guideline-supported option. I should confirm that these are endorsed strategies in HF and cardiorenal syndrome contexts, which they are [^1127g8rv] [^115RN2Sg] [^113Y5EMV].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety thresholds. I need to check electrolytes and renal function frequently during active diuresis, watch for hypokalemia and hyponatremia, and avoid excessive daily diuretic totals that approach ototoxic ranges. High-dose furosemide above about 1 g/day carries increased ototoxic risk, and continuous infusions above roughly 0.5 mg/kg/hr have been linked to hearing loss, so I should cap doses and prefer divided boluses when possible, while still prioritizing decongestion [^113DKeNX] [^112rGfc5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought continuous infusion might be clearly superior for AKI risk mitigation, but I should double-check that. The DOSE trial and a recent Cochrane review do not show outcome advantages for continuous infusion over bolus, and some data suggest more electrolyte disturbances with continuous therapy; therefore, I should individualize the route and not assume continuous infusion is safer by default, especially in the setting of AKI where close monitoring is key [^111vvwQD] [^115MJc1J] [^113zZnDw].

> I should confirm absolute contraindications and when to hold. Anuria is a contraindication to furosemide, and in hypotension or suspected hypovolemia, I need to correct volume status before diuresis to avoid worsening renal perfusion. Likewise, if the AKI phenotype suggests non-congestive tubular injury rather than cardiorenal hemodynamics, I should pause aggressive diuresis and address the underlying cause instead [^113RFydL] [^116VG857] [^111bnCzv].

> Putting this together, yes, furosemide can be given to a patient with CHF exacerbation and concurrent AKI when the AKI is likely hemodynamic and congestion is present, because relieving venous congestion can improve renal perfusion and outcomes despite transient creatinine rises. I need to start at an appropriate IV dose based on prior exposure, titrate to effect using urine sodium to judge response, monitor closely for electrolytes and volume shifts, and escalate to combination therapy or ultrafiltration if resistance emerges, while avoiding use in anuria and correcting hypovolemia first [^114DeRrU] [^113Z49sd] [^113CGoBy] [^113Y5EMV].

---

In select cases, **furosemide can be used cautiously** in CHF exacerbation with AKI when there is clear volume overload and no signs of hypovolemia or shock [^113CGoBy]. Use the **lowest effective dose**, monitor renal function and electrolytes closely, and adjust therapy if creatinine rises > 50% or if oliguria develops. Avoid furosemide in anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, or hypotension, and consider alternatives such as ultrafiltration if diuretic resistance or worsening renal function occurs [^113Y5EMV].

---

## Clinical considerations and risks

- **Worsening renal function**: Furosemide can cause prerenal azotemia by reducing intravascular volume, especially in AKI [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis are common and can worsen cardiac arrhythmias [^112rGfc5].

- **Hypotension**: Excessive diuresis can cause hypotension, reducing renal perfusion and aggravating AKI [^112rGfc5].

- **Ototoxicity**: High doses, especially with rapid IV push, can cause hearing loss, particularly in renal impairment [^113ZdrML].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **KDIGO guidelines**: Diuretics are not recommended to treat AKI itself, but may be used to manage volume overload [^113CGoBy] [^114LP4C4].

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: Loop diuretics are first-line for decongestion in acute heart failure, with dosing individualized and titrated to effect [^114DeRrU] [^113Z49sd].

- **ESC guidelines**: Emphasize careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes during diuretic therapy in acute heart failure [^115RN2Sg].

---

## Clinical scenarios where furosemide may be beneficial

Furosemide may be beneficial in **volume overload** — when pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, or ascites are present — and in **diuretic-responsive AKI**, where the AKI is primarily due to congestion rather than intrinsic renal injury [^11355ghS] [^117W2pND].

---

## Clinical scenarios where furosemide should be avoided

- **Anuria**: Absolute contraindication [^113RFydL].

- **Severe electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, or metabolic alkalosis.

- **Hypotension**: Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or signs of shock.

- **Severe renal impairment**: Creatinine > 3 mg/dL or eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

- **Ultrafiltration**: For diuretic-resistant congestion or severe renal impairment [^116CqBdi].

- **Vasodilators**: Nitrates or nitroprusside to reduce preload and afterload [^117CUErr].

- **Inotropes**: Dobutamine or milrinone for low cardiac output states [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and safety measures

- **Renal function**: Monitor serum creatinine and eGFR daily.

- **Electrolytes**: Monitor potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate regularly.

- **Volume status**: Assess clinically for signs of hypovolemia or ongoing congestion.

- **Urine output**: Monitor closely; oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h) warrants reassessment.

---

## Practical dosing recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dose** | **Route** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild congestion with AKI | 20–40 mg | IV bolus | Once daily |
| Moderate congestion with AKI | 40–80 mg | IV bolus | Every 12 hours |
| Severe congestion or diuretic resistance | 80–120 mg | IV bolus or continuous infusion | Every 8–12 hours or 5–10 mg/h |
| Diuretic resistance | Add thiazide (e.g. metolazone) | Oral | Daily |

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision-making

Furosemide can be used cautiously in CHF exacerbation with AKI when there is clear volume overload and no contraindications. Use the **lowest effective dose**, monitor renal function and electrolytes closely, and adjust therapy if creatinine rises > 50% or if oliguria develops. Avoid furosemide in anuria, severe electrolyte disturbances, or hypotension, and consider alternatives such as ultrafiltration if diuretic resistance or worsening renal function occurs [^113CGoBy] [^116CqBdi].

### Furosemide (Lasix) [^115wfWb3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Controlled clinical studies of LASIX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function (s ee PRECAUTIONS: General and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

WARNING

LASIX (furosemide) is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required and dose and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (s ee DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Question Among hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury, do diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations sent by a kidney action team through the electronic health record prevent the primary outcome of worsening kidney injury stage, dialysis, or mortality. Findings In this randomized clinical trial involving 4003 patients hospitalized with acute kidney injury, the intervention did not reduce the primary outcome compared with usual care, tailored to individual patients presenting with AKI, would improve clinical outcomes of worsening kidney function and mortality. We excluded patients with kidney failure undergoing dialysis; stage 5 chronic kidney disease; admission creatinine levels higher than 4 mg/dL; solid organ transplant; and hospice or comfort measures only and those with emergency nephrology consult criteria defined as serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L or higher, acute ingestion of dialyzable toxins, refractory volume overload, metabolic acidosis with pH lower than 7. 15 despite ventilatory support, blood urea nitrogen higher than 150 mg/dL, a prior nephrology consult, or receipt of kidney replacement therapy during the same admission. However, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors could be recommended for discontinuation for patients with hyperkalemia or hypotension.

During individual orientation to KAT, emphasis was made on applying caution when making any volume-targeted recommendations because the EHR review did not allow for a physical examination. KAT members were advised to consider recent chest radiographs, recent echocardiograms, vital signs, weight trend, and fluid intake and output data prior to making any volume-targeted recommendations. Second, although discontinuing and dose-adjusting medications was more common in the intervention group, about half of these changes were recommended to avoid extrarenal medication toxicity in the setting of reduced glomerular filtration rate rather than to mitigate the risk of nephrotoxic exposure. Nevertheless, the rate of recommendations to change or discontinue medications was quite high. This underscores challenges of managing polypharmacy in the setting of AKI.

Use of intravenous furosemide rather than oral administration in acute decompensated congestive cardiac failure is universally recommended in international guidelines. We argue that this recommendation is not supported by the existing evidence, and suggest that trials should be performed to determine whether larger doses of oral furosemide should be prescribed prior to an IV switch. This could reduce length of hospital admissions and allow for more patients to be managed in the primary care setting.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Edema

LASIX is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. LASIX is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Hypertension

Oral LASIX may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with LASIX alone.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^114GBUa1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with acute heart failure (AHF), the risk of death or rehospitalization within 60 days from admission ranges from 30 to 60%, depending on the population studied. The symptoms that drive hospital admission are linked to congestion, and loop diuretics are the most common initial therapeutic approach (used in 90% of cases). These agents promptly improve symptoms and have been shown to reduce dyspnea scores and peripheral edema. However, loop diuretics have been associated with increased rates of mortality and readmission in a graded fashion with cumulative dose and with continuous infusions. It is unclear whether this association is due to confounding by indication or whether adverse events lead to clinically meaningful outcomes accounting for these observations. In this context, neither European Society of Cardiology nor American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines provide any specific recommendation regarding starting and maintaining dosage, oral or intravenous infusion, and time course of treatment. Thus, despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs in providing decongestion and symptomatic improvement, several questions remain to be answered about the optimal approach in any given patient providing diuresis and decongestion but not tipping the balance leading to acute kidney injury (AKI), electrolyte disturbances, and worse outcomes.

General

Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. As with any effective diuretic, electrolyte depletion may occur during LASIX therapy, especially in patients receiving higher doses and a restricted salt intake. Hypokalemia may develop with LASIX, especially with brisk diuresis, inadequate oral electrolyte intake, when cirrhosis is present, or during concomitant use of corticosteroids, ACTH, licorice in large amounts, or prolonged use of laxatives. Digitalis therapy may exaggerate metabolic effects of hypokalemia, especially myocardial effects.

All patients receiving LASIX therapy should be observed for these signs or symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance (hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia): dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests (with abnormalities of the fasting and 2-hour postprandial sugar) have been observed, and rarely, precipitation of diabetes mellitus has been reported.

In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. Thus, these patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment.

In patients at high risk for radiocontrast nephropathy, LASIX can lead to a higher incidence of deterioration in renal function after receiving radiocontrast compared to high-risk patients who received only intravenous hydration prior to receiving radiocontrast.

In patients with hypoproteinemia (e.g., associated with nephrotic syndrome), the effect of LASIX may be weakened and its ototoxicity potentiated.

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated.

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may also be allergic to LASIX. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^111vvwQD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation — Acute Heart failure) trial provided an experimental model for investigating worsening renal function [defined as ≥ 20% decrease in estimated GFR (eGFR)] during aggressive diuretic therapy for decompensated heart failure as the trial protocol stipulated use of high-dose loop diuretics. Ahmad et al. observed that in 283 patients on the ROSE-AHF trial who received a median dose of 560 mg IV furosemide [interquartile range (IQR) 300–815 mg], inducing a urine output of 8425 mL (IQR 6341–10, 528 mL) over the 72-h intervention period, worsening renal function occurred in 21.2% of population and was not associated with rise in renal tubular injury biomarkers (NGAL, NAG or KIM-1). In fact, increases in NGAL, NAG and KIM-1 were associated with improved survival.

Pharmacological decongection therapy

Loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide and torsemide acting at the level of loop of Henle by inhibiting the sodium, potassium, chloride cotransporter remain the mainstay of pharmacological therapy for ADHF, administered orally or intravenously [39, 40]. Felker et al. investigated the difference between intermittent and continuous administration of intravenous loop diuretics as well as comparing high-dose versus low-dose diuretics in ADHF in a randomized controlled trial of 308 patients. It was concluded that there was no difference in the global assesment of symptoms and renal function across the two groups, nor was a change noted with high-dose versus low-dose diuretic use. The use of high-dose diuretics was associated with more effective diuresis but with a transient worsening of renal function.

### Diuretic response in acute heart failure-pathophysiology, evaluation, and therapy [^116hQNS3]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2015). Medium credibility.

The administration of loop diuretics to achieve decongestion is the cornerstone of therapy for acute heart failure. Unfortunately, impaired response to diuretics is common in these patients and associated with adverse outcomes. Diuretic resistance is thought to result from a complex interplay between cardiac and renal dysfunction, and specific renal adaptation and escape mechanisms, such as neurohormonal activation and the braking phenomenon. However, our understanding of diuretic response in patients with acute heart failure is still limited and a uniform definition is lacking. Three objective methods to evaluate diuretic response have been introduced, which all suggest that diuretic response should be determined based on the effect of diuretic dose administered. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome diuretic resistance, including combination therapy and ultrafiltration, but prospective studies in patients who are truly unresponsive to diuretics are lacking. An enhanced understanding of diuretic response should ultimately lead to an improved, individualized approach to treating patients with acute heart failure.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^1145gCMA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Current goals in the acute treatment of heart failure are focused on pulmonary and systemic decongestion with loop diuretics as the cornerstone of therapy. Despite rapid relief of symptoms in patients with acute decompensated heart failure, after intravenous use of loop diuretics, the use of these agents has been consistently associated with adverse events, including hypokalemia, azotemia, hypotension, and increased mortality. Two recent randomized trials have shown that continuous infusions of loop diuretics did not offer benefit but were associated with adverse events, including hyponatremia, prolonged hospital stay, and increased rate of readmissions. This is probably due to the limitations of congestion evaluation as well as to the deleterious effects linked to drug administration, particularly at higher dosage. The impaired renal function often associated with this treatment is not extensively explored and could deserve more specific studies. Several questions remain to be answered about the best diuretic modality administration, global clinical impact during acute and post-discharge period, and the role of renal function deterioration during treatment. Thus, if loop diuretics are a necessary part of the treatment for acute heart failure, then there must be an approach that allows personalization of therapy for optimal benefit and avoidance of adverse events.

### Benefits and risks of furosemide in acute kidney injury [^1159zCND]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is frequently used in different stages of acute kidney injury, but its clinical roles remain uncertain. This review summarises the pharmacology of furosemide, its potential uses and side effects, and the evidence of its efficacy. Furosemide is actively secreted by the proximal tubules into the urine before reaching its site of action at the ascending limb of loop of Henle. It is the urinary concentrations of furosemide that determine its diuretic effect. The severity of acute kidney injury has a significant effect on the diuretic response to furosemide; a good 'urinary response' may be considered as a 'proxy' for having some residual renal function. The current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with acute kidney injury. In patients with acute lung injury without haemodynamic instability, furosemide may be useful in achieving fluid balance to facilitate mechanical ventilation according to the lung-protective ventilation strategy.

### Derivation and validation of a prediction score for acute kidney injury secondary to acute myocardial infarction in Chinese patients [^1117RoDk]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we have confirmed that larger dosage of intravenous loop diuretics were the cause of AKI. The risk of AKI in patients with intravenous furosemide dosage ≥ 60 mg/d was 2.9-fold higher than those patients with < 60 mg/d. We analyzed the data of 1010 patients with acute heart failure and acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, and found that the risk of AKI in patients with intravenous furosemide dosage ≥ 80 mg/d and ≥ 120 mg/d was nearly 1.96- and 5.06-fold higher than those with < 80 mg/d. Although Use of loop diuretics can reduce venous congestion and increase renal blood flow, larger dosage might also reduce circulating blood volume, decrease the renal blood flow, activate the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system, and increase the peripheral vascular resistance, thereby lead to a decreased renal function. Therefore, the use of diuretics is a double-edged sword, and inappropriate use of larger dosage can lead to renal damage.

### Acute kidney injury in acute heart failure-when to worry and when not to worry? [^11355ghS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Acute kidney injury is common in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. It is more common in patients with acute heart failure who suffer from chronic kidney disease. Worsening renal function is often defined as a rise in serum creatinine of more than 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol/L) which, by definition, is acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 1. Perhaps the term AKI is more appropriate than worsening renal function as it is used universally by nephrologists, internists and other medical practitioners. In health, the heart and the kidney support each other to maintain the body's homeostasis. In disease, the heart and the kidney can adversely affect each other's function, causing further clinical deterioration. In patients presenting with acute heart failure and fluid overload, therapy with diuretics for decongestion often causes a rise in serum creatinine and AKI. However, in the longer term the decongestion improves survival and prevents hospital admissions despite rising serum creatinine and AKI. It is important to realize that renal venous congestion due to increased right-sided heart pressures in acute heart failure is a major cause of kidney dysfunction and hence decongestion therapy improves kidney function in the longer term. This review provides a perspective on the acceptable AKI with decongestion therapy, which is associated with improved survival, as opposed to AKI due to tubular injury related to sepsis or nephrotoxic drugs, which is associated with poor survival.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure [^115MJc1J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults.

Search Methods

We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I² = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I² = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I² = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I² = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.

### Study details | The furosemide stress test, electrolytes… [^115UtY5w]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

The Furosemide Stress Test, Electrolytes Response and Renal Index in Critically Ill PatientsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The acute kidney injury is a common clinical syndrome in critically ill patients, occurring in up of 60% of the patients, and almost 40% of these patients will die within 90 days. Between 5% to 10% of the patients with AKI requires renal replacement therapy and only 30% will be alive after 5 years. The most common reported contributing factors to AKI were sepsis, major surgery, cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia and potentially related drugs. Although the AKI has been classically defined as an abrupt and sustained decrease in renal function and is commonly assessed on serum creatinine rise and/or fall in urine output there are not clear cutoffs for the diagnosis. Unfortunately the changes in these two parameters are poor predicting of AKI in critically ill patients.

In the recent years several renal biomarkers have been proposed to accurately detect acute tubular injury before serum creatinine changes with possible improvement in the outcome; however the evidence was quite low. Because the majority of early AKI are related to an acute tubular injury, it has been suggested to evaluate the tubular function reserve by a bolus of furosemide. Specially a relatively intact kidney, with preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate and tubular function, should respond to furosemide with a quick diuresis, whereas tubular injury can be associated with urine output that is relatively preserved at baseline, but that fails to significantly augment with a diuretic challenge. In one mixed study and in one randomized trial in critically ill patients admitted in intensive care with mild AKI, the furosemide stress test was able to predict the progression to severe AKI.

Furthermore also the response to electrolyte excretion should predict the possible presence of AKI. Although the physiological and clinical significance of RI is still debated because is related to the resistance and compliance of the renal vessels and to the central hemodynamic, previous studies have shown the utility of RI to predict both the occurrence and the reversibility of AKI. Aim of the present study is to compare the response to furosemide stress test in term in diuresis and electrolytes and of the renal index in mechanically ventilated patients at admission and after 3 days in patients with and without the presence of AKI.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^115BtgFz]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Pulmonary and systemic congestion are inextricably linked to renal function. Use of loop diuretics is clearly playing a role in decongestion but at the same time is probably precipitating AKI and type 1 cardiorenal syndromes in patients at risk for worsened renal function and poor outcomes. Future research using advanced tools and personalized approaches for optimal outcomes is needed. Broad applications of high-dose or continuous infusion of loop diuretics or adjunctive use of inotropic and new vasoactive therapies have not been associated with improved outcomes. We propose an algorithm including a metric measurement of decongestion with concomitant evaluation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity and renal dysfunction mechanisms. This approach would allow a better AHF treatment by actualizing the integrated actors of the cardio-renal axis.

Multiple studies indicate that it is venous congestion rather than reduced cardiac output that drives the detrimental interplay of above factors leading to development of cardiorenal syndrome. Hence adequate decongestion is the mainstay of management, but this is complicated by the risk of worsening renal function with diuretic use due to reduced intraglomerular pressure and consequent increased neurohormonal activity.

### Efficacy of intravenous furosemide versus a novel, pH-neutral furosemide formulation administered subcutaneously in outpatients with worsening heart Failure [^113f8Z7V]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the efficacy and safety of a novel, pH-neutral formulation of furosemide administered subcutaneously (SC) for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (HF).

Background

Congestion requiring intravenous (IV) administration of a diuretic agent is the main reason patients with HF present for acute medical care.

Methods

Outpatients presenting with decompensated HF were randomized to receive a single SC or IV dose of furosemide. Primary outcome was 6-h urine output, and secondary outcomes were weight change, natriuresis, and adverse events.

Results

Forty-one patients were randomized: 19 were treated with IV (mean dose: 123 ± 47 mg) and 21 with SC furosemide (fixed dose of 80 mg over 5 h). The 6-h urine output in the IV group was not significantly different from that in the SC furosemide group (median IV: 1,425 ml; interquartile range [IQR]: 1,075 to 1,950 ml; vs. median SC: 1,350 ml; IQR: 900 to 1,900 ml; p = 0.84). Additionally, mean weight loss was not significantly different (-1.5 ± 1.1 kg in the IV group vs. -1.5 ± 1.2 kg in the SC group; p = 0.95). Hourly urine output was significantly higher in the IV group at hour 2 (425 mL in the IV group vs. 250 mL in the SC group; p = 0.02) and higher in the SC group at hour 6 (125 ml, IV group vs. 325 ml, SC group; p = 0.005). Natriuresis was higher in the SC group (IV: 7.3 ± 35.3 mEq/l vs. SC: 32.8 ± 43.6 mEq/l; p = 0.05). There was no worsening renal function, ototoxicity, or skin irritation with either formulation. Thirty-day hospitalization rates were similar.

Conclusions

In this phase II trial, we did not identify significant differences between urine output obtained with pH-neutral furosemide administered SC and that obtained by IV. This method of decongestion may allow treatment at home and reduced HF resources and warrants further investigation. (Sub-Q Versus IV Furosemide in Acute Heart Failure; NCT02579057).

DECONGESTION THERAPY

Decongestion options include use of oral or intravenous diuretics or ultrafiltration (UF). Proper diagnosis and ongoing assessment of congestion helps with escalation of diuretic therapy and if diuretic therapy fails it may indicate an AKI not related to congestion, or there might be true diuretic resistance in which case UF may be an option.

Importance of achieving adequate decongestion

A study with 599 patients admitted with acute heart failure in a large European institution over a period of 1 year and followed for 797 ± 619 days demonstrated the benefits of diuretic therapy with adequate decongestion in terms of mortality and readmissions to hospital, despite the presence or absence of AKI and rising creatinine compared with patients who did not achieve decongestion. This study included 34% of the patients with diabetes, 36% with atrial fibrillation, 35% with CKD and mean ejection fraction of 33%. The overall post-discharge mortality or combined mortality with acute heart failure readmission rates were 13% and 43%, respectively. Patients who had worsening of their kidney function and achieved adequate decongestion were no different from the patients who achieved decongestion and did not develop worsening of their kidney function, adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 1.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 1.6, P = 0.11]. Having baseline CKD was a predictor of poor outcome, and AKI was a predictor of poor prognosis in patients where adequate decongestion was not achieved (Table 1).

### High-dose furosemide for established ARF: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial [^114JSi5e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of furosemide on the survival and renal recovery of patients presenting with acute renal failure (ARF) is still debated.

Methods

Three hundred thirty-eight patients with ARF requiring dialysis therapy were randomly assigned to the administration of either furosemide (25 mg/kg/d intravenously or 35 mg/kg/d orally) or matched placebo, with stratification according to severity at presentation. The primary end point was survival. The secondary end point was number of dialysis sessions. Tertiary end points included time on dialysis therapy, time to achieve a serum creatinine level less than 2.26 mg/dL (< 200 micromol/L), and time to reach a 2-L/d diuresis.

Results

There were no differences in survival and renal recovery rates between the 2 groups. Time to achieve a 2-L/d diuresis was shorter with furosemide (5.7 ± 5.8 days) than placebo (7.8 ± 6.8 days; P = 0.004). Overall, 148 patients achieved a urine output of at least 2 L/d during the study period (94 of 166 patients; 57%) with furosemide versus 54 of 164 patients (33%) with placebo (P < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in number of dialysis sessions and time on dialysis therapy between the furosemide and placebo groups, even in the subgroup of patients reaching a 2-L/d diuresis.

Conclusion

High-dose furosemide helps maintain urinary output, but does not have an impact on the survival and renal recovery rate of patients with established ARF.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1165AUd9]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diuretics — evidence and rationale indicate frequent use despite no demonstrated benefit and potential harm. Recent observational studies showed that 59–70% of patients with AKI received diuretics around nephrology consultation or before renal replacement therapy (RRT), yet there is no evidence that the use of diuretics reduces the incidence or severity of AKI. Systematic reviews of frusemide (furosemide) reported no significant effect on in-hospital mortality, RRT requirement, dialysis sessions, or persistent oliguria, with pooled RR for mortality of 2.67 (95% CI 0.75–7.25; P = 0.115) and for RRT incidence of 4.08 (95% CI 0.46–35.96; P = 0.21) versus placebo. Prophylactic furosemide was found to be ineffective or harmful after cardiac surgery and to increase the risk of AKI when given to prevent CI-AKI. In the largest trial including 338 patients with AKI requiring dialysis, patients randomized to furosemide (25 mg/kg/d i.v. or 35 mg/kg/d orally) versus placebo reached 2 l/d diuresis sooner (5.7 days vs 7.8 days, P = 0.004) without differences in survival or number of dialysis sessions, and current evidence does not suggest that furosemide can reduce mortality in patients with AKI.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^116EDjhz]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous loop diuretics are a cornerstone of therapy in acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We sought to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcomes between intravenous bolus and continuous infusion of loop diuretics.

Methods

Subjects with ADHF within 12 hours of hospital admission were randomly assigned to continuous infusion or twice daily bolus therapy with furosemide. There were three co-primary endpoints assessed from admission to discharge: the mean paired changes in serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary endpoints included the rate of acute kidney injury (AKI), change in body weight and six months follow-up evaluation after discharge.

Results

A total of 43 received a continuous infusion and 39 were assigned to bolus treatment. At discharge, the mean change in serum creatinine was higher (+0.8 ± 0.4 versus -0.8 ± 0.3 mg/dl P < 0.01), and eGFR was lower (-9 ± 7 versus +5 ± 6 ml/min/1.73 m² P < 0.05) in the continuous arm. There was no significant difference in the degree of weight loss (-4.1 ± 1.9 versus -3.5 ± 2.4 kg P = 0.23). The continuous infusion arm had a greater reduction in BNP over the hospital course, (-576 ± 655 versus -181 ± 527 pg/ml P = 0.02). The rates of AKI were comparable (22% and 15% P = 0.3) between the two groups. There was more frequent use of hypertonic saline solutions for hyponatremia (33% versus 18% P < 0.01), intravenous dopamine infusions (35% versus 23% P = 0.02), and the hospital length of stay was longer in the continuous infusion group (14. 3 ± 5 versus 11.5 ± 4 days, P < 0.03). At 6 months there were higher rates of re-admission or death in the continuous infusion group, 58% versus 23%, (P = 0.001) and this mode of treatment independently associated with this outcome after adjusting for baseline and intermediate variables (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.57, 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 6.58 P = 0.04).

Conclusions

In the setting of ADHF, continuous infusion of loop diuretics resulted in greater reductions in BNP from admission to discharge. However, this appeared to occur at the consequence of worsened renal filtration function, use of additional treatment, and higher rates of rehospitalization or death at six months.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112SpfL6]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline — natriuretic peptides in heart failure reports that even at doses ≤ 0.015 μg/kg/min, nesiritide was associated with increased renal dysfunction compared to controls, and in a cohort of 682 elderly heart-failure patients, when stratified according to nesiritide usage, AKI emerged as an independent risk factor for mortality only among patients who received the drug and nesiritide usage emerged as the only independent predictor of mortality; an expert panel further emphasized that the drug should not be used to improve renal function or in place of diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. In summary, the document states that there are no definitive trials to support the use of ANP, BNP, or nesiritide and that "Thus, the Work Group suggests that these agents not be used for prevention or treatment of AKI". The research recommendation states: "We recommend further trials of ANP at doses below 0.1 μg/kg/min, for the prevention or treatment of AKI".

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^114poBeZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### Clinical effects and safety of different strategies for administering intravenous diuretics in acutely decompensated heart failure: a randomised clinical trial [^113zZnDw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The mainstay of treatment for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is intravenous diuretic therapy either as a bolus or via continuous infusion.

Objectives

We evaluated the clinical effects and safety of three strategies of intravenous furosemide administration used in emergency departments (EDs) for ADHF.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study. Patients with ADHF were randomised within 2h of ED arrival to receive furosemide by continuous infusion (10mg/h, group 1) or boluses (20mg/6h, group 2; or 20mg/8h, group 3). The primary end point was total diuresis, and secondary end points were dyspnoea, orthopnoea, extension of rales and peripheral oedema, blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, and pulse oximetry, which were measured at arrival and 3, 6, 12 and 24h after treatment onset. We also measured serum creatinine, sodium and potassium levels at arrival and after 24h.

Results

Group 1 patients (n = 36) showed greater 24h diuresis (3705mL) than those in groups 2 (n = 37) and 3 (n = 36) (3093 and 2670mL, respectively; p < 0.01), and this greater diuretic effect was observed earlier. However, no differences were observed among groups in the nine secondary clinical end points evaluated. Creatinine deterioration developed in 15.6% of patients, hyponatraemia in 9.2%, and hypokalaemia in 19.3%, with the only difference among groups observed in hypokalaemia (group 1, 36.3%; group 2, 13.5%; group 3, 8.3%; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients with ADHF attending the ED, boluses of furosemide have a smaller diuretic effect but provide similar clinical relief, similar preservation of renal function, and a lower incidence of hypokalaemia than continuous infusion.

### Acute and acute-on-chronic kidney injury of patients with decompensated heart failure: impact on outcomes [^112dC3py]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

ACKI group

The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group recommends separate criteria for the diagnosis of ACKI. They assigned these patients to the Fc category (where F is failure and c is chronic kidney disease) when their serum creatinine had increased to 350 μmol/L. The ADQI group did not assign a category to those in whom serum creatinine did not rise as high as 350 μmol/L. Patients in our study were defined as CKD when their index eGFR values were arrange from 60 ml/min/1.73 m² to 30 ml/min/1.73 m². We excluded patients with eGFR below 30 ml/min/1.73 m², since it may be difficult to distinguish between the final stages of progression to end stage renal disease and potentially reversible acute worsening of renal function due to relatively small changes in GFR leading to large changes in serum creatinine.

We used the following classification of ACKI in this study according to previous report:

1. **Risk**: serum creatinine increased by 50% or more from index serum creatinine but had not reached 350 μmol/L.

2. **Injury**: serum creatinine increased by 100% or more from index serum creatinine but had not reached 350 μmol/L.

3. **Failure**: serum creatinine increased by 200% or more from index serum creatinine or serum creatinine had increased to 350 μmol/L as the ADQI group recommends.

Patients were excluded when any rise in serum creatinine was not sustained for 24 hours.

Definition of renal recovery

Renal recovery was defined as previously reported.

1. **Full recovery**: Serum creatinine concentrations fell below or to the index.

2. **Partial recovery**: Serum creatinine remained above the index.

3. **Failure to recover**: Dialysis dependent at 90 day.

Diuretic resistance

Diuretic resistance was defined as persistent pulmonary congestion with or without acute worsening of renal function despite attempts at diuresis (repeated doses of 80 mg furosemide, or greater than 240 mg furosemide daily, or combination diuretic therapy including loop diuretics with thiazide or aldosterone antagonist). The doses of diuretics were calculated according to the prescription records in chart review.

### Decongestive treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: cardiorenal implications of ultrafiltration and diuretics [^116CqBdi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), treatment aimed at adequate decongestion of the volume overloaded state is essential. Despite diuretic therapy, many patients remain volume overloaded and symptomatic. In addition, adverse effects related to diuretic treatment are common, including worsening kidney function and electrolyte disturbances. The development of decreased kidney function during treatment affects the response to diuretic therapy and is associated with important clinical outcomes, including mortality. The occurrence of diuretic resistance and the morbidity and mortality associated with diuretic therapy has stimulated interest to develop effective and safe treatment strategies that maximize decongestion and minimize decreased kidney function. During the last few decades, extracorporeal ultrafiltration has been used to remove fluid from diuretic-refractory hypervolemic patients. Recent clinical studies using user-friendly machines have suggested that ultrafiltration may be highly effective for decongesting patients with ADHF. Many questions remain regarding the comparative impact of diuretics and ultrafiltration on important clinical outcomes and adverse effects, including decreased kidney function. This article serves as a summary of key clinical studies addressing these points. The overall goal is to assist practicing clinicians who are contemplating the use of ultrafiltration for a patient with ADHF.

Background

This prospective, randomized trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different intravenous diuretic regimens in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients.

Methods

ADHF patients were enrolled and randomized into three groups: continuous intravenous furosemide infusion (cIV), bolus furosemide injection (bI), and furosemide plus hypertonic saline solution (HSS). Clinical outcomes were assessed over 48h.

Results

In a study involving 1276 patients admitted for ADHF, three therapeutic regimens (T×1, T×2, and T×3) were compared. T×1 administered an 80mg furosemide intravenous bolus infusion twice daily to 479 patients, while T×2 involved a continuous 16-h infusion of 160mg furosemide daily to 420 patients. T×3 treated 377 patients with 160mg furosemide combined with 150mL of HSS containing 1.95% NaCl over 30min. Yet, overall changes in renal markers such as BUN, Na, K, and serum creatinine did not differ significantly. Analysis of prespecified study endpoints revealed notable variations in hospitalization length among the treatment arms. T×1 demonstrated a significantly shorter hospital stay (3.7 days) compared to T×2 (6.6 days) and T×3 (7.9 days). Conversely, alterations in serum creatinine at 48h, overall changes in serum creatinine, body weight loss, and serum potassium levels did not significantly differ among the treatment groups.

Conclusion

While intravenous bolus of furosemide showed potential benefits in reducing hospitalization duration, limitations such as a small sample size and short-term observation emphasize the need for larger studies to validate these outcomes further.

Other risk factors of CI-AKI — besides pre-existing kidney disease with renal function impairment, the chief risk factors for developing CI-AKI include diabetes, hypertension, CHF, advanced age, volume depletion, hemodynamic instability, use of concurrent nephrotoxic medications, and large volume or high osmolality of the contrast agent. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend discontinuation of ACE-I or ARB prior to contrast-media administration. When possible, the administration of contrast media should be delayed in patients with circulatory collapse or CHF until their hemodynamic status is corrected. Repeated exposure should be delayed for 48 hours in patients without risk factors for CI-AKI, and for 72 hours in those with diabetes mellitus or pre-existing chronic renal dysfunction, and if acute renal dysfunction develops after contrast-media administration, repeated exposure should preferably be delayed until the SCr level has returned to baseline levels. Concurrent nephrotoxic medications — including, in particular, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, high doses of loop diuretics, and antiviral drugs like acyclovir and foscarnet — should preferably be stopped. A recent study using a so-called forced euvolemic diuresis protocol including mannitol and furosemide led to a significantly increased risk of CI-AKI; it can be advised that such strategy should be abandoned, and that furosemide therapy should preferably be stopped before angiography.

Adenosine A1 receptor antagonists — cardiorenal syndrome and acute heart failure trials show early signals but no phase III efficacy for rolofylline. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 63 patients with CHF, single doses of the adenosine A1 antagonist BG9719 had a marked stimulatory effect on diuresis and increased GFR, and when coadministered with furosemide BG9719 showed a synergistic diuretic effect and prevented the decrease in GFR associated with the loop diuretic. Rolofylline, another adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, was tested in two double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs; in the first, study drug was given concomitantly with furosemide for 3 days (146 patients) or as a single infusion in 35 diuretic resistant patients, and a second trial involved 301 patients in whom rolofylline administration dose-dependently attenuated the rise in SCr within 14 days and tended to reduce 60-day mortality or readmission for cardiovascular or renal causes. Three pivotal phase III trials in a total of 2500 patients were recently completed, and rolofylline, as compared to placebo, did not provide a benefit with respect to the three primary end-points; persistent renal impairment developed in 15.0% versus 13.7% (P = 0.44) and by 60 days death or readmission for cardiovascular or renal causes occurred in 30.7% versus 31.9% (P = 0.86), adverse-event rates were similar overall but only rolofylline patients had seizures, and thus rolofylline does not appear to be effective for treatment of cardiorenal AKI.

### Kidney dysfunction in heart failure: core curriculum 2025 [^112XtZqt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with kidney dysfunction is represented by several maladaptive bidirectional pathways wherein acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ drives acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. Suboptimal decongestion, diuretic resistance, and low use rates of guideline-directed medical therapy in individuals with kidney dysfunction and HF contribute to poor cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Recent developments with the early identification and treatment of diuretic resistance may help mitigate the harmful effects of persistent congestion in individuals with HF. Several classes of guideline-directed medical therapies in HF have been shown to reduce death, hospitalizations for HF, and kidney function decline and improve quality of life. A combination of efficient and personalized strategies to achieve decongestion while optimizing the implementation of evidence-based therapies that modify the trajectory of HF are essential in tandem to reduce adverse outcomes and premature death in this high-risk patient population.

INTRODUCTION

Heart failure was described as an epidemic 25 years ago and remains a major clinical challenge today. The global prevalence of heart failure is an estimated 64.34 million cases, although there is a dearth of data from developing countries. Globally, this leads to 9.91 million years lost due to disability and consequent economic burden with conservative estimate of346.17 billion. In the UK, there are 200 000 new diagnosis of heart failure each year, with prevalence of about 1 million. The condition remains under-diagnosed, with an estimated 385 000 undiagnosed heart failure cases consequently remaining untreated.

The kidney is an amazing organ with secretory, metabolic and endocrine functions. It is highly vascular and receives up to 25% of the cardiac output, and the renal plasma flow is close to 625 mL/min. The kidney autoregulates the flow of blood elegantly, the glomerular filtration pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are maintained by regulating the blood flow, using the vascular tone of the afferent and efferent arteries, to the glomerulus.

Worsening renal function, more commonly referred to as acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as deterioration of kidney function associated with the rise in serum creatinine of 26 µmol/L (or 0.3 mg/dL) or 50% from baseline; or a drop in urine output. The risk factors of AKI are increasing age, diabetes, presence of ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure. The causes of AKI are sepsis, urine infection, glomerulonephritis, urine obstruction, interstitial nephritis and tubular toxicity due to drugs; and haemodynamic insults from drugs including diuretics. It is important to distinguish between non-haemodynamic and haemodynamic insults, as we will discuss further.

Acute decompensated heart failure is defined as a rapid onset clinical syndrome with signs and symptoms of fluid overload and pulmonary congestion including oedema, raised jugular venous pressure, bilateral chest crepitations, S3 gallop sound, breathlessness, weight gain, requiring urgent or emergent decongestion therapy, often hospital admission. The risk factors for acute heart failure are age, presence of diabetes, hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and CKD. The precipitating factors are accelerated hypertension, dietary salt and fluid non-compliance, cardiac arrhythmias, infection, non-adherence to heart failure drugs and AKI.

Fluid overload management

Diuretic therapy

Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative for relieving symptoms and improving pathophysiological states of fluid overload such as congestive heart failure and in patients with AKI. At this time, there is no evidence that favors ultrafiltration over diuretic use in volume overload patients with or without AKI in terms of less progression of AKI, improved clinical outcomes or reduce incidence of AKI. Despite that more patients developed AKI during diuretic treatment, numerous studies have demonstrated that more aggressive use of loop diuretics to achieve greater volume removal is associated with improved outcomes (Table 2).

Table 2

What should be the goal of urine output when using diuretics to manage fluid overload? Some empirical observations have shown that a urine output of 3–4 ml/kg/h rarely causes intravascular volume depletion as capillary refill can meet such rates in almost all patients. Diuretics could be either administered by bolus or using a continuous infusion. There has been controversy about which of these strategies is better; some authors advocate that diuretic infusion is superior to boluses since urinary output could be maintain easily. In one study diuretic infusion was associated with greater diuresis and this was achieved with a lesser dose; infusion was also associated with fewer adverse events such as worsening AKI, hypokalemia, and ototoxicity. However, in the DOSE-AHF(Diuretic Optimization Strategy Evaluation in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study, authors found that patients with acute heart failure may benefit from an initial bolus strategy.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

### Are diuretics harmful in the management of acute kidney injury? [^113tQ7DQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To assess the role of diuretics in acute kidney injury (AKI) and their effectiveness in preventing AKI, achieving fluid balance, and decreasing progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

Diuretics are associated with increased risk for AKI. The theoretical advantage of diuretic-induced preservation of renal medullary oxygenation to prevent AKI has not been proven. A higher cumulative diuretic dose during the dialysis period can cause hypotension and increase mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Data on the use of forced euvolemic diuresis to prevent AKI remains controversial. Positive fluid balance has emerged as an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Post-AKI furosemide dose had a favorable effect on mortality due in part to the reduction of positive fluid balance. There are exciting experimental data suggesting that spironolactone may prevent AKI once an ischemic insult has occurred and thus prevent the progression to CKD.

Summary

Diuretics are ineffective and even detrimental in the prevention and treatment of AKI, and neither shorten the duration of AKI, nor reduce the need for renal replacement therapy. Diuretics have an important role in volume management in AKI, but they are not recommended for the prevention of AKI. There is increased emphasis on the prevention of progression of AKI to CKD.

Acute heart failure syndromes — loop diuretics and nitrates in prehospital/emergency care: There are no randomized clinical trials evaluating the clinical benefit of furosemide alone in acute heart failure syndromes. In advanced chronic heart failure, intravenous furosemide 1.3 ± 0.6 mg/kg was given and during the next 1 to 2 hours patients experienced worsening hemodynamics. An out-of-hospital randomized study of 104 patients with acute heart failure, all with a room air pulse oximetry of less than 90% when sitting upright, compared low-dose furosemide plus high-dose nitrates versus high-dose furosemide plus low-dose nitrates; one arm used high-dose nitrates (8-fold difference between study arms) and the other used high-dose furosemide (4-fold difference between study arms). The combined endpoint of hospital death, myocardial infarction within 24 hours, and intubation within 12 hours was lower with high-dose nitrates (25% versus 46%; P < 0.04), with markedly lower intubation within 12 hours (13% versus 40%, P < 0.005) and fewer myocardial infarctions within 24 hours than high-dose furosemide (37% versus 17%, P < 0.05). Regarding renal safety, in a multicenter nested case-control of 382 patients, worsening renal function was associated with a 60 mg greater total furosemide dose the prior day (199 mg ± 195 versus 143 mg ± 119; P < 0.05). Mortality risk increased with renal dysfunction: in ADHERE data from more than 60,000 patients, in-hospital mortality is greater than 20% with admission blood urea nitrogen greater than 43 mg/dL, creatinine greater than 2.7 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 115 mm Hg, and a creatinine rise greater than 0.3 mg/dL during hospitalization was associated with nearly 3 times higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 4.6).

The most potent diuretic class includes loop diuretics, with the effect of WHF on their dose–response curve presented in Figure 2. In the context of WHF and the consequent reduced bioavailability of oral loop diuretics, guidelines recommend the use of IV loop diureticsto rapidly and more efficiently achieve a natriuretic ceiling. Different loop diuretics exist and they have different pharmacokinetics and bioavailability; a large (∼6000 participants to be enrolled) ongoing trial is comparing oral torasemide to furosemide as treatment for congestion at the time of discharge from an episode of HF (TRANSFORM‐HF, NCT03296813) following the favourable effect of torasemide on HF hospitalizations suggested in observational studies and the meta‐analysis of small trials.

Shift in dose–response relation to furosemide in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Renal function (as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate) has an important impact on the dose–response curve to furosemide: Higher dosing is needed for lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. This is the underlying reason of the right shift observed for patients with CHF and cardiorenal syndrome and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (orange curve). IV, intravenous. Adapted from Brater

Thiazide‐like diuretics can be used in severe HF patients who responded poorly to loop diuretics in a sequential nephron blockade strategy. These diuretic agents potentialize the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (Figure 1) and in the case of oral and IV metolazone remain effective with reduced filtration rate (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m²). This effect can significantly increase diuresis and should be closely monitored with serum potassium and sodium measurements.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115RN2Sg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

### The effect in renal function and vascular decongestion in type 1 cardiorenal syndrome treated with two strategies of diuretics, a pilot randomized trial [^1128N7gV]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart performance and kidney function are strictly interconnected through a variety of pathways, including perfusion, filling pressure and neurohormonal activity [1]. Cardiorenal type 1 syndrome (CRS1) is characterized by a rapid worsening of cardiac function leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) [2]. In a meta-analysis, CRS1 occurred in one-fifth of patients with cardiac disease and increased the risk of death by 5 times [3]. Accumulating clinical evidence supports a key role for venous congestion in this syndrome [4]. Decongestion is the primary therapeutic goal in the majority of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) [5]. The mainstay of therapy to obtain fluid removal is intravenous (IV) loop diuretics, mainly furosemide [6]. Unfortunately, an efficient diuretic response is not observed in many patients who present with ADHF or some of them develop resistance; therefore, synergizing the diuretic effect with thiazides [7] or spironolactone [8] has been explored, since blocking the renal tubule in different segments would potentiate the effect of furosemide. The sequential blockage of the renal tubule promotes greater natriuresis, urinary volume, effects observed even in patients at high risk of resistance to diuretics. So far, there are no clinical trials assessing sequential blockage of the renal tubule to promote decongestion by infused furosemide in CRS1 patients. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind clinical trial of patients with CRS1 in which we used a combined diuretic strategy compared to stepped furosemide, to promote renal recovery and the variables associated with vascular decongestion. Our hypothesis was that a combination of diuretics would be at least similar than stepped furosemide alone.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a degree of acute renal impairment would be expected and acceptable while trying to achieve adequate decongestion in patients with acute or decompensated heart failure. If clinicians are not aware that this can hamper the initiation or continuation of heart failure medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEi/ARB), angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The introduction of RAAS inhibitor medications is associated with efferent arteriolar vasodilatation, drop in intraglomerular filtration pressure and decrease in GFR. The introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with increased sodium delivery to distal tubule, causing afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a drop in GFR, which aids in preservation of the kidney function in the long run as shown in the large SGLT inhibitor studies of heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (Fig. 2). While concerns regarding worsening renal function and hyperkalemia in progressive CKD frequently lead to discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors, the Renin–Angiotensin System Inhibition in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease or STOP – ACEi trial has shown that stopping RAAS inhibitors is not associated with change in the long-term rate of decline in eGFR.

AKI is common in patients at admission with acute heart failure, related to renal arterial hypoperfusion and renal venous congestion. Further AKI happens during hospital admission due to decongestion and further haemodynamic changes. These haemodynamic changes are potentially reversible and do not have long-term adverse consequences, as shown in a meta-analysis of 13 studies where AKI with decongestion was associated with lower mortality and patients who had no AKI and remained congested. AKI can also happen due to non-haemodynamic tubular injury such as sepsis and nephrotoxic drugs, and it is important to distinguish between the two to guide further decongestion therapy and predict prognosis. The rise in serum creatinine and tubular injury markers during adequate decongestion predicts a better prognosis, compared with patients with no decongestion and no rise in creatinine. Hence it is important to achieve rapid and adequate diuresis or decongestion with acute heart failure in hospital, perhaps within first 3 days of admission, accepting minor AKI that usually recovers; however, patients should be closely monitored to identify and treat for sepsis and other non-haemodynamic causes to avoid irreversible AKI. Worsening or persistent congestion despite adequate diuretic therapy characterized by worsening or persistent symptoms of heart failure with concomitant worsening renal impairment would be a cause for concern and may indicate irreversible AKI (Fig. 3).

Pharmacological management

Diuretics

While almost universally used in the management of HFrEF to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion, there is little evidence for a mortality benefit associated with diuretic use. Loop diuretics are first-line treatments and recommended in cases of acute heart failure. Dose escalation may be necessary during decompensations associated with times of intercurrent infection, acute coronary syndrome or acute arrhythmia. High doses or intravenous administration may be required with renal impairment, where patients are diuretic resistant, or where there is reduced bioavailability associated with gut oedema. In the congested state, elevated serum creatinine commonly relates to reduced glomerular flow rates due to higher pressures in the efferent arterioles — a consequence of elevated central venous pressure. Escalation of intravenous diuretic therapy rather than dose reduction is indicated in this context. Where cardiac function is improved by other therapies, diuretic dose may need to be reduced, as well as at times of insensible fluid losses — for example, during periods of extreme heat or diarrhoeal illness.

Addition of a thiazide diuretic to encourage natriuresis by blocking reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules can be helpful in diuretic-resistant patients. These patients will need closer monitoring of electrolytes and a low threshold for potassium replacement.

Four pillars of disease-modifying treatment

The neurohormonal model of heart failure is key to understanding the efficacy of disease-modifying medical therapy and is summarised in figure 4. More recent evidence for the significant benefits related to reducing heart failure admissions associated with SGLT2i expands our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure and cements these agents as fundamental keystones in the management of HFrEF.

Many patients with HFrEF have a degree of renal impairment prior to commencing therapy. Due to their mode of action, some further deterioration in renal function is to be expected with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) — this usually stabilises and ultimately is renoprotective. Pragmatic UK consensus guidelines are available when assessing renal impairment in the patient with HFrEF. Acute kidney injury is often cited as a cause for discontinuing RAASi but such reflex response should be avoided in favour of careful monitoring and consideration of other factors leading to reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Occasionally hyperkalaemia may limit RAASi and newer potassium-binding agents may have a role here, but the prognostic benefit of this approach is yet to be determined.

### Furosemide [^112HQCY7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Parenteral therapy should be reserved for patients unable to take oral medication or for patients in emergency clinical situations.

Edema: Furosemide is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.

Furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema. The intravenous administration of furosemide is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired, e.g., in acute pulmonary edema.

If gastrointestinal absorption is impaired or oral medication is not practical for any reason, furosemide is indicated by the intravenous or intramuscular route. Parenteral use should be replaced with oral furosemide as soon as practical.

### Cardiorenal syndrome: new developments in the understanding and pharmacologic management [^112a2nTH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiorenal syndromes (CRSs) with bidirectional heart-kidney signaling are increasingly being recognized for their association with increased morbidity and mortality. In acute CRS, recognition of the importance of worsening kidney function complicating management of acute decompensated heart failure has led to the examination of this specific outcome in the context of acute heart failure clinical trials. In particular, the role of fluid overload and venous congestion has focused interest in the most effective use of diuretic therapy to relieve symptoms of heart failure while at the same time preserving kidney function. Additionally, many novel vasoactive therapies have been studied in recent years with the hopes of augmenting cardiac function, improving symptoms and patient outcomes, while maintaining or improving kidney function. Similarly, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic CRS have led to reanalysis of kidney outcomes in pivotal trials in chronic congestive heart failure, and newer trials are including changes in kidney function as well as kidney injury biomarkers as prospectively monitored and adjudicated outcomes. This paper provides an overview of some new developments in the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic CRS, examines several reports that illustrate a key management principle for each subtype, and discusses opportunities for future research.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^112d2Nyr]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there may not be differences in clinical outcomes associated with different loop diuretic medications, there are relevant and important pharmacokinetic differences in relative potencies and bioavailability. These differences dictate relative conversions between loop diuretics and as shown in the current analysis, as the magnitude of dose increases, the likelihood of receiving optimal initial IV dosing decreases. This finding may reflect either a discomfort in practice when selecting an initial dose that surpasses a particular threshold or inadequate pharmacokinetic equipotent conversions between loop diuretics. Both potential mechanisms are further supported in our study by the 20 to 25% lower probability of optimal dosing with the use of bumetanide as a home oral diuretic or as an initial IV diuretic. This may indicate a misinterpretation of pharmacokinetic equivalences between bumetanide and furosemide. Furthermore, results remained consistent in our sensitivity analysis with an alternative diuretic dosing conversion. While these mechanisms may be driven by the goal of minimizing medication-related side effects, there are limited reports of adverse events from exceeding dosing thresholds for IV loop diuretics in patients with ADHF. Hearing loss or tinnitus, rare side effects of loop diuretics, are only notable in rapid IV bolus doses exceeding 500 mg of FEs, which is rarely seen within current HF management. Furthermore, acute kidney injury in the setting of volume overload and diuresis is not associated with long-term worsening renal function, which diverges from the pedagogical "nephrotoxicity" side effect of loop diuretics during initial ADHF volume management. In fact, a retrospective analysis of the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure trail demonstrated that worsening acute kidney injury biomarkers among those with ADHF were associated with an improvement in survival vs those without acute kidney injury biomarker changes.

### Loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: the need for solid evidence on a fluid issue [^116RksQW]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a common condition associated with substantial cost, morbidity, and mortality. Because results of clinical trials in the acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) setting have been mostly neutral, loop diuretics remain the mainstay of treatment.

Hypothesis

Loop diuretic use may be associated with unfavorable outcomes.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search was performed to identify articles relating to heart failure and loop diuretics. The current evidence on the risks and benefits of loop diuretics for the treatment of ADHF is reviewed.

Results

Loop diuretics are associated with symptomatic improvements in congestion, urine output, and body weight, but have shown no long-term mortality benefit. Loop diuretics, especially at high doses, are associated with worsened renal function and other poor outcomes.

Conclusions

Loop diuretics still prove useful in HF treatment, but risk-benefit analysis of these agents in the treatment of ADHF requires a well-designed prospective study.

### Acute heart failure: acute cardiorenal syndrome and role of aggressive decongestion [^111WysnE]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Congestion and acute renal dysfunction are at the center of acute heart failure (HF) syndromes. Acute cardiorenal syndrome, which refers to worsening of renal function in a patient with acute HF syndrome, is partly related to venous congestion and high renal afterload. Aggressive decongestion improves renal and myocardial flow and ventricular loading conditions, potentially resulting in reduced HF progression, rehospitalization, and mortality. High-dose diuretic therapy remains the mainstay therapy. Ultrafiltration and inotropic therapy are useful in the subgroup of patients with a low-output state and diuretic resistance.

### Worsening renal function in patients with acute heart failure undergoing aggressive diuresis is not associated with tubular injury [^112AMcuK]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation-Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.

Methods

Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n = 283). WRF was defined as a ≥ 20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.

Results

Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both P > 0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (-8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, -169 to 35 ng/mg; P < 0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (P = 0.21), N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (P = 0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, N -acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.

Venous congestion

The impact of renal venous congestion on AKI during acute heart failure admission was very elegantly demonstrated in a study with 145 consecutive heart failure patients admitted for intensive therapy with central venous pressure monitoring. In this study the mean (± standard deviation) age of the patients was 57 ± 14 years, ejection fraction was 20 ± 8% and serum creatinine was 1.7 ± 0.9 mg/dL. It was noted that patients with AKI, defined as a rising serum creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL, compared with patients without AKI, had higher baseline serum creatinine (1.9 ± 0.9 versus 1.5 ± 0.8 mg/dL); similar doses of furosemide, systemic arterial blood pressure (111 ± 21 versus 108 ± 15 mmHg), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (25 ± 7 versus 24 ± 7 cm); higher cardiac index (2.0 ± 0.8 vs 1.8 ± 0.4 L/m 2); but higher central venous pressure (18 ± 7 vs 12 ± 6 cm). The risk of AKI increased with increasing central venous pressure, with 75% of patients developing AKI when the central venous pressure was more than 24 cm. Increasing central venous pressure and not decreasing systolic blood pressure were associated with AKI. Baseline elevated central venous pressure and not baseline cardiac index predicted the development of AKI. Thus, central venous congestion was largely responsible for AKI in these patients with ADHF.

The term congestive nephropathy is used to describe the pattern of renal impairment due to reduced renal venous outflow and rising renal interstitial pressure, which may be potentially reversible. Renal venous congestion triggers hormone activation leading to increased renal sodium resorption, leading to volume overload, increased intra-abdominal pressure and eventually right ventricular stress. Thus, reduced renal perfusion along with increased vascular congestion and hence increased central venous pressure leads to worsening renal function in decompensated heart failure. In addition, Boorsma et al. proposed the concept of 'renal tamponade', the compression of renal structures due to the confines of the renal capsule linking the two. In animal models of heart failure and acute renal ischaemia, removal of the renal capsule has been shown to be effective is improving the compression related injury (Fig. 1).

### Impact of nesiritide on renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and pre-existing renal dysfunction a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^112jEdeE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our purpose was to evaluate the impact of nesiritide on renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and baseline renal dysfunction.

Background

Although nesiritide is approved for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure, retrospective analyses have raised concerns that it may cause worsened renal function. To date, no randomized clinical trials have prospectively evaluated this issue.

Methods

Consecutive patients with acute decompensated heart failure and baseline renal dysfunction were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects were randomized to receive nesiritide (0.01 microg/kg/min with or without a 2-microg/kg bolus) or placebo (5% dextrose in water) for 48 h in addition to their usual care. Predefined primary end points of the trial were a rise in serum creatinine by ≥ 20% and change in serum creatinine.

Results

Seventy-five patients were enrolled (39 nesiritide, 36 placebo). The groups had similar baseline age (74.9 vs. 75.5 years, respectively), blood pressure (123/64 vs. 125/64 mm Hg) and serum creatinine (1.82 vs. 1.86 mg/dl). There were no significant differences in the incidence of a 20% creatinine rise (23% vs. 25%) or in the change in serum creatinine (-0.05 vs. +0.05 mg/dl). There were no significant differences in the secondary end points of change in weight (-2.19 vs. -1.58 kg), intravenous furosemide (125 vs. 107 mg), discontinuation of the infusion due to hypotension (13% vs. 6%), or 30-day death/hospital readmission (33% vs. 25%).

Conclusions

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, nesiritide had no impact on renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure. (BNP-CARDS trial; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00186329?order = 1; NCT00186329).

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### The blunted loop diuretic response in acute heart failure is driven by reduced tubular responsiveness rather than insufficient tubular delivery. the role of furosemide urine excretion on diuretic and natriuretic response in acute heart failure [^111bs6eB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Diuretic response in heart failure is blunted when compared to healthy individuals, but the pathophysiology underlying this phenomenon is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether the diuretic resistance mechanism is related to insufficient furosemide tubular delivery or low tubular responsiveness.

Methods and Results

We conducted a prospective, observational study of 50 patients with acute heart failure patients divided into two groups based on previous furosemide use (furosemide naïve: n = 28 [56%] and chronic furosemide users: n = 22 [44%]). Each patient received a protocol-derived, standardized furosemide dose based on body weight. We measured diuretic response and urine furosemide concentrations. The furosemide naïve group had significantly higher urine volumes and natriuresis when compared to chronic users at all timepoints (all p < 0.05). Urine furosemide delivery was similar in furosemide naïve versus chronic users after accounting for differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate (28.02 [21.03–35.89] vs. 29.70 [18.19–34.71] mg, p = 0.87). However, the tubular response to delivered diuretic was dramatically higher in naïve versus chronic users, that is the urine volume per 1μg/ml of urine furosemide at 2h was 148.6 ± 136.1 versus 50.6 ± 56.1ml (p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Patients naïve to furosemide have significantly better diuresis and natriuresis when compared to chronic furosemide users. The blunted diuretic response in patients with chronic loop diuretic exposure is driven by decreased tubular responsiveness rather than insufficient furosemide tubular delivery.

### Development and standardization of a furosemide stress test to predict the severity of acute kidney injury [^116NLhXo]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

In the overall cohort, 24 patients (31%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD). The numbers of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and congestive heart failure (CHF) were 35 (44%), 60 (78%), and 25 (33%), respectively. The proportion of patients with CKD, HTN, CHF, and DM was not statistically different between progressors and non-progressors (Table 1). There was no difference in the prevalence of sepsis or recent cardiac surgery in those who did and did not progress. Baseline serum albumin concentration was not different between progressors and non-progressors (2.82 g/dL versus 2.89 g/dL, P = 0.89). Baseline serum lactate concentrations were not different between those who did and did not progress (data not shown). The mean cardiovascular Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 1.16 (0.3) and the mean APACHE II score was 17.8 (1.11); there was no difference between progressors and non-progressors (Table 1).

In this trial, "Patients treated with furosemide (n = 36) had a significantly increased urinary volume and greater sodium excretion compared to placebo-treated patients (n = 35). However, there were no differences in need for repeated CVVH, or renal recovery during ICU or hospital stay". An observational study "found no difference in diuretic use between patients with successful or unsuccessful discontinuation of IHD", and overall, "diuretics may improve urine volume after RRT, but do not appear to have any significant benefit in reducing the need for RRT or promoting renal recovery from AKI".

### Development and standardization of a furosemide stress test to predict the severity of acute kidney injury [^113cP7UM]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Although the findings in this study show good performance metrics for the FST, the use of the FST in patients who are not appropriately resuscitated can be potentially deleterious. We cannot overemphasize the point that patients need to be euvolemic before undertaking any type of furosemide challenge, and that volume replacement is mandatory in patients who are not obviously volume overloaded, as the mean UO in response to the challenge was over 1.3 L in 6 hours. In addition, the FST should be conducted in an appropriate clinical setting where UO, heart rate, and blood pressure can be monitored frequently.

The study has several limitations. Since this is a pilot study, larger more comprehensive studies of the FST are warranted in order to fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of this dynamic functional test. Although previous clinical trials of furosemide use in AKI have not shown any beneficial effect, we cannot be sure that the FST did not impact the natural history of AKI and therefore affect its predictive performance. Some investigators have suggested that furosemide is protective in AKI because its administration may decrease tubular oxygen consumption, in which case its early administration in AKI would be protective. Clinical trials using furosemide early in the course of AKI are underway and may help determine whether furosemide has a role in the treatment of AKI. In addition, we did not specifically study patients with acute decompensated heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or other patient populations with diuretic resistance. As such, we cannot be certain that the FST will perform similarly in those patient populations.

Similar to the approach used in acute coronary syndrome before the advances in thrombolytic therapy, the clinical syndrome of angina (that is, chest pain and dyspnea) was followed by a biomarker assessment (that is, creatine phosphosphokinase-MB) to further risk-assess the patient. For those patients who were confirmed with a biomarker, stress testing (for example, dobutamine or treadmill stress test) was used to confirm the presence of severe coronary artery disease. We believe that a similar process can begin in patients with AKI. Patients with renal angina can be further assessed with AKI biomarkers. For those patients in whom AKI biomarkers confirm AKI, FST could be used to assess the severity and prognosis of AKI. Because indiscriminate use of loop diuretics can be harmful, appropriate resuscitation prior to FST is mandatory, and the FST should not be used as a primary screening diagnostic. We suggest that future studies to test this hypothesis be conducted.

### Association between furosemide administration and outcomes in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^113DnWQo]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of furosemide was associated with reduced short-term mortality and improved recovery of renal function in critically ill patients with AKI. Furosemide was especially effective in patients with AKI oliguria stage 2–3 degree, but not in those with AKI SCr stage 2–3 and chronic kidney disease. Our results may be helpful for the rational use of furosemide in critically ill patients with AKI. The results need to be verified in the future by multicenter randomized controlled trials.

### Loop diuretics in acute heart failure: beyond the decongestive relief for the kidney [^116FEqnE]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Beyond hemodynamic derangement, there are systemic mechanisms that substantially contribute to congestion status, including neurohormonal activation which works to maintain organ perfusion and systemic pressure while enhancing sodium and water retention. Combined, increased vascular stiffness and reduced vein capacitance enhance both preload and afterload with a consequent rise in cardiac filling pressure that reflects on the pulmonary circulation. Arterial vasoconstriction associated with increased venous pressure affects the kidney, causing hemodynamic and parenchymal alterations: renal blood flow redistribution, tubuloglomerular feedback, tubule obliteration, and efferent arteriolar constriction which leads to reduced salt and water excretion. Slow plasma refill from extravascular to intravascular bed and overhydrated interstitium is another component: the intravascular volume decreases only marginally by diuretic treatment; in contrast, the interstitial volume has substantial reduction.

Given the combination of hemodynamic and neurohormonal factors, each patient has an individual risk of AKI or type 1 cardiorenal syndrome after the first few doses of intravenous loop diuretics. A strong clinical clue for risk of AKI is increased central venous pressure and therefore intra-abdominal and renal congestion. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure has recently been debated as a causal contributor in congestion development. Raised intra-abdominal pressure reduces abdominal compliance, leading to intra-abdominal organ compression due to reduced venous return and parenchymal congestion. Moreover, elevated intra-abdominal pressure may raise central venous pressure, which consequently increases cardiac preload (Fig. 1). If the degree of diuresis exceeds the rate of plasma refill from the extravascular space, then transient decreases in forward flow to the kidney can occur with the same amount of venous back pressure, precipitating tubuloglomerular feedback and a reduction of glomerular filtration combined with augmented sodium reabsorption. This causes an abrupt reduction in urine output and then a rise in the plasma pool of creatinine, urea, and other filtered substances.

The physical exam and traditional laboratories are poor tools in assessing this complex and dynamic pathophysiology in each patient. Futuristic approaches involve the use of non-invasive abdominal compartment monitoring, bioimpedance, or real-time assessments of glomerular filtration to establish the correct loop diuretic dosing and management of other drugs.

### Intravenous hydration and contrast-induced acute kidney injury: too much of a good thing? [^1178U2yH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Furthermore, studies of the RenalGuard device, which uses furosemide diuresis with matched intravenous fluid hydration to increase urine output, have demonstrated protection from CI‐AKI. 18, 19 The principle of the RenalGuard device is to achieve maximal intra‐ and postprocedural urine flow rates while avoiding dehydration or excessive hydration. Intraprocedural urine‐output rates of > 450 mL/h were associated with prevention of CI‐AKI. 20 With these high urine‐output rates and with matched intravenous hydration, participants treated with RenalGuard receive high rates of intravenous fluid hydration, albeit in manner that maintains euvolemic volume status.

How can we reconcile the findings of the current article by Liu et al with the findings from POSEIDON and Qian et al, who found that high volumes of intravenous fluids, administered under hemodynamic guidance, were protective against CI‐AKI? As addressed earlier, it is possible that the current findings are largely attributable to residual confounding because participants in Q4 for HV/W ratio had many baseline variables associated with CI‐AKI risk. Beyond this important limitation, perhaps the message from the current study is that too much hydration increases the risk of CI‐AKI in some people; it is well known that congestive heart failure is associated with CI‐AKI risk, and renal venous hypertension (or congestion) may contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI. Perhaps we have refinement of the message regarding intravenous fluids (Figure). It is not that intravenous fluid hydration is automatically good but rather that the right amount of fluid for each patient is needed to optimize outcomes and reduce the risk of CI‐AKI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Loop diuretic therapy in hospitalized heart failure — dosing and monitoring is outlined as follows: Table 7A provides guidance on timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan based on patient profile as represented in the randomized ARNI trials; subsequent IV diuretic doses are modified to achieve the desired daily response, and doses are often doubled until reaching 400 to 500 mg of furosemide equivalent per day; when the response is brisk but transient, the frequency should be increased to 3 to 4 times daily; the DOSE trial did not demonstrate improved outcomes with continuous infusion of IV furosemide, but patients with chronic furosemide equivalent doses of over 240 mg daily were excluded, while a Cochrane review suggested that loop diuretic agent infusions may produce greater net diuresis and better tolerability at equivalent doses compared with bolus dosing; measurement of urine sodium shortly after the start of therapy can be useful to evaluate diuretic responsiveness, with a spot urine sodium content < 50 mEq/L at 2 hours after the diuretic dose correlated with a poor diuretic response and suggests consideration of dose.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is common, affecting more than six million adults and resulting in over 1.8 million hospitalizations per year in the United States alone, with significant financial impact.HF is a chronic, progressive condition, marked by episodes of acute decompensation, typically requiring hospitalization for stabilization and improvement in symptoms. Almost 90% of hospitalizations are due to symptoms related to volume overload. Unfortunately, outcomes after hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are poor. The 1‐year mortality rate after an HF hospitalization has remained high at 20%–30%, and there is additive risk with each subsequent hospitalization. For patients with ADHF, many medical therapies have been tested in this patient population without success, and, as a result, ADHF care remains largely homogenous and unchanged over the past 40 years, with treatment largely focusing on diuresis with intravenous diuretics. With currently available treatment options, approximately 33% of patients hospitalized for ADHF are discharged with persistent congestion, and higher degrees of clinical congestion at hospital discharge are associated with increased HF readmissions and reduced survival.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) versus furosemide — renal hemodynamics after cardiac surgery are contrasted: ANP infusion (25–50 ng/kg/min) increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), filtration fraction, fractional excretion of sodium, and urine output, with a 9% increase in tubular sodium absorption and a 26% increase in renal oxygen consumption, whereas furosemide infusion (0.5 mg/kg/h) raised urine output 10-fold and fractional excretion of sodium 15-fold, decreased tubular sodium absorption by 28% and renal oxygen consumption by 23%, and lowered GFR by 12% and filtration fraction by 7%; lower ANP dosing (50 ng/kg/min vs. 200 ng/kg/min) avoided significant hypotension seen previously.

Purpose Of Review

The kidney, like most other organs, has a reserve capacity that can be utilized in times of increased physiologic demand. The ability to quantify this renal reserve function across various parts of the nephron (glomerular and tubular) has been an area of increased investigation over the past several years. In this review, we discuss several techniques that have been developed to interrogate the maximal physiologic capacity of the injured kidney.

Recent Findings

Although protein loading has been established as an ideal method to investigate glomerular filtration capacity in healthy kidneys, other methods such as the antagonism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have demonstrated promise as a method to determine underlying glomerular disease in those with acute kidney injury and other comorbidities (e.g., congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease). The furosemide stress test has been demonstrated to be a useful clinical tool to ascertain tubular integrity in the setting of acute kidney injury.

Summary

Although various methods to interrogate the reserve capacity of the several nephron segments (glomerulus and tubules) have been investigated, none of these techniques have had wide-spread clinical implementation. Further research into acute kidney injury stress testing is warranted.

Diuretics

Recommendations

We recommend against loop diuretics given solely for the prevention of acute kidney injury (Grade 1B).
We suggest using diuretics to control or avoid fluid overload in patients that are diuretic-responsive (Grade 2D).

Rationale

Oligoanuria is frequently the first indicator of acute renal dysfunction. Intensivists frequently use loop diuretics in a wide spectrum of AKI settings. The rationale for using diuretics to ameliorate AKI includes prevention of tubular obstruction, reduction in medullary oxygen consumption and increase in renal blood flow as well as reducing fluid overload and venous congestion. Although there is no single parameter for fluid overload, increased CVP, peripheral oedema and/or increased intra-abdominal pressure may be used as surrogates. A recent study demonstrated than a urinary output of at least 100 ml/h following a test dose of 1.0–1.5 mg furosemide/kg BW predicted reduced progression to a higher stage of AKI in oliguric patients.

Clinical studies

Use of conservative fluid management including diuretics has been investigated in only one large RCT in patients with acute lung injury (FACTT trial) which showed a tendency to reduced requirement of RRT.

In cardiac surgery either no protection or elevated postoperative serum creatinine levels were found in patients receiving furosemide. These findings were supported by a recent meta-analysis. In patients with acute heart failure, diuretic therapy with higher doses was more effective at reducing clinical symptoms, but at the cost of decreased renal function. To date four RCTs have examined the role of diuretics in established renal failure in the intensive care setting. No demonstrable improvements in clinically relevant outcomes, such as recovery of renal function or mortality, were observed. Other studies compared diuretics with dopamine or placebo, again with no perceived benefit. Three meta-analyses confirmed that the use of diuretics in established AKI did not alter outcome but carried a significant risk of side effects such as hearing loss (ESM_2 Table S4).
