## Question

Hematuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hematuria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hematuria and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should classify gross versus microscopic and consider age-specific differentials. Next, I will risk-stratify for malignancy and outline the initial workup, including when to image and scope. After that, I need to address special populations and anticoagulation, and finally, I will plan follow-up, summarize key principles, and flag controversies and evidence gaps, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and high-quality data where available.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in urine, with microscopic hematuria typically defined as three or more RBCs per high-power field on microscopic examination of a properly collected specimen, and gross hematuria as visible discoloration. Importantly, dipstick positivity for blood is not sufficient and must be confirmed microscopically to avoid false positives from pigments or myoglobin [^96018b79] [^258b589d] [^6168f0f7].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic confirmation steps before proceeding: I should repeat urinalysis to confirm persistence, exclude contamination from menstruation or poor collection, and ensure no obvious benign causes like recent vigorous exercise or infection. If infection is present, treat it and recheck because hematuria should resolve with appropriate therapy, and persistent hematuria after treated infection warrants evaluation [^f40ab8ed] [^258b589d].

> Next, I should review the differential and how it shifts by age. In adults, nonglomerular causes predominate, including infection, stones, and malignancy, whereas in children, glomerular diseases such as IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease, and postinfectious glomerulonephritis are more common. I need to keep this in mind because it drives the intensity and type of testing I choose [^1398985e] [^05ca0dba].

> Hold on, I should verify malignancy risk factors and how to stratify. The AUA/SUFU risk stratification uses sex, age, degree of hematuria, and smoking history to categorize patients into low, intermediate, or high risk, which correlates with bladder cancer incidence and guides the intensity of evaluation. For example, in a large validation cohort, cancer incidence was 0.4% in low-risk, 1.0% in intermediate-risk, and 6.3% in high-risk groups, supporting a tiered approach rather than a one-size-fits-all workup [^4b88a23a] [^96018b79].

> I will now examine the initial evaluation elements I must not miss: a focused history including smoking, occupational exposures, prior urologic disease, and anticoagulation; a physical exam with blood pressure; and targeted labs including urinalysis with microscopy, serum creatinine, and eGFR. I should confirm that these are recommended in the updated AUA/SUFU guidance and that they anchor subsequent decisions about imaging and cystoscopy [^d50b5e85] [^96018b79].

> Let me think about when to image and how to choose modalities. For upper tract evaluation, CT urography has the highest diagnostic yield for urothelial carcinoma and stones but carries radiation and contrast risks; renal ultrasound is reasonable in low-risk patients or when contrast is contraindicated, though it can miss small urothelial lesions. I should balance sensitivity against harms and patient risk, and remember that many patients undergo CT urography without meeting criteria, which inflates utilization without proportional yield [^03cefe05] [^6cab8586] [^40c77865].

> I should confirm the role of cystoscopy. Cystoscopy remains the gold standard for evaluating the lower tract and is indicated in essentially all patients with gross hematuria and in those with microscopic hematuria who are intermediate or high risk; in low-risk patients, shared decision-making about deferring cystoscopy is reasonable, but I need to ensure we do not miss a malignancy in those with subtle risk features [^96018b79] [^258b589d].

> But wait, what if the urinalysis shows dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or significant proteinuria? That pattern points toward glomerular disease, and I should pivot to a nephrologic workup rather than a urologic one, with consideration of serologies and kidney biopsy when indicated, because persistent glomerular hematuria can portend CKD progression and even ESRD in some contexts [^e98cbe93] [^46be03bc] [^3c180e7e].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with women. I initially thought the AUA threshold of 3 RBCs/hpf applies uniformly, but hold on, I should verify sex-specific guidance: ACOG/AUGS recommend a higher threshold for evaluation in low-risk, never-smoking women under 50, suggesting no routine workup unless there are more than 25 RBCs/hpf, given a malignancy risk of 0.5% or less in that subgroup. This is a key exception to the AUA framework and requires careful counseling about trade-offs [^4931467b] [^a1fed3d0].

> I need to check the approach in children. Most pediatric hematuria is medical rather than surgical, so I should prioritize urinalysis with microscopy, blood pressure, and selective imaging such as renal ultrasound when indicated; persistent proteinuria, hypertension, or abnormal renal function should prompt nephrology referral, and I should avoid overtesting in isolated, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^05ca0dba] [^4356fed0].

> Let me consider anticoagulation carefully. Hematuria on anticoagulants still warrants evaluation because up to 44% may have underlying urologic pathology, including malignancy, and the baseline risk is not erased by anticoagulation. I should not dismiss gross or persistent microscopic hematuria solely due to anticoagulant use, and I should tailor imaging to renal function and contrast risk [^b9ef5fa2] [^3cc101bd].

> I should double-check follow-up recommendations after a negative evaluation. Shared decision-making about repeating urinalysis is advised, and if hematuria resolves and no new risk factors emerge, discontinuing further evaluation is reasonable. However, new gross hematuria, a significant increase in microscopic hematuria, or new urinary symptoms should trigger renewed evaluation, which aligns with the updated AUA/SUFU guidance [^e6575d8b] [^25396540].

> Next, I should review the key principles to ensure internal consistency: confirm hematuria microscopically before evaluating, risk-stratify to avoid both under- and over-testing, use CT urography judiciously given radiation and contrast risks, maintain a low threshold to evaluate gross hematuria, and remember that glomerular hematuria changes the pathway entirely. These principles reconcile differing guideline perspectives and help deliver high-value care [^96018b79] [^03cefe05] [^6168f0f7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about controversies without acknowledging them explicitly. There is ongoing debate about the optimal imaging modality in low-risk patients, the cost-effectiveness of universal CT urography, and the appropriate thresholds for women. Real-world data show low yield and frequent inappropriate use of CT urography, while emerging tools like risk models and selective biomarkers may refine triage but are not yet substitutes for standard evaluation [^40c77865] [^6cab8586] [^4931467b].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical approach: confirm hematuria on repeat urinalysis excluding contamination, apply AUA/SUFU risk stratification, perform core labs and targeted history/physical, proceed to cystoscopy and upper tract imaging for intermediate/high risk or gross hematuria, consider ultrasound-only in carefully selected low-risk patients, pivot to nephrology when glomerular features are present, and use shared decision-making for follow-up. This balances cancer detection, avoidance of harm, and stewardship of resources while aligning with contemporary guidelines and evidence [^96018b79] [^03cefe05] [^e98cbe93].

Hematuria is the presence of **red blood cells in urine** [^96018b79], either visible (gross) or only detectable by microscopy (microscopic) [^e98cbe93]. It is a **common clinical finding** with a broad differential, including benign causes such as infection, stones, or trauma, and serious diseases such as malignancy or glomerulonephritis [^d5f3a63e] [^46be03bc]. Evaluation should be guided by risk stratification [^4b88a23a], with **cystoscopy and upper tract imaging** (CT urography or ultrasound) for high-risk patients [^03cefe05], and a more selective approach for low-risk patients [^4931467b]. Persistent hematuria warrants further workup to exclude malignancy or glomerular disease [^46be03bc] [^e98cbe93], and management is directed at the underlying cause [^c81a7b28].

---

## Classification

Hematuria is classified as **gross** when visible to the naked eye, indicating a higher likelihood of significant pathology, and as **microscopic** when ≥ 3 RBCs/hpf are seen on microscopy, often incidental but still clinically important [^96018b79] [^258b589d].

---

## Etiology

Hematuria has diverse causes; **common etiologies** include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Glomerular | - IgA nephropathy <br/> - Alport syndrome <br/> - Thin basement membrane disease <br/> - Post-infectious GN [^3c180e7e] [^05ca0dba] |
| Non-glomerular renal | - Stones <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Polycystic kidney disease <br/> - Pyelonephritis [^30764832] [^e9d7b2b0] |
| Lower urinary tract | - Bladder cancer <br/> - Urethral stricture <br/> - Prostatic hypertrophy <br/> - Cystitis [^258b589d] [^d5f3a63e] |
| Systemic | - Coagulopathies <br/> - Anticoagulation <br/> - Sickle cell disease [^b9ef5fa2] [^3cc101bd] |
| Factitious | - Menstrual contamination <br/> - Myoglobinuria [^d5f3a63e] |

---

## Clinical significance

Hematuria is a **marker of underlying disease**; risk of malignancy increases with age, smoking, and gross hematuria [^4b88a23a] [^0212cd2e]. Persistent microscopic hematuria is associated with **chronic kidney disease progression** and end-stage renal disease, particularly in younger patients with glomerular disease [^3c180e7e] [^46be03bc].

---

## Evaluation

### Initial assessment

- **History**: Onset, duration, pain, trauma, infection, family history, medications, smoking [^d50b5e85].
- **Physical exam**: Blood pressure, abdominal/flank tenderness, prostate exam [^d50b5e85].
- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis with microscopy, urine culture, serum creatinine/eGFR [^d50b5e85].

---

### Risk stratification

The AUA/SUFU guidelines stratify patients into **low-, intermediate-, or high-risk** categories based on age, sex, smoking, degree of hematuria, and recurrence, guiding the intensity of evaluation [^4b88a23a] [^96018b79].

---

### Imaging and cystoscopy

- **High-risk patients**: Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging (CT urography preferred) [^03cefe05] [^96018b79].
- **Low-risk patients**: Consider ultrasound or observation with repeat urinalysis [^4931467b] [^36552811].
- **CT urography**: High sensitivity for upper tract malignancy but with radiation and contrast risks [^6cab8586] [^30764832].

---

## Management

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Infection**: Antibiotics and follow-up urinalysis [^f40ab8ed].
- **Stones**: Medical expulsion, lithotripsy, or surgery [^notfound].
- **Malignancy**: Urologic oncology referral and definitive treatment [^notfound].
- **Glomerular disease**: Nephrology referral, blood pressure control, and disease-specific therapy [^af3a1e66] [^5a0953ee].

---

## Follow-up

Follow-up depends on risk and findings; **repeat urinalysis** is advised after treatment of benign causes, and persistent or recurrent hematuria warrants ongoing surveillance or additional evaluation [^e6575d8b] [^f40ab8ed].

---

Hematuria is a **common and potentially serious** finding that requires a structured, risk-based evaluation to identify and treat underlying causes while minimizing unnecessary testing [^96018b79].

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Hematuria and risk for end-stage kidney disease [^3c180e7e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematuria is a common clinical finding requiring medical attention and poses several clinical challenges. The main challenge is to predict the future risk for chronic kidney disease and therefore to design a long-term follow-up evaluation and treatment plan. This review focuses on the risk for subsequent end-stage kidney disease among young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria.

Recent Findings

It has been recently recognized that young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria have an increased risk for end-stage kidney disease, mainly secondary to primary glomerular diseases. These predominantly include IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease, and Alport syndrome. Among these causes, the association with progression to chronic kidney disease is best established for IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome. Thin basement membrane disease had been considered 'benign' by most authors, although recent findings suggest otherwise. In addition, novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic interventions for these conditions have recently been studied.

Summary

Persistent isolated microscopic hematuria confers a risk for future chronic kidney disease, which is dependent on disease context, underlying genetics, environment interactions, and treatment. 'Benign (familial) hematuria' is a misnomer, which we recommend abandoning as it prompts loss to follow-up. Instead, we favor annual/biennial follow-up assessment that should include measurement of blood pressure, urinalysis, and kidney function tests.

### Hematuria in children [^4356fed0]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Children with hematuria require a thorough history and physical examination. Not all children with hematuria require the same investigations. The only laboratory test uniformly required for children with the various presentations of hematuria is a complete urinalysis with a microscopic examination. The rest of the evaluation is tailored according to the pertinent history, physical examination, and other abnormalities on the urinalysis. This article has provided a brief summary of the more common causes of pediatric hematuria and suggestions for tailoring the patient's evaluation according to the presentation. Most causes of hematuria in pediatrics represent medical conditions that often require referral to a pediatric nephrologist. Indications for referral to a urologist are more limited and include stones that do not pass spontaneously or are more than 5 mm in diameter, renal injury from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, or gross hematuria that seems to originate from the urinary tract and is without an identified cause.

### Hematuria [^d5f3a63e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^af3a1e66]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^03cefe05]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^be6c22a1]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

Microscopic and gross hematuria present unique and difficult diagnostic and management challenges in the already complex general surgery patient. This article provides the general surgeon with relevant knowledge in the pathophysiology, anatomy, etiologies, workup, and treatments of hematuria. In addition common causes of hematuria that may be encountered by the general surgeon (including trauma, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, and malignancy), the difficult to manage clinical situation of clot urinary retention is presented. This article provides a urologic framework of thinking for the clinician to best manage a general surgery patient who has hematuria.

Hematuria in ADPKD — practice points advise that "Healthcare providers should be aware of the causes and natural history of hematuria in people with ADPKD to provide proper guidance and, if appropriate, reassurance," and that "Healthcare providers should discuss the possibility of gross hematuria with patients at the time of diagnosis of ADPKD to avoid unnecessary worry if it happens."

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^0212cd2e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and lethality of urinary tract malignancies by sex — "Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign for urinary tract malignancy." In 2017, "there are estimated to be 3.3 times more new cases of bladder cancer in men than in women (60,490 versus 18,540) (6)," and "bladder cancer accounts for approximately 6% of cases of cancer in males" but "accounts for only 2% of cases of cancer in females." For renal cancer, "there are estimated to be 1.7 times more new cases… in men compared with women (40,610 versus 23,380)." Regarding deaths, "Men are 2.2 times more likely to die of urinary tract cancer than women (22,260 versus 9,930 estimated deaths) (6)," and "bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of death in men, but is not in the top 10 for women."

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^8c727380]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of gross hematuria [^96328893]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

---

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^05ca0dba]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^1398985e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^33e6e054]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Hematuria in ADPKD — practice points and management: Healthcare providers should be aware of the causes and natural history of hematuria in people with ADPKD to provide proper guidance and, if appropriate, reassurance, and should discuss the possibility of gross hematuria with patients at the time of diagnosis of ADPKD to avoid unnecessary worry if it happens. Gross hematuria is a common clinical finding that is distressing to people with ADPKD, and early-onset (i.e., at age < 30 years) gross hematuria is associated with more rapid progression of kidney disease in people with ADPKD. Gross hematuria due to cyst rupture generally resolves within 2–7 days with conservative therapy that consists of bedrest, hydration, and analgesics that exclude NSAIDs, except for short-term use (< 1 week) in people with preserved kidney function; antibiotics are not indicated unless gross hematuria is associated with culture-proven infection. If hematuria is painless, it often resolves spontaneously within 1 or 2 days, and immediate medical attention may not be necessary, but patients should increase their fluid intake and monitor for any additional symptoms. With unusual and severe bleeding, percutaneous arterial embolization or even nephrectomy may become necessary, and while the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid has been used in severe gross hematuria or kidney hemorrhage, the possible benefit needs to be balanced with an increased risk of urinary tract obstruction due to clotting, and of thromboembolic events. In children, an episode after a sports event does not mean the child should not participate in sports; however, should hematuria repeatedly occur in a child, avoiding contact sports in which blunt trauma to the kidney is possible may be prudent.

### Imaging of hematuria [^30764832]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria may have a number of causes, of which the more common are urinary tract calculi, urinary tract infection, urinary tract neoplasms (including renal cell carcinoma and urothelial tumors), trauma to the urinary tract, and renal parenchymal disease. This article discusses the current status of imaging of patients suspected of having urologic causes of hematuria. The role of all modalities, including plain radiography, intravenous urography or excretory urography, retrograde pyelography, ultrasonography, and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in evaluation of these patients is discussed. The article highlights the current status of MDCT urography in imaging of patients with hematuria, and discusses various-often controversial-issues, such as optimal protocol design, accuracy of the technique in imaging of the urothelium, and the significant issue of radiation dose associated with MDCT urography.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^15b213b6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^8ced16df]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — risk predictors and diagnostic definition context: Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer, and the 2012 American Urological Association guidelines require only a single positive properly collected specimen with three or more red blood cells per high-power field with no obvious benign cause.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^818fd57c]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^51f25589]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — evaluation scope and evidence indicate the guideline "lowered the age threshold for evaluation from older than 40 years to 35 years," and "the recommended evaluation for all patients meeting the criteria for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (after other causes have been ruled out) includes cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with multiphasic computed tomography (CT) urography, with and without intravenous contrast." The document emphasizes that "'blood' on a dipstick urinalysis is not hematuria, and this finding indicates the need for a microscopic urinalysis to evaluate for red blood cells." Regarding screening, "the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2011 concluded the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults (4)." The evidence strength behind the AUA recommendations "is Grade C," is "primarily… based on data from male patients," and "the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men."

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^6168f0f7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^36552811]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^4e3d1b21]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### AKI associated with macroscopic glomerular hematuria: clinical and pathophysiologic consequences [^efbdeccf]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a common finding in various glomerular diseases. This article reviews the clinical data on glomerular hematuria and kidney injury, as well as the pathophysiology of hematuria-associated renal damage. Although glomerular hematuria has been considered a clinical manifestation of glomerular diseases without real consequences on renal function and long-term prognosis, many studies performed have shown a relationship between macroscopic glomerular hematuria and AKI and have suggested that macroscopic hematuria-associated AKI is related to adverse long-term outcomes. Thus, up to 25% of patients with macroscopic hematuria-associated AKI do not recover baseline renal function. Oral anticoagulation has been associated with glomerular macrohematuria-related kidney injury. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms may account for the tubular injury found on renal biopsy specimens. Mechanical obstruction by red blood cell casts was thought to play a role. More recent evidence points to cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress induced by hemoglobin, heme, or iron released from red blood cells. These mechanisms of injury may be shared with hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria-induced AKI. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the conversion of heme to biliverdin and is protective in animal models of heme toxicity. CD163, the recently identified scavenger receptor for extracellular hemoglobin, promotes the activation of anti-inflammatory pathways, opening the gates for novel therapeutic approaches.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^294e0532]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^4c6873ad]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the long-term risk of cancer after a hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria?

Findings

In this cohort study of 134 173 Danish adults with a hospital-based hematuria diagnosis, a 2-fold increase in risk of bladder and kidney cancers was found 1 to 5 years after the first hematuria diagnosis but was confined to patients who did not undergo cystoscopy within 3 months of their initial hematuria diagnosis. After 1 year, patients had similar risks of both gynecologic and colorectal cancers as the background population, and the risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated.

Meaning

These findings may indicate that hospital-based hematuria diagnosis is a marker of greater cancer risk and may inform follow-up recommendations for hematuria.

### Rare causes of hematuria associated with various vascular diseases involving the upper urinary tract [^808f2544]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria is a commonly encountered symptom of a wide spectrum of diseases, including calculi, tumors, and vascular abnormalities. In rare cases, hematuria is caused by life-threatening vascular diseases. When hematuria is encountered, physicians sometimes fail to include vascular diseases in the differential diagnosis because of their rare association with hematuria. Likewise, radiologists often fail to do so because of the low frequency of occurrence of these diseases. Multidetector computed tomography performed with the bolus injection technique should be the first-line diagnostic test when vascular disease is suspected. Radiologists should be familiar with the various imaging findings of hematuria caused by vascular disease. They should also be familiar with the management options (including endovascular techniques) for hematuria caused by vascular disease, since in some cases affected patients can be treated with interventional procedures.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^96018b79]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline (2020, Amended 2025) — purpose and methodology are outlined as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of microhematuria (MH). OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating hematuria using criteria determined by the expert panel; the initial draft evidence report included evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, and a second search included studies published up to December 2019. Five systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies met the study selection criteria and were chosen to form the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular modality was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low); and evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed, with additional information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence exists. In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA update literature review (ULR) process, which identified 82 studies for full-text review that were published between December 2019 and June 7, 2024; of those 82 studies, 23 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, and the subsequent amendment is based on data released since the initial 2020 publication of this Guideline.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^5a0953ee]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease — additional tests for evaluation of cause (Table 6) describe four categories with examples and key uses. Imaging (ultrasound, intravenous urography, CT kidneys ureters bladder, nuclear medicine studies, MRI) is used to assess kidney structure (i.e., kidney shape, size, symmetry, and evidence of obstruction) for cystic disease and reflux disease, with an evolving role for additional technologies such as 3D ultrasound. Kidney biopsy (ultrasound‑guided percutaneous) specimens are usually examined by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, and may include molecular diagnostics; biopsy is used for exact diagnosis, planning treatment, assessing activity and chronicity of disease, and likelihood of treatment response, and may also be used to assess genetic disease. Laboratory tests include chemistry (acid‑base and electrolytes), serologic tests such as anti‑PLA2R, ANCA, anti‑GBM antibodies, serum‑free light chains with serum and urine protein electrophoresis/immunofixation, and urinalysis/urine sediment; guidance highlights recognition of light chains in kidney disease even without multiple myeloma (monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS)) and states that persistent hematuria or albuminuria is critical in determining differential diagnosis; it also refers to the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases. Genetic testing examples include APOL1, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, NPHS1, UMOD, HNF1B, PKD1, and PKD2, and it is described as evolving as a tool for diagnosis with increased utilization expected and recognition that genetic causes are more common and may present without classic family history.

### Incidence of visible hematuria among antithrombotic agents: a systematic review of over 175, 000 patients [^b9ef5fa2]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the probability of visible hematuria with antithrombotic agents and to evaluate association of urologic etiology in antithrombotic-related hematuria.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review using search engines PUBMED and SCOPUS with the terms "(hematuria) OR (haematuria) OR urinary bleeding)) AND ((anticoagulants) OR anticoagulation) OR noac) OR novel anticoagulants) OR antiplatelet) OR dabigatran) OR rivaroxaban) OR apixaban) OR warfarin) OR aspirin) OR heparin) OR dipyridamole)". Raw data were used to perform a pooled analysis. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analyses.

Results

Twenty-two studies describing 175,114 patients met inclusion criteria. Odds ratio of hematuria with warfarin to rivoraxaban was 33 and warfarin to dabigatran was 16. The odds ratio of hematuria for oral anticoagulant (26.7%) to prophylactic parenteral anticoagulant (1.1%) agents was 9.6. Antiplatelet agents are 76 times less likely to cause hematuria compared to anticoagulants. Odds of hematuria with aspirin were 6.7 times the odds with clopidogrel and 3.5 times the odds with ticagrelor. Dabigatran was 198 times more likely to cause major hematuria compared to warfarin, whereas clopidogrel is 1.2 times more likely to cause major hematuria compared to aspirin. Urologic pathology was identified in 44% (234/532) of cases, malignancy in 24%.

Conclusion

Warfarin use poses the greatest risk for hematuria but is unlikely to cause major hematuria, whereas novel antithrombotic agents are more commonly associated with major hematuria. This review further characterizes the risk profile of antithrombotic agents and associated hematuria to equip clinicians with knowledge to choose an appropriate antithrombotic agent in patients with high-risk hematuria.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^7e1617e0]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

What prior guidelines recommend — evaluation of hematuria in donor candidates includes defined tests and exclusions. Previous guidelines recommend that evaluation of donor candidates for causes of hematuria include urine culture and imaging, cystoscopy if older than 40 years, urine cytology and "complete" urological evaluation. A recent Canadian protocol recommends tests of urine culture, urine cytology, 24-hour urine calcium, metabolic stone workup, and then if the cause of hematuria is undetermined, cystoscopy and a native kidney biopsy. In the absence of an identified cause, evaluation by kidney biopsy has been advised if hematuria is ≥ 1+ or possibly caused by glomerular disease. Although many prior living donor guidelines recommend kidney biopsy for otherwise persistent microscopic hematuria before donation, few articulate criteria for donor selection. The 2011 British Transplantation Society offers a "moderate quality" recommendation that "glomerular pathology precludes donation, with the possible exception of thin basement membrane disease," and Canadian Blood Service's KPD protocol defines IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome (including carrier status) as exclusions to donation. The 2013 Expert Guidelines state that "Individuals with TBMN may be kidney donors if they have normal BP, proteinuria, and renal function" and "a biopsy is done and Alport syndrome is excluded," with close monitoring and nephroprotective strategies advised; they further state that "Living donation from families with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, who have only one of the causative mutated alleles (parents, offspring, some siblings) may be kidney donors" provided specified clinical and genetic conditions are met.

### Glomerular hematuria and the utility of urine microscopy: a review [^e98cbe93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of hematuria and microscopic examination of urine sediment are commonly used tools by nephrologists in their assessment of glomerular diseases. Certain morphological aspects of urine red blood cells (RBCs) seen by microscopy may help in identifying the source of hematuria as glomerular or not. Recognized signs of glomerular injury are RBC casts or dysmorphic RBCs, in particular acanthocytes (ring-shaped RBCs with protruding blebs). Despite being a highly operator-dependent test, urine sediment examination revealing these signs of glomerular hematuria has demonstrated specificities and positive predictive values ranging between 90%-100% for diagnosing glomerular disease, although sensitivity can be quite variable. Hematuria is a commonly used tool for diagnosing patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis such as IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, and lupus nephritis, sometimes even as a surrogate for kidney involvement. Studies examining the role for hematuria in monitoring and predicting adverse outcomes in these diseases have shown inconsistent results, possibly due to inconsistent definitions that often fail to consider specific markers of glomerular hematuria such as dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes, or RBC casts. A consensus definition of what constitutes glomerular hematuria would help standardize use in future studies and likely improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of hematuria as a marker of glomerulonephritis.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^73586f27]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The association of hematuria with CKD outcomes and death in our study was limited to 2 years of follow-up after multivariable adjustments. One of the possible explanations for this time-limited effect is that the assessment of hematuria was restricted to baseline, and that hematuria did not consistently persist throughout follow-up as many potential causes of hematuria are transient, including IgA nephropathy, acute interstitial nephritis, urinary infections, kidney stones, etc. This time-varying association between hematuria and progression of kidney disease or death has not been reported previously. Among CKD cohorts that examined the association between hematuria and progression of kidney disease or death, the follow-up time has been shorter than the median 7.3 years in this study. However, all these studies followed participants for approximately 5 years, a duration of follow-up that should have been long enough to detect the interactions with time, but that may not have been explored. Regardless, as we were unable to track the presence of hematuria throughout follow-up we were limited in our capacity to understand this association after the immediate window of time following the assessment for hematuria. Further, previous studies were not able to implement multivariable adjustment for confounding as extensive as implemented in this study. We believe that the consistent association of hematuria observed across all outcomes within the same time interval, after extensive multivariable adjustment, reinforces the strength of our findings.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^6cab8586]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

is a cardinal clinical symptom with an associated risk of urinary tract cancer. The risk of malignancy in patients who present with macroscopic hematuria is 20.4% and in comparison the risk of malignancy is 5.2% in patients who present with microscopic hematuria. Bladder cancer is the most common cancer detected in microscopic hematuria cases, accounting for 4.8% of those investigated, while renal cancer and UTUC are less common with an incidence of 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.

Recommendations on who should be investigated for microscopic hematuria differ across guideline bodies. While there is a resounding consensus that cystoscopy remains the investigation of choice to visualize the bladder, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal upper tract imaging. RBUS and CTU are the most commonly used imaging modalities. The AUA recommends performing CTU for macroscopic and microscopic hematuria while the United Kingdom NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the ACP (American College of Physicians®) do not specify a recommended imaging modality. Similarly the role of upper tract imaging in patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer also differs among guidelines.

CTU has the highest diagnostic performance for identifying upper tract disease. A meta-analysis suggested that CTU achieves 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC. However, the diagnostic performance of CTU should be balanced against the risk due to intravenous contrast medium. Intravenous contrast administration is associated with a 3% risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients at high risk, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m 2. Prophylaxis hydration was shown to be ineffective. In addition, exposure to ionizing radiation is carcinogenic and there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction, although it is rare.

The DETECT I study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study prospectively recruiting patients referred from primary care physicians to urology departments for investigation following the presentation of hematuria. We report the incidence of upper tract disease and bladder cancer in patients with macroscopic and microscopic hematuria as well as the diagnostic ability of CTU and RBUS to identify upper tract cancer to determine whether CTU can be safely replaced by RBUS in patients who present with microscopic hematuria.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — ACOG and AUGS recommendations for low-risk women: The College and AUGS recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Renal cancer and bladder cancer are more common in men than women.

### Imaging of hematuria [^50dabb2c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

In this article, we will discuss the current status of imaging in patients with hematuria of urologic origin. Issues impacting evaluation of these patients with radiography, excretory urography, retrograde pyelography, and sonography will be discussed.

Conclusion

Conventional radiography has no role in the detection of renal or urothelial carcinoma. Low-dose CT offers much greater sensitivities for the detection of urinary tract calculi than radiography at doses equivalent to conventional radiography. Ultrasound alone is insufficient for imaging of hematuria. Using ultrasound alone, it is often difficult to differentiate renal transitional cell carcinoma from other causes of filling defects of the renal collecting system such as blood clots, sloughed papillae, or fungus balls. The prominence of the role of excretory urography in the evaluation of patients with hematuria has diminished, and MDCT urography is now preferred to excretory urography in most cases.

### Haematuria: the forgotten CKD factor? [^0657b73d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Haematuria is a frequent manifestation of glomerular disease. However, nephrologists devote more attention to the monitoring and therapeutic targeting of another key manifestation of glomerular injury, proteinuria. Recent reports have propelled haematuria to the forefront of clinical nephrology. Thus, glomerular macroscopic haematuria is associated with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) with predominant tubular cell damage and there is increasing evidence for the negative impact of glomerular haematuria-associated AKI on long-term renal function outcome both in the context of IgA nephropathy and in anticoagulated patients. In addition, an epidemiological association between isolated microscopic haematuria in young adults and long-term incidence of end-stage renal disease has been described. Finally, a clearer understanding of how haematuria may cause tubular injury is emerging through detailed histological assessment of human biopsies and experimental models of haemoglobin-mediated nephrotoxicity.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^ee133812]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

No clinical investigation was prompted by the observation of hematuria in our participants so we were unable to identify its source and further understand if the origin of the hematuria (renal vs. urinary tract) affected the magnitude of the association of dipstick hematuria with outcomes. We could not classify different levels of hematuria or the coexistence of pyuria based on the available data. Also, as for the exposure, covariates were assessed only at baseline and residual confounding could have played a role in our findings given the limitations of our observational study design. Lastly, information was missing on multiple covariates that may have created bias despite our use of multiple imputation.

Few novel risk factors have been proven powerful enough to improve upon the capacity to predict renal outcomes using established markers like proteinuria and eGFR level. The C-statistics obtained for our baseline models are very robust making it difficult to improve upon prediction with the addition of information on hematuria. Our category free-NRI analysis suggested that hematuria may be useful for prediction of renal outcomes and death among CKD patients within the 2 years following its first assessment. However, these findings were not supported by the categorical NRI or by improvement in the C-statistics suggesting that the evaluation of hematuria does not substantially improve prediction of risk of progression of CKD.

Given the universal access to the dipstick test for hematuria, we understand our finding imply the value of enhanced testing among individuals with CKD. However, analysis of the predictive value of hematuria and our inability to explore the causes of hematuria do not support the conclusion that screening for hematuria in the setting of CKD should be expanded.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^4931467b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women is less likely to be associated with urinary tract malignancy among women than men, and in women the strongest predictors of urologic cancer are being older than 60 years, a history of smoking, and gross hematuria. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%, and evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Based on these data, the College and AUGS recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^ba2c0402]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematuria is a common urinary abnormality indicative of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the long asymptomatic early phase of CKD, urinalysis was considered a high priority for evaluating patients with suspected kidney diseases that manifest as hematuria. Urine red blood cells (RBCs) count, a strong indicator of hematuria, has true variability in individual patients ranging from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive stages. Fluctuations in urinary component concentration are affected by water intake, exercise, and improper urine sample collection and are associated with the instability of urinary RBC count (URBC). Although limited data are available regarding the test performance of RBCs count, efforts are being made to clarify urine test competence and identify candidates for enhancing the accuracy of hematuria diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to optimize the URBC based routine urinalysis, explore new urinary indexes, and subsequently improve accuracy and stability in hematuria diagnosis and early detection of CKD.

### Utilization and yield of CT urography: are the American Urological Association guidelines for imaging of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria being followed? [^40c77865]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to determine whether patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria undergoing CT urography (CTU) meet the American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation and to determine the yield of CTU for upper tract malignancy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive CTU examinations performed for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adult patients. Patients with clinical evidence suggestive of a benign cause of hematuria (stone, urinary tract infection, trauma) or prior urologic malignancy were excluded. The study group included 419 patients (173 men, 246 women). CT reports were reviewed to identify causes of hematuria in all cases. Evaluate for appropriateness was conducted with 200 randomly allocated patients. Urinalysis results were reviewed, and appropriate use of CTU was defined as more than 3 RBCs per high-power field in the absence of urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy results after CTU were noted.

Results

In total, 58 of 200 patients (29.0%; 95% CI, 23.2–35.6%) did not meet American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation. Fifteen (7.5%) received dipstick analysis only. Thirty-eight (19.0%) had urinalysis results showing 0–2 RBCs per high-power field. Five patients (2.5%) were found to have urinary tract infections. No upper tract urothelial neoplasms were identified (0/419; 95% CI, 0.0–0.9%). One solid renal mass was identified without pathologic confirmation. One possible bladder mass was seen at CTU but not visualized at subsequent cystoscopy.

Conclusion

In 29.0% of examinations, CTU is performed for patients who do not meet the criteria for radiologic evaluation. The yield of CTU for upper urinary tract malignancy is low.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^71e1b03f]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we observed that hematuria was associated with a significantly greater risk of CKD progression and death within the first 2 years after hematuria ascertainment. Our findings should stimulate further investigation of the impact of hematuria with more specific and sensitive testing strategies. Understanding the pattern of hematuria over time and its relationship to clinical outcomes will be important for fully understanding its predictive value in the setting of CKD.

Cancer risk context in women with microscopic hematuria — the risk scoring system suggests that women younger than 50 years have a very low rate of urinary tract cancer; in women without gross hematuria in the previous 6 months, microscopic hematuria was not significantly associated with the risk of urologic cancer; in one screening series, the renal cancer rate was only 0.33%; up to 60% of renal cancers are diagnosed incidentally on imaging for unrelated symptoms.

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^d7fc928b]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common finding in patients presenting to both primary care doctors as well as urologists. Sources of microscopic hematuria include infection, stones, inflammatory disorders as well as cancer of the genitourinary tract, particularly urothelial cancer. A primary focus in the urologic workup of hematuria is to rule out cancer. This is done using radiographic studies as well as procedures such as cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. As the authors state in their article titled "The utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria", cytologic analysis of voided urine, though attractive due to its noninvasive nature, has been found to have the neither the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, nor the ease of administration necessary to replace more invasive diagnostics in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### The COVID-19 nephrology compendium: AKI, CKD, ESKD and transplantation [^cd4abb58]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria (27–53%) and proteinuria (36–66%) are common, with higher rates reported in patients with AKI. Proteinuria is often transient, similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, although the mechanism is not known with certainty. It may be a consequence of fever, systemic inflammation, or possibly direct viral infection of renal epithelium. Nevertheless, the severity of proteinuria and hematuria is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with CoVID-19. Hematuria is often multifactorial in origin, and detailed studies on the mechanism of hematuria are lacking.

Lastly, collapsing glomerulopathy has been reported in the context of COVID-19 infection. Not surprisingly, this lesion has developed in patients homozygous for APOL1 G1 risk alleles. This pattern of injury is most strongly associated with viral infection, particularly HIV and parvovirus. This finding suggests the presence of a high risk APOL1 genotype and may increase the risk for interferon mediated podocyte injury due to CoVID-19. Homozygosity for high-risk APOL1 alleles is present in 14% of African Americans, who collectively represent 12.9% of the US population but have suffered an estimated 25.1% of U.S. COVID-19 deaths. It remains to be determined if infection will lead to increased rates of CKD/ESKD in this population as compared to other groups.

Microscopic hematuria — prevalence, risk, and general evaluation shows that prevalence varies widely (0.18% to 16%), a population study of 1.2 million persons aged 16 to 25 years in Israel found persistent microscopic hematuria in 0.3% of individuals, and long-term renal risk in young persons with persistent asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria included ESKD rates of 34.0 versus 2.05 per 100 000 person-years; participants in that study had serum creatinine values "within the normal range" and 24-hour urine protein less than 200 mg, and the study does not provide information on ESKD risk after comprehensive evaluation and selection including measured kidney function. Urine cytology and urine biomarkers are not recommended as a part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria.

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^8e95026e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The combination of hematuria, proteinuria and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with no previous diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is widely considered a strong indication for kidney biopsy. This study aimed to compare the frequencies of diseases leading to this symptom constellation, and to explore differences related to age and sex using data from kidney biopsy registries in Europe and Japan.

Methods

Data were retrieved from national or regional kidney biopsy registries in Japan, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Austria, Croatia and Turkey from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019. Patients were included if the indication for kidney biopsy was acute/subacute nephritic syndrome, which was defined as a combination of hematuria, proteinuria and reduced GFR in a patient without a prior diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at the time of kidney biopsy.

Results

A total of 1023 patients from Europe and 2477 from Japan were included in the study. The primary cause of acute/subacute nephritic syndrome in both regions was ANCA-associated vasculitis, followed by IgA nephropathy/vasculitis and acute interstitial nephritis. The estimated GFR was higher in Europe than in Japan, at 24 and 20ml/min/1,73m2, respectively. The median age was 10years younger in European patients than in Japanese patients.

Conclusions

The most common underlying causes of acute/subacute nephritic syndrome are ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA nephropathy/vasculitis and acute interstitial nephritis. This study highlights both similarities and differences in the spectrum of underlying diagnoses and clinical presentations across ages, sexes, and geographical regions in patients presenting with acute/subacute nephritic syndrome.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^1bf99601]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has been variably defined over the years. In addition, the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, whether the patient is a man or a woman influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Thus, data support changing current hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Multi-detector row CT urography in the evaluation of hematuria [^6c069952]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Hematuria can be well evaluated with a comprehensive contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) protocol that combines unenhanced, nephrographic-phase, and excretory-phase imaging. Unenhanced images are obtained from the kidneys to the bladder and allow optimal detection of renal calculi, a common cause of hematuria. Renal parenchymal abnormalities, particularly masses, are best visualized on nephrographic-phase images, which also provide excellent evaluation of the other abdominal organs. Thin-section delayed images obtained from the kidneys to the bladder demonstrate the urinary tract distended with contrast material and are useful in detecting urothelial disease. Intravenous urography, ultrasonography, CT, retrograde ureterography and pyelography, cystoscopy, and ureteroscopy can all be used to evaluate patients with hematuria. In the past, a combination of several of these examinations was necessary to fully evaluate these patients. Now, however, this CT protocol may permit evaluation of hematuria patients with a single comprehensive examination, although more experience and data are needed to determine its efficacy in this setting.

### Proteinuria in children [^b9ad5738]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is common in children and may represent a benign condition or a serious underlying renal disease or systemic disorder. Proteinuria may occur secondary to glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Although a 24-hour urine protein excretion test is usually recommended, it may be impractical in children. A spot, first-morning urine test for protein/creatinine ratio can be useful in this situation. Proteinuria is usually benign, in the form of transient or orthostatic proteinuria. Persistent proteinuria may be associated with more serious renal diseases. Clinical features from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests help determine the cause of proteinuria. Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause. Patients with active urinary sediments, persistent and gross hematuria, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, renal insufficiency with depressed glomerular filtration rate, or signs and symptoms suggestive of vasculitic disease may require a renal biopsy and referral to a pediatric nephrologist.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^481a3afa]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective observational study [^bb5c68cb]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Hematuria is an important pathologic finding and thus is included in the criteria for chronic kidney disease. However, its presence is not usually mentioned in large epidemiological studies when compared with proteinuria; most studies in the field of AKI do not focus on the role of hematuria. A few studies described hematuria-associated AKI in certain clinical settings such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy or warfarin-induced nephropathy, but it is difficult to apply these data directly to subjects with a high risk of AKI. For the first time, the present study demonstrates the associations of hematuria with both AKI and mortality in ICU patients. The effect size of hematuria seemed to be small compared with that of proteinuria, but the effects of hematuria (1+ or more) on AKI and mortality were independent of proteinuria with the following adjusted ORs in the hematuria group compared with the non-hematuria group: AKI, 1.88 (1.476–2.386) (P < 0.001); mortality, 1.27 (1.031–1.555) (P = 0.024). Furthermore, the predictability of mortality in the AKI model was improved by the addition of hematuria. Based on the present results, further clinical and experimental studies are needed to delineate the role of hematuria in AKI.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1f59c287]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

USPSTF bladder cancer screening — clinical summary for asymptomatic adults states the population is Asymptomatic Adults with the recommendation No recommendation and Grade: I (Insufficient Evidence). Risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and family or personal history of bladder cancer. Screening tests for bladder cancer include microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and urine biomarkers. The principal treatment for superficial disease is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant chemotherapy, is used for surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer. There is inadequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved morbidity or overall mortality, and there is inadequate evidence on harms of screening for bladder cancer.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^fd2ff268]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The need for such a non-invasive UC risk-assessment tool for patients with hematuria contrasts with skepticism regarding the clinical utility of urine biomarkers and molecular diagnostics in diagnosing UC, particularly predictions that routine use of urine biomarker tests will ultimately increase the use of invasive diagnostic procedures.

The non-invasive Cxbladder urine test can be used to identify patients with hematuria with a low or high probability of UC in its Triage (sensitivity 0.95; negative predictive value 0.98) and Detect (specificity 0.85; sensitivity 0.82) modalities, respectively. Cxbladder has previously demonstrated population-level clinical utility in reducing the net number of diagnostic tests using real world clinical data in a retrospective evaluation of participating urologist's decisions. Specifically, invasive procedures, requested by urologists assessing a real-world sample population of patients with AMH led to all patients ultimately diagnosed with UC receiving a cystoscopy and/or CT scan as part of a diagnostic work-up, in line with the AUA guidelines. There is therefore potential for an increased risk of harm for the one-third of UC-positive cases potentially missed using non-invasive procedures in the baseline case.

Having demonstrated that Cxbladder may decrease the use of invasive tests across a population of patients with AMH, the aim of the present study was to provide greater resolution by investigating the potential change in clinical utility from communicating objective information from Cxbladder tests on the diagnostic decisions made by individual physicians for individual patients with AMH.

Investigating anticoagulant-associated bleeding — evidence summary: No randomized trials have addressed different strategies of investigating bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants, and the evidence found was not of sufficient quality to make a recommendation. Observational findings include hematuria incidence and prevalence of 0.6% and 3.2% in those taking anticoagulants vs 0.08% and 4.5% in controls, subsequent cancer in two of 32 vs one of 11, and neoplastic disease in two of 30 and four of 24 across small series; a retrospective review reported 25% (six of 25) tumors among anticoagulant or aspirin users with gross hematuria. For GI bleeding, a series of 166 patients (100 on antiplatelet or anticoagulant, 66 not) found nine of 88 (10.2%) anticoagulant users had colon cancer vs two of 62 (3.2%) nonusers, and another analysis of 98 warfarin patients found 52 of 71 upper-GI lesions and, on colonoscopy, 26 of 41 lesions including five cancers. In summary, although the data are of low quality, they suggest that there might be sufficient incidence of pathologic causes for VKA-associated hematuria or GI bleeding to warrant investigation.

### Proteinuria and hematuria are associated with acute kidney injury and mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective observational study [^22f9bc26]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Proteinuria and hematuria are both important pathologic findings, but before the present study, we did not know the relationship between these conditions and AKI or mortality in critically ill patients. The present study cannot determine whether reducing the amount of proteinuria or hematuria decreases the risk of AKI or mortality in the ICU subset. Furthermore, although the dipstick test has the advantage of being inexpensive, the cost-effectiveness of the dipstick test is not assured from the study results. However, the present study will form the basis of later studies to address these issues.

IgAN may also present with AKI due to a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with extensive crescent formation, commonly in the absence of visible hematuria, and if visible hematuria is absent and other causes of an RPGN and reversible causes have been excluded, a kidney biopsy should be performed as soon as possible.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^33e08a2e]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Approximately 30% of the studied CKD population had dipstick hematuria at baseline, and the prevalence was greater for lower levels of eGFR and higher levels of albuminuria. During the 24 months following its assessment, hematuria was significantly associated with both CKD progression and death. Despite these associations, incorporating hematuria into risk assessment did not substantively improve prediction of the outcomes of CKD progression or death.

In the general population, the frequency of hematuria is highly variable (0.23 to 17%) and the association between hematuria and renal outcomes in different settings has led to different conclusions. In Okinawa, Japan, a study screening about 100,000 individuals found hematuria to be twice as common among those who developed ESRD, compared to those who did not (18 vs. 9%). In a cohort of more than 170,000 volunteers for health screening in North Carolina, 6.1% of the individuals who developed ESRD had hematuria in contrast to 4.3% of those who did not. Both studies assessed hematuria through dipstick examination, had extended follow-up periods (median of 17 and 25 years, respectively), and detected no association between hematuria and ESRD after multivariable adjustment. In contrast, a study of young adults and adolescents for whom urologic diseases were excluded demonstrated a prevalence of hematuria confirmed by a microscopic exam of only 0.3%. This study, which enrolled 1.2 million individuals, reported a strong association between hematuria and ESRD (HR 18.5; 95%CI:12.4–27.6) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and blood pressure.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^81dcbbfc]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Several clinical prognostic characteristics, including age, gender, smoking history and degree of hematuria, are well-established as risk factors for UC in patients with hematuria. Recently, several groups have attempted to develop models based on clinical prognostic characteristics to predict the risk of UC in patients with hematuria, but critically, these models offer limited accuracy and have largely focused on detecting patients with UC rather than ruling out patients who do not have disease. These detection-focused models have therefore been insufficient to reliably identify patients with disease during a primary evaluation, even if used in combination with urine cytology.

Despite the higher incidence of UC in patients presenting with macrohematuria, a number of studies show there is no significant difference in the distribution of UC by grade and stage in patients presenting with micro- compared with those presenting with macrohematuria. Therefore, the AUA recommends that all patients with macrohematuria or AMH be referred to a urologist for a full urological work-up, as severity of hematuria is not sufficiently predictive for the presence of UC. However, as patients with hematuria may only undergo limited urinalysis in a primary evaluation, consisting of cytology and in some cases imaging studies, such as ultrasound, a full urological work-up is often necessary to conclusively detect or rule out UC. While urine cytology is specified in current guidelines and routinely used in patients with suspected UC, cytology results are often inconclusive with atypical or suspicious findings and also suffer from a low diagnostic yield driven by a relatively high risk of false negative results for patients with UC-related hematuria. Consequently, it can be difficult to rule out benign causes of hematuria, whether macrohematuria or AMH, during a primary evaluation, especially if UC-related hematuria is intermittent and appears to resolve following treatment for a benign cause.

### Persistent hematuria in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis during clinical remission: chronic glomerular lesion or low-grade active renal vasculitis? [^966a36d6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Among the AAV patients who achieved clinical remission after standard immunosuppressive therapy, those with persistent hematuria are not rare. This persistent hematuria may reflect either chronic renal damage or low-grade active renal disease, and the differential diagnosis of these two circumstances is sometimes difficult without renal histology.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^9c439f3d]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As expected, we found an increased risk of cancer, particularly bladder and other urologic cancers, within the first 3 months after diagnosis of hematuria. After more than 5 years of follow-up, the risk of both bladder and other urologic cancers remained slightly elevated. However, the increase in cumulative incidence during 1 to 5 years of follow-up was modest, and the increased risk of urologic cancers was confined to patients without documented cystoscopy. Although the risk of gynecologic and colorectal cancers was increased in the first 3 months after hematuria diagnosis, it was as expected or even lower 1 year after hematuria diagnosis. For liver cancer and hematologic malignant neoplasms, a slightly elevated risk persisted throughout follow-up, but the cumulative incidence was small.

In Denmark, patients with a hospital-based (inpatient or outpatient) diagnosis of hematuria usually have been previously evaluated and referred by a general practitioner for a hospital consultation. As the general practitioner may have ruled out common benign sources of hematuria, referred patients are likely to have a greater risk of underlying cancer compared with patients seen only in primary care. This may explain why the 1.9% 1-year risk of invasive bladder cancer found in this study was higher than the 0.7% 3-year risk of urologic cancer found among patients with microscopic hematuria in the 2004 to 2005 study of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Health Plan.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^e6575d8b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — follow-up after negative evaluation: In patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Evaluation of the new American Urological Association guidelines risk classification for hematuria [^4b88a23a]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microhematuria is a prevalent condition and the American Urological Association has developed a new risk-stratified approach for the evaluation of patients with microhematuria. Our objective was to provide the first evaluation of this important guideline.

Materials and Methods

This multinational cohort study combines contemporary patients from 5 clinical trials and 2 prospective registries who underwent urological evaluation for hematuria. Patients were stratified into American Urological Association risk strata (low, intermediate or high risk) based on sex, age, degree of hematuria, and smoking history. The primary end point was the incidence of bladder cancer within each risk stratum.

Results

A total of 15,779 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 727 patients (4.6%) were classified as low risk, 1,863 patients (11.8%) were classified as intermediate risk, and 13,189 patients (83.6%) were classified as high risk. The predominance of high risk patients was consistent across all cohorts. A total of 857 bladder cancers were diagnosed with a bladder cancer incidence of 5.4%. Bladder cancer was more prevalent in men, smokers, older patients and patients with gross hematuria. The cancer incidence for low, intermediate and high risk groups was 0.4% (3 patients), 1.0% (18 patients) and 6.3% (836 patients), respectively.

Conclusions

The new risk stratification system separates hematuria patients into clinically meaningful categories with differing likelihoods of bladder cancer that would justify evaluating the low, intermediate and high risk groups with incremental intensity. Furthermore, it provides the relative incidence of bladder cancer in each risk group which should facilitate patient counseling regarding the risks and benefits of evaluation for bladder cancer.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^a7b400f3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to repeat urinalysis, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to re-classify low/negligible-risk patients as intermediate- or high-risk based on hematuria on repeat urinalysis, and obtain risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^f077f46a]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The addition of Cxbladder to the decision making by participating physicians evaluating the retrospective patient data showed an increase in the clinical utility from a reduction in the overall diagnostic burden of patients with hematuria. The previous study provided a population-level perspective and demonstrated a reduction in the total number and invasive procedures by 25% and 31%, respectively. The present study extends the analysis at the individual physician-patient level with repeatable outcome results. Specifically the results identified that all participant physicians modified their chosen diagnostic work-ups to reflect the change in risk assessment provided by the addition of Cxbladder test results for each patient, i.e. an escalation or de-escalation of the number and invasiveness of the work-ups appropriately reflecting the change in the probability of UC. Notably, this was often observed as a change in nature or type of the tests and procedures requested, not only the total number. In particular, the prevalence of UC was 3-fold higher in the subset of patients referred for a physician-directed protocol by Cxbladder Triage, providing evidence that the escalation of procedures is appropriate for this subset of patients, while no patients with a negative result had UC, justifying a de-escalation.

Evidence from this study shows that the provision of more objective data on the probability of UC does not result in harm to patients, i.e. a reduced risk of patients who were ultimately diagnosed with UC in the real world not undergoing an appropriate urological work up. On the contrary, more information on the risk of UC is likely to lead to a lowering of the level of variance observed during the diagnostic process to the benefit of patients; high-risk patients may be prioritized, while less invasive diagnostic tests and procedures may be recommended for low-risk patients.

The present data provide evidence that the use of a quantitative tool can guide the selection of diagnostic procedures for up to 20% of the general patient population with AMH. Indeed, presenting Cxbladder test results to urologists led to all patients with UC being allocated guideline-recommended procedures compared with 2/3 of patients with baseline referral data alone.

### Using dipstick urinalysis to predict development of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 [^133dbac1]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The unique kidney pathology associated with COVID-19 highlights the importance of developing AKI risk prediction models specific to this population. Acute tubular necrosis may be a common etiology of AKI, as it is in other hospital settings; however, data also support virus-mediated injury involving cytokine storm, thrombotic microangiopathy, and glomerulonephritis as possible causes of kidney injury in COVID-19. Our findings that proteinuria and hematuria on dipstick urinalysis are associated with increased risk for AKI may suggest presence of subclinical kidney pathology prior to clinically apparent AKI. In other words, if SARS-CoV-2 infection directly affects the tubular epithelium and/or the podocyte, the proteinuria and hematuria seen on urinalysis may represent an earlier phase of AKI that precedes the rise in serum creatinine. Alternatively, the findings could be consistent with the heuristic in nephrology that those with preexisting kidney disease are more at risk for developing AKI in the setting of other acute illnesses supported by the fact that adding CKD presence and baseline creatinine to the model improved the prognostic capability of the model. Given that those who developed AKI carried much higher rates of documented CKD, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, these findings may represent underlying chronic disease rather than acute changes in dipstick urinalysis results. However, given that the risk of AKI was also increased in models that only included proteinuria and hematuria, it is possible to infer that dipstick proteinuria and hematuria are indicative of an active urinary sediment and additional kidney pathology beyond the presence of prior CKD. Overall, our findings support that AKI in the setting of COVID-19 is likely multifactorial and may not be limited to acute tubular necrosis related to severe acute illness.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^a67e8f78]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — scope of review, screening tests, and evidence gaps notes that to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. Primary care–feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers, but no evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons. The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening, and the USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with acute kidney injury (AKI) — AKI can occur with severe visible hematuria, commonly with an upper respiratory tract infection; a repeat kidney biopsy should be considered in patients who fail to show improvement in kidney function within 2 weeks of cessation of the hematuria, and immediate management should be focused on supportive care for AKI. IgAN may also present with AKI due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), often with extensive crescent formation and commonly without visible hematuria; when other causes of RPGN and reversible causes have been excluded, a kidney biopsy should be performed as soon as possible.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^748d6482]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, which is most often associated with causes such as benign prostatic enlargement, infection or urinary calculi, but is also symptomatic of urothelial carcinoma (UC), is estimated to occur in between 1 and 22% of patients in a general population. Macroscopic (macro-) hematuria is characterized by a visible color change in the urine of patients, while microscopic (micro-) hematuria is defined more precisely as the presence of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-powered field (RBCs/HPF) in three concurrently collected urine samples. The overall prevalence of UC in patients with microhematuria has been reported to be approximately 4%, whereas several studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of UC is much higher in patients with macrohematuria, ranging from approximately 12–23%, yet up to four times as many patients with micro- versus macrohematuria present for urological evaluation. Notably, given that recent changes to the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines have seen the threshold for asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH) lowered to ≥ 3 RBCs/HPF in a single sample, and even lower thresholds (≥ 1 RBC/HPF) have been proposed, a consequential increase in the number of patients with hematuria who will undergo a urological work-up to investigate potential UC and a corresponding increase in the overall clinical and financial burden of these patients on healthcare systems is expected.
