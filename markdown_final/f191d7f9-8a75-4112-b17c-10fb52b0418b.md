## Question

Updates in type 2 diabetes care

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest updates in type 2 diabetes care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching paradigm shift from glucose-centric to complications-centric care. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacotherapy and when to escalate early with combination therapy. Next, I will examine cardiorenal risk stratification and the role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. After that, I need to check individualized A1C targets, CGM integration, and lifestyle-first principles. I will then review prediabetes strategies, special populations such as early-onset T2D and CKD, and finally address implementation, equity, and emerging therapies, ensuring each assertion is supported by current guidelines and high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the paradigm shift. Modern care has moved beyond a purely glucose-centric model to a complications-centric approach that prioritizes cardiovascular and renal risk reduction, weight management, and comprehensive risk factor control, with glycemic control integrated rather than isolated, reflecting the interrelated cardiometabolic-renal axis and the need to act early and synchronously rather than sequentially [^113aJx7e] [^115tN3h7] [^116PGRvB].

> I need to verify first-line pharmacotherapy. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent for most patients if tolerated and not contraindicated, but I should double-check that this is framed within a complications-centric mindset rather than a blanket rule, and that early combination therapy is appropriate when hyperglycemia is more severe or when comorbidities warrant faster risk reduction [^117H4U9h] [^111qNBNG] [^112dHfyA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stepwise therapy. For A1C ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy is reasonable. For A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, dual or even triple therapy is advised. And for symptomatic hyperglycemia, A1C > 10%, or glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, basal insulin with or without a GLP-1 RA should be initiated to rapidly restore glycemic control and mitigate catabolism, which aligns with AACE 2023 and ADA/EASD consensus updates [^116YSn1B] [^114o5Fsx] [^117WzJKy].

> Next, I should review cardiorenal risk stratification. In established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular benefit are recommended independent of baseline A1C, and in CKD or heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are foundational. I should confirm that this is consistent across ADA/EASD, ESC, and AACE, and yes, these bodies converge on early, risk-based deployment of these agents [^113aJx7e] [^1144ha62] [^113fNY3E].

> Wait, let me verify the renal-specific guidance. For diabetic kidney disease, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce adverse renal outcomes by roughly 30–40% and are recommended down to eGFR thresholds supported by trial evidence, with GLP-1 RAs offering additional albuminuria and eGFR-decline benefits. KDIGO 2022 and AACE 2023 align on prioritizing these therapies in T2D with CKD, and I should note that finerenone is now part of the contemporary armamentarium in living guidelines for additional cardiorenal protection [^113fNY3E] [^114zUo4G] [^1147GBvf].

> I will now examine individualized A1C targets. AACE supports an optimal A1C ≤ 6.5% when safely achievable, while ADA and ESC emphasize individualization by comorbidity burden, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia risk, and life expectancy. I should confirm that both tighter and less stringent targets are endorsed based on patient factors, and that reassessment at least annually is advised [^116M5KMd] [^1174JCJs] [^116dSSUe].

> Let me think about continuous glucose monitoring. CGM is highly recommended to improve time-in-range and reduce hypoglycemia, with particular value in patients at hypoglycemia risk or on intensive regimens. I should confirm that AACE 2023 explicitly elevates CGM's role and that professional CGM can aid diagnosis and education when personal CGM is not available [^1158rB6p] [^116M5KMd].

> Next, I should review lifestyle-first principles. Lifestyle modification underpins all therapy, with emphasis on ≥ 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training, dietary patterns such as Mediterranean-style eating, intentional weight loss, sleep hygiene, and reduction of sedentary time. I need to ensure these align with ACSM and AACE, which they do [^115tidAc] [^115UbbGt] [^115saLn7].

> I should confirm prediabetes management updates. Structured lifestyle intervention remains first-line, with consideration of weight-loss pharmacotherapy such as semaglutide 2.4 mg, liraglutide 3 mg, or phentermine/topiramate when lifestyle alone is insufficient, and metformin, pioglitazone, or acarbose as pharmacologic options to treat dysglycemia. Bariatric surgery should be considered for BMI > 35 kg/m² with prediabetes, and I should note that while no FDA-approved drug prevents progression to T2D, these agents have trial evidence of benefit [^112pb4Jg] [^111o3CaX].

> But wait, what about early-onset type 2 diabetes. I need to check that adolescents and young adults with T2D face disproportionate risks and that current adult-derived algorithms may underperform; ISPAD and recent Lancet data support aggressive, early risk modification, attention to social determinants, and a lower threshold for intensification given the steep trajectory of complications in this group [^11187i5Q] [^1122S6z8].

> Let me verify implementation and equity considerations. Guidelines increasingly embed SDOH, access, and cost into decision-making, emphasize DSMES to improve outcomes, and call for rapid therapy adjustments every about 3 months to avoid inertia. I should confirm that AACE 2023, ADA 2025, and CDC DSMES guidance converge on these points, which they do [^115tN3h7] [^111BMTFs] [^113HvNGo].

> I will now examine emerging therapies and evolving evidence. Dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonism with tirzepatide demonstrates superior A1C and weight effects and is reflected in updated algorithms, while finerenone adds non-steroidal MR antagonism for cardiorenal protection. Living guidelines are being adopted to keep pace with rapidly evolving evidence, and I should note that ongoing trials will refine sequencing and combinations [^1147GBvf] [^113pCAf6].

> Hold on, I should verify that my synthesis remains patient-centered and reference-aligned. The core updates cohere around four pillars: a complications-centric framing of therapy, early and risk-stratified use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs, individualized A1C targets with CGM-enabled precision, and lifestyle-first, equity-informed implementation with timely escalation to combat inertia, all supported by contemporary ADA/EASD, AACE, ESC, and KDIGO guidance [^113aJx7e] [^114jTmzf] [^1144ha62] [^114zUo4G].

---

The latest updates in type 2 diabetes care emphasize a **complications-centric approach** [^115tN3h7] that prioritizes cardiovascular and renal risk reduction alongside glycemic control [^113aJx7e]. Key changes include **earlier use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists** [^115qj1J7] for patients with ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, regardless of A1C [^113ayVRd], and broader adoption of CGM to guide therapy and reduce hypoglycemia [^1158rB6p]. A1C targets are now individualized [^1174JCJs] based on comorbidities, duration, and hypoglycemia risk [^116dSSUe], and metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated [^117WzJKy]. Early combination therapy is recommended for marked hyperglycemia [^112Vy4C8], and lifestyle interventions, including weight management and physical activity, are foundational [^116nzvSq]. These updates reflect stronger evidence for cardiorenal benefits [^1147GBvf] and a shift toward **patient-centered, outcomes-focused care** [^116qZT8W].

---

## Shift toward a complications-centric approach

Modern guidelines prioritize **cardiovascular and renal risk reduction** [^113aJx7e] alongside glycemic control, reflecting robust evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations, and chronic kidney disease progression [^notfound].

---

## Updated pharmacologic management

### First-line therapy

Metformin remains the **preferred initial therapy** [^111qNBNG] unless contraindicated (e.g. eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^117WzJKy], with continued use as long as tolerated [^117H4U9h].

---

### Second-line therapy

Second-line therapy is **individualized** [^113pBd7W] based on comorbidities, patient preferences, and risk profile:

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Strongly recommended for patients with ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD [^113ayVRd], regardless of A1C, due to proven cardiovascular and renal benefits [^113yfLWv].

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Recommended for patients with ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk [^112phgRT], particularly when weight loss is desired [^117WzJKy].

- **Early combination therapy**: Recommended for patients with marked hyperglycemia (A1C > 1.5% above target) [^112Vy4C8] to achieve faster glycemic control and reduce therapeutic inertia [^112dHfyA].

---

### Insulin therapy

Insulin remains indicated for persistent hyperglycemia despite dual therapy [^114o5Fsx] or when A1C is > 10% or glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL [^116YSn1B]. Basal insulin can be combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists to enhance glycemic control and limit weight gain [^notfound].

---

## Individualized glycemic targets

A1C targets are now **individualized** [^1174JCJs] based on comorbidities, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^113pBd7W] [^116dSSUe]. Less stringent targets (A1C 7.5–8.0%) are appropriate for older adults, those with multiple comorbidities, or high hypoglycemia risk, whereas more stringent targets (A1C < 6.5%) may be suitable for younger, healthier patients without significant hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

---

## Enhanced role of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)

CGM is increasingly recommended to improve glycemic control, reduce hypoglycemia, and guide therapy adjustments [^1158rB6p]. Real-time CGM or intermittently scanned CGM with alerts is particularly beneficial for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness or on intensive insulin regimens [^notfound].

---

## Emphasis on lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions remain foundational, with **greater emphasis on weight management** [^115UbbGt], physical activity, and dietary patterns (e.g. Mediterranean diet) [^1151Dbmu]. Weight loss of 5–10% significantly improves glycemic control and reduces cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

---

## Management of comorbidities

### Cardiovascular disease

Statins are **first-line** [^115NtE51] for dyslipidemia management, with intensity based on ASCVD risk. Blood pressure targets are generally < 130/80 mmHg, individualized based on patient characteristics and tolerance [^1151Dbmu].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

SGLT2 inhibitors are **foundational therapy** [^113fNY3E] for patients with CKD, reducing progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular events [^113fNY3E]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are also recommended for additional cardiovascular and renal benefits [^113fNY3E].

---

## Addressing therapeutic inertia

Guidelines emphasize **regular reassessment** [^111BMTFs] and timely therapy intensification to overcome therapeutic inertia and improve outcomes [^112dHfyA].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists** (e.g. tirzepatide) [^1147GBvf], which show superior glycemic control and weight loss, and oral GLP-1 receptor agonists under development. Personalized medicine approaches, integrating genetic, metabolic, and clinical data, are expected to further optimize treatment strategies [^1114icT8].

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^115Qc2DG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Clinical guidance for diabetes… [^113HvNGo]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and manage all types of diabetes.
- They are often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program or diabetes self-management education and support services. Refer your patients with prediabetes to the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. Research shows that the program can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half. This yearlong program, delivered by a trained Lifestyle Coach, will teach your patients how to eat healthy, increase physical activity, manage stress, and stay motivated. They can also lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke and improve their overall health. Already delivering the lifestyle change program.

Managing diabetes Stay up to date on the latest Diabetes Standards of Care to ensure your patients are receiving timely, equitable, and high-quality care. These guidelines include screenings and management for diabetes and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Your patients manage their diabetes care with regular guidance and support from their health care team. At every health care visit, you and other care team members can encourage them to take the steps needed to manage their diabetes effectively:

- Promoting Ear Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Eye Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Foot Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Medication Management for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Oral Health for People With Diabetes As a health care provider, you know firsthand that these actions are key to preventing complications and enhancing quality of life for people with diabetes.

Living successfully with diabetes means developing the skills to self-manage outside the clinical setting. Diabetes self-management education and support helps people learn practical skills and personalized strategies to manage diabetes in their everyday life. DSMES provides structured support so people with diabetes can make sustainable lifestyle changes with the help of a diabetes care and education specialist. People who participate in DSMES are more likely to have better health outcomes, including lower A1C levels and fewer complications. Diabetes education helps you and your patients.

Recent updates to diabetes treatment guidelines and recommendations

Since publication of EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, a number of national and international guidelines and recommendations for the management of Type 2 diabetes have been updated to include cardiovascular risk reduction as a key consideration, and specifically the use of anti‐hyperglycaemic agents that have demonstrated cardiovascular protection in those with Type 2 diabetes (Table S1). Indeed, some have explicitly named empagliflozin and liraglutide as appropriate choices for the management of people with Type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

Recent updates to international guidelines and recommendations

Several major international guidelines and recommendations on the management of Type 2 diabetes specifically cite EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, and recommend a hierarchical approach to drug selection dependent on the strength of this evidence 3, 48, 49, 50. The updated joint American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement emphasizes a stratification of people based on the presence of pre‐existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before considering which additional glucose‐lowering agent to add as dual therapy (following metformin failure) 51. In those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the ADA/EASD recommend the use of a SGLT‐2i (with a preference for empagliflozin) for those with a diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure or chronic kidney disease, or a GLP‐1RA (with a preference for liraglutide or semaglutide) for those with atherosclerotic disease, as these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality (except semaglutide) when added to standard care 51.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^113fNY3E]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 RA renal guidance: Nearly 50% of U.S. adults with kidney failure have DM, and SGLT2 inhibitors show an approximately 38% reduction in composite adverse renal outcomes; use of an SGLT2i with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy to reduce progression of DKD and CV risk for persons with T2D and DKD with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² if HF is also present. Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m² (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes annually to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Methods

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^116eaHkz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes-fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^112phgRT]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (‐2is) and glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (‐1s) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the. We also consider cost‐effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long‐term outcomes and cost‐effectiveness.

AACE 2023 prediabetes management — Lifestyle intervention specifies regular physical activity with a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises to achieve ≥ 150 minutes per week of moderately intense aerobic exercise over 3 to 5 sessions plus resistance exercise 2 to 3 times per week, which should be added. Pharmacotherapy for weight loss should be considered when lifestyle measures alone are inadequate, with FDA‑approved agents that have shown efficacy including semaglutide 2.4 mg, liraglutide 3 mg, and phentermine/topiramate‑extended release (ER); other FDA‑approved options (naltrexone‑ER/bupropion‑ER, short‑term phentermine, or orlistat) could be considered if the above are not tolerated or accessible. Bariatric procedures are more effective than lifestyle interventions and medications in weight reduction and should be considered in those with prediabetes with a BMI > 35 kg/ m². For prevention of progression, although there are currently no drugs approved by the FDA with an indication to prevent the progression of prediabetes to T2D, metformin, pioglitazone, and acarbose have evidence of efficacy in clinical trials.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^115saLn7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This consensus statement is an update of the 2010 American College of Sports Medicine position stand on exercise and type 2 diabetes. Since then, a substantial amount of research on select topics in exercise in individuals of various ages with type 2 diabetes has been published while diabetes prevalence has continued to expand worldwide. This consensus statement provides a brief summary of the current evidence and extends and updates the prior recommendations. The document has been expanded to include physical activity, a broader, more comprehensive definition of human movement than planned exercise, and reducing sedentary time. Various types of physical activity enhance health and glycemic management in people with type 2 diabetes, including flexibility and balance exercise, and the importance of each recommended type or mode are discussed. In general, the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans apply to all individuals with type 2 diabetes, with a few exceptions and modifications. People with type 2 diabetes should engage in physical activity regularly and be encouraged to reduce sedentary time and break up sitting time with frequent activity breaks. Any activities undertaken with acute and chronic health complications related to diabetes may require accommodations to ensure safe and effective participation. Other topics addressed are exercise timing to maximize its glucose-lowering effects and barriers to and inequities in physical activity adoption and maintenance.

Glucose-centric algorithm for glycemic control (persons without established or high ASCVD/HF/stroke/TIA/CKD risk) — initial therapy and escalation: Metformin should be initiated if there is no contraindication (eg, eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) and started at a low dose titrated over a few weeks to the maximally tolerated dose. Given T2D progression, many will need a second antihyperglycemic medication to reach targets, which usually occurs within 3 months. Agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i are associated with low risk of hypoglycemia unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas. Patients often present with > 1 treatment-shaping factor; in those with overweight/obesity and a weight-loss goal, oral GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT2i are preferred options. For cost/access constraints, a TZD, SU, or glinide would be more economical. Patients with symptomatic hyperglycemia and/or an A1C > 10% should start basal insulin; basal can be initiated with or without a GLP-1 RA, and some may need simultaneous bolus insulin.

Manage hyperglycemia synchronously, rather than in parallel, with patient comorbidities and risk factors

Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiorenal compromise have been classically viewed as separate diagnostic entities and are managed autonomously. These conditions are highly interrelated, however, and should be regarded as coincident conditions. Moreover, these conditions represent overlapping targets for therapy. For example, renal dysfunction continues to be underdiagnosed in patients with diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes and comorbid renal dysfunction are five times more likely to die from cardiovascular causes before reaching kidney failure, highlighting the interrelatedness of the cardiorenal axis with dysglycemia. One study reported a 16-year differential in longevity for individuals with type 2 diabetes with or without renal compromise, stressing the importance of screening and managing renal dysfunction alongside hyperglycemia.

In 2023, an international expert task force issued a dictate for physicians: apply early, intensive, and coordinated approaches across interrelated disease states:

"… all too often, the risk factors for these disorders are not addressed promptly in clinical practice, leading to irreversible pathologic progression… Traditional approaches to treatment involving sequential therapy, in which agents are added only after one has failed, contribute to clinical inertia and often prevent goal attainment, leading to adverse outcomes… in turn contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. In contrast, early diagnosis and prompt, intensive intervention, often with initial combination therapy, leads to faster goal attainment and improved outcomes for at-risk patients".

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^114ALJGY]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK. We also consider cost-effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111PKqb5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^116G6PJt]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

To date, six classes of oral medication have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and several new agents are in the pipeline. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In addition to the currently available drugs, several new agents have recently been introduced or are in the development pipeline. Incretin therapies include both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Non-incretin beta cell stimulants still in development include glucokinase activators, G-protein-coupled receptors, and anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant therapies. Additional agents that target glucose synthesis include glucose-6-phosphatase and glycogen phosphorylase. Other new agents target metabolic syndrome, which is often the first clinical condition that presents in patients at risk for type 2 diabetes. Finally, for obese patients who are unable to lose weight through diet and exercise, weight-loss surgery is an option that should be discussed with their physicians.

### Update and next steps for real-world translation of interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^114HQ7cX]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. They conclude with descriptions of some innovative, pragmatic translational initiatives already under way around the world.

### Personalized management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^1114icT8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Publication of the latest ADA/EASD position statement on type 2 diabetes management has generated strong interest in the concept of a personalized medical approach for individuals with diabetes. However, there are a multitude of pharmacological antihyperglycemic therapies now available, often with incomplete evidence concerning their long-term efficacy, effectiveness, tolerability, and safety. Accordingly, questions remain regarding the best ways to implement the recommendations of the position statement in the care of patients.

Emerging research in genetics, pathophysiology, metabolomics, and human behavior, as well as longer-term, randomized comparative trials could eventually yield new information to inform the personalization of care. In the meantime, we must develop tools to translate existing guidelines into practical clinical applications, and, more importantly, to develop processes that encourage the organized comanagement of patients by primary care providers, specialists, educators, dietitians, and other diabetes HCPs as patients' unique needs and risks require. Another consideration is how well the tools we develop can be implemented around the globe given the differences in pathophysiology among ethnic groups, country-specific resources and medical care infrastructure, training level of providers, and knowledge of patients.

We hope these reflections have provided a broad overview of the evidence deficits and procedural challenges that will need to be overcome to ensure success in our efforts to implement effective, personalized therapy regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### An update on the pharmacotherapy options for pediatric diabetes [^114erxXz]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a frequent endocrine disease during childhood and adolescence. Achieving a good glycemic control is of paramount importance to avoid short- and long-term complications and to allow a normal growth and quality of life.

Areas Covered

This review offers an update on current available treatment strategies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes approved for use in children and adolescents.

Expert Opinion

Although many progresses have been made in the field of diabetes management in children and adolescents, there are still several problems to deal with. With regard to type 1 diabetes, insulin remains the main and essential therapeutic strategy. However, the main issue is to develop a system that allows more physiological insulin coverage and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Adjunct therapies would be invaluable for patients struggling to achieve an acceptable glycemic control. Treatment of type 2 diabetes is based on lifestyle interventions and metformin is the first-line drug for children older than 10 years. As for type 1 diabetes, there is a strong need for developing new drugs to be used alone or in combination.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112kw26g]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Place of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Clinical Guidelines

At present, clinical guidelines for diabetes do not distinguish among drugs of the SGLT2 inhibitor class. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement for the management of hyperglycemia in T2DM recommends a patient-centered approach, selecting treatment strategies (and indeed treatment targets) based on the patient's individual characteristics. This group lists SGLT2 inhibitors along with five other options to use in combination with metformin, although given that there were no available data on CV outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors at the time this position statement was written, further updates may be expected, perhaps also with the results of the LEADER trial. The ADA 2016 Standards of Care in Diabetes discuss the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study results, noting one of the advantages of SGLT2 inhibitors as a class is the association of empagliflozin with a lower CV disease event rate and mortality in patients with CV disease. However, these guidelines continue to list SGLT2 inhibitors among various options, with the recommendation to select therapies based on individual patient needs. The AACE/ACE consensus statement on management of T2DM is updated annually, and the 2016 update included discussion of EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Again, this group continues to list SGLT2 inhibitors among various agents, although they raised the class in the hierarchy of alternative options.

Why has neither group rushed to recommend empagliflozin as first-line treatment, given the excitement around the results? This is clarified in an interim guideline update by the Canadian Diabetes Association, recently issued in response to the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results. They point out that the patients in EMPA-REG OUTCOME not only had a history of CV disease, but fewer than 2% of patients were drug-naïve, and patients typically had long-standing diabetes; therefore, for newly diagnosed (drug-naïve) patients, metformin is recommended as the first choice of agent, along with lifestyle therapy. As with other guidelines, individualizing therapy is recommended, but unlike other guidelines, when a second agent is needed, a history of CV disease is prioritized among the patient characteristics, with empagliflozin the current recommended choice of agent in such patients. As with any drug choice, there would be other factors to consider, such as adverse effects, contraindications, and cost, as well as patient preference.

### Current insights and emerging trends in early-onset type 2 diabetes [^1122S6z8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood is termed early-onset type 2 diabetes. Cases of early-onset type 2 diabetes are increasing rapidly globally, alongside rising obesity. Compared with a diagnosis later in life, an earlier-onset diagnosis carries an unexplained excess risk of microvascular complications, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and earlier death. Women with early-onset type 2 diabetes also have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The high burden of complications renders individuals with early-onset type 2 diabetes at future risk of multimorbidity and interventions to reverse these concerning trends should be a priority. Within the early-onset cohort, disease pathophysiology and interventions have been better studied in paediatric-onset (< 19 years) type 2 diabetes compared to adults; however, young adults aged 19–39 years (a larger number proportionally) are not well characterised and are also invisible in the current evidence base supporting management, which is derived from trials in later-onset type 2 diabetes. Young adults with type 2 diabetes face challenges in self-management that older individuals are less likely to experience (being in education or of working age, higher diabetes distress, and possible obesity-related stigma and diabetes-related stigma). There is a major research gap as to the optimal strategies to deploy in managing type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults, given that current models of care appear to not work as well in this age group. In the face of manifold risk factors (obesity, female sex, social deprivation, non-White European ethnicity, and genetic risk factors) prevention strategies with tailored lifestyle interventions, where needed, are likely to have greater success, but more evidence is needed. In this Review, we draw on evidence from both adolescents and young adults to provide a contemporary update on the current insights and emerging trends in early-onset type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes with ASCVD/high-risk — A1C targets and treatment thresholds: A target A1C of < 6.5% in most nonpregnant adults can be used if safely achieved, whereas less stringent A1C goals (> 7%) should be adopted in specified situations. If further lowering is needed and renal function is eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², metformin should be considered. If the initial A1C is ≥ 7.5%, early combination therapy with 2 agents may be needed, and with initial A1C > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, 2 or 3 antihyperglycemic agents should be initiated concomitantly. If there is symptomatic hyperglycemia, an A1C > 10% and/or BG > 300 mg/dL, basal insulin should be initiated; in this scenario, a combination basal insulin with a GLP-1 RA can also be considered.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease: an update based on rapidly emerging new evidence [^114zUo4G]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

### The management of type 2 diabetes before, during and after COVID-19 infection: what is the evidence? [^112sK4MT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physicians are adapting to a new era in healthcare brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the myriad of challenges faced is the management of patients for whom Covid-19 risk is elevated, especially given the epidemiological evidence that diabetes and cardiovascular disease are major risk factors for severe Covid-19 and mortality.

As experts in diabetology from the Central and Eastern European region, we convened to consider what advice we can provide for clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes, including the large proportion of patients who also present with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk. We note that several recommendations are already published, albeit with some contradictions;– however, we do not feel there are sufficient data available for us to adjudicate between these recommendations or to make our own evidence-based recommendations. Furthermore, we are concerned about the lack of guidance on restarting patients on optimal antidiabetic therapy post-Covid-19, and the potential impact of clinical inertia with regards to optimizing glucose-lowering therapy.

As the pandemic progresses, we expect more evidence to emerge that may help to inform diabetes management in a Covid-19 setting. A first step comes from a real-world report on Covid-19 mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. This nationwide study suggested that the pandemic does not provide grounds to change overall glucose-lowering drug preferences.

In this article, we summarize what is and what is not known about managing type 2 diabetes during the Covid-19 pandemic, discuss recommendations made to date, review the implications of the latest real-world evidence, and make our own suggestions for patients who are returning to normal care after recovery from Covid-19.

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

### Do we need updated guidelines on the use of insulin pump therapy in type 2 diabetes? A review of national and international practice guidelines [^116DaRr4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is used less for type 2 than for type 1 diabetes because of inconsistencies in evidence of effectiveness. We reviewed published guidelines on intensive insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes to assess whether updating of guidance is needed with respect to evidence used and recommendations for CSII in diabetes management.

Methods

A literature review was performed to identify published national and international guidelines on type 2 diabetes management. Searches were performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, and websites of national health care agencies, reimbursement agencies, and professional associations. Searches were limited to articles published in English between 2004 and 2014 and 1666 unique hits were identified, of which 22 were reviewed following screening.

Results

Only 6 of the 22 guidelines identified from North and South America, Western Europe, Greece, and Israel provided specific recommendations on intensive insulin therapy and the role of CSII, and only 1 provided information on the grade of evidence supporting recommendations. Quality appraisal based on the AGREE II tool suggested that published guidelines may have limitations in terms of search methodology and evidence grading, and findings were of mixed rigor and clarity. Only 3 guidelines described the population for whom CSII may be appropriate.

Conclusions

Guidelines need to improve the evidence base, rigor, clarity, and grading of evidence associated with recommendations on intensive insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes. Future updates may benefit from considering recent evidence on the efficacy of CSII in poorly controlled patients on MDI.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^11411GsN]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the recent expansion of antidiabetic agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2is, glycemic control remains suboptimal in many patients. Approximately half of all type 2 diabetic patients in the United States and worldwide fail to achieve the glycemic target of A1c ≥ 7.0%.

Ninety percent of diabetes cases are managed by primary care providers. Guidelines are integral to updating best practices and are especially edifying for general practitioners who maintain a broad knowledge base across numerous medical conditions. Primary care providers are encouraged to apply the most effective treatment parameters in clinical practice rather than relying on specialists. This review seeks to highlight key developments in the field to both provision and empower generalists as well as specialists in dispensing care in line with the latest knowledge in the disease state ready for use in routine care.

The field of type 2 diabetes research has detailed guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology. Many advances, however, see extensive delays in anatomizing research discoveries into clinical approaches. This prudence helps prevent the need to elaborate extensively on areas pending additional research or to deadopt a faulty recommendation. On the other hand, it impedes the timeliness of advances reaching patients. It also sets a deceptively slow rate of change in best practices, contributing to "physician habituation", one contributing aspect to clinical inertia.

In this review, we shortlisted timely leaps in the management of type 2 diabetes — advances that we believe are ready for "prime time". We provide context for selected updates that have already been incorporated into guidelines — context that we feel will edify the rationale for readers and speed adoption into real-world use. Second, we detail several important developments that are yet to be translated to the clinic while these remain either in vigorous debate or in limbo despite a strong body of evidence of the benefit and utility of these having benefit to patients.

Third, this review revisits outmoded dogmas about the basic science of type 2 diabetes — premises that continue to be widely reiterated in physician education but are, in fact, incorrect. Today's type 2 diabetes is "not your mother's type 2 diabetes", that is, our modern understanding of dysglycemia is a departure from old tenets. A correct understanding of beta cell function and dysglycemia is needed for physicians to be in command and optimally control diabetes and its sequelae in their clinics.

### Advances in the clinical management of type 2 diabetes: a brief history of the past 15 years and challenges for the future [^112bbtYu]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress has been made in some aspects of diabetes care over the last 15 years, but there have also been a rising number of challenges that differ between high and low-income countries. In high-income countries, a substantial increase in the use of preventative drugs for cardiovascular disease has lowered vascular complications and improved diabetes survival. More recently, new classes of diabetes drugs have emerged that can variably lower cardiovascular outcomes, new-onset heart failure and slow renal decline, thereby meaningfully increasing the diabetes armoury that should help patients to live even longer lives and with fewer complications. At the other end of the disease spectrum, we can now better prevent diabetes in people who are at elevated risk of developing it, whereas other new research has shown that diabetes remission is possible when lifestyle changes are made in the early years after diagnosis. The downside is that more people than ever before have type 2 diabetes, so despite such progress in high-income countries, the absolute burden of disease is rising. Furthermore, it is rising even faster in low and middle-income countries, where rising adiposity is driving a tidal wave of new diabetes cases; yet, healthcare systems are less able to cope, lacking sufficient drugs, trained personnel and integrated care systems. Thus, despite advances, the future challenges from rising diabetes rates worldwide are daunting.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

### Cardiovascular, kidney related, and weight loss effects of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes: a living clinical practice guideline [^1147GBvf]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Why is the guideline needed?

Type 2 diabetes affects half a billion people worldwide. It is the ninth leading cause of death internationally, and is associated with multi-organ morbidity. Preventing macrovascular and microvascular sequalae including cardiovascular and kidney complications is central to diabetes management. Randomised trials of emerging medications including SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and finerenone (a non-steroidal selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with more potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects and less risk of causing hyperkalaemia than steroidal alternatives like spironolactone) have demonstrated cardiovascular and kidney protective benefits. These medications have contributed to a shift in diabetes management from a long-standing focus on glycaemic control to a focus on reducing the risk of cardiovascular and kidney complications. Trials have also demonstrated substantial weight loss effects with some new medications including GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist.

More evidence is anticipated to address existing and emerging drug classes and their impact on patient-important outcomes. Clinical decision-makers require up-to-date and trustworthy guidance regarding effects of these treatments and how they compare to each other. To accomplish this, practice guidelines should leverage dynamically updated systematic reviews responsive to latest evidence. Moreover, guidelines should incorporate variable prognoses of adults with type 2 diabetes through a risk-stratified approach to recommendations, and explicitly and systematically address patient values and preferences.

In 2021, a previous BMJ Rapid Recommendation on SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes provided risk-stratified recommendations across five risk groups for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Several limitations in the previously adopted risk stratification approach (summarised in MAGICapp), combined with a rapid evolution in evidence and available medications, has underscored the need for the current living practice guideline.

Objective

This consensus statement provides (1) visual guidance in concise graphic algorithms to assist with clinical decision-making of health care professionals in the management of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve patient care and (2) a summary of details to support the visual guidance found in each algorithm.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) selected a task force of medical experts who updated the 2020 AACE Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm based on the 2022 AACE Clinical Practice Guideline: Developing a Diabetes Mellitus Comprehensive Care Plan and consensus of task force authors.

Results

This algorithm for management of persons with type 2 diabetes includes 11 distinct sections: (1) Principles for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes; (2) Complications-Centric Model for the Care of Persons with Overweight/Obesity; (3) Prediabetes Algorithm; (4) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Dyslipidemia; (5) Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Algorithm: Hypertension; (6) Complications-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (7) Glucose-Centric Algorithm for Glycemic Control; (8) Algorithm for Adding/Intensifying Insulin; (9) Profiles of Antihyperglycemic Medications; (10) Profiles of Weight-Loss Medications (new); and (11) Vaccine Recommendations for Persons with Diabetes Mellitus (new), which summarizes recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

Aligning with the 2022 AACE diabetes guideline update, this 2023 diabetes algorithm update emphasizes lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in the management of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus and highlights the importance of appropriate management of atherosclerotic risk factors of dyslipidemia and hypertension. One notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for the treatment of persons with diabetes. The algorithm also includes access/cost of medications as factors related to health equity to consider in clinical decision-making.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^117SQ5ew]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide updated and new evidence-based recommendations for the comprehensive care of persons with diabetes mellitus to clinicians, diabetes-care teams, other health care professionals and stakeholders, and individuals with diabetes and their caregivers.

Methods

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology selected a task force of medical experts and staff who updated and assessed clinical questions and recommendations from the prior 2015 version of this guideline and conducted literature searches for relevant scientific papers published from January 1, 2015, through May 15, 2022. Selected studies from results of literature searches composed the evidence base to update 2015 recommendations as well as to develop new recommendations based on review of clinical evidence, current practice, expertise, and consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development.

Results

This guideline includes 170 updated and new evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the comprehensive care of persons with diabetes. Recommendations are divided into four sections: (1) screening, diagnosis, glycemic targets, and glycemic monitoring; (2) comorbidities and complications, including obesity and management with lifestyle, nutrition, and bariatric surgery, hypertension, dyslipidemia, retinopathy, neuropathy, diabetic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease; (3) management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy and glycemic targets, type 1 diabetes with insulin therapy, hypoglycemia, hospitalized persons, and women with diabetes in pregnancy; (4) education and new topics regarding diabetes and infertility, nutritional supplements, secondary diabetes, social determinants of health, and virtual care, as well as updated recommendations on cancer risk, nonpharmacologic components of pediatric care plans, depression, education and team approach, occupational risk, role of sleep medicine, and vaccinations in persons with diabetes.

Conclusions

This updated clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to assist with person-centered, team-based clinical decision-making to improve the care of persons with diabetes mellitus.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^115tidAc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

American College of Sports Medicine consensus on exercise/physical activity in type 2 diabetes (T2D) updates prior guidance, broadens scope beyond planned exercise, and provides actionable general directives. It states, "This consensus statement is an update of the 2010 American College of Sports Medicine position stand on exercise and type 2 diabetes", and "The document has been expanded to include physical activity, a broader, more comprehensive definition of human movement than planned exercise, and reducing sedentary time". For overall applicability, "In general, the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans apply to all individuals with type 2 diabetes, with a few exceptions and modifications". Practice guidance includes, "People with type 2 diabetes should engage in physical activity regularly and be encouraged to reduce sedentary time and break up sitting time with frequent activity breaks", while safety considerations note, "Any activities undertaken with acute and chronic health complications related to diabetes may require accommodations to ensure safe and effective participation". The statement also emphasizes that "Various types of physical activity enhance health and glycemic management in people with type 2 diabetes, including flexibility and balance exercise", and that it "provides a brief summary of the current evidence and extends and updates the prior recommendations".

Antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy for persons with type 2 diabetes — treatment escalation thresholds specify that for some recently diagnosed individuals with T2D and more severe hyperglycemia (A1C ≥ 7.5%), early combination pharmacotherapy should be considered, usually to include metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia; for newly diagnosed persons with T2D and an entry A1C > 9.0% and/or ≥ 1.5% above target, clinicians should initiate dual- or possibly triple-combination pharmacotherapy usually including metformin, and basal insulin along with noninsulin therapy is recommended if there are significant signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia, especially including catabolism or a very high A1C > 10% (86 mmol/mol) or BG levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L); persons with T2D initially treated with monotherapy who do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets should progress to dual-combination therapy and then triple-combination therapy, if needed, and use a basal insulin to adequately obtain and maintain control.

### A Greek registry of current type 2 diabetes management, aiming to determine core clinical approaches, patterns and strategies [^113ouutg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a multifaceted disease which causes major morbidity and mortality due to micro- and macro- vascular complications. Evidence from key studies established the importance of tight and sustained glycaemic control among type 1 and 2 diabetic patients. Metformin monotherapy should be started at diagnosis of Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) along with lifestyle modifications.

Current treatment guidelines therefore advocate a patient-centred approach, with treatment goals of HbA1c < 7.0% according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Diabetes Association (EASD) and the Hellenic Diabetes Association (HDA) and < 6.5% according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) while they stress the need to modify therapy if HbA1c goal is not met within 3 months.

Nevertheless, despite treatment guidelines, a large proportion of T2DM patients achieve suboptimal goals. The frequency of inadequate glycaemic control is commonly around 50% and even as high as 76%. In the European Study on Cardiovascular Risk Prevention and Management in Usual Daily Practice (EURIKA), HbA1C < 6.5% was reached by 37% of treated patients. Particularly, 44% of patients from Greece achieved HbA1C < 6.5%. Another recent retrospective observational study in Greece showed that the proportion of patients achieving the target of HbA1c < 7% was 53.9% in 2012 versus 56.1% in 2006.

In PANORAMA, an observational study of T2DM patients, assessing glycaemic control and treatment patterns, 37.4% of patients enrolled, had an HbA1c ≥ 7% with a mean HbA1c of 6.9%. Particularly 32.9% of patients from Greece did not achieve HbA1c < 7%, with a mean HbA1c of 6.7%.

Limited data are currently available on T2DM management, daily clinical practice and real-life treatment in Greece to the best of our knowledge. Clearly, an update on glycaemic control in the general population of T2DM patients and a possible assessment of reasons why treatment goals are not achieved is needed. The Disease Registry 'AGREEMENT' was designed to provide a reliable picture of current T2DM management in the public healthcare sector in Greece, aiming to determine clinical approaches, therapeutic strategies, level of compliance with latest international and local guidelines in terms of glycaemic control and therapeutic regimens used.

### Update in the CNS response to hypoglycemia [^1132Jfbv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia remains a major clinical issue in the management of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Research in basic science is only beginning to unravel the mechanisms that: 1) underpin the detection of hypoglycemia and initiation of a counterregulatory defense response; and 2) contribute to the development of defective counterregulation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, particularly after prior exposure to repeated hypoglycemia. In animal studies, the central nervous system has emerged as key to these processes. However, bench-based research needs to be translated through studies in human subjects as a first step to the future development of clinical intervention. This Update reviews studies published in the last 2 yr that examined the central nervous system effects of hypoglycemia in human subjects, largely through neuroimaging techniques, and compares these data with those obtained from animal studies and the implications for future therapies. Based on these studies, it is increasingly clear that our understanding of how the brain responds and adapts to recurrent hypoglycemia remains very limited. Current therapies have provided little evidence that they can prevent severe hypoglycemia or improve hypoglycemia awareness in type 1 diabetes. There remains an urgent need to increase our understanding of how and why defective counterregulation develops in type 1 diabetes in order for novel therapeutic interventions to be developed and tested.

The updated guideline, Oral Pharmacologic Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, was developed by the American College of Physicians and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm — core themes emphasize lifestyle modification and treatment of overweight/obesity as key pillars in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus (DM) care, along with appropriate management of dyslipidemia and hypertension risk factors. A notable new theme is an emphasis on a complication-centric approach, beyond glucose levels, to frame decisions regarding lifestyle/pharmacologic choices, including decisions regarding first-line pharmacologic choices for persons with DM. The algorithm also incorporates access/cost of medications as health equity factors in clinical decision-making, and acknowledges that health care disparities and lack of access to newer medications remain a significant barrier for some persons with DM.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes hypertension targets and treatment recommend that AACE has set a specific BP goal for the majority of adults with T2D as < 130 mm Hg with a diastolic BP goal of < 80 mm Hg, with a lower target considered for persons with micro- or macroalbuminuria, moderate/high risk for or with established ASCVD, peripheral vascular disease, or retinopathy, and recognition that some persons with T2D may not tolerate a goal of < 130/80 mm Hg. Lifestyle therapy is part of initial management, as exercise several times per week is important because there are reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP with endurance and dynamic resistance training, and Mediterranean diets have been demonstrated to lower BP. Pharmacologic therapy specifies that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line therapies for HTN in persons with T2D, particularly in those with DKD; there is no additional benefit for coadministration of an ACEI and an ARB together, and combination may cause harm, an ARB can substitute for ACEI intolerance, and if the initial BP is > 150/100 mm Hg, dual therapy may need to be used at the outset.
