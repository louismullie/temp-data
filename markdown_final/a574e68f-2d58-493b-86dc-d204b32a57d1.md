## Question

How to have more energy in a healthy way.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to increase energy in a healthy way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "energy" means physiologically and how it is generated and regulated. Then, I should verify the core pillars that sustainably raise energy: nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress management. Next, I will examine metabolic flexibility and energy flux as unifying concepts. After that, I need to check for common pitfalls and ineffective or risky "quick fixes". Finally, I will synthesize a practical, personalized plan with monitoring and safety considerations, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate evidence and that I correct any overstatements along the way.

> Let me first confirm what "energy" means in this context; I need to ensure we are not conflating subjective vitality with stimulant-induced arousal. Clinically, sustainable energy reflects efficient mitochondrial ATP production, robust metabolic flexibility, and tight coupling between energy intake and expenditure, with the brain's neuroenergetics also influencing perceived energy and appetite regulation, so I should anchor recommendations to these mechanisms rather than transient stimulants [^114rX94x] [^112mBYTr] [^115JNoMG].

> Next, I should review the core pillars; wait, let me verify that I'm prioritizing the most impactful levers. Nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress management are the principal, evidence-based domains that enhance energy availability and utilization, and I will examine each with attention to mechanisms like mitochondrial function, metabolic plasticity, and appetite–energy coupling before moving to implementation details [^114K3zku] [^113NKdXY] [^113gfjyE].

> I will now examine nutrition. Hold on, I should verify that I'm emphasizing diet quality and timing rather than just caloric load. High-quality, minimally processed diets rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and plant proteins improve mitochondrial efficiency and metabolic flexibility, while time-restricted feeding and calorie-restriction mimetics can enhance metabolic resilience; high-protein approaches modestly increase energy expenditure and improve satiety, and morning-loaded calories may reduce hunger without changing total daily energy expenditure, which can aid adherence to energy-restricted patterns [^114K3zku] [^114rX94x] [^116Pz75z] [^111f5xh4].

> Let me consider physical activity. I should double-check the dose–response and the compensation issue. Regular moderate-to-vigorous activity improves mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic flexibility, but many individuals partially compensate with increased intake, so combining exercise with dietary strategies yields more predictable energy-balance effects; importantly, higher habitual energy turnover (energy flux) improves appetite–expenditure coupling, making energy balance more stable and sustainable over time [^117FF2HK] [^112JAcam] [^115nZ44Z].

> Now, sleep. Wait, I need to ensure I'm not underestimating its impact on energy balance. Short sleep impairs insulin sensitivity, dysregulates leptin and ghrelin, and promotes positive energy balance. Extending sleep to about 7–9 hours in adults reduces objectively measured energy intake and improves daytime energy, so sleep hygiene should be treated as a non-negotiable pillar of energy optimization [^113NKdXY] [^115Uvmui].

> I should confirm the role of stress management. Let me verify mechanistic links to energy. Chronic stress elevates cortisol, which can increase appetite, reduce insulin sensitivity, and impair sleep, thereby disrupting energy homeostasis; mindfulness-based strategies and regular movement can mitigate these effects and indirectly improve perceived and objective energy by stabilizing neuroendocrine signals [^notfound].

> Next, I should review metabolic flexibility and energy flux as unifying concepts. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without tying them to outcomes. Metabolic flexibility — the capacity to switch between carbohydrate and fat oxidation — is trainable via diet and exercise and is tightly linked to mitochondrial fitness, while higher energy flux improves the accuracy of appetite signaling and helps maintain energy balance at a healthy body weight, reducing fatigue and weight-cycling risk [^115tybYT] [^115nZ44Z].

> But wait, what about common pitfalls? I need to check which "energy boosters" are ineffective or harmful. Energy drinks carry risks, especially in youth and those with cardiovascular vulnerability, and there is no high-quality evidence that intravenous vitamin infusions improve energy in the absence of a deficiency; relying on stimulants can mask fatigue without correcting underlying metabolic or behavioral drivers, so I should steer away from these shortcuts [^114K1aFs] [^1169NDTL].

> I will now synthesize a practical plan. Let me first confirm that it is individualized and adherence-focused. A Mediterranean-style or whole-food, plant-forward pattern with adequate protein, fiber, and micronutrients, avoidance of ultra-processed foods, and a consistent eating window can enhance mitochondrial function. Pairing this with at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training, a sleep routine of 7–9 hours with regular timing, and daily stress-reduction practices provides a synergistic foundation. For those with obesity or cardiometabolic risk, a modest caloric deficit of 500–750 kcal/day or 5–10% weight loss improves energy efficiency and reduces fatigue, and all elements should be adapted to preferences, culture, and comorbidities to maximize adherence [^116iwwFP] [^116d4M3C] [^111EkooE] [^113gfjyE].

> Hold on, I should verify how to monitor and adjust. I need to ensure we are tracking meaningful metrics. Subjective energy scales, sleep quality, appetite cues, and objective markers like weight, waist circumference, and fasting glucose can guide iterative changes. For patients with persistent fatigue despite optimizing lifestyle, I should screen for medical contributors such as anemia, thyroid disease, sleep apnea, or medication effects before escalating interventions, and consider structured energy-management principles if chronic fatigue is present [^113gfjyE] [^114dp2pU].

> Let me reconsider one potential overstatement. I initially implied that high-protein diets universally increase energy expenditure by 200–300 kcal/day, but wait, I should verify the magnitude and context. Controlled inpatient studies show that high-protein total diet replacements can increase energy expenditure and improve fat balance in healthy adults, yet the magnitude is modest and varies with diet design and population. Moreover, systematic reviews of isocaloric low- versus high-carbohydrate diets generally find no meaningful TEE difference, though some data suggest attenuation of post–weight-loss TEE decline with lower-carb approaches, so I should present protein's effect as plausible but modest and context-dependent rather than a guaranteed large increase [^116Pz75z] [^113rpwLP].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and actionable: sustainable energy arises from high-quality nutrition, regular and appropriately dosed physical activity, restorative sleep, and stress regulation, all of which enhance mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility. Individualized, adherence-focused implementation, avoidance of stimulant shortcuts, and careful monitoring with medical screening when needed provide the most reliable path to feeling and functioning with more energy in a healthy, evidence-based way [^114rX94x] [^114K3zku] [^113NKdXY] [^113gfjyE].

To boost energy in a healthy way, **prioritize sleep** (7–9 hours nightly) [^notfound], **eat nutrient-dense foods** (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats) [^116igsEZ], and **stay hydrated** (about 8 cups of water daily) [^notfound]. Engage in **regular physical activity** (≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus resistance training) [^116d4M3C] and manage stress with mindfulness or meditation [^notfound]. Avoid energy drinks and excess caffeine; instead, choose natural sources like green tea or coffee in moderation [^115ZHZRt]. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, limit screen time before bed, and seek medical evaluation if fatigue persists to rule out underlying conditions [^notfound].

---

## Nutrition and hydration

- **Balanced diet**: Emphasize whole foods — fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil) [^116iwwFP] — to provide essential nutrients and steady energy [^116igsEZ].

- **Regular meals**: Eat at consistent intervals to maintain stable blood sugar and avoid energy crashes [^notfound].

- **Hydration**: Aim for ~8 cups of water daily; dehydration causes fatigue and cognitive decline [^115ZHZRt].

- **Limit processed foods**: Reduce added sugars, refined carbs, and ultra-processed foods that cause energy spikes and crashes [^113UExYP].

---

## Physical activity

Regular physical activity increases **energy expenditure**, improves cardiovascular function, and enhances overall stamina [^115bT9af]. Engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking, cycling, swimming) [^116d4M3C]. Include resistance training at least twice weekly to improve muscle strength, endurance, and metabolic health. Incorporate more movement throughout the day — such as taking stairs, walking during breaks, and standing desks — to increase daily energy expenditure [^115bT9af].

---

## Sleep and rest

Aim for **7–9 hours of quality sleep per night** to support energy metabolism, cognitive function, and overall health [^notfound]. Maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule to regulate circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality. Avoid screens and bright light before bedtime, and create a dark, quiet, cool sleeping environment [^notfound].

---

## Stress management

Chronic stress depletes energy and contributes to fatigue; **mindfulness, meditation, and deep breathing** can reduce stress and improve energy levels [^notfound]. Organize tasks, set realistic goals, and take regular breaks to prevent burnout and maintain mental clarity.

---

## Avoidance of harmful substances

Limit **caffeine** to moderate amounts (≤ 400 mg/day) and avoid it within 6 hours of bedtime to prevent sleep disruption [^notfound]. Avoid energy drinks, which can cause rapid heart rate, anxiety, and sleep disturbances [^notfound]. Alcohol can impair sleep quality and reduce energy levels; limit intake, especially before bedtime.

---

## Medical evaluation

If persistent fatigue occurs despite healthy habits, **evaluate for underlying medical conditions** such as anemia, thyroid disorders, diabetes, or chronic fatigue syndrome [^114dp2pU].

---

## Healthy energy-boosting strategies

| **Strategy** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Nutrition | - Balanced diet <br/> - Regular meals <br/> - Hydration <br/> - Limit processed foods [^113UExYP] |
| Physical activity | - ≥ 150 min/week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise <br/> - Resistance training <br/> - Increased daily movement [^116d4M3C] |
| Sleep | - 7–9 hours nightly <br/> - Consistent schedule <br/> - Good sleep hygiene [^notfound] |
| Stress management | - Mindfulness <br/> - Meditation <br/> - Time management [^notfound] |
| Avoid harmful substances | - Limit caffeine <br/> - Avoid energy drinks <br/> - Limit alcohol [^notfound] |
| Medical evaluation | Seek evaluation for persistent fatigue [^notfound] |

---

Boosting energy in a healthy way requires a **holistic approach** encompassing nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, and avoidance of harmful substances. Persistent fatigue warrants medical evaluation to identify and treat underlying conditions [^notfound].

### When a calorie is not just a calorie: diet quality and timing as mediators of metabolism and healthy aging [^114K3zku]. Cell Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

An epidemic of obesity has affected large portions of the world, increasing the risk of developing many different age-associated diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. In contrast with the prevailing notion that "a calorie is just a calorie", there are clear differences, within and between individuals, in the metabolic response to different macronutrient sources. Recent findings challenge this oversimplification; calories from different macronutrient sources or consumed at different times of day have metabolic effects beyond their value as fuel. Here, we summarize discussions conducted at a recent NIH workshop that brought together experts in calorie restriction, macronutrient composition, and time-restricted feeding to discuss how dietary composition and feeding schedule impact whole-body metabolism, longevity, and healthspan. These discussions may provide insights into the long-sought molecular mechanisms engaged by calorie restriction to extend lifespan, lead to novel therapies, and potentially inform the development of a personalized food-as-medicine approach to healthy aging.

### Beyond appetite regulation: targeting energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and lean mass preservation for sustainable weight loss [^113BZrfr]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Energy expenditure and energy intake regulation

Energy expenditure has been proposed as a primary driver of energy intake. Changes in energy expenditure are usually matched by changes in energy intake, explaining why therapies that solely modify energy expenditure usually result in less‐than‐expected weight loss. However, even if energy intake generally matches energy expenditure in the long term, low levels of total energy expenditure seem to be linked to appetite dysregulation resulting in enhanced hunger and impaired satiation, favoring hyperphagia. This has led to thinking that the human body can better match energy intake to expenditure at high energy flux. This hypothesis suggests that, if energy expenditure is kept low enough, the drive to eat is not decreased proportionally. This seems to be corroborated by preliminary evidence showing that acute increases in energy flux improve appetite control and reduce the drive to eat. Moreover, the maintenance of high total energy expenditure by increasing voluntary or spontaneous physical activity (or targeting inactivity) is one of the few factors that has been shown to favor successful weight‐loss maintenance. Consequently, the decreased energy expenditure induced by weight loss might, to some extent, oppose the effects exerted by appetite‐regulating drugs on energy intake. Indeed, a positive association between the increase in hunger and metabolic adaptation has been documented, which might explain why metabolic adaptation seems to be a weak predictor of weight‐loss maintenance. Furthermore, the decrease in lean mass in response to weight loss also seems to drive compensatory hyperphagia aiming at restoring the lost lean mass. Pharmacological strategies aimed at sparing lean mass or counteracting metabolic adaptation could therefore provide additional benefits for controlling energy intake, thus triggering larger and more sustainable weight loss.

### Exercise, energy balance and body composition [^112TTecj]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Need of future research

Knowledge about mechanisms behind variation in responses of exercise training on energy balance and body composition is useful to optimize exercise for prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity. The largest part of the response variability is ascribed to exercise-induced changes in energy intake. An answer might come from a large randomized controlled exercise study in sedentary overweight and obese subjects, completed in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01264406). In this study, energy intake will be derived from energy expenditure measured with doubly labeled water, adjusted for changes in body composition. Additional questions to be answered are: what limits exercise-induced fat loss; why does an exercise-induced change in body composition plateau in time; and is exercise intensity and exercise volume critical to reduce fat mass.

Exercise-induced fat loss is limited by the maximum sustained PAL. The doubly labeled water assessed PAL of overweight subjects and obese is similar to the PAL of normal-weight subjects with a mean value around 1.75. Activity-induced energy expenditure is similar or slightly higher in most obese subjects. Obese subjects can move less for the same amount of energy through the increased cost of moving a larger body mass. High body weight leads to high activity-induced energy expenditure, even when moving less than normal-weight subjects. With exercise training, resulting in an additional energy expenditure of 2–3 MJ per day, the PAL reaches its maximum value of 2.0–2.4. Thus, the maximum exercise-induced fat loss is about 0.5 kg per week.

### Metabolic flexibility as an adaptation to energy resources and requirements in health and disease [^117FF2HK]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

It is currently unclear how metabolic flexibility is perturbed in the elderly, because few metabolic flexibility studies have been conducted in late middle-aged and aged populations. One underlying cause to age-related metabolic pathophysiology is a sedentary lifestyle that is steadily increasing in prevalence in the general population and in particular strongly increases as people age. A study in middle-aged postmenopausal women showed that endurance training improved work-related ability to mobilize and oxidize free fatty acids, suggesting that in the elderly metabolic flexibility can still be trained. Importantly, exercise is a principal preventive strategy to improve metabolic flexibility and prolong healthy aging (see "Exercise training").

In summary, on a cellular level, acute metabolic flexibility is a universal property of healthy cells. Metabolic flexibility, and therefore substrate flux, is principally determined by the reciprocity of metabolic circuitries, of which the presence is dependent on the cell's gene and protein expression, nutrient availability and/or demand. On a systemic level, metabolically active organs such as the liver, muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, communicate to best organize the utilization of available fuel. This holistic and vis-à-vis orchestration of available nutrients to sustain whole-body energy homeostasis has ensured organism survival and is therefore interwoven with both healthy and diseased states of metabolism.

### Energy balance: a crucial issue for exercise and sports medicine [^112Xe1e9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Energy flux — a recent concept

Energy flux refers to the rate of energy flow through a system. Recently this concept has been applied to the rate of energy flow in the human body. Mayer et al postulated that individuals with a high rate of energy flow through the body (ie, high intake matched by high expenditure) were better able to maintain energy balance than those with a low rate of energy expenditure. It should be noted that at a very sedentary level, the participants had energy intake similar to that of the highly active individuals. Blundellreferred to a low energy flux as the unregulated zone where energy intake and expenditure were not well matched and where the likelihood of positive energy balance was high. He referred to a moderate and high energy flux as the regulated zone where energy intake was well matched to level of energy expenditure (eg, better appetite control). Energy balance at a high energy flux is seen typically in those with high levels of physical activity. A low energy flux may be an unstable situation that is resolved by increasing body mass, which in turn increases energy expenditure and energy flux. This last point reinforces the 'drive' to maintain a relatively high energy intake which requires either equivalent energy expenditure or energy storage. To maintain a high energy flux in the face of a sedentary lifestyle, there is no option other than significant energy storage.

The fact that food restriction has not proven to be an effective means of long-term weight control is consistent with the flux hypothesis. People need to be in the regulated zone to be better able to match caloric intake to caloric expenditure over long time periods. In addition, drastic caloric restriction by sedentary individuals in an effort to lose body weight creates a number of health concerns including cachexia, reduction in bone density, impaired immune function and fatigue. Finally, the reduced resting metabolic rate resulting from excessive caloric restriction reduces the likelihood of sustained weight management at a lower body weight over time.

Citations and review or study details are documented in Supporting Information Table S6.

Table 1
Summary of findings

Food labeling

We identified 69 systematic reviews in which the scope of the review included food‐labeling initiatives. Six of these exclusively addressed food labeling such as calorie labeling in restaurants. The reviews reported on a variety of acceptability outcomes and obesity measures.

We did not identify any individual study that met inclusion criteria and reported on daily energy consumed or expended with food‐labeling initiatives.

Financial incentives

We identified 68 systematic reviews in which the scope of the review included financial incentives. Of these, six exclusively targeted financial incentives.

Our literature searches in databases and reference mining of the systematic reviews identified one relevant study that reported on daily energy consumed.

Energy consumed

The study evaluated whether incentivizing the purchase of fruits and vegetables and prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious food in a food‐benefit program improves the nutritional quality of participants' diets. The study reported reduced intake of energy (−96 kcal per day; SE, 59.9), but the difference between the intervention and control group was not statistically significant (SMD, 0.10; 95% CI: −0.24 to 0.44; one RCT) 10. The quality of the evidence was downgraded because the result is based on a single study and the consistency across studies could not be assessed.

None of the identified studies reported on children alone.

Energy expended

None of the identified studies reported on energy expended.

### Intranasal insulin suppresses food intake via enhancement of brain energy levels in humans [^115JNoMG]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebral insulin exerts anorexic effects in humans and animals. The underlying mechanisms, however, are not clear. Because insulin physiologically facilitates glucose uptake by most tissues of the body and thereby fosters intracellular energy supply, we hypothesized that intranasal insulin reduces food consumption via enhancement of the neuroenergetic level. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject comparison, 15 healthy men (BMI 22.2 ± 0.37 kg/m²) aged 22–28 years were intranasally administered insulin (40 IU) or placebo after an overnight fast. Cerebral energy metabolism was assessed by ³¹P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. At 100 min after spray administration, participants consumed ad libitum from a test buffet. Our data show that intranasal insulin increases brain energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels). Cerebral energy content correlates inversely with subsequent calorie intake in the control condition. Moreover, the neuroenergetic rise upon insulin administration correlates with the consecutive reduction in free-choice calorie consumption. Brain energy levels may therefore constitute a predictive value for food intake. Given that the brain synchronizes food intake behavior in dependence of its current energetic status, a future challenge in obesity treatment may be to therapeutically influence cerebral energy homeostasis. Intranasal insulin, after optimizing its application schema, seems a promising option in this regard.

### Effect of sleep extension on objectively assessed energy intake among adults with overweight in real-life settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115Uvmui]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Future similarly rigorous intervention studies of longer duration and using objective assessments of energy balance under real-life conditions are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to investigate whether sleep extension could be an effective, scalable strategy for reversing obesity in diverse populations. Along with a healthy diet and regular physical activity, healthy sleep habits should be integrated into public messages to help reduce the risk of obesity and related comorbidities.

### Nutrition myths and healthy dietary advice in clinical practice [^113UExYP]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Healthy dietary intake is important for the maintenance of general health and wellness, the prevention of chronic illness, the optimization of life expectancy, and the clinical management of virtually all disease states. Dietary myths (i.e., concepts about nutrition that are poorly supported or contradicted by scientific evidence) may stand in the way of healthy dietary intake. Dietary myths exist about micronutrients, macronutrients, non-nutrients, and food energy. Representative myths of each type include that patients need to focus on consuming enough calcium to ensure bone health, dietary fat leads to obesity and is detrimental to vascular health, all fiber (whether naturally occurring or artificially added) is beneficial, and food calories translate to pounds of body weight through a linear relationship and simple arithmetic. A common theme for dietary myths is a reductionist view of diet that emphasizes selected food constituents as opposed to whole foods. Healthy dietary advice takes a more holistic view; consistent evidence supports recommendations to limit the consumption of ultraprocessed foods and to eat whole or minimally processed foods, generally in a form that is as close to what occurs in nature as possible. Family physicians can help dispel myths for patients and give sound nutritional advice by focusing on actual foods and broader dietary patterns.

### Physical activity and health: what is the best dose? [^111ogQqE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Given some of the issues cited concerning the representativeness of the PA profile of the cohorts studied by Shiroma et al and the limitations in sensitivity of the methods to differentiate between moderate and vigorous activity, the reported modest additional benefit for men of vigorous‐intensity activity may be questioned. The small additional benefit in only men led the authors to conclude "a focus on moderate‐intensity PA is appropriate". They based this conclusion on their mortality data and a 2011 meta‐analysis that showed no difference in mortality rates between equal volumes (meeting Physical Activity Guideline recommendations) of moderate versus vigorous intensity. Other literature supports a potential additional value for vigorous‐intensity PA. An excellent resource is a 2006 review paper that found lower risk of mortality and better improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, diastolic blood pressure, and glucose control with vigorous‐ versus moderate‐intensity PA when controlling for total energy expenditure (another common measure of PA volume). Interestingly, this review considered both epidemiological studies (mortality) and clinical exercise training studies (cardiovascular risk factors) and found greater benefit for vigorous‐intensity exercise, at equivalent total PA volume, for both types of studies. Although the issue of controlling for total volume of PA is lacking in some clinical training studies comparing various exercise intensities, an abundant body of literature suggests that equal or superior health benefits are derived from vigorous‐intensity PA. An area that seems to be gaining much interest, related to promising findings, is consideration of high‐intensity interval training as an alternative approach to derive health benefits. A recent meta‐analysis reported that this form of training, either as the sole form of training or in combination with continuous training programs, showed much larger‐magnitude increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (maximum oxygen consumption increases of 0.5 to 1.0 L/min) than traditional exercise training programs in previously sedentary adults. Another recent high‐intensity interval training study showed benefits in cardiorespiratory fitness, glucose control, blood pressure, blood lipids, and body fat. The most interesting aspect of this study was the benefit for cardiorespiratory fitness, glucose control, and blood pressure obtained in 10 weeks with as little as one 4‐minute bout exercising at 90% of maximal heart rate for 3 days per week. For these subjects, the total weekly training volume was ≈2 MET‐h/week. This relatively low total volume is a characteristic feature of most high‐intensity interval‐training protocols. High‐intensity interval training has been shown to provide benefit in a wide variety of populations including many disease‐based groups. Despite the lack of consistent findings of additional mortality benefits for the subjects in the study by Shiroma et al, it appears that performing vigorous‐intensity PA can provide a number of health benefits.

### A high-protein total diet replacement increases energy expenditure and leads to negative fat balance in healthy, normal-weight adults [^116Pz75z]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Another potential dietary strategy for body weight management is manipulation of macronutrient intake, particularly high-protein (HP) diets. These diets have gained popularity over the years and their main characteristic is a protein content above recommended values (i.e. for healthy adults aged > 19 y: 0.80 g/kg of body weight/d or 10–35% of total energy intake) with varying levels of carbohydrate and fat intake. High-protein diets are known to increase satiety, energy expenditure (EE), and maintain or increase fat-free mass (FFM), which altogether have been shown to positively affect body weight loss and maintenance.

Taken together, the benefits offered by TDR and HP diets seem to be an interesting combination for weight management. Not surprisingly, these synergistic effects have been noticed by industry and several HP-TDR products are widely available to consumers. Although some well-designed inpatient metabolic studies have already assessed the effects of HP diets on energy and substrate metabolism in healthy individuals, to our knowledge, no inpatient metabolic balance studies have evaluated the exact role of a liquid TDR with an increased protein content on EE, macronutrient oxidation rates and balances, and metabolic blood markers. Additionally, and of extreme importance is the study of this intervention using state-of-the-art methodology in a controlled environment in healthy females and males with a normal body weight to eliminate the confounding effects of obesity and comorbidities on the results. Therefore, the aim of this inpatient metabolic balance study was to compare the impact of a HP-TDR versus a control (CON) diet (North American) on EE, macronutrient oxidation rates and balances, and metabolic blood markers in healthy female and male adults. The primary outcome evaluated was the difference in fat balance between the HP-TDR and CON diets; the secondary outcome was difference in the total EE, with remaining variables as exploratory. It was hypothesized that, compared with the CON diet, participants consuming the HP-TDR would be in negative fat balance, have increased EE, and improved metabolic profile. It was also hypothesized that females and males would respond similarly to the dietary interventions in spite of known sex-related physiological differences.

### A high-protein total diet replacement increases energy expenditure and leads to negative fat balance in healthy, normal-weight adults [^112wXe8N]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

To date, studies investigating the effects of TDRs have been conducted in individuals with obesity and/or comorbidities in a state of negative energy balance with the main objective of weight loss (,–). The presence of several confounding variables in these studies, such as weight loss and comorbidities, hinders our understanding of the real physiological impact of TDRs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare a HP-TDR with a North American diet in healthy young adults of both sexes. In addition to being the first on the topic, this study has several strengths, including its crossover and rigorously controlled feeding design, allowing the detection of small diet effects on energy metabolism variables and metabolic blood markers. Moreover, the use of state-of-the-art technology, such as the WBCU, provided highly accurate and precise results, reflecting the real effects of the dietary interventions. In addition to the design and technology used, the study of both females and males allowed us to explore how different sexes respond to these dietary interventions.

In this study, participants received isocaloric diets that were designed to mimic the North American dietary pattern and a nutritional product commercially available in many countries. For this reason, 1 or more macronutrients could not be kept constant in 1 dietary intervention while others were manipulated in the other intervention. When comparing the macronutrient distribution of the HP-TDR with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range, this dietary strategy can be characterized as HP and low-carbohydrate. Therefore, it is not possible to attribute any of the results observed in this study to a single macronutrient. In addition, this study has other limitations, including the specificity of the population being studied (i.e. healthy, young adults with a normal body weight) and the short-term intervention. These limitations restrict our ability to translate these results to other population groups and longer intervention periods. Therefore, future studies are needed to better understand the long-term effects of this dietary intervention on the physiology of healthy and diseased population groups.

### Estimates of energy intake, requirements and imbalances based on anthropometric measurements at global, regional and national levels and for sociodemographic groups: a modelling study [^113LQhCA]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

An accurate understanding of total energy intake, energy requirements for healthy body weights and the resultant imbalance is important for many aspects of dietary analysis. Despite its importance, existing estimates are highly uncertain and not well aligned with trends in body weight and malnutrition, especially at regionally comparable and global levels. We estimated energy intake, energy requirements and energy imbalances at global, regional, national and sociodemographic levels based on anthropometric measures.

Methods

We used predictive equations for estimating energy requirements derived from a comprehensive database of doubly labelled water studies, and paired them with global datasets on body weight, height and physical activity to estimate a new proxy of energy intake. We calculated energy requirements to attain healthy body weights by applying the predictive equations to a body mass index that minimises risks for weight-related diseases and is classified as normal. We calculated energy imbalances as the difference between the estimated intake and energy requirements to attain healthy body weights.

Results

On average, 2160 kilocalories per person per day (kcal/day) were required in 2020 to sustain measured levels of body weight, height and physical activity (95% CI, 2100 to 2210 kcal/day), ranging from 1980 (95% CI, 1900 to 2060) kcal/day in low-income countries to 2360 (95% CI, 2310 to 2410) kcal/day in high-income countries. The estimated intake exceeded energy requirements to attain healthy body weights by 80 (95% CI, 70 to 100) kcal/day on average, with 192 countries (97%) having average intakes above recommendations, and 6 countries (3%) with intake below, and increasing to 14 (7%) when considering rural residences. Between 1990 and 2020, 50 countries (25%) changed from average intakes below recommendations to intakes above.

Conclusions

Estimating total energy intake based on anthropometric measures captures the regional and temporal trends in body weight, height and physical activity. The estimates can be used as a complementary measure to existing proxies of energy intake. Among other things, they can inform misreporting of intake in dietary surveys, uncertainty in the amount of food wasted and the lack of data on at-home production in food availability statistics. Aligning existing measures of food intake with consistent estimates of overall energy intake could improve dietary analyses and policy planning.

### Impact of energy turnover on the regulation of glucose homeostasis in healthy subjects [^1142jA7d]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different levels of energy turnover (ET; low, medium, and high level of physical activity and the corresponding energy intake) on glucose metabolism at zero energy balance, caloric restriction, and overfeeding.

Methods

Sixteen healthy individuals (13 men, 3 women, 25.1 ± 3.9 years, BMI 24.0 ± 3.2 kg/m²) participated in a randomized crossover intervention under metabolic ward conditions. Subjects passed 3 × 3 intervention days. Three levels of physical activity (PAL: low 1.3, medium 1.6, and high 1.8 achieved by walking at 4 km/h for 0, 3 × 55, or 3 × 110 min) were compared under three levels of energy balance (zero energy balance (EB): 100% of energy requirement (Ereq); caloric restriction (CR): 75% Ereq, and overfeeding (OF): 125% Ereq). Continuous interstitial glucose monitoring, C-peptide excretion, and HOMA–IR, as well as postprandial glucose and insulin were measured.

Results

Daylong glycemia and insulin secretion did not increase with higher ET at all conditions of energy balance (EB, CR, and OF), despite a correspondingly higher CHO intake (Δ low vs. high ET: +86 to 135 g of CHO/d). At CR, daylong glycemia (p = 0.02) and insulin secretion (p = 0.04) were even reduced with high compared with low ET. HOMA–IR was impaired with OF and improved with CR, whereas ET had no effect on fasting insulin sensitivity. A higher ET led to lower postprandial glucose and insulin levels under conditions of CR and OF.

Conclusion

Low-intensity physical activity can significantly improve postprandial glycemic response of healthy individuals, independent of energy balance.

### Timing of daily calorie loading affects appetite and hunger responses without changes in energy metabolism in healthy subjects with obesity [^116rRY7g]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Morning loaded calorie intake in humans has been advocated as a dietary strategy to improve weight loss. This is also supported by animal studies suggesting time of eating can prevent weight gain. However, the underlying mechanisms through which timing of eating could promote weight loss in humans are unclear. In a randomized crossover trial (NCT03305237), 30 subjects with obesity/overweight underwent two 4-week calorie-restricted but isoenergetic weight loss diets, with morning loaded or evening loaded calories (45%:35%:20% versus 20%:35%:45% calories at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively). We demonstrate no differences in total daily energy expenditure or resting metabolic rate related to the timing of calorie distribution, and no difference in weight loss. Participants consuming the morning loaded diet reported significantly lower hunger. Thus, morning loaded intake (big breakfast) may assist with compliance to weight loss regime through a greater suppression of appetite.

### Reaching the healthy people goals for reducing childhood obesity: closing the energy gap [^115JXwc3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The federal government has set measurable goals for reducing childhood obesity to 5% by 2010 (Healthy People 2010), and 10% lower than 2005–2008 levels by 2020 (Healthy People 2020). However, population-level estimates of the changes in daily energy balance needed to reach these goals are lacking.

Purpose

To estimate needed per capita reductions in youths' daily "energy gap" (calories consumed over calories expended) to achieve Healthy People goals by 2020.

Methods

Analyses were conducted in 2010 to fit multivariate models using National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1971–2008 (N = 46,164) to extrapolate past trends in obesity prevalence, weight, and BMI among youth aged 2–19 years. Differences in average daily energy requirements between the extrapolated 2020 levels and Healthy People scenarios were estimated.

Results

During 1971–2008, mean BMI and weight among U.S. youth increased by 0.55 kg/m(2) and by 1.54 kg per decade, respectively. Extrapolating from these trends to 2020, the average weight among youth in 2020 would increase by ∼1.8 kg from 2007–2008 levels. Averting this increase will require an average reduction of 41 kcal/day in youth's daily energy gap. An additional reduction of 120 kcal/day and 23 kcal/day would be needed to reach Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020 goals, respectively. Larger reductions are needed among adolescents and racial/ethnic minority youth.

Conclusions

Aggressive efforts are needed to reverse the positive energy imbalance underlying the childhood obesity epidemic. The energy-gap metric provides a useful tool for goal setting, intervention planning, and charting progress.

### Impact of energy turnover on the regulation of energy and macronutrient balance [^115nZ44Z]. Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Energy turnover, defined as the average daily total metabolic rate, can be normalized for basal metabolic rate in order to compare physical activity level between individuals, whereas normalization of energy turnover for energy intake (energy flux) allows investigation of its impact on regulation of energy partitioning independent of energy balance. Appetite sensations better correspond to energy requirements at a high compared with a low energy turnover. Adaptation of energy intake to habitual energy turnover may, however, contribute to the risk of weight gain associated with accelerated growth, pregnancy, detraining in athletes, or after weight loss in people with obesity. The dose-response relationship between energy turnover and energy intake as well as the metabolic effects of energy turnover varies with the habitual level of physical activity and the etiology of energy turnover (e.g., cold-induced thermogenesis, growth, or lactation; aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise). Whether a high energy turnover due to physical activity or exercise may compensate for adverse effects of overfeeding or an unhealthy diet needs to be further investigated using the concept of energy flux. In summary, the beneficial effects of a high energy turnover on regulation of energy and macronutrient balance facilitate the prevention and treatment of obesity and associated metabolic risk.

### Understanding and addressing the epidemic of obesity: an energy balance perspective [^113vnSze]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

The intent of this paper is to address the obesity epidemic, which is a term used to describe the sudden and rapid increase in obesity rates that began in the 1980s and continues unabated today. Since 1980, the entire population, regardless of starting weight, is gradually gaining weight. This has led to escalating obesity rates and to obesity being considered one of the most serious public health challenges facing the world. At one level, the obesity epidemic is a classic gene-environment interaction where the human genotype is susceptible to environmental influences that affect energy intake and energy expenditure. It is also a problem of energy balance. Understanding the etiology of obesity requires the study of how behavioral and environmental factors have interacted to produce positive energy balance and weight gain. Reversing the epidemic of obesity will require modifying some combination of these factors to help the population achieve energy balance at a healthy body weight. While body weight is strongly influenced by biological and behavioral factors, changes in the environment promoting positive energy balance have been most responsible for the obesity epidemic. Our best strategy for reversing the obesity epidemic is to focus on preventing positive energy balance in the population through small changes in diet and physical activity that take advantage of our biological systems for regulating energy balance. Simultaneously, we must address the environment to make it easier to make better food and physical activity choices. This is a very long-term strategy for first stopping and then reversing the escalating obesity rates, but one that can, over time, return obesity rates to pre-1980s levels.

### Energy metabolism, fuel selection and body weight regulation [^1149irJ1]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Energy homeostasis is critical for the survival of species. Therefore, multiple and complex mechanisms have evolved to regulate energy intake and expenditure to maintain body weight. For weight maintenance, not only does energy intake have to match energy expenditure, but also macronutrient intake must balance macronutrient oxidation. However, this equilibrium seems to be particularly difficult to achieve in individuals with low fat oxidation, low energy expenditure, low sympathetic activity or low levels of spontaneous physical activity, as in addition to excess energy intake, all of these factors explain the tendency of some people to gain weight. Additionally, large variability in weight change is observed when energy surplus is imposed experimentally or spontaneously. Clearly, the data suggest a strong genetic influence on body weight regulation implying a normal physiology in an 'obesogenic' environment. In this study, we also review evidence that carbohydrate balance may represent the potential signal that regulates energy homeostasis by impacting energy intake and body weight. Because of the small storage capacity for carbohydrate and its importance for metabolism in many tissues and organs, carbohydrate balance must be maintained at a given level. This drive for balance may in turn cause increased energy intake when consuming a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. If sustained over time, such an increase in energy intake cannot be detected by available methods, but may cause meaningful increases in body weight. The concept of metabolic flexibility and its impact on body weight regulation is also presented.

In this review, we summarize how NAD⁺ metabolism links energy status with adaptive cellular and organismal responses and how this knowledge can be therapeutically exploited.

### Effect of different doses of supervised exercise on food intake, metabolism, and non-exercise physical activity: the E-MECHANIC randomized controlled trial [^113boyBf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Exercise is recommended for weight management, yet exercise produces less weight loss than expected, which is called weight compensation. The mechanisms for weight compensation are unclear.

Objective

The aim of this study was to identify the mechanisms responsible for compensation.

Methods

In a randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic research center, adults (n = 198) with overweight or obesity were randomized for 24 wk to a no-exercise control group or 1 of 2 supervised exercise groups: 8 kcal/kg of body weight/wk (KKW) or 20 KKW. Outcome assessment occurred at weeks 0 and 24. Energy intake, activity, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured with doubly labeled water (DLW; with and without adjustments for change in RMR), armband accelerometers, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Appetite and compensatory health beliefs were measured by self-report.

Results

A per-protocol analysis included 171 participants (72.5% women; mean ± SD baseline body mass index: 31.5 ± 4.7 kg/m2). Significant (P < 0.01) compensation occurred in the 8 KKW (mean: 1.5 kg; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.2 kg) and 20 KKW (mean: 2.7 kg; 95% CI: 2.0, 3.5 kg) groups, and compensation differed significantly between the exercise groups (P = 0.01). Energy intake by adjusted DLW increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the 8 KKW (mean: 90.7 kcal/d; 95% CI: 35.1, 146.4 kcal/d) and 20 KKW (mean: 123.6 kcal/d; 95% CI: 64.5, 182.7 kcal/d) groups compared with control (mean: -2.3 kcal/d; 95% CI: -58.0, 53.5 kcal/d). Results were similar without DLW adjustment. RMR and physical activity (excluding structured exercise) did not differentially change among the 3 groups. Participants with higher compared with lower compensation reported increased appetite ratings and beliefs that healthy behaviors can compensate for unhealthy behaviors. Furthermore, they increased craving for sweet foods, increased sleep disturbance, and had worsening bodily pain.

Conclusions

Compensation resulted from increased energy intake and concomitant increases in appetite, which can be treated with dietary or pharmacological interventions. Compensation was not due to activity or metabolic changes. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01264406.

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^116yGGPb]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Diet and energy balance — consensus and comparative effectiveness indicate that "Dietary approaches that lead to a reduction in energy intake will be the most effective for treating excess body weight and adiposity", and that "Dietary approaches that reduce portion size can assist in the prevention of weight gain and may contribute to reducing energy intake resulting in weight loss"; additionally, "Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting do not appear to be superior to low-energy intake diets", and "At the population level, one type of diet and macronutrient composition does not appear to be more effective for weight loss when compared to other approaches, provided that these approaches result in similar effects in achieving negative energy balance".

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^114FNe7C]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity — "Potential Areas for Needed Research" are outlined that emphasize integrating physical activity with medical treatments, refining exposure characteristics, and evaluating behavioral and dietary contexts. Priorities include defining the dose (duration, frequency, intensity) of activity when used with antiobesity medications or metabolic/bariatric surgery; examining variability in response across modes, doses, intensities, and timing; and conducting appropriately designed prospective and randomized studies to isolate the roles of bout duration and time of day while controlling total energy expenditure in persons with overweight or obesity. Intensity- and behavior-focused questions include comparing light-intensity with moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity at equal energy expenditure and assessing the health and psychosocial effects of shifting sedentary time to other intensities. Mode-focused gaps include testing different modes that elicit equal energy expenditure and evaluating multi-mode versus single mode approaches. Dietary research needs include assessing weight loss variability across dietary approaches and whether specific diets yield health benefits beyond weight loss and reductions in adiposity. The page also highlights the need for longer-term exercise training studies that integrate metabolic and physiological adaptations with psychological and behavioral responses to better understand mechanisms shaping compensatory eating behavior.

### Physical activity and your weight and health… [^115bT9af]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Regular physical activity provides immediate and long-term health benefits.
- Being physically active can help you maintain a healthy weight.
- How much physical activity you need to maintain a healthy weight varies by individual. Why it's important Regular physical activity provides immediate and long-term health benefits. Being physically active can improve your brain health. Other benefits include stronger bones and muscles and better ability to perform everyday activities. Physical activity also helps:

- Improve sleep quality.
- Reduce high blood pressure and risk of heart disease and stroke.
- Reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.
- Reduce risk of several forms of cancer.
- Reduce arthritis pain and associated disability.
- Reduce risk of osteoporosis and falls.
- Reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, physical activity is important if you are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.

More physical activity increases the number of calories your body uses for energy. Using calories through physical activity, combined with reducing the calories you eat, creates a calorie deficit that results in weight loss. Most weight loss occurs from decreasing calories. However, the only way to maintain weight loss is to engage in regular physical activity. How much physical activity do I need. For overall health, adults need at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. This could be brisk walking 22 minutes a day; 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week; or what works for your schedule. Alternatively, you could do 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week, such as swimming laps. Or you could do an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week. Adults also need at least 2 days a week of muscle-strengthening activity. See recommendations for different groups.

You may need more than the recommended minutes of physical activity a week to maintain your weight. The exact amount of physical activity needed to maintain a healthy weight varies greatly from person to person. To lose weight and keep it off, you will need a high amount of physical activity unless you also adjust your diet to reduce the number of calories you eat and drink. Getting to and staying at a healthy weight requires both regular physical activity and healthy eating patterns. How many calories are used in typical activities. The following tables show calories used in common physical activities at both moderate and vigorous levels.

### Evidence for nutritional benefits in prolonging wellness [^113AAUgE]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Healthy aging involves the interaction between genes, the environment, and lifestyle factors, particularly diet and physical activity. Worldwide, the increase in life span has led to an increase in morbidity and mortality as the result of chronic, lifestyle-influenced diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Nutrient deficiency diseases are giving way to energy imbalances, and links between diet and chronic disease are becoming clearer. The global demographic, epidemiologic, and nutrition transitions are dramatic and point to an urgent need to focus on preventive approaches in health care. Thus, nutrition research has shifted from focusing exclusively on alleviating nutrient deficiencies to also stressing chronic disease prevention. Ongoing initiatives to optimize long-term health and promote healthy aging are based on the concept of functional fitness, ie, the ability to lead an active and healthy life. The Dietary Reference Intakes provide a framework for assessing nutrient adequacy at the population and individual levels. In addition, the Healthy Eating Index provides a single summary measure of diet quality. To effect changes in lifestyles to optimize health as we age, health care providers need to consider all the lifestyle and environmental factors contributing to suboptimal eating and lifestyle patterns.

### Manipulation of dietary amino acids prevents and reverses obesity in mice through multiple mechanisms that modulate energy homeostasis [^117Qehte]. Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Reduced activation of energy metabolism increases adiposity in humans and other mammals. Thus, exploring dietary and molecular mechanisms able to improve energy metabolism is of paramount medical importance because such mechanisms can be leveraged as a therapy for obesity and related disorders. Here, we show that a designer protein-deprived diet enriched in free essential amino acids can 1) promote the brown fat thermogenic program and fatty acid oxidation, 2) stimulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-independent respiration in subcutaneous white fat, 3) change the gut microbiota composition, and 4) prevent and reverse obesity and dysregulated glucose homeostasis in multiple mouse models, prolonging the healthy life span. These effects are independent of unbalanced amino acid ratio, energy consumption, and intestinal calorie absorption. A brown fat-specific activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 seems involved in the diet-induced beneficial effects, as also strengthened by in vitro experiments. Hence, our results suggest that brown and white fat may be targets of specific amino acids to control UCP1-dependent and -independent thermogenesis, thereby contributing to the improvement of metabolic health.

### Exercise for weight loss: further evaluating energy compensation with exercise [^114nzVYw]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2020). Medium credibility.

It is evident, based on the lack of improvement in the present obesity epidemic, that more effective weight-loss treatment strategies are needed. Exercise is commonly prescribed as a treatment option; however, the multi-faceted, complex nature of exercise necessitates careful prescription and consideration for all and interacting variables that may influence the weight loss response. The current findings provide some clarity on relevant variables and set the stage for future research that may further elucidate the role exercise may have or increase its utility in obesity treatment.

### Weight loss effects from vegetable intake: a 12-month randomised controlled trial [^113k4bQH]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

There were necessary controls on energy intakes and the background diet in this study, which made it difficult to expose effects of a single food group, as acknowledged in the literature. Dietary change is not just about desirable foods going into the diet; it is also about taking others out. In a recent publication, we reported that participants with poor baseline dietary patterns lose substantially more weight than those starting with healthy dietary patterns. Future research might test whether shifting eating patterns from a low to a high vegetable intake may have an impact on achieving weight loss by replacing poor quality foods in the total diet.

In conclusion, a dietary energy deficit can be achieved in any number of ways. Advice to consume a healthy low-energy diet including five servings of vegetables per day can lead to sustained weight loss, with associated reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors. In the short term, consuming a higher proportion of the dietary energy as vegetables may support a greater weight loss and the dietary pattern appears sustainable.

What you can do for early nutrition in cystic fibrosis — emphasize a high‑calorie diet and follow CF team guidance on enzymes, vitamins, salt, bowel regimen, and escalation options. It is important to focus on a diet high in calories (especially protein and fat), and the CF nutrition team will focus on your child's growth and add nutritional supplements as needed, ensure correct enzyme, salt, and vitamin dosing, and advise on stool softeners to ensure your child's bowel movements are soft and passing fully. Pancreatic enzymes should be given prior to meals and snacks, and vitamins should be given with a fatty food. Feeding your child can be a struggle; discuss your challenges with your CF care team, and sometimes a feeding tube placed in the stomach is recommended to give your child the extra calorie boost they may need for a strong start to a healthy life.

### Energy and caloric restriction, and fasting and cancer: a narrative review [^111Vjnzn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Dietary interventions have a significant impact on body metabolism. The sensitivity of cancer cells to nutrient and energy deficiency is an evolving characteristic of cancer biology. Preclinical studies provided robust evidence that energy and caloric restrictions could hinder both cancer growth and progression, besides enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Moreover, several, albeit low-powered, clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefits in cancer patients. Future research will inform and firmly establish the potential efficacy and safety of these dietary interventions. Here, we review the current evidence and ongoing research investigating the relationship between various dietary restriction approaches and cancer outcomes.

### Obesity prevention interventions and implications for energy balance in the United States and Mexico: a systematic review of the evidence and meta-analysis [^1167cc6U]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Even the statistically significant effect estimates were relatively small in magnitude. This may follow from the unique nature of the interventions. Modifying the built and social environments will change energy balance only distally. That is, many steps or choices happen between the environmental change and a person's decision to consume what type of and how much food and how physically active they will be. Small effects will be difficult to detect without adequate samples; therefore, many of the studies we reviewed may be underpowered. That is not to say that investigators did not present adequate power estimates. All RCTs included power calculations; however, BMI was often the primary outcome assessed. It may be that because BMI is a consequence of energy balance and further downstream from the intervention, proximal energy intake and expenditure should be considered the primary outcome in power and sample size estimates.

The studies we reviewed relied on recruited participants, so findings may be vulnerable to selection bias. Socially disadvantaged populations have historically been underrepresented in health research 85, 86 which not only threatens generalizability but, often, the missing groups are also those with a high burden of disease. An assessment of selection bias in the reviewed studies is beyond the scope of this paper; however, the evidence should be considered in light of this limitation. We also recognize that our energy intake and expenditure reporting requirement excluded other types of relevant population‐level interventions (e.g. advertising restrictions) 87.

In addition to estimating the effects of included studies, our review identified a critical gap in the literature. Out of hundreds of potentially relevant studies, we had to exclude more than 90% because they did not meet our inclusion criteria, primarily because they did not measure or report energy consumption or expenditure. However, understanding effects on energy consumption and expenditure is needed if we are to understand obesity intervention effects and potential intervention targets.

Whole food, plant-based diets and energy density — calorie reduction strategies and associations: Control of SG can be accomplished, without negative side effects from medication, by reducing consumption of excess calories; this can be done in 1 of 2 ways: either by reducing the volume of food (holding energy density constant) or by reducing the energy density (holding the volume of food constant); in order of effect size, decreasing fat, increasing fruits and vegetables, and increasing water content decrease caloric content in ad libitum eating conditions; consumption of food with lower energy density has been found to produce satiety without feelings of hunger or deprivation, and portion size, independent of greater energy density, has been shown to affect satiety; the dietary pattern that offers the greatest reduction in fat and the greatest increase in fruits and vegetables and water content is a WFPB diet, which in observational studies largely overlaps with a vegan diet and is associated with lower BMI and prevalence of T2D; long-term prevention trials of T2D have applied diets emphasizing healthy dietary patterns with typical protein intake, and the primary goal of prevention of T2D is permanent weight reduction that can be achieved by healthy dietary patterns and increased physical activity.

### Energy balance: a crucial issue for exercise and sports medicine [^117FGZXD]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and type 2 diabetes, are clearly the leading public health problems facing the world in the 21st century. The causes of NCDs are predominately unhealthful lifestyles such as physical inactivity, poor diets, smoking, unhealthful sleep habits and not managing stress effectively. In recent years, obesity rates have increased in most countries, and this problem receives enormous attention, in both the popular media and scientific press. The fundamental cause of increasing rates of obesity is too many people being in a positive energy balance on too many days; but the problem is very complex. From a simple perspective, energy balance is the ratio of energy intake and energy expenditure, and if more calories are consumed than are expended, a person will be in positive energy balance. This excessive energy will be stored in the body, mostly as body fat. Of course maintaining energy balance is a much more complex issue than this simple statement, with numerous environmental, social and physiological factors having a role. Extensive reviews of the energy balance concept have been published in recent years.

### Enhanced axonal response of mitochondria to demyelination offers neuroprotection: implications for multiple sclerosis [^111vEsya]. Acta Neuropathologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no effective neuroprotective therapy for demyelinating disorders, including MS. One strategy is to curtail the increased energy demand of demyelinated axon through drugs that inhibit sodium channels. Although effective in experimental models, these have failed in clinical trials and are poorly tolerated by MS patients. This is perhaps not surprising because they perturb adaptive neuronal firing properties that are required for healthy functioning. An alternative strategy, which we show here, is to boost the energy producing capacity of the demyelinated axon. Previous studies have shown that axonal mitochondrial transport can be increased by targeting mitochondrial biogenesis, through PGC1α over expression, as a potential therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. This potential therapeutic strategy, however, has not been applied to demyelinating disorders. We show that an increased transport of mitochondria from the neuronal cell body to axon makes ARMD more efficient and protects the acutely demyelinated axon. Given the suboptimal nature of the homeostatic ARMD, the strategy of increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and axonal transport is ideally suited for demyelinating disorders. Hence, our findings provide a mechanism that can be therapeutically targeted — within the necessary short time frame — for neuroprotection in demyelinating disorders.

### Metabolic and behavioral compensatory responses to exercise interventions: barriers to weight loss [^114eve2Q]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

An activity-induced increase in energy expenditure theoretically disturbs energy balance (EB) by creating an acute energy deficit. Compensatory responses could influence the weight loss associated with the energy deficit. Individual variability in compensation for perturbations in EB could partly explain why some individuals fail to lose weight with exercise. It is accepted that the regulatory system will readily defend impositions that promote a negative EB. Therefore, a criticism of exercise interventions is that they will be ineffective and futile methods of weight control because the acute energy deficit is counteracted. Compensation for exercise-induced energy deficits can be categorized into behavioral or metabolic responses and automatic or volitional. An automatic compensatory response is a biological inevitability and considered to be obligatory. An automatic compensatory response is typically a metabolic consequence (e.g., reduced resting metabolic rate) of a negative EB. In contrast, a volitional compensatory response tends to be deliberate and behavioral, which the individual intentionally performs (e.g., increased snack intake). The purpose of this review is to highlight the various metabolic and behavioral compensatory responses that could reduce the effectiveness of exercise and explain why some individuals experience a lower than expected weight loss. We propose that the extent and degree of compensation will vary between individuals. That is, some individuals will be predisposed to compensatory responses that render them resistant to the weight loss benefits theoretically associated with an exercise-induced increase in energy expenditure. Therefore, given the inter-individual variability in behavioral and metabolic compensatory responses, exercise prescriptions might be more effective if tailored to suit individuals.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 12 to 18 years old [^111hjjLE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

Interventions that aim to prevent childhood obesity seek to maintain an energy balance that is ideal for the healthy growth and development of the child. All such interventions work either by limiting the amount of energy (calories) consumed or by increasing the amount of energy expended (which includes basal metabolic rate, physical activity and other movement, including sleep and energy required for child growth), or by both limiting the amount of energy consumed and increasing the amount of energy expended. If sustained energy expenditure (normal metabolic demands plus cost of growth) exceeds energy consumed, the child may become malnourished. A severe energy deficit over a prolonged period in childhood, particularly during rapid periods of growth such as adolescence, may have serious negative consequences for growth and development, and these effects are potentially irreversible. Getting the balance of short‐term effectiveness versus a more moderate, safer and sustained energy deficit in the context of childhood obesity prevention interventions 'right' remains a key public health challenge (Emmett 2015).

The safest and most reliable way to ensure an ideal energy balance in growing children is for the child to eat a healthy diet (low in fat and sugar) and be physically active. Most countries have age‐specific recommendations for daily food and drink intake, and physical activity levels. Most interventions that include a diet component promote a low fat or low sugar intake, or both; for example, by replacing sugary drinks with water and high fat snacks with fruit and vegetables. Takeaways and fast food are particularly high in fat, and these are often the target of interventions to prevent obesity. Examples relevant for adolescents include town planning regulations that restrict the presence of mobile food vans and fast‐food outlets close to schools (Brown 2021), limiting vending machine content in schools and other environments where children frequent and play (Kubik 2011), and monitoring the content of packed lunches (Singhal 2010). Voluntary and mandatory school food standards are in place in many countries.

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^111b7X1X]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

ACSM consensus — when combined with an energy-restricted diet, the effect of physical activity on body weight and adiposity is additive to diet and can enhance weight loss by approximately 20% compared to diet alone; the magnitude of these additive effects may occur in a dose–response manner but may be blunted and diminished with greater levels of dietary energy restriction.

### Estimating total energy expenditure to determine energy requirements in free-living children with stage 3 chronic kidney disease: can a structured approach help improve clinical care? [^112kA1gM]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Malnutrition and obesity are complex burdensome challenges in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) management that can adversely affect growth, disease progression, wellbeing, and response to treatment. Total energy expenditure (TEE) and energy requirements in children are essential for growth outcomes but are poorly defined, leaving clinical practice varied and insecure. The aims of this study were to explore a practical approach to guide prescribed nutritional interventions, using measurements of TEE, physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), and their relationship to kidney function.

Design and Methods

In a cross-sectional prospective age-matched and sex-matched controlled study, 18 children with CKD (6–17 years, mean stage 3) and 20 healthy, age-matched, and gender-matched controls were studied. TEE and PAEE were measured using basal metabolic rate (BMR), activity diaries and doubly labeled water (healthy subjects). Results were related to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The main outcome measure was TEE measured by different methods (factorial, doubly labeled water, and a novel device).

Results

Total energy expenditure and PAEE with or without adjustments for age, gender, weight, and height did not differ between the groups and was not related to eGFR. TEE ranged from 1927 ± 91 to 2330 ± 73 kcal/d; 95 ± 5 to 109 ± 5% estimated average requirement (EAR), physical activity level (PAL) 1.52 ± 0.01 to 1.71 ± 0.17, and PAEE 24 to 34% EAR. Comparisons between DLW and alternative methods in healthy children did not differ significantly, except for 2 (factorial methods and a fixed PAL; and the novel device).

Conclusion

In clinical practice, structured approaches using supportive evidence (weight, height, BMI sds), predictive BMR or TEE values and simple questions on activity, are sufficient for most children with CKD as a starting energy prescription.

### Intravenous vitamin injections: where is the evidence? [^1169NDTL]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

The body needs small daily quantities of vitamins and minerals, which are usually obtained from the diet. Intravenous vitamins are used for a few serious medical conditions (eg, malabsorption syndromes with severe vitamin depletion, Wernicke's encephalopathy or critical illness). Intravenous drips containing high doses of various vitamins and minerals (eg, the so-called 'Myers' cocktail') have been promoted in popular culture to 'reduce stress', 'increase energy' or 'boost immunity', with claims that the intravenous route allows faster absorption of vitamins into the bloodstream than if they are taken orally. There is a lack of high-quality evidence to suggest that high-dose vitamin infusions are necessary or offer any health benefit in the absence of a specific vitamin deficiency or medical condition. There may be harms from taking high (non-physiological) quantities of some vitamins and minerals. Licensed forms of injectable vitamins that are prescription-only medicines should not be advertised to the public and should only be supplied and administered by appropriately qualified healthcare professionals.

### Achievement of public health recommendations for physical activity and prevention of gains in adiposity in adults [^116UXWhu]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Physical activity (PA) is considered a cornerstone in weight control and public health guidelines recommend regular participation to prevent gains in adiposity. It may therefore come as a surprise that the cumulative evidence from observational studies to support this is not strong. A weakness of many published observational studies on this topic has been a reliance on a single baseline assessment of PA. Using only the baseline information on PA in a prospective study cause misclassification because of participants often change activity level during follow-up. In turn this causes regression dilution bias and decreases the precision of the estimate of an association between PA and adiposity. Furthermore, because gains in adiposity often are caused by a small average daily energy imbalance over many years, following individuals for longer periods of time is essential to characterize a relationship.

### Optimization of protocols using neuromuscular electrical stimulation for paralyzed lower-limb muscles to increase energy expenditure in people with spinal cord injury [^117715dA]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) could lead to a significant increase in energy expenditure for weight management in able-bodied people. Using NMES to activate paralyzed lower-limb muscles for increasing energy expenditure and subsequently weight management in people with spinal cord injury has not been fully investigated.

What Is New

Using NMES for paralyzed lower-limb muscles can significantly increase energy expenditure with the highest increase for the protocol with more muscles activated and the duty cycle with a shorter rest period (+51%).
Muscle fatigue occurred significantly with the more intense NMES protocols.
Future studies should further optimize the NMES parameters and investigate the long-term effects of NMES.

Obesity is a common secondary health complication in people with spinal cord injury (SCI), with about two of every three persons with SCI being obese and at risk for the metabolic consequences of obesity. Therefore, it is necessary to reach a healthy energy balance and prevent weight gain or achieve weight loss, respectively, in people with SCI.

Reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure or a combination are the possibilities of reaching a healthy energy balance. The SCI affects resting energy expenditure, which is markedly lower (14%–27%) in people with SCI compared with the able-bodied population. Resting energy expenditure is the greatest proportion (60%–80%) of the total daily energy expenditure especially in very sedentary individuals. Because resting energy expenditure is low in SCI, rather extreme dietary requirements, with very low energy intake, might cause a lower suboptimal protein and micronutrient intake, resulting in a higher risk of malnutrition and subsequent health complications. The other way to achieve a healthy energy balance, increasing energy expenditure, might therefore be more rational. By participating in physical exercises such as arm cranking, weight training, or wheelchair sports, people with SCI can gain muscle mass and strength and reduce fat mass. However, not all people with SCI are able or inclined to engage in physical exercise and it was also reported that the energy expenditure in response to exercises could be rather limited in people with SCI, especially in those with a high degree of paralysis, making it difficult to sufficiently increase energy expenditure using only the nonparalyzed muscles.

### A high-protein total diet replacement increases energy expenditure and leads to negative fat balance in healthy, normal-weight adults [^111HZfHn]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total diet replacements (TDRs) are nutritionally complete formula foods designed to replace the whole diet for a specific period of time. In the context of obesity, they may facilitate weight loss. Considering the prevalence of obesity worldwide and its impact on the population's health, TDRs are becoming increasingly popular as a weight management strategy; however, research around this topic has not kept pace with its growth in popularity. To our knowledge, only a few studies have evaluated the effects of TDRs in humans to date. Studies were mostly long-term intervention trials with all participants presenting with obesity and sometimes with type 2 diabetes. Interventions consisted of calorie-restricted TDRs and the primary outcome was mainly weight loss, which might have influenced all other variables assessed. None of these studies examined energy metabolism, only some measured metabolic blood markers (,–), and no studies looked at potential sex differences.

### Healthy eating tips… [^116igsEZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance Most people in the United States need to increase their intake of dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. This page includes a few quick and easy tips on how to make healthy dietary choices. Background Good nutrition is about consistently choosing healthy foods and beverages. Healthy eating patterns can include foods and beverages that reflect preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations. Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein. Dairy recommendations include low-fat or fat-free milk, lactose-free milk, and fortified soy beverages. Other plant-based beverages do not have the same nutritional properties as animal's milk and soy beverages. Protein recommendations include seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes, soy products, nuts, and seeds.

Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started. Bump up fiber Fiber helps maintain digestive health and helps us feel fuller longer. Fiber also helps control blood sugar and lowers cholesterol levels. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds are good sources of fiber. To bump up fiber, try this: Add more potassium Potassium helps the kidneys, heart, muscles and, nerves function properly. Not getting enough potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones. People with chronic kidney disease and people taking certain medications may have too much potassium in their blood. But most people in the United States need to consume more potassium. See food sources of potassium.

To replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats, try this:

- Replace whole milk in a smoothie with low-fat yogurt and an avocado.
- Sprinkle nuts or seeds on salads instead of cheese.
- Use beans or seafood instead of processed or high-fat meats as a source of protein.
- Cook with oil instead of butter or margarine.
- Try canola, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, or sunflower oil.
- Try canola, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, or sunflower oil.
- Replace full-fat milk and cheese with low-fat or fat-free versions.

### A nutrigeroscience approach: dietary macronutrients and cellular senescence [^115rPD4n]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Cellular senescence, a process in which a cell exits the cell cycle in response to stressors, is one of the hallmarks of aging. Senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-a heterogeneous set of secreted factors that disrupt tissue homeostasis and promote the accumulation of senescent cells-reprogram metabolism and can lead to metabolic dysfunction. Dietary interventions have long been studied as methods to combat age-associated metabolic dysfunction, promote health, and increase lifespan. A growing body of literature suggests that senescence is responsive to diet, both to calories and specific dietary macronutrients, and that the metabolic benefits of dietary interventions may arise in part through reducing senescence. Here, we review what is currently known about dietary macronutrients' effect on senescence and the SASP, the nutrient-responsive molecular mechanisms that may mediate these effects, and the potential for these findings to inform the development of a nutrigeroscience approach to healthy aging.

### Do low-carbohydrate diets increase energy expenditure? [^113rpwLP]. International Journal of Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Proponents of low-carbohydrate diets have claimed that such diets result in a substantial increase in total energy expenditure (TEE) amounting to 400–600 kcal/day thereby providing patients with a "high calorie way to stay thin forever". However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled feeding studies found no meaningful TEE effects comparing isocaloric diets with equivalent amounts of protein but varying in their proportion of carbohydrate to fat. Nevertheless, it is possible that these past studies may have failed to create the appropriate conditions to reveal the hypothesized increase in TEE during a low-carbohydrate diet.

For example, low-carbohydrate diets may attenuate the usual reduction in TEE that occurs after weight loss. In support of this possibility, Ebbeling et al. recently reported that a low-carbohydrate diet significantly increased TEE by ~200–300 kcal/day compared with a high-carbohydrate diet during maintenance of lost weight. Here, we critically examine this conclusion by reanalyzing the data of Ebbeling et al. to investigate whether the reported diet differences in TEE were commensurate with other measurements, robust to various assumptions, and obeyed the physical law of energy conservation.

### Exercise for weight loss [^112JAcam]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Negative energy balance and subsequent weight loss can be achieved by either reducing energy intake or increasing energy expenditure, the latter usually by exercise. Exercise-induced weight loss, however, is usually small, and smaller than expected from an exercise-induced increase in energy expenditure. In this issue of the Journal, Martin et al. try to identify mechanisms for the phenomenon termed "weight compensation" in response to exercise in overweight and obese participants.

Nearly 200 women and men were randomly assigned to receive 3 treatments over 24 wk: no-exercise control, 8 kcal · kg body weight –1 · wk –1 supervised exercise (8 KKW), or 20 kcal · kg body weight –1 · wk –1 supervised exercise (20 KKW). Outcome measures, as assessed at baseline and week 24, included energy expenditure, energy intake, and body composition. Energy expenditure increased in the exercise groups as expected, without compensatory metabolic or activity changes. However, weight loss was only 36.2% and 40.8% of predicted values in the 8- and 20-KKW groups, respectively, indicating that compensation was noted at both exercise levels. (Indeed, 42.4% of the subjects in the 8-KKW group and 23.5% in the 20-KKW group did not lose weight or even gained weight.) Participants compensated by increasing energy intake (an average of 90.7 kcal/d in the 8-KKW group and 123.6 kcal/d in the 20-KKW group).

### Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for promoting healthy behaviour or improving health outcomes [^111Htxs2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic diseases are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Much of this burden can be prevented by adopting healthy behaviours and reducing chronic disease risk factors. Settings-based approaches to address chronic disease risk factors are recommended globally. Sporting organisations are highly prevalent, and engage many people in many countries. As such, they represent an ideal setting for public health interventions to promote health. However, there is currently limited evidence of their impact on healthy behaviour and health outcomes as previous systematic reviews are either limited in their scope (e.g. restricted to professional sporting organisations), or are out of date.

Objectives

Primary: to assess the benefits and harms of interventions implemented through sporting organisations to promote healthy behaviours (including physical activity, healthy diet) or reduce health risk behaviours (including alcohol consumption, tobacco use). Secondary: to assess the benefits and harms of these interventions to promote health outcomes (e.g. weight), other health-related behaviours (e.g. help-seeking behaviour) or health-related knowledge; to determine whether benefits and harms differ based on the characteristics of the interventions, including target population and intervention duration; to assess unintended adverse consequences of sporting organisation interventions; and to describe their cost or cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database and two clinical trial registries, from inception to May 2024, to identify eligible trials. We searched Google Scholar in May 2024. We did not impose language or publication status restrictions. We also searched reference lists of included trials for other potentially eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-RCTs, of any intervention conducted within or using a sporting organisation for access to a target group, that aimed to improve a health behaviour primary outcome or a secondary review outcome, and had a parallel control group (no intervention, alternative intervention). Eligible participants were any individual exposed to an intervention involving a sporting organisation, including players, members, coaches, and supporters.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to synthesise results where we could pool data from at least two trials. Where we could not conduct meta-analysis, we followed Cochrane guidance for synthesis using other methods and reported results according to the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidance.

Main Results

We included 20 trials (42 trial arms, 8179 participants) conducted in high-income countries, and identified four ongoing trials and four trials awaiting classification. There was considerable heterogeneity in the type of participants, interventions and outcomes assessed across trials. Included trials primarily targeted sporting organisation members (eight trials) or supporters (eight trials), males only (11 trials) and adults (14 trials). Football clubs (e.g. soccer, American football, Australian football league) were the most common intervention setting (15 trials), and interventions targeted various combinations of health behaviours, knowledge and health outcomes. Fourteen trials (10 RCTs and four cluster-RCTs) assessed the impact of a sporting organisation intervention on a primary outcome: physical activity (nine trials); diet (six trials); alcohol consumption (11 trials); and tobacco use (two trials). For RCTs, we assessed the risk of bias for primary outcomes (physical activity, diet, alcohol consumption) and unintended adverse consequences as being at low risk of bias (four outcomes), some concerns (one outcome) or high risk of bias (32 outcomes), due to outcomes being self-reported. For cluster-RCTs, we assessed the risk of bias for all primary outcomes (alcohol consumption, tobacco use) as high risk (eight outcomes), due to outcomes being self-reported. Sporting organisation interventions versus control probably have a small positive effect on the amount of physical activity per day, equivalent to approximately 7.4 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.49; I² = 3%; 4 trials, 1213 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may not reduce sedentary behaviour (mean difference (MD) -15.18, 95% CI -30.82 to 0.47; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 1047 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sporting organisation interventions versus control may have a moderate positive effect on fruit and vegetable consumption, equivalent to a score increase of 1.25 points on a 12-point scale for frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.65; I² = 0%; 5 trials, 1402 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sporting organisation interventions versus control may reduce sugary drink consumption (equivalent to a reduction of sugary drink consumption by 0.8 times per day), but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.10; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sporting organisation interventions versus control may have little to no effect on alcohol consumption (equivalent to a reduction of 0.38 units of alcohol consumed per week), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.38, 95% CI -1.00 to 0.24; I² = 78%; 7 trials, 2313 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials that could not be synthesised reported equivocal findings on tobacco use (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of sporting club interventions on unintended adverse consequences. Five trials assessed this outcome, with two reporting that there were no adverse consequences, one reporting only non-serious adverse consequences, and two reporting that there were serious unintended adverse consequences in less than 1% of participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, sporting organisation interventions probably increase MVPA by 7.4 minutes per day, may result in little to no difference in sedentary behaviour, and may increase fruit and vegetable consumption. The evidence is very uncertain about whether sporting organisation interventions decrease sugary drink and alcohol consumption. Findings for tobacco use and unintended adverse consequences were equivocal in the few trials reporting these; thus, the evidence was very uncertain. These findings should be interpreted in the context of the heterogeneity of the interventions, participants and sporting organisations for some outcomes.

### Metabolic flexibility as an adaptation to energy resources and requirements in health and disease [^115tybYT]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Metabolic flexibility is likely best understood as a system of interacting components to manage energy resources and requirements in health and disease. Together with the endocrine system, mitochondria orchestrate the metabolic reprogramming necessary to sustain cell function in both healthy and pathological conditions.

Metabolic flexibility has a broad scope that can be daunting; nevertheless great progress has been made over the past few decades to understand its underpinnings. However, because of the complexity of metabolic flexibility, many ends remain untied and solid translational steps are often missing. The use of isotope labeling to determine metabolic flux and substrate preference is a common practice. Flux measurements can aptly portray the dynamics of metabolism, whereas protein and gene expression analyses are typically static snapshots in time. A biochemical revival of flux metabolism research will surely reveal insights into metabolic flexibility.

Unveiling the key denominators of metabolic flexibility as targets for intervention strategies is paramount to stop the rise of metabolic disease. Besides abating metabolic inflexibility such strategies may even prolong health span and lifespan. To advance translational research from bench to bedside, clinical trials need to be performed that are well-controlled and use state-of-the-art methods to measure metabolic flexibility.

With this review, we have summarized the current status of metabolic flexibility research and realize that, because of the vast amount of literature and the complexity of this research field, it is not comprehensive. Nonetheless, it is evident that metabolic flexibility can be placed in the broad context of health and disease and a deeper understanding of its intricacies will significantly affect health care. As a final note, the situation portrayed here does not necessarily reflect that of each individual. Because of the genetic and epigenetic disparity of humans and the enormous varieties in lifestyle, it is not unthinkable that each person fashions a unique way to maintain energy homeostasis. In light of the rapid developments in the field of nutrigenomics and personalized medicine, future research will likely focus on the union between metabolic flexibility and personalized medicine. Clearly, there is still much work to be done, yet interesting times lie ahead.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^113AhqVw]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Isolated LDL-C elevation — nutrition interventions focus on modifying cholesterol-raising dietary components: Several dietary components have been shown in randomized controlled trials to raise or lower cholesterol carried by atherogenic particles (LDL-C and non-HDL-C); for isolated LDL-C elevation, objectives are to minimize cholesterol-raising factors and increase cholesterol-lowering components within a healthy dietary pattern. LDL-C–raising factors include saturated fatty acids (mainly 12–16 carbon SFAs), trans fatty acids, and dietary cholesterol, and excess adiposity and positive energy balance can also raise LDL-C, whereas unsaturated fatty acids, proteins (especially plant proteins), viscous dietary fibers, and plant sterols/stanols (PSs) lower atherogenic particles.

### Physical activity and excess body weight and adiposity for adults. American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement [^111B17qJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Exercise, appetite, and energy intake — consensus statements — A single bout of aerobic exercise does not increase hunger or energy intake over the subsequent 24 h, yet further evidence is needed to examine individual responses, and when performed over the longer term, regular aerobic exercise can elicit partial compensation in energy intake. High habitual levels of physical activity may sensitize the control of appetite with a tighter coupling between energy expenditure and energy intake following energy perturbations, whereas physical inactivity and sedentariness fail to downregulate energy intake and can permit overconsumption. The complex interaction between energy expenditure and energy intake means that the effects of exercise on the control of appetite will be variable between individuals.

### The epidemiological burden of obesity in childhood: a worldwide epidemic requiring urgent action [^114wq8SK]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

It is recognised that the main drivers of the current obesity epidemic are related to changing food systems and reduced physical activity, with two key features. Firstly, there is increased availability of generally inexpensive, energy-dense and ultra-processed foods and beverages. The globalisation of food supply means that it is often economically more profitable to produce and market processed, energy-dense foods than fresh ones. Recent results from the Global Burden of Disease study show that consumption of healthy foods is suboptimal, whereas that of unhealthy options exceeds recommended levels. Secondly, there have been increases in the number of people with sedentary lifestyles, with high levels of physical inactivity among children. As children transition through childhood and adolescence, susceptibility to the food and physical environments increases. Increasingly, children can choose the foods they eat and how much exercise they do and this has a strong impact on current and future behaviour. This may, in part, explain the rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity in this group. Further investigation is required to explain the more rapid increase in obesity in boys, including studies of whether they are more susceptible to obesogenic pressures.

The need to improve the food environment requires governments, international organisations and other key stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector at local and global levels, to address global and local commercial determinants of obesity, including production and marketing of unhealthy, energy-dense foods and to improve availability and affordability of unprocessed healthy foods. Equally, healthy diets must be integrated with food systems in a sustainable way, such that long-term health benefits are possible. A constructive dialogue with the food industry and effective regulations are needed to improve the availability of healthy foods and reduce that of unhealthy options, including prevention of unethical marketing of unhealthy foods aimed at low-income countries and other vulnerable members of the global population. The paradigm of energy imbalance (increased energy intake not balanced by energy consumption) is often used by the food industry to weaken policies aimed at tackling the use of energy-dense foods; i.e. it is argued that adequate levels of physical activity can compensate for this imbalance. Given the scale of the obesity epidemic, this argument must be viewed with scepticism. In the same vein, city and urban planners must rethink their role in society, given that current physical environments substantially restrict mobility patterns. As sedentarism becomes more common and future jobs require less activity, our children will amass a substantial cumulative burden of inactivity that will become difficult to reverse.

### Personalized weight loss strategies-the role of macronutrient distribution [^115d14FS]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

A large number of different dietary approaches have been studied in an attempt to achieve healthy, sustainable weight loss among individuals with overweight and obesity. Restriction of energy intake is the primary method of producing a negative energy balance leading to weight loss. However, owing to the different metabolic roles of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids in energy homeostasis, diets of similar overall energy content but with different macronutrient distribution can differentially affect metabolism, appetite and thermogenesis. Evidence increasingly suggests that the fuel values of calories provided by distinct macronutrients should be considered separately, as metabolism of specific molecular components generates differences in energy yield. The causes of variation in individual responses to various diets are currently under debate, and some evidence suggests that differences are associated with specific genotypes. This Review discusses all available systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and summarizes the results of relevant randomized controlled intervention trials assessing the influence of macronutrient composition on weight management. The initial findings of research into personalized nutrition, based on the interactions of macronutrient intake and genetic background and its potential influence on dietary intervention strategies, are also discussed.

EE: Light to Vigorous Intensity Physical Activity in Healthy Adults — pre-measurement abstinence for RMR advises that if a healthy adult engages in light to vigorous intensity physical activity, the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should instruct the individual to refrain from physical activity prior to the RMR measurement for a period of time (e.g., 12 to 48 hours moderate to vigorous physical activity). Physical activity rises the RMR for an unknown period after cessation, and the elevation varies by intensity, type, duration, level of fitness and other factors; therefore, the length of time to refrain should be determined based on these factors. This recommendation applies to healthy adults who engage in light, moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity.

Here, the focus is on effects of exercise training on energy balance and body composition in subjects with a sedentary or light-active lifestyle. Then, exercise training induces an energy imbalance consistently lower than prescribed energy expenditure from exercise. Additionally, individual responses are highly variable and decrease in time. Combining the results from 23 exercise training studies in normal-weight, overweight, and obese subjects, varying in duration from 2 to 64 weeks, showed an average initial energy imbalance of about 2 MJ/day with an exponential decline to nearly zero after about 1 year. A compensatory increase in energy intake is the most likely explanation for the lower than expected effect of exercise on energy balance. Overall, exercise training results in a healthier body composition as reflected by a reduction of body fat, especially in overweight and obese subjects, with little or no long-term effect on body weight.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 2 to 4 years old [^1178cqF3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Interventions that aim to prevent childhood obesity seek to maintain an energy balance that is ideal for the healthy growth and development of the child. All such interventions work by limiting the amount of energy (calories) consumed, increasing the amount of energy expended (which includes basal metabolic rate, physical activity and other activity, including sleep, and energy required for child growth), or both limiting the amount of energy consumed and increasing the amount of energy expended. If energy consumed exceeds energy expenditure, excess body fat will accumulate. If sustained energy expenditure (normal metabolic demands plus cost of growth) exceeds energy consumed, the child may become malnourished. A severe energy deficit over a prolonged period in childhood, particularly during rapid periods of growth such as during early childhood, may have serious negative consequences for growth and development, and these effects are potentially irreversible. Balancing short‐term effectiveness with a safer, more moderate, and sustained energy deficit remains a key public health challenge in childhood obesity prevention.

The safest and most reliable way to ensure an ideal energy balance in growing children is for children to eat a healthy diet (low in saturated and trans‐fats and sugar) and be physically active. Most countries have age‐specific recommendations for daily food and drink intakes, and physical activity levels. Most interventions for young children that include a diet component promote a reduction in fat and added sugar intake (e.g. Fisher 2019), which sometimes includes limiting sugar‐sweetened beverage intake (e.g. Nezami 2017). Interventions for young children that include an activity component promote active play, a reduction in sedentary behaviour and screen time, or a combination of these. Examples include ensuring there are physical activity sessions during childcare (e.g. Fitzgibbon 2005), and strategies to limit the amount of time a child spends using a screen‐based device (e.g. Dennison 2004).

### Combating excessive eating: a role for four evidence-based remedies [^116HmB1C]. Obesity (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to review the control of energy balance and outline some causes of and remedies for excessive energy intake.

Methods

A narrative review was conducted.

Results

There is negative feedback control of energy intake and body weight, but, nonetheless, energy intake is only loosely coupled with energy expenditure. Consequently, we are vulnerable to eating in excess of energy requirements. In this context, energy density, portion size, and habitual meal patterns have strong influences on energy intake and, accordingly, can be targeted to reduce energy intake. For example, energy density can be reduced without much affecting food reward (approximately the pleasure gained from eating) because their relationship is such that reward value is affected relatively little by increments in energy density above 1.5 kcal/g. This and other strategies that increase reward per calorie eaten may be superior to increasing the satiety effect of products because fullness is not inherently rewarding. Low-calorie sweeteners provide a means to reduce energy density while largely preserving food or beverage reward value. Consistent with this, consumption of low-calorie sweeteners compared with consumption of sugars has been found to reduce energy intake and body weight.

Conclusions

Understanding what causes excessive eating also provides insights into how to combat this problem.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114rVwXA]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Healthy diet in children — risk factor links and current distribution are described: Healthy dietary behaviors directly influence multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Two of the primary features of healthy eating include diet quality and energy balance; the latter is defined as caloric consumption matched with energy expenditure. Approximately 91% of US children are classified as having a poor diet score, 9% are classified as having an intermediate diet score, and < 0.5% are classified as having an ideal diet score, and a higher percentage of children than adults are ranked in the poor category of diet quality. Avoidance of obesity in children is key, and balancing energy intake to match growth and activity needs can mean the difference between successful and compromised management of lifetime risk.

### A global perspective on energy: health effects and injustices [^11776VHc]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

The exploitation of fossil fuels is integral to modern living and has been a key element of the rapid technological, social, and cultural changes of the past 250 years. Although such changes have brought undeniable benefits, this exploitation has contributed to a burden of illness through pollution of local and regional environments, and is the dominant cause of climate change. This pattern of development is therefore unsustainable at a global level. At the same time, about 2.4 billion of the world's population, disadvantaged by lack of access to clean energy, are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollutants from the inefficient burning of biomass fuels. Even in high-income countries, many people live in fuel poverty, and throughout the world, increasingly sedentary lifestyles (to which fossil-fuel-dependent transport systems contribute) are leading to chronic disease and injuries. Energy security is also an issue of growing concern to many governments in both the developed and developing world, and a potential source of international tension and conflict. In this Series, we examine the opportunities to improve health, reduce climate effects, and promote development through realistic adjustments in the way energy and food are produced and consumed.

### Improving physical activity in COPD: towards a new paradigm [^114z2Cw3]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Physical activity levels recommendation and applications in COPD

The recently developed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for physical activity recommend that all adults should undertake at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, such as walking, to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Individuals limited by medical conditions are advised to undertake as much physical activity as their health allows. A joint statement from the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society in 2006 states that pulmonary rehabilitation 'should no longer be viewed as a "last ditch" effort for patients with severe respiratory impairment. Rather, it should be an integral part of the clinical management of all patients with chronic respiratory disease, addressing their functional and/or psychologic deficits'. An update of this document, recently accepted for publication, will further stress the importance of physical activity and improvement of physical activity as a goal for pulmonary rehabilitation. The more recent 2013 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy recommends that all patients with COPD should participate in daily physical activity, although recommended levels have not been defined. Despite these recommendations, a recent Swedish study demonstrated that significantly fewer patients with COPD attained recommended physical activity levels compared with a healthy population and patients with other chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes.

Evaluation of physical activity

It is important to make the distinction between physical activity and exercise capacity, which are both closely related to clinical outcomes in COPD. Physical activity is 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure'. By contrast, exercise capacity indicates an individual's ability to endure exercise, where exercise comprises physical activities that are specifically performed with the intention of improving physical fitness. Exercise capacity indicates what a person is capable of doing, while physical activity reflects what someone actually does.

Physical activity can be assessed by direct observation, evaluation of energy expenditure during bodily movement, physical activity questionnaires and patient diaries, and the use of performance based motion sensors. Direct observation is a time-consuming and intrusive method, and therefore not suitable for assessing physical activity in large populations. Energy spent on physical activities can be assessed by indirect calorimetry such as the doubly labeled water method; however, body mass, movement efficiency, and the energy cost of activities, make inter-individual comparison of the amount of physical activity performed difficult. Furthermore, the quantity, duration, frequency and intensity of physical activity cannot be discriminated. Moreover, patients with COPD have a poor mechanical efficiency yielding larger energy expenditure compared to healthy subjects for the same level of activity.

### Obesity: overview of an epidemic [^115VB8DD]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic in the United States has proven difficult to reverse. We have not been successful in helping people sustain the eating and physical activity patterns that are needed to maintain a healthy body weight. There is growing recognition that we will not be able to sustain healthy lifestyles until we are able to address the environment and culture that currently support unhealthy lifestyles. Addressing obesity requires an understanding of energy balance. From an energy balance approach it should be easier to prevent obesity than to reverse it. Further, from an energy balance point of view, it may not be possible to solve the problem by focusing on food alone. Currently, energy requirements of much of the population may be below the level of energy intake than can reasonably be maintained over time. Many initiatives are underway to revise how we build our communities, the ways we produce and market our foods, and the ways we inadvertently promote sedentary behavior. Efforts are underway to prevent obesity in schools, worksites, and communities. It is probably too early to evaluate these efforts, but there have been no large-scale successes in preventing obesity to date. There is reason to be optimistic about dealing with obesity. We have successfully addressed many previous threats to public health. It was probably inconceivable in the 1950s to think that major public health initiatives could have such a dramatic effect on reducing the prevalence of smoking in the United States. Yet, this serious problem was addressed via a combination of strategies involving public health, economics, political advocacy, behavioral change, and environmental change. Similarly, Americans have been persuaded to use seat belts and recycle, addressing two other challenges to public health. But, there is also reason to be pessimistic. Certainly, we can learn from our previous efforts for social change, but we must realize that our challenge with obesity may be greater. In the other examples cited, we had clear goals in mind. Our goals were to stop smoking, increase the use of seatbelts, and increase recycling. The difficulty of achieving these goals should not be minimized, but they were clear and simple goals. In the case of obesity, there is no clear agreement about goals. Moreover, experts do not agree on which strategies should be implemented on a widespread basis to achieve the behavioral changes in the population needed to reverse the high prevalence rates of obesity. We need a successful model that will help us understand what to do to address obesity. A good example is the recent HEALTHY study. This comprehensive intervention was implemented in several schools and aimed to reduce obesity by concentrating on behavior and environment. This intervention delivered most of the strategies we believe to be effective in schools. Although the program produced a reduction in obesity, this reduction was not greater than the reduction seen in the control schools that did not receive the intervention. This does not mean we should not be intervening in schools, but rather that it may require concerted efforts across behavioral settings to reduce obesity. Although we need successful models, there is a great deal of urgency in responding to the obesity epidemic. An excellent example is the effort to get menu labeling in restaurants, which is moving rapidly toward being national policy. The evaluation of this strategy is still ongoing, and it is not clear what impact it will have on obesity rates. We should be encouraging efforts like this, but we must evaluate them rigorously. Once we become serious about addressing obesity, it will likely take decades to reverse obesity rates to levels seen 30 years ago. Meanwhile, the prevalence of overweight and obesity remains high and quite likely will continue to increase.

### Improving sleep: outcomes from a worksite healthy sleep program [^115CcunQ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Unhealthy and inadequate sleep is a common and significant problem impacting absenteeism, presenteeism, health, and productivity. This study aimed at analyzing the effect of a worksite-based healthy sleep program.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 53 adult members of a worksite wellness center who participated in an 8-week healthy sleep program and completed pre- and postintervention health behavior questionnaires.

Results

Following the intervention participants felt significantly more rested, more confident in their ability to deal with sleep problems, and more knowledgeable about sleep. In addition, they reported a reduction in their stress level, improved quality of life, and increase energy level.

Conclusions

These results support the effectiveness of worksite programs designed to promote healthy sleep. Future randomized studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and optimal delivery of healthy sleep promotion.

### Physical activity in the management of obesity [^113jVKRU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Physical activity is any movement of skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. Long-term success in weight management depends on both physical activity and dietary modification. Exercise has a pivotal role in weight management, optimising body composition by minimising fat-free mass losses and maximising fat mass loss; and, enhancing metabolic fitness. The amount and type of exercise needed to obtain health-related benefits may differ from that recommended for fitness benefits. Public health messages about exercise have focused on improvements in general health and fitness rather than on weight loss, prevention of weight gain or weight regain. About 2.5 times more exercise than the US Surgeon General's recommendation is needed to maintain energy balance and thus maintain a certain weight. The challenge is to get the exercise prescription right at an individual level.

### Keeping the young-elderly healthy: is it too late to improve our health through nutrition? [^114yBsxA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Healthy older individuals can take several measures to preserve and improve their health. Even if past nutritional and lifestyle practices were not optimal, much can be done to reduce the risk of chronic disease and disability in future years. The first challenge is to recognize and address the profound changes in body composition that occur with aging. Older persons tend to accumulate relatively more body fat and less lean body mass, ie, muscle and bone. With a gain in body weight, which usually occurs, these changes are exaggerated. Because muscle tissue has a much higher metabolic rate than does fat tissue, older individuals generally develop lower metabolic rates. To avoid excess weight gain, older individuals must make major restrictions in caloric intake and increases in energy expenditure. Women experience changes in body composition similar to those in men, with changes becoming more prominent at menopause. Exercise improves body composition among healthy elderly, both by reducing fat mass and by increasing bone and muscle mass, thereby helping to restore higher metabolic rates. In men and women aged ≥ 65 y and taking calcium and vitamin D supplements for 3 y, the rate of bone loss slowed and the incidence of nonvertebral fractures was reduced. Several population studies of older persons show that following nutritional and lifestyle guidelines for cancer prevention reduces risk by one-third. Improving serum lipid concentrations in adults over 65 y of age with coronary artery disease decreases the risk of future cardiac events by as much as 45%. Furthermore, the greatest benefit from control of hypertension is in older individuals.

### Health and sustainable development: can we rise to the challenge? [^115wQ6DR]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

The forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development is an unprecedented opportunity to place health higher on the environmental and development agenda. The world's leaders will be grappling with some of the major challenges of our times — how to eradicate poverty and meet the world's development needs in a way that does not destroy the environment. Topping the agenda are water, energy, health, agriculture, and biodiversity. Improvement of access of the world's poor people to clean water, sanitation, and safe sources of household energy would have a huge effect on the main killers of young children — pneumonia and diarrhoea. Similarly, improved environmental management could substantially affect many infectious disease outcomes. At the same time, the growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases could be reversed if people's consumption patterns and lifestyles could be put on a more sustainable and healthy footing. A shared health, environmental, and development agenda could address the large share of the burden of disease that is environmentally related, and vice versa. The health sector increasingly needs to work in partnership with others rather than work alone. New tools are needed to ensure that intersectoral action becomes embedded in the way that the health sector does business. Improving coordination might be one of the most important ways in which we can help put the planet back on a healthy and sustainable path.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise [^116d4M3C]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide guidance to professionals who counsel and prescribe individualized exercise to apparently healthy adults of all ages. These recommendations also may apply to adults with certain chronic diseases or disabilities, when appropriately evaluated and advised by a health professional. This document supersedes the 1998 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand, "The Recommended Quantity and Quality of Exercise for Developing and Maintaining Cardiorespiratory and Muscular Fitness, and Flexibility in Healthy Adults". The scientific evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of exercise is indisputable, and the benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks in most adults. A program of regular exercise that includes cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercise training beyond activities of daily living to improve and maintain physical fitness and health is essential for most adults. The ACSM recommends that most adults engage in moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 30 min·d on ≥ 5 d·wk for a total of ≥ 150 min·wk, vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 20 min·d on ≥ 3 d·wk (≥ 75 min·wk), or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise to achieve a total energy expenditure of ≥ 500–1000 MET·min·wk. On 2–3 d·wk, adults should also perform resistance exercises for each of the major muscle groups, and neuromotor exercise involving balance, agility, and coordination. Crucial to maintaining joint range of movement, completing a series of flexibility exercises for each the major muscle-tendon groups (a total of 60 s per exercise) on ≥ 2 d·wk is recommended. The exercise program should be modified according to an individual's habitual physical activity, physical function, health status, exercise responses, and stated goals. Adults who are unable or unwilling to meet the exercise targets outlined here still can benefit from engaging in amounts of exercise less than recommended. In addition to exercising regularly, there are health benefits in concurrently reducing total time engaged in sedentary pursuits and also by interspersing frequent, short bouts of standing and physical activity between periods of sedentary activity, even in physically active adults. Behaviorally based exercise interventions, the use of behavior change strategies, supervision by an experienced fitness instructor, and exercise that is pleasant and enjoyable can improve adoption and adherence to prescribed exercise programs. Educating adults about and screening for signs and symptoms of CHD and gradual progression of exercise intensity and volume may reduce the risks of exercise. Consultations with a medical professional and diagnostic exercise testing for CHD are useful when clinically indicated but are not recommended for universal screening to enhance the safety of exercise.

### Timing of daily calorie loading affects appetite and hunger responses without changes in energy metabolism in healthy subjects with obesity [^111f5xh4]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Morning loaded calorie intake in humans has been advocated as a dietary strategy to improve weight loss. This is also supported by animal studies suggesting time of eating can prevent weight gain. However, the underlying mechanisms through which timing of eating could promote weight loss in humans are unclear. In a randomized crossover trial (NCT03305237), 30 subjects with obesity/overweight underwent two 4-week calorie-restricted but isoenergetic weight loss diets, with morning loaded or evening loaded calories (45%:35%:20% versus 20%:35%:45% calories at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively). We demonstrate no differences in total daily energy expenditure or resting metabolic rate related to the timing of calorie distribution, and no difference in weight loss. Participants consuming the morning loaded diet reported significantly lower hunger. Thus, morning loaded intake (big breakfast) may assist with compliance to weight loss regime through a greater suppression of appetite.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obesity, more specifically with respect to dietary management, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to offer a diet to achieve reduced calorie intake as part of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention in patients with obesity or overweight. Consider offering any of the following methods to reduce food and calorie intake:

- 1,200–1,500 kcal/day in females and 1,500–1,800 kcal/day in males (calories adjusted for the individual's body weight)

- 500–750 kcal/day energy deficit

- an evidence-based diet restricting certain food types (such as high-carbohydrate foods, low-fiber foods, or high-fat foods) in order to create an energy deficit by reducing food intake.

### Too old for healthy aging? Exploring age limits of longevity treatments [^114rX94x]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Energy metabolism is a central regulator of healthy aging.

The figure provides an overview of the current interventions that effectively extend lifespan and improve organ function during aging. The common mechanistic targets of these interventions are summarized, and the key dependence of these downstream adaptive processes on the efficacy of energy metabolism and mitochondria is highlighted.

Energy metabolism therefore stands out among longevity mechanisms since it dictates the outcomes of other cellular responses by controlling the energy reservoir. And unsurprisingly, metabolic dysfunction underlies the progressive loss of cellular health, and deterioration of tissues, leading to impaired organismal function, and elevated mortality risks. Mitochondria, organelles that largely control the energy status of the cell are not only regulatory units of many metabolic processes, but also crucial instigators of the development and progression of aging-associated diseases. A growing body of evidence connects aging-driven functional impairments to the imbalance between cellular energy supply and demand, which can be improved by interventions that directly or indirectly target energy metabolism.

In this context, it is noteworthy that the most reliable, robust and long-known interventions for healthy aging all target energy metabolism in one way or another. For example, the attenuation of the growth hormone (GH) signaling elicits lifespan extension across species by shifting energy resources from growth towards repair activities. Similarly, various forms of dietary restriction (DR) such as intermittent fasting (IF), time-restricted feeding (TRF) and calorie restriction (CR) act in large part by increasing metabolic resilience of the cells and their ability to swiftly alternate between metabolic substrates for energy production known as metabolic plasticity. Same is true for DR mimetic drugs like metformin. Finally, one of the most promising longevity drugs, rapamycin is thought to exert its anti-aging effects by attenuating translation and upregulating autophagy. However, recently we and others found that rapamycin treatment also stabilizes cellular energy expenditure, likely by shutting down energy demanding activities such as ribosome biogenesis, thus reducing metabolic pressure and protecting mitochondria from stress.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^114K1aFs]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — conclusions on risk and monitoring emphasize that energy drinks are frequently consumed and there are reports of morbidity and mortality associated with their consumption. In particular, individuals known to be more susceptible to adverse events include those of young age, small stature, caffeine-naïve or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant or breastfeeding women, those with certain medical conditions and/or taking certain medications, consuming multiple energy drinks in one session, and those with underlying cardiovascular or other diseases. Of critical importance, children and adolescents appear to be at particularly high risk of complications from energy drinks due to their small body size, being relatively caffeine naive, and potentially heavy and frequent consumption patterns, as well as the amounts of caffeine. Although most healthy adults can consume an energy drink without any significant, negative, acute health effects, the long-term effects of chronic consumption have not been well studied. Continued monitoring of adverse events related to energy drink consumption is needed to fully understand the rate, severity and nature of reactions to these products across the lifespan.

### Managing nitrogen to achieve sustainable food-energy-water nexus in China [^113PGtcR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Nitrogen holds a crucial place in sustaining the food-energy-water (FEW) nexus, which underpins human society. Its importance spans food production, energy generation, and water quality preservation. Here we show that comprehensive nitrogen management strategies offer the dual benefits of satisfying China's food requirements and boosting nitrogen energy production from straw by 1 million tonnes (26%) compared to 2020. Simultaneously, these strategies could lead to a reduction of 8 million tonnes (−31%) in nitrogen fertilizer usage, a decrease of 3.8 million tonnes (−46%) in nitrogen-induced water pollution, and a halving of water consumption in agriculture, all relative to 2020 levels. These transformative changes within the FEW nexus could result in national societal gains of around US$140 billion, against a net investment of just US$8 billion. This highlights the cost-effectiveness of such strategies and their potential to support China's sustainable development goals, especially in hunger relief, clean energy, and aquatic ecosystem protection.

### Oral protein calorie supplementation for children with chronic disease [^114toTEz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomised controlled trials, published or unpublished.

Types of participants

Children, aged between one year and 16 years, with any defined chronic disease i.e. a disease which requires medical intervention for a period of six months or more, or for the remainder of the person's lifetime. Children with malnutrition resulting from insufficient dietary intake without any causative disease, e.g. during famine, were excluded.

Types of interventions

Protein calorie supplements administered orally, in any amount and given for a period of at least one month, compared with no intervention, routine nutritional advice or placebo. A period of at least one month has been selected as we are interested in the longer‐term use of these products to improve nutritional status and growth. These products are sometimes provided in the short term to boost nutritional intake during a period when dietary intake is compromised, for example during an acute infection. Studies with an intervention period of less than one month will therefore be excluded. Oral protein calorie supplements provided as either whole protein milk or juice drinks were considered. Those which provide calories alone were not included.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Change in nutritional indices weight height body mass index z score other indices of nutrition (including blood biochemistry if appropriate) or growth, including anthropometric measures of body composition
Calorie and nutritional intake from food measured by diet diary or weighed food intake daily, weekly or over some other time interval total energy intake total fat intake total protein intake
Calorie and nutritional intake from oral protein calorie supplements measured by diet diary or weighed food intake daily, weekly or over some other time interval total energy intake total fat intake total protein intake

Secondary outcomes

Measures of eating behaviour
Severity scores for individual chronic diseases (e.g. FEV₁)
Measures of quality of life
Measures of compliance to dietary treatment
Adverse effects including diarrhoea, vomiting, reduced appetite and abdominal bloating. Other adverse effects, if reported, would also be examined
Number of deaths or age at death in each group

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^1168AYbT]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Dietary interventions for people with obesity/adiposity-based chronic disease emphasize creating a personalized energy deficit using evidence-based strategies and counseling, with diet patterns optimized for health benefits and aligned to individual preferences and context. Interventions must create an energy deficit for weight reduction, and this can be achieved through varied strategies that can be combined and tailored; individuals should receive counseling and support to create personalized nutrition plans. Numerous meal plans in reduced-calorie formats can safely promote weight reduction and health improvement, and when lifestyle interventions are used as the single therapeutic modality, guidelines conventionally recommend caloric deficits of 500 to 750 kilocalories daily or estimated intakes of 1200 to 1500 kilocalories daily, calculated from baseline energy expenditure. Across meal plans (e.g. Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, complex carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate, plant-based, paleo), there is no macronutrient composition known to be superior to others; effectiveness depends on long-term adherence, and safety data beyond 2 to 3 years are unavailable for many plans. Timing of eating or fasting may be implemented with other personalized dietary interventions, and during dose-escalation of obesity medications and the hypocaloric period of active weight loss it is important to ensure adequate nutrition to minimize adverse events, with particular attention to macro- and micronutrient intake during pronounced weight loss (e.g., with second-generation obesity medications).

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^11626ZqE]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Recommendations for Individual Choices — Overweight, Obesity, and Excess Body Fat — state the following: Recommendation: Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life. Keep body weight within the healthy range, and avoid weight gain in adult life. Excess body fat (overweight and obesity) occurs from energy imbalance as a result of excess energy intake (from both food and beverages) and low energy expenditure; dietary factors most consistently associated with excess body fat include sugar-sweetened beverages, "fast-foods", and a "Western"-type diet (ie, high in added sugars, meat, fat), whereas foods containing dietary fiber and a "Mediterranean" dietary pattern may reduce risk; in addition, aerobic physical activity, including walking, is associated with a lower risk of excess body fatness, whereas sedentary behaviors and greater screen time are associated with higher risk.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^116iwwFP]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Healthy dietary patterns and plant-based diets — Meta-analyses and trials indicate benefits, as two randomized clinical trials found lower overall cancer or breast cancer risk among those randomized to follow the Mediterranean diet, and these studies provide consistent and compelling evidence that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a decreased risk of cancer, all-cause mortality, and other chronic disease endpoints. These healthy dietary patterns are also associated with a lower environmental impact, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and energy, land, and water use, and environmentally sustainable diets emphasize fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-sourced protein foods, unsaturated plant oils, and more limited (optional) quantities of animal-based protein foods, dairy products, and sugar. Plant-based diets are associated with lower levels of inflammation, improved insulin response, less oxidative DNA damage, and higher concentrations of beneficial gut bacteria compared with mostly animal-based diets high in saturated fat and sugar.

### Adherence to ketogenic diet in lifestyle interventions in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes: a scoping review [^111LXT5s]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

The ketogenic diet (KD) is a very low-carbohydrate diet that restricts daily carbohydrate intake to ~20–50 g/d or > 10% of total daily caloric intake, with 70–80% calories derived from fat. By restricting carbohydrate intake, KD aims to induce a state of nutritional ketosis. During ketosis, the liver typically consumes fat to produce and secrete ketones and fatty acids as the primary energy source for body tissues. Emerging evidence suggests that KD can be considered as first-line treatment approach for obesity management due to its ability to suppress hunger, reduce lipogenesis, increase lipolysis, enhance metabolic efficiency for fat utilization, and boost energy expenditure. Research also indicates that KD can be a first-line approach for T2D treatment. Given that T2D is characterized by hyperglycemia and that dietary carbohydrate intake has a significant impact on glycemic levels, reducing carbohydrate intake is a reasonable strategy for effective T2D management. Studies have consistently demonstrated that KD positively influences glycemic control in individuals with T2D by reducing glucose uptake from dietary carbohydrates, improving systemic insulin sensitivity, reducing insulin requirements, and facilitating weight loss.

Sleep duration and metabolic health — Experimental and observational evidence links short sleep with adverse metabolic function; experimental sleep restriction reduces cellular and whole body insulin sensitivity, lowers glucose tolerance, and raises afternoon and evening cortisol levels, and if prolonged can compromise β-cell function and lead to type 2 diabetes, with additional promotion of positive energy balance via effects on leptin and ghrelin.

EE: Diurnal variation in healthy adults — two studies provide evidence that diurnal variation has minimal effect on resting metabolic rate (RMR) in healthy adults, and the conclusion statement supporting the recommendation is grade III. For research, the same time of day should be used throughout the study, and clinical judgment should be used in applying this recommendation to healthy children and non-critically ill children and adults, due to no evidence in these populations. There are no obvious costs associated with the application of this recommendation.

Discussion

Statement of principle findings

National health and food policies depend on having accurate estimates of energy intake, requirements and imbalances at the population level. Current measures of energy intake have major shortcomings, including substantial misreporting in dietary surveysand translating estimates of food availability to intake. In this study, we provide a third, complementary method which is based on estimating total energy intake by calculating the energy requirements for attaining measured levels of body weight, height and physical activity. By design, our estimates are in line with observed trends in these parameters. They indicate levels of energy intake that exceed levels recommended to attain healthy body weights in most regions, with greatest levels of excess intake in North America, and levels of intake that are below recommended intake in several sub-Saharan African and East Asian countries. Our estimates also highlight how total energy intake has evolved from a state of average shortfall to a state of average excess. While hunger and undernourishment continue to exist, they now coexist with increasing levels of overweight and obesity. Total energy intake mirrors these changes, and our estimates provide a consistent picture of the level and change in total energy intake over time and across regions and sociodemographic groups.

Meaning of the study: possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policymakers

While various factors might be contributing to the estimated imbalances in energy intake, the near universal overconsumption of energy from foods that we identified suggests that population-level approaches would be most appropriate for addressing them. These can include the regulation of ultra-processed foods which are particularly energy dense and have been found to increase overeating. Several countries and municipalities have recently started to levy health-motivated taxes on sugary drinks, with early results indicating beneficial changes in intake. In addition to sugary drinks and refined grains, red meat intake has also been associated with weight gain, which could warrant similar attention for both health and environmental reasons. We identified a relatively small number of countries whose populations have energy intake below recommended levels. However, this number increased when considering rural residencies, which suggests that more targeted approaches could be warranted to address underconsumption. These can include policies to improve the functioning of local food systems and increase the affordability of healthy diets. However, given that the identified countries, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, have a history of conflict and institutional failure, wider policy approaches that also target institutional resilience and internal conflict might be needed.

### My experience of chronic fatigue syndrome [^114dp2pU]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

The treatment of CFS is incredibly effective if people are able to access it. My treatment took place over regular video calls, not only because of COVID-19 regulations, but also in order to make the treatment more accessible to those with CFS.

My treatment came in the form of energy management, which is the process of sustaining energy levels by preventing the 'boom and bust' cycle, followed by gradual increase in energy levels. This means you have to meet your baseline even on bad days and try not to exceed it even on good days. Managing the 'boom and bust' cycle involves a lot of relearning the basic rules to healthy sleep/resting, many of which you probably take for granted or even ignore if you are not struggling with CFS. These include having a set bedtime/wake-up time, not napping for longer than 30 min, maintaining a good bedtime routine, stopping work early, resting regularly, etc.

To start managing your energy, you must first establish a baseline of energy by tracking your activity (hour by hour) for a few weeks. The baselines are often surprisingly low, for example, my baseline was 4 hours. You also (through tracking your activity levels) identify particular areas or circumstances that might drain your energy levels quicker than other activities. For me, I found that activities that triggered my anxiety quickly drained my energy. You then slowly build up your energy levels, with the help of CFS therapists, at a slow rate of around 10% every 2 weeks (or however it takes for this increase to become sustainable), this could, for example, be through adding a 5-minute walk.

I also learnt the importance of interspersing rest into my high-energy activities, and also the importance of actively resting. Before I thought that resting was just lying in bed or meditation (both of which never really worked for me), but I actually found that activities such as reading a book or listening to music helped me rest and recharge much better.
