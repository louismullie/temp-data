## Question

This question refers to the following information.
The condition of foreign states is not what it once was; they have invented the steamship, and introduced radical changes in the art of navigation. They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.
 — Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847
Which event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns?

Answer Choices:
A. The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan
B. The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court
C. The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese
D. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which historical event best reflects Lord Ii's 1847 warning about foreign naval and military superiority and the risk of clinging to antiquated systems. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal context of the letter and what "antiquated systems" likely meant in 1847 Japan. Then, I should verify which answer choices fit chronologically and thematically with the arrival of Western powers. Next, I will examine each option against the core concern about foreign military-technological dominance forcing change. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly note why the alternatives are less appropriate, anchoring the reasoning in the sakoku-era isolation and the Perry expeditions.

> Let me first confirm the context. The letter is from 1847, during the late Tokugawa shogunate, when Japan was under sakoku (national seclusion) and had minimal official contact with the West, aside from the Dutch at Dejima. Western medicine and science entered only indirectly through that narrow channel, and the regime was broadly resistant to foreign influence, which frames the anxiety about "antiquated systems" and the threat of modern foreign navies and armies [^112nX6R1] [^114U9zMR].

> Now, I need to check which option aligns chronologically and thematically. The expulsion of Christian missionaries belongs to the late 16th and early 17th centuries, well before 1847, so it cannot reflect the specific mid-19th-century fear of steamships and modern weaponry; that would be anachronistic, even though it does relate to earlier foreign influence concerns [^notfound]. The adoption of Chinese imperial customs is a Heian-period phenomenon (794–1185), again centuries too early to match the 1847 context of industrial-era military pressure, so I should rule that out as well [^notfound]. The annexation of Manchuria occurred in 1931, nearly a century after the letter, so it reflects Japanese expansionism rather than the defensive vulnerability Lord Ii feared, making it temporally and directionally mismatched [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the fit of Commodore Perry's arrival. Perry's Black Ships came in 1853–1854, just a few years after Lord Ii's letter, and their steam propulsion and naval firepower directly embodied the "steamship" and "war implements of great power" he worried about. The resulting Convention of Kanagawa forced Japan to open ports and signaled the collapse of sakoku, precisely the "mighty calamity" that could befall the Empire if it clung to antiquated isolation, so this is the closest historical realization of his warning [^notfound].

> Let me consider the alternatives one more time to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The missionary expulsion and the Chinese customs adoption are both too early and do not capture the industrial-military threat Lord Ii described, whereas Manchuria is too late and reflects Japanese aggression rather than vulnerability to foreign power; none of these map as cleanly to the 1847 anxiety about Western naval supremacy and the need to modernize or face coercion as Perry's forced opening does [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The event that best reflects Lord Ii's 1847 concerns is Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade, because it directly confronted Japan with the military-technological superiority of Western powers and precipitated the end of its isolationist "antiquated systems" within years of his warning [^notfound].

---

The best answer is **D. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade**. Lord Ii's 1847 letter warns that foreign powers' steamships, modern navies, and advanced weapons threaten Japan's isolation and antiquated systems. This concern was realized in 1853–1854 when Commodore Perry's fleet compelled Japan to end its isolation and open to trade, exposing the shogunate's military inferiority and triggering modernization. The other options are incorrect: A (expulsion of missionaries) occurred in the 16th–17th centuries, B (Chinese customs) dates to the 7th–9th centuries, and C (Manchuria) happened in the 20th century, none matching the 1847 context or the specific threat of Western naval power.

---

## Analysis of lord ii's concerns

Lord Ii's letter highlights several **key concerns**:

- **Foreign naval advancements**: The invention of steamships and radical changes in navigation signify a shift in maritime power dynamics, posing a direct threat to Japan's isolationist policies.

- **Military modernization**: Foreign powers have built efficient armies with powerful and precise war implements, making them formidable forces.

- **Antiquated systems**: Japan's adherence to outdated systems and policies could lead to significant vulnerability and potential calamity if it fails to adapt to these changes.

These concerns reflect a growing awareness among Japanese leaders of the **need to modernize** and adapt to the changing global landscape, or risk being overtaken by foreign powers.

---

## Historical context and timing

The letter was written in **1847**, during the late Edo period, when Japan was still largely isolated from the rest of the world under the sakoku policy. This period was characterized by strict regulations on foreign trade and interaction, with limited access granted only to Dutch and Chinese traders. However, the mid-19th century marked a significant shift in global power dynamics, with Western powers — particularly the United States and European nations — rapidly advancing in naval technology, military capabilities, and industrialization.

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

### A. The expulsion of Christian missionaries from Japan

The expulsion of Christian missionaries occurred primarily in the early 17th century, notably during the Tokugawa shogunate's implementation of the sakoku policy. This event reflects Japan's efforts to isolate itself from foreign influence, particularly religious influence, but it does not align with the **specific concerns** raised by Lord Ii regarding modern naval and military advancements. Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.

---

### B. The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court

The adoption of Chinese imperial customs in the Japanese court dates back to the Asuka and Nara periods (6th–8th centuries), significantly predating the 19th-century context of Lord Ii's letter. This historical development pertains to cultural and political influences from China and does not reflect the **modern threats** posed by Western naval and military advancements. Thus, this option is **incorrect**.

---

### C. The annexation of Manchuria by the Japanese

The annexation of Manchuria by Japan occurred in the early 20th century (1931), long after Lord Ii's letter was written. This event represents Japanese expansionism and imperial ambitions, rather than the **defensive concerns** about foreign threats and modernization highlighted in the letter. Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.

---

### D. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade

Commodore Matthew Perry's arrival in Japan in 1853–1854, just a few years after Lord Ii's letter, directly addresses the concerns raised in the letter. Perry's fleet of steamships and advanced naval technology demonstrated the superiority of Western military capabilities, compelling Japan to open its ports to trade and effectively ending its isolationist policy. This event **directly reflects **Lord Ii's warnings about the threat posed by foreign naval advancements and the potential calamity of adhering to antiquated systems.

---

## Conclusion

The event that best reflects Lord Ii's concerns is **Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade**. This event directly corresponds to the specific threats mentioned in the letter, including foreign naval advancements, military modernization, and the vulnerability of Japan's antiquated systems. The other options, while historically significant, do not align with the specific context and concerns outlined in Lord Ii's letter.

Following the atomic bomb attacks on Japan in 1945, scientists from the United States and Japan joined together to study the Hibakusha - the bomb affected people in what was advertised as a bipartisan and cooperative effort. In reality, despite the best efforts of some very dedicated and earnest scientists, the early years of the collaboration were characterized by political friction, censorship, controversy, tension, hostility, and racism. The 70-year history, scientific output and cultural impact of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission and the Radiation Effects Research Foundation are described in the context of the development of Occupied Japan.

### Surgeons who contributed to the enlightenment of Japanese medicine [^1142gEYB]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Until the sixteenth century internal medicine, primarily Chinese medicine, had been predominant in Japan. From 1639, under the national seclusion policy of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Japan's doors were closed to the West; and Japan had no trade relations with any countries except China and Holland. Only in Nagasaki, where a Dutch settlement was located, were Japanese able to learn about Western culture and Western medicine. Through the medical education and services provided by Philipp Franz von Siebold, Western surgery was introduced to Japan. In 1854 Japan was opened to the world, and many German physicians were invited to provide medical education in Japan. The German medical education system continued until about 1950. After World War II, Japanese medical education was reformed, and several medical professors from U.S. universities were sent to Japan. One was Charles G. Johnston of Wayne State University. Thanks to the efforts of these visiting American professors, many young Japanese doctors were sent to the United States to study surgery, anesthesia, and the like. These doctors later became the leaders of medical education in Japan. The guidance and friendship of these foreign doctors had a profound effect on the progress and advancement of modern Japanese medicine.

### Biological warfare in a historical perspective [^113w1KJM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

There are some early examples of biological warfare (BW), but in modern times it was used first for sabotage by Germany during WWI. Development of biological weapons on a military significant scale was initiated in several countries in the period between the world wars. During WWII, several countries had active programs such as the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union. It was only Japan that on a fairly large scale used BW. The US program continued until 1969, when President Nixon took a decision to end it in connection with signing the BTWC. The Soviet Union had also continued its program after the war, and this was enhanced after signing the BTWC: in the 1980s the program consisted of around fifty facilities and involved around 60,000 people. The Soviet Union produced and maintained a large stockpile of BW-agents. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and due to pressure from USA and UK, President Yeltsin issued a decree in 1992 banning continued offensive BW activity. However, there are still concerns of residual activity in Russia. Another program of concern is the Iraqi BW-program. After 10 years of UN inspections that were stopped in 1998, there are still many unanswered questions concerning the BW program. There was also a covert BW-program in South Africa that was terminated around 1993. There have also been a number of allegations of alleged use or possession. In addition, there are indications that 10–12 states are now trying to acquire BW, and this assessment is based on intelligence information, mainly from the USA. For example Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan and Libya. Another aspect is the strong driving force of technology developments to promote this type of program, opening new risks for future potential military misuse.

### The neuropsychiatric aftermath of exposure to weapons of mass destruction: applying historical lessons to protect health during the war in Ukraine [^111WtGHk]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evolving war in Ukraine raises global concerns about the potential for future WMD events and their compounding traumatic effect on the Ukraine within and outside its borders. Whether or not a significant WMD event occurs, the invisible and imperceptible nature of these events add considerable fear and uncertainty to the numerous traumatic exposures experienced by the affected communities. Healthcare workers will need to understand psychosocial consequences of WMD, on patients and themselves, and prepare accordingly. It is also crucial to keep in mind that people have the power to recover even through the hardest of times, as shown in the recovery of Japanese communities after the atomic bombings, Jews and other victims of the Holocaust, prisoners of war, populations affected by the Fukushima disaster, and survivors of neurotoxic exposures.

### The American orthopaedic association-Japanese Orthopaedic Association 2010 traveling fellowship [^113UtU75]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

We started this journey excited by the prospects of visiting Japan, a country with a proud and historic past. We ended the fellowship accomplishing those goals, and we left with a great deal of admiration for our orthopaedic colleagues halfway around the world for their excellence in education, clinical care, and research. Their hospitality and attention to the details of our visit were exemplary and a lesson to us as we host visiting fellows in the future. Japan reflects its past, but it also offers a preview into our own nation's future: an aging population, a shrinking workforce, a stagnant economy, nationalized health care, and a mushrooming national debt. Of all of these factors, it is the aging population that we, as orthopaedic surgeons, will be most acutely aware of and involved with. The degenerative disorders that affect elderly patients dominate the landscape of surgical care in Japan. Osteoporosis and osteopenia permeate many aspects of care across orthopaedic subspecialties. The surgeons in Japan are developing innovative and cost-effective means of treating the large volume of older patients within the fiscal constraints of a nationalized health-care system. We learned, and will continue to learn more, from Japan about the management of this growing patient population with its unique pathologies and challenges. With the recent natural disaster and ongoing safety concerns in Japan, the character and will of the people of Japan have been on display. Their courage and resolve combined with order and compassion are a testament to the nation's cultural identity. The seeds of the Traveling Fellowship were planted shortly after Japan's last wide-scale reconstruction, and the ties that have bound the JOA and the AOA together are strengthened through this trying time. We strongly urge our colleagues in the U.S. to help support the people, the physicians, and the health-care system of Japan through its most recent tribulations and offer them the same care and hospitality that we were shown during our fellowship. Japan is an open and friendly nation, and we encourage anyone interested to seek out opportunities to visit or work with our orthopaedic colleagues there. We are grateful to our hosts at each institution as well as to the JOA and AOA organizations for continuing this wonderful tradition. This exchange is now entering its twentieth year. It remains a "trip of a lifetime" for those fortunate enough to be selected. For us, as for many who have participated before us, it will shape our careers in the years to come.

### Facilitators and barriers in the humanization of childbirth practice in Japan [^111BwK9f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the existence in 2005 of more than 388 birthing houses in Japan, 98.8% births took place in hospital or private clinics, while 1.2% of all babies were born in maternity home and home. In the hospital setting, power and authority is vested uniquely in obstetricians, and they are the only professionals with access to specialized obstetrics technology. Japanese obstetricians, however, have a rather limited involvement in uncomplicated births, and are usually less inclined to use medical intervention, as they consider birth a physiological, rather than a potentially pathological event.

Birthing practices are obviously different in Japan from those observed in the United States as they tends to be more natural and it includes avoidance of anesthesia, while the perinatal outcomes remain among the best in the world. With an infant mortality rate of about 2.7 per 1000 live births, Japan has been considered to be the best place to give birth in 2009. In 1990, the caesarean section rate was 11% in Japan, compared to 23.5% in the United States. Japan's caesarean section rate has in recent years risen exponentially from 11% to 21%, but even so, the increase has been less than in North America (27%), and up to 30% in the US alone.

Previous studies focusing on the childbirth experiences of Japanese women in the United States have shown that the birthing experiences in these two countries can prove to be very different. There is no parallel research being conducted on the subject of humanized birthing practices in Japan alone. How do the Japanese experience the humanization of birth in the birth settings that have already aimed at providing such a care? And, what are the barriers and facilitators encountered whilst implementing such care in the Japanese institutions?

The objectives of this study are to explore the Japanese experience of childbirth practice in different birth settings where the humanization of birth has been implemented as an institutional goal, and also to explore the obstacles and facilitators encountered in such a practice.

### Evolving research and development landscape for rare diseases: growing concerns over orphan drug lag in Japan [^114jHD84]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is that the analysis was based on US approval years, focusing on the development timelines and strategies in Japan following initial development in the United States, where OD development typically begins earlier. This approach may not fully align with trends based on actual calendar years. Several drugs remain under development in Japan, and the actual drug lag period and R&D strategies may change slightly in the future due to approvals in Japan or strategy modifications. Although this study highlights the R&D strategies differences between foreign and Japanese companies and captures key trends, variations among individual companies and drugs, and underlying factors such as corporate culture and policy, are possible.

In conclusion, various efforts and advances in R&D have led to a surge in OD development in the United States. However, Japan is experiencing a resurgence in OD lag, raising public health concerns. This is largely due to changes in pharmaceutical companies' R&D strategies, which are driven by the growing presence of United States‐ and Europe‐based SMEs and the evolving industry landscape. With a growing number of ODs developed in the United States by SMEs without a presence in Japan, Japanese companies are increasingly in‐licensing late‐stage drug candidates for the Japanese market from these SMEs and employing a bridging strategy, contributing to the expanding OD lag. Given the challenges, these SMEs are unlikely to expand their OD development and operations into Japan. Therefore, it is crucial for Japanese companies to seek earlier, more proactive global partnerships with SMEs to effectively address drug lag. Additionally, because most ODs originate from abroad, cultivating a robust drug discovery ecosystem in Japan is essential to meet the substantial unmet therapeutic needs of RDs worldwide. Further research is warranted to gain insights into the impact of ongoing regulatory framework reforms and efforts on OD development.

On the occasion of the 14th Korea-Japan joint meeting of dermatology, the founding of the Japanese Dermatological Association, its activities and relationship to neighboring societies were presented to let both Korean and Japanese participants know the current status of Japanese dermatology. It is felt that one central meeting in Asia will be necessary to make a strong impact on not only Asian but also Western colleagues. We should make more of an effort to get used to our common international language, English, so that we can communicate with other Asian colleagues more closely and in more depth in this era of increasing globalization.

### Woodrow Wilson's hidden stroke of 1919: the impact of patient-physician confidentiality on United States foreign policy [^114dXq7z]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

World War I catapulted the United States from traditional isolationism to international involvement in a major European conflict. Woodrow Wilson envisaged a permanent American imprint on democracy in world affairs through participation in the League of Nations. Amid these defining events, Wilson suffered a major ischemic stroke on October 2, 1919, which left him incapacitated. What was probably his fourth and most devastating stroke was diagnosed and treated by his friend and personal physician, Admiral Cary Grayson. Grayson, who had tremendous personal and professional loyalty to Wilson, kept the severity of the stroke hidden from Congress, the American people, and even the president himself. During a cabinet briefing, Grayson formally refused to sign a document of disability and was reluctant to address the subject of presidential succession. Wilson was essentially incapacitated and hemiplegic, yet he remained an active president and all messages were relayed directly through his wife, Edith. Patient-physician confidentiality superseded national security amid the backdrop of friendship and political power on the eve of a pivotal juncture in the history of American foreign policy. It was in part because of the absence of Woodrow Wilson's vocal and unwavering support that the United States did not join the League of Nations and distanced itself from the international stage. The League of Nations would later prove powerless without American support and was unable to thwart the rise and advance of Adolf Hitler. Only after World War II did the United States assume its global leadership role and realize Wilson's visionary, yet contentious, groundwork for a Pax Americana. The authors describe Woodrow Wilson's stroke, the historical implications of his health decline, and its impact on United States foreign policy.

The authors elucidate the strong personal relationship that developed between Dr. Harvey Cushing and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) from 1928 to 1939, as manifested in their frequent letters to each other. The relationship was initiated by the marriage of their children. Through his correspondence with FDR, Cushing was able to affect several medical issues of the period. The relationship of these two individuals is set within the historical, social, and political contexts of the times.

### The disaster at Japan's fukushima-daiichi nuclear power plant after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the resulting spread of radioisotope contamination [^113mmYpS]. Radiation Research (2012). Low credibility.

On March 11, 2011 eastern Japan was struck by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and an enormous tsunami, over 13 m in height, which together killed over 20,500 people and resulted in the evacuation of over 320,000 people from the devastated areas. This paper describes the damage sustained by the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant during this unpredicted major natural disaster and the events that happened in the months after this accident. The events occurring at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, the actions taken to minimize the effects of the damage to the plant and to protect the public, and the points at which the responses proved to be inadequate all offer lessons that will be of value to those planning for and responding to future natural disasters and accidents in Japan and around the world.

### Pediatric considerations before, during, and after radiological or nuclear emergencies [^113xqR8E]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Types of radiation emergencies and related exposures — major historical sources include the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 that killed more than 100 000 people and injured nearly as many; four major nuclear plant accidents (Windscale in Seascale, Cumbria, in the United Kingdom [1957]; Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania [1979]; Chernobyl in Ukraine [1986]; and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan [2011]); and atmospheric nuclear testing beginning in 1945 that resulted in 504 devices exploding at 13 sites, with a 1963 treaty leading to a limited test ban by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, although atmospheric testing continued until 1974 by France and until 1980 by China; health studies around test sites have focused on cancer risks in military participants and/or observers and on thyroid cancer and leukemia among nearby populations, and events involving abandoned medical radiation equipment have caused acute radiation sickness, deaths, and contamination of thousands of people and homes.

### The intriguing encounters of pavlov and Cushing [^112m6tig]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Ivan Petrovich Pavlov and Harvey William Cushing were two of the most prominent neuroscientists of the early 20th century. Their contributions helped advance the understanding of the brain and its disorders, and propelled neuroscience into a new era of research and treatment. Although separated geographically and culturally, Pavlov and Cushing exchanged letters and followed one another's careers from afar. They met only a few times, during international scientific gatherings in the US and abroad. These encounters were captured in journal entries, letters, and photographs, and provide a glimpse into the lives of these two great men and the history of neuroscience at the turn of the last century.

### An introduction to the Japanese immunization program: past, present, and future perspectives [^114iMNRf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

In Japan, immunization is regulated by the Immunization Law, enacted shortly after World War II ended. It has been subsequently revised in response to social changes; however, after public health conditions improved, adverse events following immunization have received more public attention than the effectiveness of vaccination. This kind of public opinion had a major impact on the immunization program, leading to a so-called "vaccine gap" around a decade ago, that is, the less availability of vaccines for routine vaccination as compared with other countries. However, in recent years, several vaccines have been approved and are being routinely administered with the same schedule as in other countries. National immunization programs are influenced by various factors, such as cultures, customs, habits and ideas. This paper summarizes the status of immunization schedule and practices in Japan, process of policymaking, and possible future issues.

### The 150th anniversary of nagasaki university school of medicine: recovery from the atomic disaster and evolution of the department of neurosurgery [^114EpJbz]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

NAGASAKI IS LOCATED on the western edge of Japan, closer to the Asian continent. Because of this geographical proximity, Nagasaki became a gateway for the introduction of continental culture and civilization to Japan. After the port of Nagasaki was opened for trade with the Portuguese in 1571, Nagasaki had a central role in cultural exchange with the West and China until the latter half of the 19th century. As a result of the political situation, students came to Nagasaki from all over Japan to obtain information on Western science, especially in medicine, turning Nagasaki into a hub for modern academic studies. The first medical facility in Japan educating doctors in the Western style was founded in Nagasaki in 1857. Despite the tragedy of World War II, the medical school arose again. More than 10 000 physicians have completed their studies at the medical school since its founding. The Department of Neurosurgery at Nagasaki University had its origins within the Second Department of Surgery and became an independent department in 1973. The post of professor was assumed by Kazuo Mori and succeeded in 1991 by Shobu Shibata and in 2003 by Izumi Nagata, who holds the post at the time of this writing. Neurosurgery is dynamic and constantly changing at Nagasaki University with work in progress on technological, diagnostic, and surgical innovations that permit the treatment of highly complex cases. In 2007, the 150th anniversary of the founding of Nagasaki University School of Medicine was celebrated with a number of commemorative events.

### Recent trends and success factors in reducing the lag time to approval of new drugs in Japan [^112W7owZ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

For many years, approvals of new drugs in Japan have lagged behind those in the United States and Europe. As a result of simultaneous global development strategies, more widespread inclusion of Japan in multiregional clinical trials, and significant reforms and investment in Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency reviewer capacity and capability, the drug lag appears to be diminishing. This is allowing new medicines to be approved sooner in Japan, improving the efficiency of drug development and benefiting patients.

### Conflicting messages concerning current strategies against research misconduct in Japan: a call for ethical spontaneity [^113N5p3m]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

The Japanese government has asserted that the purpose of scientific activities is to search for the truth about the world and contribute to public interest of the humanities and claimed that research misconduct should occur under no circumstances ever. The revealing of each new case of research misconduct leads to the establishment of investigation committees and research guidelines, as well as punishments for the transgressors. However, we wonder if Japanese researchers are receiving different messages that might undermine the purpose of the former messages. First, Japan's policies on science and technology have been created to comprise an integration of merit-based evaluations, principles of competition and a concentrated and unbalanced distribution of research funding, leading to decreases in ordinary research funding for the researchers and an increase in fierce research competition. Second, Japanese government and society as a whole continue to send the researchers messages such as 'Only results matter', 'Be No. 1 as a top priority' and 'All we need now is scientific progress'. Third, cultural peculiarities may explain some of the actions relevant to research misconducts currently noted in Japan. We argue that it is essential to re-examine and improve the governmental policies and evaluation methods for research achievements need to be more multifaceted. In order to have the researchers act according to ethics, it is essential for them to reaffirm their objectives for working in the fields of science and medicine and the importance of balancing their personal profit with the greater cause for entering into this field.

### Vietnam, 1968–1969: a place and a year like no other [^116wN6of]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

THE VIETNAM WAR touched a generation of Americans with its human tragedy, sacrifice, and strife. In terms of casualties, it was the fourth most costly war in American history. However, despite a monumental military effort and modern technology, the war was lost as support from the American public and its elected officials waned. Now, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, as we embark on what might well be another protracted war, lessons from the Vietnam experience become relevant. On a positive note, a refined system for the triage, management, and evacuation of wounded military personnel evolved in Vietnam. A wounded soldier could actually be at a well-equipped base hospital within minutes after injury. At those facilities, casualties had a more than 90% chance of survival, despite some of the most horrific wounds in the history of warfare.

### Mechanical ventilation in ARDS: quo vadis? [^111nhJuc]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Contemplating the future should be grounded in history. The rise of post-polio ICUs was inextricably related to mechanical ventilation. Critically ill patients who developed acute respiratory failure often had "congestive atelectasis" (ie, a term used to describe ARDS prior to 1967). Initial mechanical ventilation strategies for treating this condition and others inadvertently led to ventilator-induced lung injury. Both injurious ventilation and later use of overly cautious weaning practices resulted from both limited technology and understanding of ARDS and other aspects of critical illness. The resulting misperceptions, misconceptions, and missed opportunities took decades to rectify and in some instances still persist. This suggests a reluctance to acknowledge that all therapeutic strategies reflect the historical period in which they were developed and the corresponding limited understanding of ARDS pathophysiology at that time. We are at the threshold of a revolutionary moment in critical care. The confluence of enormous clinical data production, massive computing power, advances in understanding the biomolecular and genetic aspects of critical illness, and the emergence of neural networks will have enormous impact on how critical care is practiced in the decades to come. Therefore, it is imperative we understand the long-crooked path needed to reach the era of protective ventilation in order to avoid similar mistakes moving forward. The emerging era is as difficult to fathom as our current practices and technologies were to those practicing 60 years ago. This review explores the history of mechanical ventilation in treating ARDS, describes current protective ventilation strategies, and speculates how ARDS management might look 20 years from now.

In this historical review the authors examine the important developments that have led to the availability of laser energy to neurosurgeons as a unique and sometimes invaluable tool. They review the physical science behind the function of lasers, as well as how and when various lasers based on different lasing mediums were discovered. They also follow the close association between advances in laser technology and their application in biomedicine, from early laboratory experiments to the first clinical experiences. Because opinions on the appropriate role of lasers in neurosurgery vary widely, the historical basis for some of these views is explored. Initial enthusiasm for a technology that appears to have innate advantages for safe resections has often given way to the strict limitations and demands of the neurosurgical operating theater. However, numerous creative solutions to improve laser delivery, power, safety, and ergonomics demonstrate the important role that technological advances in related scientific fields continue to offer neurosurgery. Benefiting from the most recent developments in materials science, current CO(2) laser delivery systems provide a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium when applied in the correct circumstances and reflect the important historical advances that come about from the interplay between neurosurgery and technology.

### Japan's conditional / time-limited early approval system in regenerative medicine: a case study of rise and falls of autologous skeletal myoblast sheets [^115qXqKN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Japan's conditional/time‐limited early approval program, initiated in 2014, aimed to advance regenerative medicine by expediting market access. However, the withdrawal of autologous skeletal myoblast sheets (Heartsheet) due to ineffectiveness raises concerns about the balance between rapid approval and scientific integrity. While the program seeks to boost innovation, it risks endorsing costly, unclear treatments under national health care. This case highlights the need to refine regulatory approaches, ensuring clinical efficacy and fiscal responsibility in regenerative therapies.

### PinPinKorori or nenNenKorori: the historical and socioeconomic background of geriatric trauma care in Japan [^112FskLA]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Global ageing, allocation of medical care costs, and futile care

Confucius was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher. According to his principles, geriatric people or the elderly must be respected in East Asia. He championed strong family loyalty and espoused the well-known principle, 'Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you'.
Ageing is one of the most serious social issues, not only in Japan, but across the globe. It is estimated that by 2050, the proportion of elderly people over 65 years of age will make up 16% of the global population, whereas children aged less than 5 years will be 7%. The rate of ageing has been increasing exponentially, especially in Asia. The proportion of those aged over 65 years was 24% in 2010, and will increase to 40% by 2060. This proportion will be the same as that of South Korea and India in 2060. According to a recent press release, the Japanese government reported that the proportion of people aged over 70 years is 20% in 2018.

A country's socioeconomic conditions must be taken into account when considering the issue of rapid ageing. Japan spent US$1 trillion, 30% of the Japanese National Income, on social security. Moreover, the problem of a decreasing working population is faced by Japan and other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. In 2010, sixty-three percent of the working population contributed to the national income. However, by 2050, only 50% of the working population will contribute to the national income.

It has been debated to what extent we should allocate resources to healthcare of the elderly, particularly when there is no hope of cure or improvement in the condition. These arguments often stem from an economic standpoint given that our society does not have adequate resources to sustain the increasing healthcare costs of the elderly. A comparison of the healthcare costs of the elderly and the national income, usually indicated as gross domestic product, seems to suggest that a large share of our resources is spent on providing care for the elderly with terminal conditions. It seems that the legend of Tono has been revived in modern societies with ageing populations. At present, we are facing a similar dilemma — should we abandon the elderly by withdrawing possible treatments to save our resources? Personally, I cannot condone a society in which the end of wealth results in the end of life.

### Evolving landscape of new drug approval in Japan and lags from international birth dates: retrospective regulatory analysis [^115dsPh9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) is the Japanese regulatory authority that protects the public health by securing safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs and medical devices. For a new drug approval, the PMDA conducts a scientific review on the product application according to the legislations in Japan, and after PMDA approval, Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) administratively grants the marketing authorization for the product based on the review report from the PMDA.

Acquiring the first‐in‐world approval for marketing authorization of new drugs yields several benefits in their own country, although such application often depends on the drug development strategy of manufactures. Early access to the latest treatment may improve the morbidity and mortality in patients with significant illness. Advancement of new drug development will bring social and economic profits. The medical review for new drug applications requires human resources, review quality, and trust of organization, and continuous improvement of those factors would increase in the activities and values of regulatory authority. However, there were even few reports reviewing new drug approvals in Japan and much less on those first approved in Japan ahead of the other countries.

Drug lag, the delay in time required for the drug approval, has been a critical issue of public health in Japan for many years. 1, 2 Drug lag may not be always evil, 3, 4 and the delay in approval may result in less frequent cautions after granting marketing authorization. 5, 6 However, drug lag would preclude the chance of patients to use new drugs and the early access to effective treatment. Drug lag is consisted of the delay in development by manufacturers and that in review period by regulatory authority. 7 In this decade, the PMDA achieved marked reduction in the review period for new drug applications. In 2019, the median approval time for the new drugs in the PMDA, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) were 304, 243, and 423 days, respectively. 8 Although the delay in regulatory review in Japan has almost been resolved, the persistence of drug lag in several specific therapeutic areas was recently pointed out, 9, 10 and it has not been well examined on the status quo of drug lag in Japan.

The aim of this study was to conduct a high‐level overview on the new drugs approved in Japan, with a focus on the first‐in‐world approval, and address the changes and current issues of drug lag in Japan.

### Barbarian medicine in feudal Japan [^114U9zMR]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

THE FIRST EUROPEANS to discover Japan were Portuguese traders who arrived in 1542. Fifteen years later, the Portuguese Jesuit priest and surgeon Luis De Almeida (1525–1583) founded the first Western hospital in Japan, for the care of lepers, syphilitics, and orphans. Because the hospital had a negative influence on the spread of Christianity, the Jesuits closed it in 1586. During the Tokugawa Shogunate (1600–1868), when Japan was secluded from the rest of the world, the only foreign physicians allowed to enter Japan were those employed by the Dutch factory at Dejima in Nagasaki. Only four of those physicians left behind seeds for the foundation of Western medicine in Japan, namely Caspar Schambergen, who founded a Japanese school of surgery in 1650; Engelbert Kämpfer, who visited Japan in 1691 to 1692; Carl Peter Thunberg, who botanically explored Japan in 1775 to 1776; and Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold, who practiced medicine in Nagasaki in 1823 to 1829 and 1859 to 1861. On the whole, Western medicine and surgery never established a real foothold in Japan until the fall of the shogunate and the restoration of the emperor in 1868.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^1153N6PZ]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Legal considerations for acute MCS withdrawal — jurisdictional differences — state that in the United States and Western Europe discontinuation of MCS is seen as allowing the process of natural death and recognizes patient autonomy or futility; the right of adults to refuse life support treatment is ethical and is also legally supported in the United States and numerous Western countries; by contrast, some regions such as Japan have legal restrictions, few guidelines are available in South America, the Middle East, and East Asia, and legal resources are a last resort if there are differing opinions regarding turning off the device.

### Treatment of war wounds: a historical review [^11213FiW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of war wounds is an ancient art, constantly refined to reflect improvements in weapons technology, transportation, antiseptic practices, and surgical techniques. Throughout most of the history of warfare, more soldiers died from disease than combat wounds, and misconceptions regarding the best timing and mode of treatment for injuries often resulted in more harm than good. Since the 19th century, mortality from war wounds steadily decreased as surgeons on all sides of conflicts developed systems for rapidly moving the wounded from the battlefield to frontline hospitals where surgical care is delivered. We review the most important trends in US and Western military trauma management over two centuries, including the shift from primary to delayed closure in wound management, refinement of amputation techniques, advances in evacuation philosophy and technology, the development of antiseptic practices, and the use of antibiotics. We also discuss how the lessons of history are reflected in contemporary US practices in Iraq and Afghanistan.

### 'Miscarriage or abortion?' understanding the medical language of pregnancy loss in britain; a historical perspective [^112S3edq]. Medical Humanities (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The clinical terminology applied to women's health experiences in Britain changed after the mid-1980s when doctors consciously began using the term 'miscarriage' instead of 'abortion' to refer to early pregnancy loss. In this essay I have sought to convey the meaning of this change in language: the factors behind it and its subsequent significance. Until now, Richard Beard's 1985 letter to the Lancet has tended to be perceived as an isolated stimulus to the shift in medical language and as a spontaneous response to women's feelings. However, evidence from medical journals and textbooks of the time reveals how Beard's letter and the change in medical language can be better understood in the context of certain historical developments that enabled and encouraged both the letter-writing and language shift.

From the late 1960s onwards, the changes in Britain's legislation allowing women greater access to abortion services also enabled them to discuss these issues with doctors without fear of being criminalised. In turn, doctors could engage in conversations with women without concern that they were being deceived: specifically, they could be confident that women describing symptoms of spontaneous pregnancy loss were not concealing a deliberate (and previously illegal) termination. Doctors' terminology for early pregnancy loss could now refer to something actually knowable. By the 1980s, developments in ultrasound technology enabled the content of a woman's uterus and any early pregnancy pathologies to be visualised in real time. Doctors were now able to apply their terminology diagnostically in the clinic.

For the first time in the medical history of early pregnancy loss, following the legal and technological developments described above, diagnostic language could be immediately coupled to a clinically knowable reality. For clinicians, this would have conferred greater significance upon the medical terminology and may have heightened consciousness of language in this context. Meanwhile, the need to define accurate and unambiguous terminology for describing diagnoses of fetal loss would have been given impetus by rapidly expanding medical knowledge of the fetus and the establishment of a new fetal-focused medical speciality. Consistent with this, the communication that sought to define the terminology came from a senior figure at the forefront of this burgeoning speciality.

### Introduction of nuclear medicine research in Japan [^117Jix98]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Every time we attend annual meetings of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine, we are surprised at the large number of attendees from Japan. In contrast, at the Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine there were fewer attendees from Europe than expected, probably due in part to the language issue. However, there were many interesting presentations of unique studies in Japan. These include research on diseases that are more frequent in Japan and Asia than in Europe, synthesis of original radiopharmaceuticals, and development of imaging devices and methods with novel ideas especially by Japanese manufacturers. In this review, we discuss recent nuclear medicine research conducted in Japan in the five categories of Oncology, Neurology, Cardiology, Radiopharmaceuticals and Technology.

### Expediting drug development in Japan: a PMDA perspective [^113jhbDH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Review time for a new drug in Japan has shortened dramatically since the establishment of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Nonetheless, Japan faces a new challenge so-called "Drug Loss", which means that new drugs approved overseas have not yet been developed in Japan or that development is delayed. In this manuscript, we describe how PMDA facilitates Japan's drug development to continuously provide innovative drugs to patients.

### Deaths associated with influenza pandemic of 1918–19, Japan [^115sxeiz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

A common characteristic of the above studies is their heavy reliance on official vital and health statistics of the time. Such data are widely recognized by demographers as being plagued by the often-severe problem of underreporting. Indeed, according to Johnson and Mueller, "it is generally accepted that recorded statistics of influenza morbidity and mortality are likely to be a significant understatement" (. 108). For India, Davis estimated that the "amount of underregistration certainly exceeds 30 per cent at all times, and is probably nearer 50 per cent" (. 34). For Indonesia, Gooszen advised that such data "should be regarded with a good deal of caution" (. 32), and Nitisastro opined that "for the system of registering deaths, the quality of the results was poor" (. 101). Japan is no exception to this pattern. According to Mosk, "we do not have a trustworthy picture of what happened to vital rates in the Tokugawa period… The same can be said for the Meiji period" (. 658), and Taeuber's assessment was that "the critical question is the accuracy of the records of vital events" (. 50). The uncharacteristically low estimates of deaths from influenza in Japan provide a strong rationale for cross-checking the findings in the manner of Davis' classic study of India.

We therefore used recently developed statistical methods to estimate the loss of population in Japan from the influenza pandemic of 1918–19. We adopted an approach that intentionally avoids heavy reliance on vital registration data and is based instead on population count data for Japan of that period. By applying data for multiple prefectures over time to prefecture-level population statistics, we estimated population loss from the pandemic to be the difference between expected population (using the prepandemic trajectory) and observed population (using the postpandemic trajectory). The new estimates are appreciably higher than the earlier estimates, bringing Japan's pandemic experience in line with that of other parts of Asia and resolving a major puzzle in the epidemiology of the 1918–19 pandemic.

### Japanese civilian and US military interaction in the evacuation of casualties from camp fuji [^1123eaLU]. BMJ Military Health (2020). High credibility.

Historically, if US soldiers at Camp Fuji become severely ill or suffer trauma, they are transported by the ground ambulance, as the doctor-led air ambulance in eastern Shizuoka has never been permitted to land at Camp Fuji. However, it is widely recognised that severely ill or traumatised patients require time-dependent medical management. It was therefore agreed to undertake a joint exercise between the US medical assets of Camp Fuji and the doctor helicopters in eastern Shizuoka prefecture in evacuating a simulated severely ill or traumatised US soldier. The aim of this article is to describe the background and rationale between this collaboration between the civilian Japanese air ambulance and the US medical assets in Camp Fuji.

### Exploring cultural imaginaries of robots with children with brittle bone disease: a participatory design study [^114SDWC6]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

As stated, the commitment to side with marginalised communities is attributed in part to societal changes occurring at the time. Increases in citizen engagement at local levels in Western European countries, along with geopolitically seismic events such the Vietnam War, led to a paradigmatic transition in IT design. Traditional design textbooks had long advocated a waterfall model where 'problems were defined by management with no input from those who would be using the system' (, 23). Over time, designers began to try to 'capture' the cognitive process of individual users (e.g. by tracking keystrokes and eye movements) and transpose it into program interface and workflow designs. This well-intentioned line of inquiry can be considered a liminal stage in the journey from top-down towards (the attempt to establish) equal power distribution in IT design, as it was part of the emergence of the concept of 'users', which had had no place in a system where large mainframe systems were custom-designed for individual companies at the behest of management. Such efforts eventually gave way to an understanding that technology is deeply bound by the social and political contexts in which it is used, as opposed to formalised best practices. This understanding is at the heart of what is known as sociotechnical design (a history of which can be found in), a pioneering philosophy that comprised a set of methods revolving around the central tenet that the improvement of working conditions and the advancement of human knowledge are equally as important as system design (note that this ties in well with critical theory). It was originally developed by the London Tavistock Institute and spread far beyond England, and notably to Scandinavian employers' associations. The approach was heavily critiqued by Scandinavian researchers at the time for its narrow approach to worker participation, 'as informants in a process dominated by managers and their specialists', and for its naïve conception of power distribution, as it advocated a voting system for decision-making in an environment with an unequal balance of authority (, 25). However, it was undoubtedly a strong influence on PD, lauded for the fact it emphasised the importance of attending to organisational concerns as well as technical ones, and for introducing prototyping onto the design scene.

### PinPinKorori or nenNenKorori: the historical and socioeconomic background of geriatric trauma care in Japan [^114jEPs2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The legends of Tono

Japanese historian and folklorist Yanagida Kunio wrote a book titled, 'The legends of Tono'. Tono is a city in Iwate Prefecture, which is also my hometown, the poorest region of Japan. Yanagida narrated the legend of an old man abandoned in the field. 'The legends in Tono' described an oral tradition of 'Denderano' or the lotus field. According to the folklore, the elderly man was brought to Denderano at the age of 60 years by his son with little food. At that time, elderly individuals were considered a burden to society, and the abandonment indicated a natural retirement of life. For a relatively short span of 200 years, the abandonment of life, a bizarre and tragic event, was common in this region at that time. From generation to generation, it was thought to be the only way for a family to survive and succeed in areas with insufficient food and resources. Practice of this rural custom has since ceased and remains a legend.

In the past, society did not allow the survival of those who could make little or no contribution to the happiness, well-being, or welfare of society. The 'normal' members of society are expected to contribute to society. Thus, the elderly were considered futile and non-normal, and, therefore, excluded from society. 'Normal' is based on the social notions of permission and elimination. As is expected, the value and meaning of 'normal' change with time and do not remain constant.

### Report of the WHO independent high-level commission on NCDs: where is the focus on addressing inequalities? [^1127PMrY]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

With regards to access to medicines and technologies, including diagnostic tools, many studies have found that availability and affordability of NCD medicines and technologies is much lower in LMICs than in high-income countries (HICs). Insulin is a striking example in that despite having been discovered 100 years, there are marked disparities and gaps in global insulin access. Governments, the private sector and other actors all need to be involved in finding sustainable solutions to ensure access to medicines and technologies within functioning health systems.

Lastly, as the report acknowledges, it fails to contextualise NCDs in humanitarian settings. Currently, the world is seeing an unprecedented number of individuals facing humanitarian emergencies with 125 million people affected, almost equivalent to the population of Japan. These individuals face many barriers to accessing care and medicines and are often reliant on external interventions to ensure their survival. Many of the authors of this comment are involved in a working group that establishes principles and guidelines for the management of NCDs in humanitarian settings, which have only recently started to be addressed in a systematic way.

### Return to galen [^113vjC7u]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

AT THE BEGINNING of the previous century, the English editor of a minor work by Galen called for a return to that ancient scholar after centuries of neglect. The appeal did not meet with success. Galen's reputation is currently based on renown arising from tradition, rather than an awareness of his actual contributions to medical science. His methodological approach to experimental medicine seems to have fallen into obscurity, although it anticipated modern principles. This report reviews the rise and fall in popularity of Galen's medical works, in an attempt to highlight the circumstances that still prevent a full appreciation of those writings.

### Heritage and stigma. Co-producing and communicating the histories of mental health and learning disability [^112P5BC4]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

For some, patient testimonies have offered the potential to communicate the histories of mental health in a new way and to throw the connection between institutions and society into 'heightened and revealing relief'. or others, the focus on history from below meant exactly that. Michael Ignatieff's review of five publications that included Museums of Madness, encouraged authors to explore the agency of the various actors in the committal process and question the assumption that the 'state was the hammer, and the working class only and always the anvil'. Since that time, the attempt to understand and reflect on patient perspectives has been an important feature of many historical studies. For others, the patient story, while important, was not necessarily defined on class grounds alone. Gender is clearly important here, but so too have been the differences between individual patients. As has been pointed out elsewhere, histories of madness that include mad 'eminences' rather than truly lowly and anonymous madmen and madwomen are not necessarily histories from below. To a degree, such comments reflect the availability of source materials and while things like diaries and letters can help to illuminate individual case studies, they are often difficult to come by. As a result, the use of archives that contain documents with a medical and/or an administrative focus mean that the unpicking of patient narratives is not straightforward. For those with research interests in the 20th century and beyond, the availability of and access to multiple narratives is potentially wider, and although not everyone chooses to go down that route, there are some good examples of academic studies which focus on patient perspectives.

Writing as an academic historian with no experience of current practice, this will to place patients at the heart of historical analysis appears to reflect initiatives that place service users and clients at the heart of decision-making processes. Indeed, although service user advocacy has its own history, their involvement in policy-oriented research and the evaluation of services had been going on since the late 20th century. While it may be stretching the point to draw a direct connection, the awareness of the importance and centrality of the voice and views of people at the sharp end of procedure and policies seems to provide some common ground, and so it proved with the Heritage and Stigma project. Beyond, this, however, the success of the project was dependent on how the histories of care were relevant to its aims, and this meant challenging some commonly held views about care in the past.

### Evolving landscape of new drug approval in Japan and lags from international birth dates: retrospective regulatory analysis [^113wjysE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Between 2008 and 2019, a total of 400 drugs with NASs have been approved in Japan, in which 20.0% were first‐in‐world (Table 1). Among 400 new drugs, 202 (50.5%) were first approved in the United States, 82 (20.5%) were in Europe, 80 (20.0%) were in Japan, and 36 (9.0%) were in the other regions (Figure 1). The vast majority were the new drugs with global approvals, and 45 (11.3%) were those with local approvals as not yet approved outside Japan. Among 355 new drugs with global approvals, 9.9% were first approved in Japan. There was a difference in nationality of the manufacturers between the new drugs with global approvals and local approvals. The local approvals were mostly by the Japanese manufacturers, although 134 of 173 (77.5%) products by Japanese manufacturers achieved global approvals. The proportion of the Japanese manufacturers was high for the Japan‐first products (80.0%), and that of the non‐Japanese manufacturers were also high for the global‐first products (93.6%). For postmarketing alert for drug safety, the Blue Letters were provided for 9 (2.5%) products with global approvals and 1 (2.2%) with local approvals, and 2 (2.5%) of Japan‐first and 8 (2.5%) of global‐first products. No Yellow Letter has been published during the past 12 years. Discontinuation from any cause, including significant concern in efficacy or safety, expiration of approval, or manufacturer's decision, were seen in 4 (1.1%) products with global approvals and 1 (2.2%) with a local approval, and 2 (2.5%) in Japan‐first and 3 (0.9%) of global‐first products. There was no specific trend in the number of new drugs by year for both new drugs with global approvals and local approvals (Figure 2 a, b).

### Comparing the eyes depicted in Japanese portraits of beautiful women: the meiji and modern periods [^111ov53b]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The women portrayed in the bijin-ga of the past, particularly those from the Meiji Period (1868–1912), tended not to show much resemblance to those of women portrayed in the more modern bijin-ga (from after World War II), and such an observation came across as a possible indication that Japanese standards of beauty have changed over the two eras. To examine whether the apparent discrepancy can be interpreted as an actual change in the standards or not, a study was designed with the aim of assigning numeric values to several aspects of the eyes and testing for the presence of a statistically significant difference in each of the aspects between the Meiji bijin-ga and the modern bijin-ga.

Methods

For this study, 29 Meiji bijin-ga and 36 modern bijin-ga were selected. The eye was chosen as the subject of comparison, and five aspects were categorized and measured: (1) presence or absence of a double fold, (2) eye width, (3) eye height, (4) eyebrow-to-upper lid distance, and (D) corneal diameter. The eye width, the eye height, and the eyebrow-to-upper lid distance were divided by the corneal diameter to derive standardized grounds for comparison.

Results

The difference in double-fold frequencies between the Meiji bijin-ga (24%) and the modern bijin-ga (36%) was not found to be statistically significant (p = 0.298). There was no difference in the eye width-to-corneal diameter ratio between the Meiji bijin-ga (mean 2.57 ± 0.6) and the modern bijin-ga (mean 2.61 ± 0.85) (p = 0.86). The eye height-to-corneal diameter ratio derived from the Meiji bijin-ga (mean 0.62 ± 0.15) was significantly smaller than that derived from the modern bijin-ga (mean 0.82 ± 0.18) (p = 0.000). The eyebrow to upper lid distance-to-corneal diameter ratio derived from the Meiji bijin-ga (mean 2.21 ± 0.83) was significantly greater than that derived from the modern bijin-ga (mean 1.36 ± 0.78) (p = 0.000).

Conclusions

The results of the study support the notion that Westernization contributed to bringing about changes in the Japanese standards of beautiful eyes in the context of bijin-ga. However, the fact that the changeover has not occurred in all the categories in question does not indicate that the Occidental characteristics came to be emulated in their entirety.

### Strained encounters of the anthropogene: preservation and extinction in tatsuaki ishiguro' s' It is with the deepest sincerity that I offer prayers' [^112eH2Lh]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

Calculating biovalue in an age of planetary emergency involves fraught decisions over what and whom should be saved, over the science used to make these decisions, and the biotechnologies used for this partial salvation. Tatsuaki Ishiguro's short story, 'It is with the Deepest Sincerity that I Offer Prayers', dramatises these decisions through a series of strained encounters in a remote species preservation centre between two molecular biologists and the last two remaining members of a rare species of mouse. Set on Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, largely inhabited by Indigenous Ainu communities until the island's colonisation in the late 19th century, Ishiguro's story subverts the teleology of species-life on which conservation models depend. Unsettling what Krithika Srinivasan identifies as human-centred values of well-being (and sexual reproduction) in wildlife conservation, these strained encounters between scientists and test subjects, selectionist methods and theories of life are a genre of what Hannah Landecker has recently called 'anthropogenic biology': relations of organic matter shaped by biological control, both affected by and exceeding calculations of scientific efficacy. The article tackles questions of reproductive justice for communities who fall outside core sites of climate mitigation, building on research that shows how conservation projects obscure the realities of environmental pressures caused by industrialisation while upholding a species-centred, genetic ark model of survival. The molecular biologists of Ishiguro's story encounter something akin to what Landecker calls life as aftermath: ecological flourishing that is historically bound to particular times and places, and which cannot be reproduced indefinitely.

### Dutch surgery in Japan [^112nX6R1]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

An isolation policy was adopted in feudal Japan from 1639 to 1853 owing to the fear of foreign influence. During those 200 years of isolation, all foreigners were withheld from the country with the exception of the Dutch, who were permitted to establish a trading post on a small island in the Bay of Nagasaki, called Decima. Western culture and science reached the Japanese exclusively through the Dutch on Decima. Health care on Decima was provided by Dutch barber-surgeons, who introduced Western surgical practice in Japan. Official interpreters were the only Japanese allowed on Decima. It was from among these interpreters that the first Japanese surgeons arose who, having mastered the Dutch language, translated several Dutch anatomic and surgical texts. Genpaku Sugita translated a Dutch anatomy textbook into Japanese, which was completed in 1774. This book, entitled Kaitai Shinsho [New Book on Anatomy], was the first Western scientific monograph to be translated entirely into Japanese. Several Dutch surgical schools were founded through which Dutch surgery, known in Japan as "surgery of the red-haired" was propagated. According to the custom of the surgical guilds in Holland, certificates were granted to Japanese apprentices who had completed their training in Dutch surgery. About 60 Dutch surgeons had served on Decima up to 1850, providing the basis for surgery to develop in Japan. Among them, Philipp Franz von Siebold was an exceptional scholar who also had a great impact in making Japanese culture known to the Western world.

Introduction

The US has long supported global immunisation through bilateral funding via the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and multilateral funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi). However, these programmes face a crisis after the abrupt funding suspension in 2025.

### Fatherlessness, sperm donors and' so what?' parentage: arguing against the immorality of donor conception through' world literature' [^116t6hvJ]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Moses is perhaps a better example. As Velleman notes, in Exodus 2.22 Moses says, 'I have been a stranger in a strange land' and, indeed, his heritage as a Hebrew among Egyptians defines his story. But Moses is also adopted. His adoption by the Pharaoh's daughter sets Moses on a path that leads him to rescue the Israelites. Moses does not reunite with his birth family and his birth mother is not mentioned again. When the Lord speaks to Moses he says, 'Who gave man a mouth, or who makes (one) dumb or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord? I will be with your mouth, and I will instruct you what you shall speak' (Exodus 4:11–12). The Lord here is creator and nurturer and plays a more central role than an earthly parent. In Exodus, complex issues surround the political and ancestral links to Israel; but without adoption, Moses would not have become Judaism's pre-eminent prophet.

The story of Telemachus is more fitting for Velleman because it details a son earnestly waiting for his father to return from a long quest. However, all three ancient texts deal with illegitimacy, adoption and biological parentage in diverse ways as these mythical characters are from opposing philosophical traditions; to suggest that biology provides centrality to identity is a low-resolution way of understanding the historical and sociopolitical contexts of these stories. Mythical form contributes to an idea of what family can mean, and we can use legends and fiction to explore family formations and identity while still appreciating that they do not promise to reveal a universal 'truth'. In Velleman's 'Narrative Explanation', an article on story-telling, he argues that an audience 'understands the narrated events, first, because it knows how they feel, in the sense that it experiences them as leading it through a natural emotional sequence' (2003, 19). However, the audiences for these stories span different times and cultures and can therefore form different inferences as to what the stories convey.

### Is recent major hurricane activity normal? [^1156a92T]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

The anomaly of the recent increase in Atlantic major hurricane activity (MHA) is controversial. From a reconstruction of past MHA, Nyberg et al. conclude that the present activity is not unusual by comparison with that of the past 270 years. However, here I estimate the uncertainty of average MHA in the hurricane record before 1945 and show that the reconstruction of Nyberg et al. differs strongly from that record, and probably overestimates past MHA. Owing to this and further reasons, I question whether their reconstruction provides an accurate basis for conclusions about past MHA.

### Ending nuclear weapons, before they end us [^117RUzSg]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

This May, the World Health Assembly (WHA) will vote on re-establishing a mandate for the WHO to address the health consequences of nuclear weapons and war. Health professionals and their associations should urge their governments to support such a mandate and support the new United Nations (UN) comprehensive study on the effects of nuclear war.

The first atomic bomb exploded in the New Mexico desert 80 years ago, in July 1945. Three weeks later, two relatively small (by today's standards), tactical-size nuclear weapons unleashed a cataclysm of radioactive incineration on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By the end of 1945, about 213 000 people were dead. Tens of thousands more have died from late effects of the bombings.

Last December, Nihon Hidankyo, a movement that brings together atomic bomb survivors, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its 'efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again'. For the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the award validated the most fundamental human right: the right to live. The Committee warned that the menace of nuclear weapons is now more urgent than ever before. In the words of Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes, "it is naive to believe our civilisation can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons. The world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation". He noted that our survival depended on keeping intact the 'nuclear taboo' (which stigmatises the use of nuclear weapons as morally unacceptable).

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge global impact. Historically, the role of the scientific community has been crucial for developing science-based interventions to be implemented by public health authorities seeking to effectively confront newly emerging infectious diseases. In Japan's first-phase response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted through the end of June 2020, the Expert Meeting (EM) for COVID-19 response served as an advisory group for the government's COVID-19 Response Headquarters. The group played a much more extensive role than groups of technical experts are generally expected to play. This article reviews the literature on the role and achievements of the EM in the COVID-19 response during February–June 2020, with the aim of defining the ideal relationship and mechanism of expert groups and government authorities for future public health crisis management.

Activities of the Advisory Bodies in Early February

The initial roles of the Advisory Board in the MHLW and the EM in the ad hoc GOJ HQ in early February were limited to expressing their opinions on items included in the meeting agenda set by the government; however, their comments were immediately reflected in government policy (Tables 1, 2). For example, the government's discharge policy for asymptomatic patients was modified to use negative test results on February 18, soon after a discussion of the issue by the EM on February 16. The group's discussion of mass gathering events on February 19 was quickly followed by the Health Minister's alert, issued on February 20, and the Prime Minister's request on February 26, that persons refrain from hosting mass gathering events. Public health measures (e.g. surveillance and prevention of the spread of infection) and the capacity of the medical system to prepare for the pandemic phase were discussed at the fourth and fifth meetings of the EM, subsequent to which notifications were sent to local governments to enhance their preparedness for the pandemic phase on March 1 and March 6.

Proposing the "New Normal" during the State Of Emergency

On April 7, GOJ declared a 1-month state of emergency in 7 prefectures for the COVID-19 outbreak under Article 31 of the Special Measures Act. The state of emergency was expanded to cover the entire country on April 16.

On April 22, SRRC reported its interim analysis of public behavior and pointed out the need for an 80% reduction in human-to-human contact throughout the society of Japan. The EM expressed concerns regarding the spread of the disease attributable to travel during the national holiday season beginning at the end of April. SRRC also encouraged the securing of more medical and public health capacity under the governors' leadership. On May 1, SRRC updated its interim analysis of public behavior and proposed the continuation of the state of emergency. It recommended that strict behavioral changes be called for in highly infected areas, and that in areas where the incidence of the disease was limited, residents should be encouraged to lead their lives under a "new normal".

On May 4, SRRC updated its situational assessment and reconfirmed the need for a state of emergency. The EM encouraged the installation of the new normal both in daily life and in business and published the "New Normal in Practice" in an Annex of SRRC. The EM also proposed considerations for developing infection control guidelines according to the type of business to encourage implementation of infection control in business areas and the restart of social activities. On the same day, GOJ extended the state of emergency through the end of May, with consideration given to the epidemic situation and SRRC.

On May 14, SRRC proposed conditions for lifting and re-declaring the state of emergency as well as a step-by-step reopening strategy. GOJ lifted the state of emergency for 39 of the 47 prefectures on the same day and lifted it entirely on May 25.

On May 29, SRRC summarized the interim assessment of the epidemic response since January. It concluded that early detection, a cluster-based strategy, and the state of emergency were the keys to success in suppressing the number of cases and deaths in the early phase. SRRC also pointed out problems in diagnosis, medical capacity, the functioning of public health centers, surveillance, infection prevention and control, and research and development for medical countermeasures, and proposed the "Checklist for Preparedness in Local Government for the Second Wave".

### SCAI position statement on best practices for clinical proctoring of new technologies and techniques [^117BhDEA]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2022). High credibility.

Clinical proctoring — preparing the patient and informed consent states that prior to the procedure day, the patient should be informed that they will be undergoing a procedure for which the operating physician will be proctored and industry clinical support will be involved in the case, and the extent of the proctor's involvement should be discussed with the patient in advance; this information needs to be reinforced on the day of the procedure and incorporated into the consent discussion. The patient needs to be comfortable knowing that the host physician may be doing a procedure or using a specific device for the first time or with minimal experience and must be given the freedom to choose to not proceed based on this information, and the key to providing informed consent while respecting patient autonomy is to genuinely acknowledge any patient concerns and work on establishing trust and rapport. Being well versed in the rates of success and complications from the pivotal randomized trials and post-market studies (if available) is extremely important in addressing patient concerns, and if the technology or procedure is completely new with unknown and potentially significant risks, then this also needs to be explicitly stated in the consent discussion. The patient should be respected and not feel pressured to perform the procedure on that day merely because a proctor is available, and patient safety and best clinical care should always be paramount, and providers should feel comfortable canceling a procedure based on their clinical judgment.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 660: family building through gestational surrogacy [^116q3e41]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Cross-border reproductive care in gestational surrogacy refers to the rapidly growing practice of individuals seeking assisted reproductive technology treatment outside of their country of domicile, including Americans seeking gestational carrier arrangements abroad and foreign nationals seeking gestational carrier arrangements in the United States, pursued to access more affordable treatment, to have a broader array of high-quality treatment options, to avoid legal restrictions in their country, or to protect their privacy. The benefits of U.S. citizenship, acceptance of same-sex partnership, and legality of gestational surrogacy in many U.S. states have led increasing numbers of foreign intended parents to seek cross-border reproductive care and the birth of resulting offspring in the United States, but compared with domestic gestational surrogacy, cross-border reproductive care is particularly fraught with ethical and legal challenges and involves obstacles to ensuring optimal medical safety, preventing undue inducement of gestational carriers, and establishing parentage and citizenship status for offspring, and political, religious, and legal norms, as well as attitudes regarding assisted reproductive technologies, vary widely among involved countries, making an internationally acceptable framework difficult.

Expert Meeting's Proactive Engagement in Developing Intervention Strategies Such as 3Cs

During the first 2 weeks of February, MHLW concentrated on the missions of 4 chartered flights to evacuate Japanese citizens from China's Wuhan Province and on the safe disembarkation of passengers and crew from the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship. Recognizing the potential risk and impact of delay, and the changing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic nationwide, members of the EM saw the need for immediate precautionary actions and assumed a more active role. The members agreed to propose measures proactively to GOJ rather than merely responding passively to the government's agenda. After the group's third meeting, the Health Minister accepted the group's proposal that the EM publish "Perspectives", enabling the EM to communicate its opinions and recommendations directly to citizens.

The EM's first issue of Perspectives was published on February 24, 1 day before publication of the GOJ Key Principles Responding to COVID-19. The initial Perspectives characterized as a high-risk environment for COVID-19 transmission any occasion "where people meet many others face-to-face at close range and have a conversation for a certain period". The publication expressed concern regarding the chain of events where 1 infected person infects many others and thus forms a cluster. This concern became the basis for Japan's "cluster-based approach" to COVID-19. The EM hosted a press conference on the day of publication and described the epidemiologic situation as "critical" over the coming 1–2 weeks.

After the release of GOJ Key Principles on February 25, GOJ intensified its response to COVID-19. On February 26, the Prime Minister asked the public not to host any mass-gathering event for the next 2 weeks. He also asked that schools be closed for the entire term until the scheduled spring break, a measure he took without consulting with the EM.

### Tackling algorithmic bias and promoting transparency in health datasets: the STANDING together consensus recommendations [^112z98Zb]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2025). High credibility.

Bias (of datasets or algorithms)

For the purpose of the STANDING Together recommendations, bias is defined as a systematic deviation from objectivity or neutrality, which can occur at any stage throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) development lifecycle. In the health-care context, bias can reflect differences between groups that are driven by factors that do not have clinical relevance. In the context of datasets, bias can arise because of differences in the rate or characteristics of errors or missingness between groups, or because of underlying distortions in the environment from which data are recorded (including structural and systematic discrimination and oppression). Biases in the outputs of algorithms (algorithmic bias) can unfairly disadvantage certain groups over others, and might reflect biases in datasets or result from choices made during development.

Contextualised groups of interest

A group of individuals with shared relevant attributes that have known or suspected associations with disparate health outcomes related to the intended use of an AI health technology. Groups can be defined by multiple attributes (eg, age in combination with gender), particularly when these factors might interact and compound disparate health outcomes (see intersectionality). Disparate health outcomes can be driven by a variety of factors, including structural and social determinants of health, biological factors, or by the AI health technology under development (including datasets used and the effect of implementation on the health-care pathway; a non-exhaustive list of potentially relevant attributes is provided in the appendix [p 2]). The relative contribution of each factor can evolve over time.

Data custodian

Individuals or organisations legally (or otherwise) responsible for the dataset.

Data origin

The original event or context in which data were generated (figure 2). This should usually include details of the specific setting and geographical location in which data were created. For instance, data generated through provision of health care in a secondary care hospital in Geneva, Switzerland; data generated on participation in a clinical trial done across 20 hospitals in Japan; or data generated through interaction with a consumer-facing app freely available via the internet. When the data origin is a provider of health-care services, details of the health-care system in which it operates should also be included (eg, details of how the system is funded and accessibility of health-care services).

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^1133hBhT]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Media and public health law — federal and state powers for communicable disease control state that U.S. federal law permits the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to take measures to prevent spread of diseases when state or U.S. possession actions are insufficient, and measures may include inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles believed to be sources of infection. A person who has a communicable disease during the transmissible period can be restricted from traveling from one state or possession to another without a permit from the state or territorial health officer, or destination locality. For interstate conveyances on which a case or suspected case develops, the person in charge is required, as soon as practicable, to notify the local health authority at the next port of call, station, or stop, and to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease as the local health authority directs. State laws authorize quarantine and isolation powers, often granted in the state public health code, and courts have consistently upheld these powers as consistent with state police powers; scope varies, with some states having broad powers applicable to any emerging infectious disease threat and others targeting specific conditions. Constitutional limitations apply, requiring compliance with procedural and substantive due process and that when deprivation of liberty involves a fundamental right the government must demonstrate a compelling interest and that the power is narrowly tailored to achieve a public health goal. Other community containment uses of state police powers, such as social distancing, event cancellation, and related strategies, also may raise constitutional concerns but are less restrictive on liberties and therefore less likely to face strict scrutiny by a court.

### Expediting drug development in Japan: a PMDA perspective [^116U5s8J]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

FUTURE STEPS AND CHALLENGES

Other initiatives have also been taken in addition to those described above: (1) Expedited pathways such as "Sakigake" and "Conditional early approval" are available in Japan,(2) Practical review operations about engineered viral vectors in terms of the Cartagena Protocol have also been dramatically improved in recent years to avoid developmental delays in Japan,(3) An PMDA webpage has been created in English to facilitate better understanding of Japanese regulations and promotion of medical product development in Japan by foreign companies, including EBPs. Regulatory efforts described above will create synergism with other initiatives, including efforts to improve clinical trial site environments (e.g. use of central IRB), and price benchmarking, on drug pricing policy in Japan, such as a price premium for promoting innovation, and financial support such as subsidization and tax credits for orphan product development. The 3 rd Healthcare Policy for 5 years approved by the Cabinet in February 2025 clearly illuminates the direction of the Japanese government's strong support for scientific innovation and drug development. The recently announced action plan by the Cabinet Secretariat provides more detailed measures to be undertaken over the next few years to strengthen Japan's drug discovery capabilities. Promoting these initiatives is expected to help resolve drug loss in Japan. PMDA strives to foster and support scientific and technological advancement by enhancing science‐based regulatory systems. In the short term, use of artificial intelligence in drug development and regulatory practice is a critical challenge. It will be crucial to work internationally to ensure its appropriate application without impeding scientific advances.

Finally, PMDA aspires to have its initiatives widely recognized by various stakeholders and to expedite drug development in Japan. PMDA is ready for the next challenge and its doors are always open.

At this meeting, the Risk Communication Advisory Committee will discuss recent developments in risk communication and related sciences and possible approaches and applications in the context of FDA communications. with the risk being what we just went through is the in and outs of the long necessary reading of the disclosure requirements and things like that. So to lay a bit of foundation, the FDA's mission is clearly related to effectively communicating the things that the FDA does. So this is from the 2011 to 2015 Strategic Priorities: "We recognize that effective. FDA has to regularly issue or have other people write and then they approve. So what are REMS.

Just kind of as a reminder or to the audience, it's when the FDA determines that additional safety measures are needed beyond the professional labeling of a drug, or whatever it might be, to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh its risks. at the drug company and then submitted to the FDA, and then the FDA will allow them and put them on the website, which is where I found some of the examples for today. So consider the mindset of those creating REMS. Their goal is to Free State Reporting, Inc. 1378 Cape St. Claire Road Annapolis, MD 21409 974–0947. 167 get the food, drug, cosmetic approved. Their lawyer's main goal or legal team's main goal, whatever you want to call it, is to protect the organization. We want to get this approved — the organization tells their lawyers this is what we want to do; now you need to get this done. You can't just have — you can't just use sixth or seventh grade writing and then just put a whole block of text with no paragraphs in there.

Nobody's going to read it. Nobody's going to be invited to get into that particular document. So you need to mix the worlds from clear writing. necessarily the order. So this is where I think prioritizing risk information becomes something that we should look at further. So creating functional risk hierarchies, as I call this, is really something that we should do to guide future drafters of documents that have a legal bent or at least high.

### Past imaging history. A new term to be introduced systematically in a patient's medical history [^116B9UYY]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In an era of integrated and multimodality imaging, which undoubtedly have added great diagnostic value in our daily practice, Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) is still underrated and not fully exploited. We believe it bears an enormous potential, able to give us relevant clinical information and a rapid overview of a patient's past medical history through his/her "past imaging history". For this reason, we suggest that "Past Imaging History" should begin to represent an essential and integral part of a patient's medical history and its systematic acquisition should be encouraged and introduced from the very early years of medical education.

### Proactive engagement of the expert meeting in managing the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, Japan, February-June 2020 [^115gfX8w]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In response to the spread of COVID-19 in Hokkaido Prefecture, where the governor had declared a nonbinding state of emergency on February 28, the EM provided an epidemiologic assessment and proposed necessary measures for the prefecture. The EM called for action by the residents and businesses of Hokkaido to reduce human-to-human contact and avoid high-risk environments. The EM also issued an alert regarding the potential risk of younger people being spreaders.

Perspectives proposed the 3 pillars of the COVID-19 response strategy: early detection and response to clusters, having the medical capacity for early diagnosis and intensive care for severely ill patients, and self-motivated behavior changes by citizens. The EM also published "Considerations Regarding a High-Risk Environment for a Cluster-Forming Event in Daily Life" (Considerations). Considerations provided critical information for preventing the formation of clusters, recommending the avoidance of the 3Cs (closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with many persons nearby, and close-contact settings such as close-range conversations).

### Proactive engagement of the expert meeting in managing the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, Japan, February-June 2020 [^112gqbae]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

To deal with the risk of emerging diseases with many unknowns, close and timely collaboration and communication between science experts and policymakers are crucial to developing and implementing an effective science-based intervention strategy. The Expert Meeting, an ad hoc medical advisory body, was established in February 2020 to advise Japan's COVID-19 Response Headquarters. The group played an important role in the policymaking process, promoting timely situation awareness and developing science-based proposals on interventions that were promptly reflected in government actions. However, this expert group may have been overly proactive in taking on the government's role in crisis management. For the next stage of managing the coronavirus disease pandemic and future pandemics, the respective roles of the government and its advisory bodies need to be clearly defined. Leadership and strategic risk communication by the government are key.

### Rapid regional perturbations to the recent global geomagnetic decay revealed by a new hawaiian record [^117R1omF]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

The dominant dipolar component of the Earth's magnetic field has been steadily weakening for at least the last 170 years. Prior to these direct measurements, archaeomagnetic records show short periods of significantly elevated geomagnetic intensity. These striking phenomena are not captured by current field models and their relationship to the recent dipole decay is highly unclear. Here we apply a novel multi-method archaeomagnetic approach to produce a new high-quality record of geomagnetic intensity variations for Hawaii, a crucial locality in the central Pacific. It reveals a short period of high intensity occurring ~1,000 years ago, qualitatively similar to behaviour observed 200 years earlier in Europe and 500 years later in Mesoamerica. We combine these records with one from Japan to produce a coherent picture that includes the dipole decaying steadily over the last millennium. Strong, regional, short-term intensity perturbations are superimposed on this global trend; their asynchronicity necessitates a highly non-dipolar nature.

### Learning from others. Japan's role in bringing psychology to China [^115Xbeai]. The American Psychologist (2000). Low credibility.

Recent research by Chinese and Japanese historians of psychology and education suggests that it was educational reformers' copying of Japan's education system in the 1st decade of the 20th century that provided the context for developing modern psychology in China. Psychology, although not well understood by those reformers, was thought to be useful in teacher training. In 1902 Japanese psychology teachers came to China and some textbooks were translated. Chinese students studying in Japan also brought back psychological knowledge in translations. However, the Chinese attraction to study in Japan declined after 1906. As the United States opened new universities and provided opportunities for Chinese students to study in U.S. schools, it became a more attractive option for later generations of Chinese, who saw psychology become established as a separate discipline.

### Unusually large earthquakes inferred from tsunami deposits along the kuril trench [^116sDnhL]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

The Pacific plate converges with northeastern Eurasia at a rate of 8–9 m per century along the Kamchatka, Kuril and Japan trenches. Along the southern Kuril trench, which faces the Japanese island of Hokkaido, this fast subduction has recurrently generated earthquakes with magnitudes of up to approximately 8 over the past two centuries. These historical events, on rupture segments 100–200 km long, have been considered characteristic of Hokkaido's plate-boundary earthquakes. But here we use deposits of prehistoric tsunamis to infer the infrequent occurrence of larger earthquakes generated from longer ruptures. Many of these tsunami deposits form sheets of sand that extend kilometres inland from the deposits of historical tsunamis. Stratigraphic series of extensive sand sheets, intercalated with dated volcanic-ash layers, show that such unusually large tsunamis occurred about every 500 years on average over the past 2,000–7,000 years, most recently approximately 350 years ago. Numerical simulations of these tsunamis are best explained by earthquakes that individually rupture multiple segments along the southern Kuril trench. We infer that such multi-segment earthquakes persistently recur among a larger number of single-segment events.

### Three decades of population health changes in Japan, 1990–2021: a subnational analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116VwKAN]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 was responsible for 0.3% of total deaths in 2020 (age-standardised mortality rate 0.8 deaths [95% UI 0.7–0.9] per 100 000 population), and 1.0% of total deaths in 2021 (3.0 [2.5–3.7] per 100 000). COVID-19 mortality rates varied among prefectures; in 2020, the age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rate ranged from 0.0 (0.0–0.0) in Shimane to 2.2 (1.0–3.4) in Hokkaido; and in 2021, the range extended from 0.2 (0.1–0.4) in Tottori to 8.8 (3.6–16.9) in Okinawa (appendix 1 pp 13, 28–29).

### Historicising global nutrition: critical reflections on contested pasts and reimagined futures [^112Fhijv]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a range of economic shocks, food systems shocks, public health crises and political upheavals across the globe, prompting a rethink of associated global systems. Prepandemic anticolonial movements that challenged hierarchies of race, space, gender and expert knowledge in global health took on new meaning in the context of the unequal impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it moved through different kinds of spaces and distinct political contexts. In light of these dynamics, and the desire of many current practitioners in global health to reimagine the future, the need for critical analyses of the recent past have become more urgent. Here we challenge linear understandings of progress in global health-with a focus on the field of nutrition-by returning to consider a previous cycle of dramatic social, political and economic change that prompted serious challenges to the dominance of Western powers and US-based philanthro-capitalists. With a 'global' health and nutrition audience in mind, we put forward considerations on why a better understanding of the continuities and divergences between this past and the present moment are necessary to challenge a status quo that was, and is, highly flawed.

### Association of the great east Japan earthquake and the daiichi nuclear disaster in fukushima city, Japan, with birth rates [^115iTUqC]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The association of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster of March 11 and 12, 2011, in Fukushima, Japan, with birth rates has not been examined appropriately in the existing literature.

Objective

To assess the midterm and long-term associations of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster with birth rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study in which interrupted time series analyses were used to assess monthly changes in birth rates among residents of Fukushima City, Japan, from March 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017, relative to projected birth rates without the disaster based on predisaster trends. Birth rates from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2017, in Fukushima City were determined using information from the Fukushima City government office.

Exposure

The Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster, expressed via 5 potential models of the association with birth rate: level change, level and slope changes, temporal level change, and temporal level change with 1 or 2 slope change(s).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Birth rate, calculated from monthly data on the number of births and total population.

Results

The mean birth rate before the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster was 69.8 per 100 000 people per month; after the disaster, the mean birth rate was 61.9 per 100 000 people per month. Compared with birth rates before the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster, there was an estimated 10% reduction in monthly birth rates in Fukushima City (rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86–0.93) in the first 2 years after the disaster. After that, the birth rate trend was similar to the predisaster trend. The predisaster trend suggested a continuous decrease in birth rate (rate ratio for 1 year, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99). This gap model was optimal and parsimonious compared with others. A similar association was found when trimonthly averaged data were analyzed.

Conclusions and Relevance

The Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster were followed by significant reductions in birth rates for 2 years. There was insufficient evidence to indicate that the trend in the 3 to 7 years after the disaster differed from the predisaster trends. The recovery from the reductions in the birth rate may be indicative of the rebuilding efforts. The continuing long-term decrease in birth rates observed before the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant disaster suggests that continuing measures to support birth planning should be considered at the administrative level.

### Quantifying local stability and noise levels from time series in the US Western interconnection blackout on 10th August 1996 [^114j4CUQ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For power grid analysis, the (N)BLE approach is well justified by the macroscopic aggregated swing equation (ASE; Eq. S.4 in the SI),– for stable grid conditions and less coarse-grained model simulations (cf. SI S3). Under certain constraints, the mesoscopic frequency dynamics of an N -node power grid, described by the less coarse-grained classical swing equation (CSE; Eq. S.5 in the SI) can be summarised by the coarse-grained ASE as the center-of-inertia frequency with dynamics that follow an OU process, i.e. a Langevin-type equation. Nevertheless, the ASE is a model approximation, and real-world bus voltage frequency data can exhibit nonlinear drift behaviour. This is also the case for the analysed time series in this article (cf. SI S4). Therefore, by using the (N)BLE, a heuristic nonlinear drift is assumed in the ASE.

The total balance between power generation and consumption is critical for maintaining the stable synchrony of bus voltage frequency, typically 60 Hz (e.g. USA, Japan) or 50 Hz (e.g. Europe, also Japan). Variations in the electric energy generation and consumption of grid components (some of which are shown as an example in Supplementary Box S1 a) thus affect the frequency dynamics. This is why the bus voltage frequency ω is a macroscopic key observable for assessing grid stability in control rooms.

Power outages as well as control mechanisms live on time scales of seconds up to several minutes (cf. SI S5). For these reasons, we focus on the sub-second to minute resolution. Since our theoretical considerations (cf. also SI S6 for B- and N-tipping, and S7 for R-tipping) are largely supported by the NBLE analysis of frequency data from the North America Western Interconnection (NAWI) cascading failure on 10th August 1996, the timeline of this historic event is briefly summarised in Fig. 1 a. A more detailed description is left for SI S8. Please note that all times in this article are given in the local Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).

### A survey of U. S. state insurance commissioners concerning genetic testing and life insurance: redux at 27 [^116ZP7Nd]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2020). Medium credibility.

Nearly three decades ago, scientists set out on one of the largest research endeavors in modern history-mapping the human genome. The research not only sparked new technologies and genetic tests, but also concomitant concerns regarding ethical, legal, and social implications of the technologies. These developments ultimately resulted in an expanded role for genetic counselors to educate consumers about the possible consequences of receiving genetic test results. In particular, many individuals undergoing testing worry that the resulting information could be used by social actors, such as life insurers, in harmful ways. Because life insurance is regulated at the state level, there is significant variability across the United States in laws and enforcement protecting consumers' genetic information. This article reports the results of a survey of U.S. state insurance commissioners regarding regulation of genetic testing and life insurance. The survey builds on a 1992 survey conducted by Jean E. McEwen et al. It returns to current U.S. state insurance commissioners to investigate changes in the climate surrounding genetic information use and risks of misuse within the insurance industry. In their 1992 survey, McEwen et al. found that: (a) genetic testing was not yet perceived to pose a significant problem for insurance rating, (b) life insurers had quite a bit of legal freedom to require and use genetic test results, and (c) insurance commissioners had received few consumers' complaints about the use of genetic information. Twenty-seven years later, our survey finds an increase in regulation protecting genetic information in insurance, but at a pace much slower than that of advances in new DNA technologies. This lag in policy to match technology increases potential risks for consumers. Our study further reveals certain inconsistencies in the letter of state law protecting consumers' genetic information and how state insurance commissioners apply that law. The study also shows that despite empirical evidence in the literature demonstrating consumer fear about genetic discrimination, consumers do not report these concerns to their state insurance commissioner. We suggest genetic counselors are key stakeholders who can help fill current gaps between consumers and the insurance industry.

### Telemedicine: pediatric applications [^1159wfZc]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Telemedicine definition and historical context in pediatrics states that telemedicine has been defined as "the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve a patient's clinical health status", and that telemedicine and telehealth, as commonly used today, can be considered synonymous. Historical examples note that telecommunications has had a role in medical care at least since the Civil War, when the telegraph was used to transmit casualty lists and to order supplies, and that the invention of the telephone and radio expanded medical telecommunications while the telephone maintains a central role. The earliest recorded reference to telemedicine involved teleradiology and the distant transmission and interpretation of radiographic images, and the needs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration drove the expansion of telemedical technology.
