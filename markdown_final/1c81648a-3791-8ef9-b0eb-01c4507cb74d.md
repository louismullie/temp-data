## Question

asthma gold criteria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the "asthma gold criteria". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "gold" refers to in this context and whether the user means diagnostic criteria versus severity classification. Then, I should verify the current consensus on diagnostic criteria and whether there is a single gold standard. Next, I will review severity definitions and how they are used retrospectively. After that, I should check the evidence base and guideline hierarchies to ensure I'm aligning with the strongest sources. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we're not conflating different concepts. "Gold" in asthma care typically refers to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), which publishes the globally used strategy documents, not a single diagnostic "gold standard" test; conversely, in COPD care, "GOLD" is the acronym for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, which is a different entity entirely, so I should not mix these up.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic piece before proceeding. There is no single gold-standard test for asthma; diagnosis relies on a stepwise approach integrating characteristic symptoms with objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, ideally confirmed by spirometry demonstrating bronchodilator responsiveness or by serial peak flow showing variability, and in children under 5, objective testing is often not feasible, so diagnosis is based on symptom patterns and treatment response with careful exclusion of alternatives [^111K9Vft] [^113ze1Ms] [^114qc2CP].

> Hold on, I should verify the severity framework, because this is where confusion often arises. GINA defines asthma severity retrospectively after at least 2–3 months of controller therapy, based on the treatment intensity required to achieve control; severe asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS–LABA or that requires such therapy to prevent loss of control, whereas "mild asthma" is a retrospective label for disease controlled on low-intensity treatment, and GINA advises avoiding the term "mild asthma" in treatment decisions because patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe exacerbations if not on ICS-containing therapy [^11172PKk] [^114DDMqv] [^115maK4T].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy to ensure I'm anchoring to the strongest sources. GINA 2024/2025 and the 2020 NAEPP update are high-credibility, evidence-based strategy documents; ERS 2022 provides contemporary diagnostic guidance; systematic reviews and comparative studies inform test performance and thresholds, while acknowledging that many diagnostic recommendations carry conditional strength due to heterogeneity and limited head-to-head trials [^111K9Vft] [^117DP1Z1] [^113M44Rj] [^114qc2CP].

> Let me consider the diagnostic thresholds and tests, and I should double-check the bronchodilator criteria. In adults, an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL from baseline after bronchodilator supports variable airflow obstruction; if spirometry is unavailable, a peak flow variability of about 20% can substitute, though spirometry is preferred; FeNO can support eosinophilic inflammation but should not be used in isolation to diagnose or monitor control; and in children under 5, diagnosis is clinical with therapeutic trials and careful exclusion of mimics, given limited objective testing feasibility [^112HHJDS] [^112FhH3v] [^113ze1Ms].

> But wait, what if the presentation suggests asthma–COPD overlap; I should confirm the safety-critical treatment principle. When features of both asthma and COPD are present, treat as asthma first by ensuring ICS-containing therapy and avoiding LABA or LAMA monotherapy, because LABA without ICS increases risk of severe exacerbations and death in asthma; COPD-directed bronchodilation can be layered per GOLD once ICS safety is secured [^113Qv6Zb] [^113F3mp7] [^111MY3VB].

> I should confirm the practical clinical flow. Start with symptoms suggestive of asthma, obtain objective testing when feasible (spirometry with bronchodilator or serial peak flow), confirm variable airflow limitation, exclude alternative diagnoses, initiate ICS-containing therapy if asthma is likely, reassess in 1–3 months, and classify severity retrospectively based on the treatment step required to achieve control; if symptoms persist despite optimized Step 4 therapy, refer for severe asthma evaluation and phenotype assessment [^115spWrp] [^112CS7sT].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: there are no "gold criteria" in the sense of a single definitive diagnostic test; instead, contemporary "gold-standard" practice is a GINA-aligned, stepwise diagnostic approach that integrates symptoms with objective evidence of variable airflow limitation, followed by a retrospective severity classification based on treatment required to achieve control, with explicit caution that so-called "mild asthma" still warrants ICS-containing therapy to mitigate exacerbation risk [^111K9Vft] [^11172PKk] [^114DDMqv].

There is **no single gold standard** for asthma diagnosis; diagnosis relies on a combination of characteristic symptoms and objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation [^111K9Vft], typically confirmed by spirometry with bronchodilator responsiveness or by documenting variability in peak flow or FeNO [^112HHJDS] [^112FhH3v]. Because no test is definitive, diagnosis should be confirmed before starting inhaled corticosteroids, and alternative causes excluded when results are inconclusive [^114qc2CP] [^114NUYEd]. Severity is assessed retrospectively by the treatment intensity required to achieve control, not by symptoms alone [^11172PKk] [^114DDMqv].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and objective tests

Asthma diagnosis requires **objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation** [^111K9Vft], supported by one or more of the following:

| **Test** | **Diagnostic threshold** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Spirometry with bronchodilator | Increase in FEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline | Preferred initial test; may be normal between symptoms [^112HHJDS] [^116JFn5d] |
| Peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability | Diurnal variation > 20% | Useful when spirometry is unavailable; less reliable but better than no objective test [^115spWrp] |
| Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) | ≥ 20 ppb (adults) | Supports eosinophilic inflammation; not diagnostic alone [^113M44Rj] |
| Bronchial challenge (methacholine or mannitol) | PC20 < 8 mg/mL (methacholine) | Useful when baseline tests are inconclusive; high sensitivity, lower specificity [^notfound] |

---

These tests should be interpreted in the **clinical context**, including symptom pattern, risk factors, and response to therapy [^111K9Vft]. If initial tests are inconclusive, repeat testing after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic is recommended [^116i3ybZ].

---

## Classification of asthma severity

Asthma severity is classified retrospectively based on the **treatment intensity required to achieve control** [^11172PKk]:

- **Mild asthma**: Well controlled with low-intensity treatment (e.g. as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol or low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA) [^115QeGzm].
- **Moderate asthma**: Requires Step 3 or 4 treatment (e.g. low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA) to maintain control [^1175jKPw].
- **Severe asthma**: Uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA, or requiring high-dose ICS-LABA or biologics to prevent loss of control [^111sFA1U].

This approach emphasizes that severity reflects treatment responsiveness rather than symptom frequency alone [^1112ugx6].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **No single gold standard**: The absence of a definitive test leads to misdiagnosis and variability in practice [^114NUYEd] [^114qc2CP].
- **Overlap with COPD**: Differentiating asthma from COPD or asthma-COPD overlap can be challenging, especially in smokers and older adults [^113Qv6Zb] [^1167xjFL].
- **Pediatric diagnosis**: Objective testing is often limited in children under 5, relying on symptom patterns and treatment response [^113ze1Ms].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Confirm diagnosis before ICS**: Objective testing should precede initiating inhaled corticosteroids to avoid overtreatment and misdiagnosis [^114qc2CP].
- **Regular reassessment**: Diagnosis should be reviewed periodically, especially if symptoms persist despite therapy or if new features arise [^113ze1Ms].
- **Specialist referral**: Indicated for diagnostic uncertainty, severe or uncontrolled asthma, or suspected alternative diagnoses [^116eJ6HV].

---

In sum, asthma diagnosis and severity assessment require a **stepwise, evidence-based approach** integrating symptoms with objective tests, and severity is defined by treatment responsiveness rather than symptoms alone [^111K9Vft] [^11172PKk].

### Improving primary care management of asthma: do we know what really works? [^113ZhC95]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate practice organisation and systems focussing on the identification, diagnosis and treatment are pivotal for quality asthma care. There was compelling evidence to indicate that integrated, multi-faceted practice-based approaches for the management of patients improves outcomes and reduces the need for referral to secondary care. Coordinated practice systems that combine several interventions such as decision support tools, flagging of electronic records, use of care pathways, staff training and structured approaches to patient education, if consistently implemented, afford the greatest benefits. Implementation of practice schemes is likely to be enhanced where there is dedicated clinical and administrative leadership.

Intuitively an accurate diagnosis should lead to better patient outcomes, although we found conflicting evidence that access to proper diagnosis has an impact on patient outcomes. Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis remains the fulcrum on which optimal asthma management depends. Indeed programmes in which an expanded medical team improved the quality of asthma care within the primary care setting (such as a diagnostic and management support organisation) show clear benefit on patient outcome.

Spirometry combined with an assessment of reversibility has been set as gold standard for asthma diagnosis. However, standards on quality of spirometry such as those set by the ERS and ATS are often not achieved – and impose an unnecessarily high and potentially unachievable threshold in primary care. Nevertheless, some studies have demonstrated that primary care office spirometry can meet the acceptability criteria –. Although such standards are laudable particularly in a specialist setting, their practicability in primary care, where patients commonly have mild–moderate, intermittent disease, is debatable. The latest ATS-ERS spirometry guidelines (published in October 2019) may address some of these issues. However, the use of spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma remains beyond reach in primary care around the world.

In many countries primary care physicians have limited or no access to tests of lung function or airway inflammation. The creation of diagnostic hubs in the community may open access to these tests. A structured approach to diagnosis including applicability and feasibility for primary care is currently under development by an ERS taskforce; its outcome not available at the time of writing.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1122GNtY]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma remission — definitions and clinical context: Remission of asthma has been investigated extensively, and definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission (e.g., no asthma symptoms or exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung function, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment, for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma, and the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the patient. When discussing the best possible outcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment. Research in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off treatment or on treatment, provides opportunities for understanding mechanisms and developing new approaches to prevention and management, which will be facilitated by using standardized criteria and tools.

Asthma guideline consensus and recommendation strength definitions — strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel after it has reviewed all of the evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action, whereas conditional recommendations are those for which the Expert Panel believes that many informed people are likely to make different decisions about whether to take the recommended course of action, and a conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their health care providers. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation, and if less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation the topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116VUbfz]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — mild asthma retrospective definition and risk: The page notes variability in criteria, including whether "FEV1 should be ≥ 80% predicted" and whether any exacerbation precludes a 'mild' label "for the next 12 months". By this definition, classification as 'mild' applies only after several months of ICS-containing treatment and only if well controlled on low-dose ICS or as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, and studies indicated baseline features (daily reliever use, lower lung function, history of exacerbations, blood eosinophils or FeNO) did not identify patients who should instead receive daily ICS; decisions about ongoing treatment should rely on evidence for as-needed ICS-formoterol or daily ICS plus individualized assessment. The term 'mild asthma' may encourage complacency despite the fact that "up to 30% of asthma exacerbations and deaths occur in people with infrequent symptoms, for example, less than weekly or only on strenuous exercise".

### An update on asthma diagnosis [^114NUYEd]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Asthma imposes a significant health and socioeconomic burden with an average prevalence impacting 5–10% of the global population. The aim of this narrative review is to update the current literature on topics related to asthma diagnosis.

Data Sources

Original research articles were identified from PubMed using the search terms "asthma diagnosis" and "asthma misdiagnosis".

Study Selections

Recently published articles (n = 51) detailing the diagnosis, misdiagnosis of asthma, and the updated recommendations of the European and international asthma guidelines.

Results

Emerging evidence revealed that asthma might represent a rather heterogenous clinical entity with varying underlying molecular mechanisms. Attempts have been made to unravel these traits to better provide accurate diagnosis and a more efficient patient-based management approach. The lack of a gold standard test for asthma diagnosis has contributed to its over- and underdiagnosis. This is problematic, given that overdiagnosis might lead to delay of both diagnosis and prompt treatment of other diseases, while underdiagnosis might substantially impact quality of life due to progression of asthma by increased rate of exacerbations and airway remodeling. In addition to poor asthma control and potential patient harm, asthma misdiagnosis is also associated with excessive costs. As a result, current international guidelines emphasize the need for a standardized approach to diagnosis, including objective measurements prior to treatment.

Conclusion

Future research is warranted to define the optimal diagnostic and treatable traits approach especially for patients with severe asthma, as they may benefit from the advent of newly targeted asthma management.

### Asthma diagnosis: a comparison of established diagnostic guidelines in adults with respiratory symptoms [^114qc2CP]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects around 300 million people worldwide, and in the UK 12% of the population have been diagnosed with the disease. Asthma is characterised by symptoms of wheeze, chest tightness, breathlessness and cough, typically associated with variable airflow obstruction and inflammation. There are however no gold standard diagnostic criteria for asthma, likely reflecting the heterogenous nature of the condition which encompasses different phenotypes (reflecting different underlying pathophysiology), particularly in adults. Given this phenotypic heterogeneity, it is inevitable that there are multiple pathways to an asthma diagnosis, incorporating different features measured with different tests.

Asthma misdiagnosis is common, reported by Aaron et al.in up to one third of subjects investigated within five years of initial diagnosis, more than half of whom had not undergone any objective testing at the time of diagnosis. Asthma symptoms are non-specific, so it is important to complete confirmatory diagnostic tests to minimise costs and risks associated with unnecessary treatment, and to offer the opportunity to make the correct diagnosis. These should be done prior to starting inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), as treatment can change results.

The most frequently used diagnostic pathways for asthma are produced by the European Respiratory Society (ERS; Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Asthma in Adults 2022), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE; Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management 2017)and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA; Global strategy for asthma management and prevention 2023). There were methodological differences in the development of the guidelines. However, these pathways show considerable variability in the utility of different tests, their thresholds, and the order in which they are conducted. None of these pathways has been tested prospectively in symptomatic adults not taking ICS.

The aim of this study was therefore to test the performance characteristics of the ERS, NICE, and GINA asthma diagnostic algorithms, in adults with symptoms in keeping with asthma but not on ICS, in the setting of our Rapid Access Diagnostics in Asthma research clinic (RADicA).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111M2Lvq]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Remission of asthma — Remission of asthma can be identified in children and in adults, either clinical remission or complete remission, and either off-treatment or on-treatment, and definitions and criteria vary; the concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management promoted by GINA to achieve the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for each patient. Research among patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off-treatment or on-treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding underlying mechanisms of asthma and to develop new approaches to asthma prevention and management, facilitated by standardized criteria and assessment tools. Take care if using the term 'remission' with patients or parents/caregivers, explain what you mean, and that if asthma symptoms have gone quiet for a while, they may recur.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113q9nZJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

Asthma remission on treatment — GINA notes extensive recent discussion in the context of biologic therapy for severe asthma, reports that several proposed definitions and criteria for operationalization have been published, and introduces a new section outlining a framework for clinical practice and research about clinical and complete (pathophysiological) remission in children and adults, both off-treatment and on-treatment; these perspectives should inform discussions with patients and parents/caregivers, and the concept aligns with the long-term goal of asthma treatment while individual patient goals should be achievable.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1128E6hX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma outcomes and GRADE/EtD methodology — The Expert Panel used the GRADE framework to review evidence, create evidence profiles, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements, and across all topic areas the outcomes deemed critical were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life, with additional outcomes assessed when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. The panel established thresholds for minimally important difference (MID) for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures and, where no MID existed (such as exacerbations), reached consensus on clinically important differences based in part on RCT effect sizes and their judgments; core exacerbation measures included treatment with systemic corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Topic teams developed EtD tables for each key question using evidence from the systematic review reports, and new articles found in updated literature reviews were noted in EtD new-evidence sections but not incorporated into pooled estimates.

Diagnosis and Initial Treatment of Patients with Features of Both Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity. It includes several clinical phenotypes that are likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD, with treatment with long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without ICS) recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma because of the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, all patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence and advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

Rationale

The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, more rapid decline in lung function, greater need for healthcare use, and higher mortality than patients with asthma or COPD alone. The recommendation for ICS is because several studies have shown that patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA compared with ICS–LABA.

### Asthma control or severity: that is the question [^1112ugx6]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

In the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful.

### Airflow reversibility in patients with asthma… [^1167xjFL]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: The article by Zeller and colleagues discusses how to distinguish asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 1 This distinction is important because the treatments for the two diseases differ. The authors state, "Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible with administration of bronchodilators. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction… on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators". However, studies have shown reversibility in a significant proportion of patients with COPD. In the UPLIFT trial of patients with COPD, 54% of patients had bronchodilator reversibility based on the American Thoracic Society criteria of FEV. 1 improvement of 12% or greater and 200 mL or greater, and 73% of patients had reversibility when using the sole criteria of 12% or greater improvement in FEV 1.

2 A comprehensive review of COPD reversibility in multiple studies concluded that "… many patients with COPD do indeed exhibit bronchodilator reversibility and that reversibility testing is not a reliable measure to differentiate between asthma and COPD. " 3. The European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society definition of reversibility was recently revised to greater than 10% of the predicted value in FEV 1 or forced vital capacity. 4 Using this updated definition would lead to a greater proportion of people with COPD being classified as having bronchodilator reversibility compared with the previous American Thoracic Society criteria of 12% or greater. The 2023 GOLD report states, "… assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction… to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended… and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma, or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. " 5.

As briefly discussed in our article, robust literature has developed around the clinical reality of coexisting asthma and COPD. 1–4 The natural history of asthma is to progress to fixed obstruction over time. 5 Some have labeled the coexistence of the two disease entities "asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, " and for a time, it appeared that this might become a separate diagnosis. However, it is now standard clinical practice to diagnose both asthma and COPD if the patient meets spirometry criteria for both conditions.

Refer for specialized investigations — indications for referral: Referral for expert advice and further diagnostic evaluation is advised for patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite treatment, for diagnostic uncertainty (especially if an alternative diagnosis needs to be investigated), for patients with suspected asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggesting an additional pulmonary diagnosis, when chronic airways disease is suspected but syndromic features of either asthma or COPD are few, and for patients with comorbidities that may interfere with assessment and management. When atypical or additional symptoms or signs suggest an additional pulmonary diagnosis, this should prompt early referral, without waiting for a trial of treatment for asthma or COPD. Referral may also be appropriate for issues arising during ongoing management of asthma, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, as outlined in the GINA and GOLD strategy reports.

Differential diagnoses and diagnostic uncertainty

Misdiagnosis of asthma remains a major problem with rates of both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis being high. Overdiagnosis is problematic as it exposes children to unnecessary side effects of medications and runs the risk of trivialising asthma.

There are several conditions that may be associated with chronic cough, wheeze and/or shortness of breath in children and therefore present similarly to asthma (table 1). Due to the difficulties with diagnosis, especially in young children where objective testing is not possible, the diagnosis of asthma should be reviewed at each clinical presentation and interaction.

Diagnosing asthma in children

There is no single 'gold-standard' test that can be used to accurately diagnose asthma. In practice, a diagnosis should be made based on characteristic symptom patterns, evidence of variability in airflow limitation in the presence of airway inflammation, likelihood of alternative diagnoses and response to treatment. Getting the diagnosis correct is key for optimal management of paediatric asthma.

Lung function tests can be used to aid the diagnosis of asthma in children over the age of 5 years. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and spirometry are commonly used to assess airflow obstruction and reversibility. PEF can be used to detect diurnal variation, which is a typical feature of asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) specifically recommends the use of either PEF or spirometry in the diagnosis of asthma in children over 5 years. Once a child is old enough to reliably perform lung function testing, it is recommended that this be undertaken if the diagnosis of asthma has not been previously confirmed. In children under 5, lung function testing is rarely practical outside a research setting. This makes diagnosis in this age group additionally challenging. Guidelines vary between countries and regions with regard to diagnostic criteria. An overview of the similarities and differences between these guidelines is displayed in table 2. Lung function testing is frequently used to monitor progress of children with asthma as part of their care. Objective testing should be repeated if there is poor response to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.

### Recommendations following a modified UK-Delphi consensus study on best practice for referral and management of severe asthma [^117TDLGM]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Severe asthma affects an estimated 3%–5% of people with asthma, and is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence to maximal inhaled therapy, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Data from the UK Severe Asthma Registry highlights that these patients have poor asthma control, impaired lung function, high exacerbation rates and frequent exposure to oral corticosteroids (OCS). Severe asthma is associated with very high healthcare costs due to medication use, unscheduled healthcare utilisation and management of OCS-related adverse events. These costs have been shown to be four times higher for uncontrolled severe asthma patients than the general asthma population.

While the majority of patients with asthma have inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-responsive, mild-to-moderate disease, which can be routinely managed in the primary care setting, patients with severe disease require systematic assessment including accurate phenotyping within a specialist multidisciplinary secondary or tertiary care setting in which advanced therapies such as biological treatments can be initiated if appropriate.

Despite the introduction of specialist asthma services in many parts of the UK and the increased availability of advanced therapeutic options to manage severe asthma, multiple challenges still remain.

The 2014 National Report into Asthma Deathsidentified a number of areas of practice where improved care could reduce asthma mortality. Among the most frequently cited factors were the failure to:

Recognise the risk status of the patient.
Provide the right level of asthma expertise.
Perform adequate asthma reviews.
Refer to an asthma specialist when indicated.

Despite this, according to the Office of National Statistics, there were 1392 deaths from asthma exacerbations in England and Wales in 2018, an increase of 6% since 2017 and a rise of 26% over the previous 5 years.

According to an Asthma UK survey of patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), patient referrals to a specialist service for diagnosis and management of severe asthma can be delayed by many years. Inconsistent thresholds used to trigger referrals by primary and secondary care as well as a lack of clarity on referral criteria are cited as key reasons for this. The report highlights capacity and resource challenges (ie, current healthcare provision may be insufficient to support patient numbers) faced by specialist services to manage patients in the most effective way.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111fxV8c]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA levels of evidence — levels A–D are used to assign management recommendations and are defined by their sources and strength. Level A draws on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and observational evidence, with endpoints from well-designed RCTs or observational studies that provide a consistent pattern of findings, and Category A requires substantial numbers of studies and participants. Level B is based on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews but with a limited body of data, including intervention studies with limited numbers of patients or post hoc/subgroup analyses, and applies when few randomized trials exist, are small, involve different populations, or results are somewhat inconsistent. Level C is from non-randomized trials or observational studies. Level D reflects panel consensus judgment when clinical literature is insufficient for other categories and is based on clinical experience or knowledge.

### Redefining the overlap of asthma and COPD [^111hz4Pf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been suggested for people with chronic airflow obstruction that has features characteristic of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 1 People with clinical features of asthma and COPD tend to have worse outcomes than those with either asthma or COPD alone, yet their clinical management has remained unclear. UK guidelines currently do not specifically address this issue, 2,3 but the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) have published a consensus-based report on the diagnosis and treatment of people with asthma, COPD and ACO. 1 Although 'asthma-COPD overlap syndrome' (ACOS) was briefly used, some thought that it gave the unhelpful impression that it referred to a single disease entity. Here, we consider some of the challenges in managing this heterogeneous group of patients.

Overview of current guidelines

The systematic establishment of a thorough evidence base is currently considered the most rigorous and accurate means to develop clinical practice guidelines. Developing evidence-based consensus guidelines is an enormous undertaking in a field such as asthma, involving a major literature search, consideration of thousands of papers, and time commitment by numerous individuals in the respiratory medical community. Several hierarchies of evidence and grading recommendations have been used by different working groups; those used by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are presented in Table 1. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group has recently proposed a system for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was first launched in 1993 as a program to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health in the United States. GINA has published evidence-based asthma guidelines since 2002; annual updates are available on the GINA website. These guidelines emphasize the fact that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways and that, while asthma exacerbations are episodic, airway inflammation is chronically present. Exposure to allergens is listed as a common risk factor. The fact that medication must be taken every day by most patients to control symptoms, to improve lung function, and to prevent attacks is noted. Criteria defining the control of asthma are presented in the guidelines (Table 2). Moreover, the guidelines provide criteria for determining asthma severity; and recommendations for pharmacological management of asthma are outlined according to a stepwise approach based on asthma severity.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^116vPsSJ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

No prior studies have assessed the quality and reporting of diagnostic testing guidelines for childhood asthma. One study evaluated diagnostic guidelines in an adult primary care setting. Of interest, the authors found that recommendations based on high-quality evidence had greater rates of clinician adherence to CPGs. Two reviews specifically compared childhood asthma recommendations across international guidelines, focusing on management. For diagnostic questions, Level 1 evidence comprises prospective studies where diagnostic tests are compared with a gold standard test in all patients in the study group. Conducting such research in asthma is challenging due to the absence of a gold-standard test; it is even more difficult to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a sequential testing strategy.

Our study sought to determine: (i) the methodological quality and reporting of paediatric asthma guidelines for primary care and (ii) the strength of evidence supporting diagnostic test recommendations for childhood asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113Qv6Zb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

Limitations and research gaps — The Expert Panel noted that a better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates, that the process would benefit from a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine, and that research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes and the cutoffs for tests, and updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes; the definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated. Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized, and standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies. The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, and applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs; such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations. Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma, and the GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes; however, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. All measures and outcomes relevant to making recommendations need to be included in the systematic reviews, and although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data; moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^113yA9Y8]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. Moderate: Asthma is well controlled with step 3 treatment. Severe: Step 4 or 5 treatment is required to control symptoms, or symptoms are uncontrolled despite this treatment. GINA recommends that a SABA not be prescribed as sole therapy because short-acting medications increase the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Adding an ICS daily or as needed reduces this risk. GINA also recommends using the lowest dose of ICS tolerated, including reducing the corticosteroid dose after symptoms are controlled. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations.

An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended. STEP 2 Preferred step 2 controller options in adults and adolescents include a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed or low-dose ICS/formoterol as needed. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but can be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an ICS or who have concomitant allergic rhinitis. The preferred step 2 controller for children six to 11 years of age is a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed. Less effective options include a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist or using a low-dose ICS as needed with a SABA.

STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MY3VB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112HHJDS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma — bronchodilator responsiveness thresholds for diagnosis — states that in adults with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL from baseline, or if spirometry is not available a change in peak expiratory flow (PEF) of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with asthma. A Technical Standards Committee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator responsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≥ 12% and > 200 mL to an increase from baseline of > 10% of the patient's predicted value; this recommendation was based on data for survival, and the Technical Standards Committee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice.

### The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: towards a revised taxonomy of chronic airways diseases? [^116i3pDP]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Most research of treatments for airways diseases has been restricted to patients who meet standard definitions of either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, yet to distinguish COPD from asthma in adult patients who have clinical features of both can be challenging. Treatment guidelines provide scant advice on how such patients should be managed. With increasing recognition that asthma and COPD are heterogeneous diseases, attention has been directed to the needs of a group of patients with what is now termed asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), particularly in view of the high morbidity in this population. This Review considers the epidemiology, mechanisms of disease, current attempts to define and diagnose ACOS, existing and potential treatment options, and new approaches to the phenotyping and taxonomy of airway diseases.

### Severity assessment in asthma: an evolving concept [^1131wNhT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the clinical management of asthma base specific treatment recommendations on the assessment of disease severity. Thus, the accuracy of such assessments is essential for proper clinical management. The consistency of asthma severity assessment in patients with difficult-to-treat disease is unknown.

Objective

The objectives of this analysis were to compare the asthma severity assessment according to 3 methodologies in patients from The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens study.

Methods

Asthma severity on the basis of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program and the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines was compared with physician assessment and benchmarked against asthma-related health care use. Guideline-based asthma severity symptom components were derived from patient-reported questionnaires. Lung function levels were determined by prebronchodilator FEV(1) measurements; asthma-related medication and recent health care use were reported by patients.

Results

There was a clear lack of agreement among the asthma severity assessment modalities. Asthma severity was associated with asthma-related health care use, and patients considered to have severe asthma according to both sets of guidelines and physicians' assessment had the highest health care and medication use.

Conclusion

Classification of asthma severity on the basis of current asthma symptoms and lung function may be useful but not completely reflective of a patient's true asthma condition. Clinical assessment of asthma severity should consider a patient's medication use and consumption of health care resources for asthma exacerbations. Additional studies that apply criteria for asthma severity longitudinally are needed to support recommendations for optimal assessment of asthma severity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115QeGzm]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for asthma, more specifically with respect to severity definitions, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to define mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled with low-intensity treatment (as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol) or low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist.

### Asthma control: how it can be best assessed? [^111k34kP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A control-based asthma assessment is recommended by guidelines, but questions remain about how to assess the level of asthma control, and how current control status relates to future risks and biomarkers of disease pathogenesis. This review summarizes recent published data relating to asthma control and describes the challenges created by currently available instruments.

Recent Findings

The current literature continues to show the widespread use of various assessment instruments for asthma control, in particular those with composite scores. However, poor correlations exist between the different assessment tools, and these instruments lack diagnostic accuracy to differentiate uncontrolled asthma. Whereas the concept of asthma control has been extended to add an assessment of future risks to the clinical control, clinical asthma control as measured by current available assessment tools does not necessary relate to the intrinsic disease activity which is typically characterized by inflammation in asthma.

Summary

The application of asthma control assessment represents an improvement in asthma management. The measurement of underlying disease activity potentially by biomarkers to assess disease control will lead to an improved assessment of the overall control of asthma, and further studies addressing this are needed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11782icB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity terminology — variability across settings — explains that in the community and in primary care, 'severe' or 'mild' labels are commonly based on symptom or exacerbation frequency irrespective of treatment, whereas epidemiological studies and clinical trials often classify severity by prescribed treatment GINA or BTS Step regardless of asthma control. Most clinical trials of biologic therapy enroll patients uncontrolled despite taking medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA without routinely addressing contributory factors before enrolment. Some guidelines retain an older symptom-based classification distinguishing 'intermittent' and 'mild persistent' asthma with an untested assumption that patients with symptoms ≤ 2 days/week were not at risk and should be treated with SABA alone; however, patients with so-called 'intermittent' asthma can have severe or fatal exacerbations and their risk is substantially reduced by ICS-containing treatment compared with SABA alone. For low-resource countries, the World Health Organization definition of severe asthma includes 'untreated severe asthma', corresponding to uncontrolled asthma in patients not taking any ICS-containing treatment.

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115maK4T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations and research gaps

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process it used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:
A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that need updating and to decrease the time between updates.
The process would benefit from a discussion and development of a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.
Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and the implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also identified several overarching research gaps listed below. Research gaps that are specific to individual topics are listed at the end of each topic section.

Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop report should require the studies they fund to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Because new information on asthma outcomes is now available, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it needs to be revised.
The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide MIDs for all asthma outcomes (eg, exacerbations and asthma symptoms) and the cutoffs for tests (eg, F). Clinical relevance should be established using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.
Updates are needed to the definitions of asthma severity that incorporate asthma phenotypes and endotypes. The definitions of low-, medium-, and high-dose ICSs also need to be updated.
Biologically appropriate subpopulations with asthma should be established and standardized. Although the populations of interest for the focused updates were defined for the systematic reviews, the characterizations of study participants did not reflect current understanding of relevant phenotypes and endotypes (eg, based on asthma severity, allergen-specific sensitization, or airway inflammatory type).
Standard reporting of results stratified by race and ethnicity as well as by age groups (0–4 years, 5–11 years, and 12 years and older) is needed to combine results across studies.
The vast majority of studies used to inform the guidelines were designed as efficacy studies, which evaluate treatment effects in relatively homogeneous populations and conditions in which fidelity to study protocols is actively promoted. Applicability to real-world clinical and community contexts requires studies with comparative effectiveness designs. Such research would benefit from the use of validated outcome measures and definitions of biologically appropriate subpopulations.
Studies need to use measures and outcomes that are important to individuals with asthma. The GRADE methodology gives highest priority to patient-centered outcomes. However, the studies that the Expert Panel used to develop the recommendations often did not measure outcomes that are most relevant or important to individuals with asthma. Research is needed to understand how preferred outcomes vary by race or ethnicity, asthma severity, age (eg, children or older adults), and socioeconomic status.
All measures and outcomes relevant to making judgments need to be included in the systematic reviews. For example, although cost-effectiveness data are available for some asthma interventions, the systematic review reports used for the updates did not include these data. Moreover, data regarding the safety of all interventions should be explicitly reported in publications on clinical trials.

In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

### Overview of changes to asthma guidelines: diagnosis and screening [^112EVSqA]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as "well controlled", "not well controlled", and "very poorly controlled". Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — interim advice on severity descriptors for clinical practice and education: The document states that GINA "continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled". It adds, "We suggest that in clinical practice, the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided if possible", and advises explaining that patients with infrequent or mild symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone and that "this risk is reduced by half to two-thirds with low-dose ICS or with as-needed low-dose ICS formoterol". It further directs, "Ensure that you prescribe ICS-containing therapy to reduce the patient's risk of severe exacerbations", clarifies that "'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive", and notes that guidance about low-intensity treatment suitability is in "Step 1 and 2". For education, it states that "'apparently mild asthma' may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K9Vft]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis — In patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis involves a stepwise approach beginning with whether the patient is likely to have chronic airways disease, then syndromic categorization as having typical asthma, typical COPD, features of both, and/or with other conditions such as bronchiectasis; lung function testing is essential to confirm persistent airflow limitation, and variable airflow obstruction can be detected with serial peak flow measurements and/or measurements before and after bronchodilator.

### Achieving guideline-based asthma control: does the patient benefit? [^117StnD3]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma management guidelines define asthma control, but the outcome criteria used do not include the patient's own assessment of their health. The objective of the present study was to determine the association between the achievement of asthma control, as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, and patient-assessed asthma-related quality of life (QOL), particularly whether maximal or near-maximal QOL scores were attainable. Clinical data from three studies that compared salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination therapy (SFC) with other treatments in patients with persistent asthma were retrospectively analysed. Achievement of asthma control was determined over an 8-week period in each study according to six parameters derived from the GINA guideline treatment goals. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores (a 7-point scale, where 1 = severe impairment and 7 = no impairment) were analysed by treatment group for well-controlled and not well-controlled patients. The analysis showed that, across a range of severities, well-controlled asthma patients had consistently higher AQLQ scores at endpoint and larger AQLQ improvements from baseline, than patients who were not well controlled. For many well-controlled patients, endpoint scores approached 7, indicating little or no impact of asthma on their QOL. However, AQLQ scores of not well-controlled patients also improved substantially in some treatment groups, particularly the SFC group. These results suggest a relationship between the achievement of guideline-based asthma control and improvements in quality of life to levels where there is little or no impact of asthma on quality of life. Guideline-based asthma control is therefore beneficial to the patient and should be tested in prospective studies.

The Global initiative against asthma (GINA) 2020 strategy has been released with some changes and updates. GINA recommends the continuation of medications, avoidance of nebulization and spirometry, and ensuring a written asthma action plan in COVID-19 times. GINA 2020 specifies which step of management is to be followed according to the patient's symptoms in an easy flowchart. Clinicians need to be aware of the changes and the evidence behind them.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113VQCMK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

FOREWORD

It has been 13 years since the last revision of the asthma recommendations, and substantial progress has been made since that time in understanding the origins of asthma as well as its pathophysiology and treatment. As members of the pulmonary and allergy provider community and the primary care community that provide more than half of all asthma care in the United States, we now recognize that asthma is not one disease, but it is a syndrome composed of multiple phenotypes. Asthma is much more complex than indicated in the Expert Panel Report: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-1), released in 1991, which characterized asthma as an inflammatory disease that is responsive to corticosteroids.

This document updates selected topics that were identified as high priority by an NHLBI Advisory Council Asthma Expert Working Group based on input from previous guideline developers, NAEPP participant organizations, and the public. The list of these priority topics was published in 2015.

Box 7–2 — likely to be COPD (adults): when features such as "Dyspnea persistent (most days)", "Onset after age 40 years", and "No past or current diagnosis of asthma" are present, with lung function showing "Persistent expiratory airflow limitation" "With or without bronchodilator reversibility", TREAT AS COPD. Initial management is "TREAT AS COPD (see GOLD report)" with "Initially maintenance LABA-LAMA", and "Add ICS as per GOLD for patients with hospitalizations, ≥ 2 exacerbations/year requiring OCS, or blood eosinophils ≥ 300/μl"; also "Avoid high dose ICS, avoid maintenance OCS", and "Reliever containing ICS is not recommended".

### Asthma-COPD overlap and chronic airflow obstruction: definitions, management, and unanswered questions [^114YbnTi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a common clinical presentation of chronic airways disease in which patients show some features usually associated with asthma, and some usually associated with COPD. There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a "treatable traits" approach to ACO management. Throughout the review, we highlight some of the pressing, unanswered questions surrounding ACO that are relevant to the clinical community. Ultimately, addressing these questions is necessary if we are to improve clinical outcomes for this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11172PKk]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessing asthma severity — The current concept is that asthma severity should be assessed retrospectively from how difficult the patient's asthma is to treat, reflected by the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations after at least several months of treatment; by this definition, severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, and must be distinguished from difficult-to-treat asthma due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, adherence problems, or comorbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity.

### Classifying asthma [^116H9eNB]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The most widely known method of asthma classification is the severity classification recommended in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 1997 guidelines, which also formed the basis of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. This method was developed to direct a hierarchy of asthma therapy based on the patient's severity of disease. However, this severity classification has not been validated and has a number of limitations; in particular, it is challenging for physicians to apply reliably. Moreover, it does not allow asthma control to be assessed after the initiation of treatment, even though symptom control is a key objective of the treatment guidelines. A number of tools have been evaluated to provide longitudinal information on asthma control, and some of these have been validated. Clinically relevant measures of inflammation, such as eosinophilic airway inflammation, may also be helpful in classifying asthma and in guiding the use of antiinflammatory therapy. This may be a particularly useful approach in patients who are asymptomatic but have poor lung function, by permitting physicians to determine whether inflammatory processes are active, thus requiring ICS therapy. In the clinical setting, easy-to-use tools are needed to enable longitudinal assessments of symptom control and (ideally) disease progression.

Chronic airflow limitation — general management advice and referral: Provide advice about treatment of modifiable risk factors including smoking cessation, treatment of comorbidities, non-pharmacological strategies including physical activity and, for COPD or asthma-COPD overlap, pulmonary rehabilitation and vaccinations, appropriate self-management strategies, and regular follow-up; in a majority of patients, the initial management of asthma and COPD can be satisfactorily carried out at primary care level; however, both the GINA and GOLD strategy reports recommend referral for further diagnostic procedures at relevant points in patient management, which may be particularly important for patients with features of both asthma and COPD given associations with worse outcomes and greater healthcare utilization.

Exacerbation history (per year) is stratified as ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations or ≥ 1 leading to hospitalization versus 0 or 1 moderate exacerbations (not leading to hospitalization). Symptoms are categorized using mMRC 0–1 CAT < 10 versus mMRC ≥ 2 CAT ≥ 10.

### Can asthma control be improved by understanding the patient's perspective? [^116o8XLk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Severity vs. control

Management guidelines for asthma, as with many other diseases, include treatment algorithms based on severity of disease, as defined by the clinical features before treatment or by the treatment given. Severity usually refers to the degree of underlying pathology. Deciding the severity of asthma is not always easy. When respiratory specialists were shown a number of case studies and asked to assign the severity of the asthma for each case, there was considerable disagreement. The inherent variability of asthma also presents problems for classification of severity. Severe asthma, defined as persisting symptoms despite high levels of treatment, is likely to have a number of underlying reasons, including psychological and adherence factors.

Although the factors indicating control may be the same as those indicating severity (e.g. persistent symptoms, impaired lung function, high bronchodilator use, oral steroid use, unscheduled consultations, hospitalisations, life-threatening attacks), there is a difference in the two concepts. Patients with severe asthma can be well-controlled, while those with mild underlying disease can show signs of poorly controlled disease. Changing the management plan to one based on control and the goals of patients may show improved outcomes compared to a plan based on severity.

Hospital-based studies have suggested that outcomes may be better with treatment algorithms based on parameters that are more closely linked to control than usual symptom-based management protocols. There is a reduction in exacerbation rate, although a higher inhaled corticosteroid load received, in patients given treatments that optimise reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity, rather than treatment on the basis of symptoms. Likewise, a treatment strategy based on normalisation of sputum eosinophil levels resulted in reduced exacerbations compared to standard management protocols, without increasing steroid exposure. A randomised controlled trial conducted in New Zealand used a management strategy incorporating exhaled nitric oxide (NO) readings and achieved control that was at least as good as that obtained with a guideline-based approach but using a lower inhaled steroid dosage. The GOAL study used a strategy based on the combined aims of treatment given in the GINA guidelines, and showed that the majority of patients treated with individually titrated doses of inhaled corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with long-acting beta 2 -agonist, could achieve and maintain control.

How to interpret lung function test results in asthma — A low FEV1, percent predicted, identifies patients at risk of asthma exacerbations, independent of symptom levels, especially if FEV1 is < 60% predicted; it is a risk factor for long-term decline, independent of symptom levels; and if symptoms are few, it suggests limitation of lifestyle or poor perception of airflow limitation, which may be due to untreated airway inflammation.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1142Y4M8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — initial pharmacotherapy and ICS use: Commence treatment as in the current GOLD strategy report with symptomatic treatment with long-acting bronchodilators (LABA and LAMA); use of inhaled corticosteroids is strongly favored for patients with ≥ 2 exacerbations/year requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) or blood eosinophils ≥ 300/μL; ICS should not be used alone without LABA and/or LAMA; inhaled therapy should be optimized to reduce the need for OCS; in patients with features of COPD, high-dose ICS should be avoided because of the risk of pneumonia.

Goals of asthma management — The GINA goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long-term outcomes for the individual patient, including good long-term symptom control (few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and unimpaired physical activity) and minimized long-term risk of asthma-related mortality, exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and side-effects of treatment; the patient's own goals should also be identified.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) interpretation — during symptoms, if FEV1 is within the predicted normal range this reduces the probability that symptoms are due to asthma; however, patients whose baseline FEV1 is > 80% predicted can have a clinically important increase in lung function with bronchodilator or ICS-containing treatment, and the patient's own best reading ('personal best') is recommended as their 'normal' value.

Several major international collaborations have provided data on COPD. For example, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) programme was established in 1998 and provides regular updates and evidence based recommendations for the management of COPD. The European Community Respiratory Health Survey was established in 1990 in response to the increased prevalence of asthma in the 1980s, with the aim of determining the distribution of asthma and its healthcare burden in the European community. In the last iteration of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (European Community Respiratory Health Survey III), the effects of atopic status and asthma on the development of COPD were evaluated. Based on the GOLD criteria, a diagnosis of COPD is suspected if the patient presents with related symptoms (eg, chronic cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) and risk factors (eg, tobacco smoking and occupational exposures) but is confirmed by the presence of a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity value of < 0.7. Commonly used drug treatments for COPD are β agonists, anticholinergic agents, and corticosteroids, and other options include α-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy, antitussive agents, and vasodilators.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^113M44Rj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Question 2.4 — fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) monitoring in individuals aged 5 years and older: In individuals aged 5 years and older with asthma, the Expert Panel recommends against the use of FENO measurements in isolation to assess asthma control, predict future exacerbations, or assess exacerbation severity, and states that FENO should only be used as part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy, with a strong recommendation and low certainty of evidence. Implementation guidance states that the Expert Panel does not recommend FENO testing on its own to assess asthma control, predict a future asthma exacerbation, or assess the severity of an exacerbation; that FENO levels are not well correlated with standard measures such as the ACT and ACQ, subsequent exacerbations, or exacerbation severity; and therefore FENO testing is not a substitute for standard measures and should not be used in isolation to monitor disease activity, although FENO measurement may be used in conjunction with an individual's history, clinical findings, and spirometry as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy. The Expert Panel also recommends against the use of isolated FENO measurement for asthma management and monitoring and specifies that FENO measurement should only be used as a part of an ongoing monitoring and management strategy to predict future exacerbations and assess exacerbation severity.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^1152timh]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114xoGng]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There are significant limitations to the utility of the ATS/ERS definition of mild asthma for both clinical practice and clinical trials, as highlighted in GINA 2022. This definition was intended as a retrospective label for clinical practice, but few patients in clinical practice have had their controller treatment stepped down to assess the minimum step at which their asthma remains controlled. It is not suitable for assessing clinical trial eligibility because of the time needed to establish the minimum effective treatment and the sporadic nature of exacerbations and because many clinical trials require asthma to be uncontrolled at entry. The exception is step-down studies; for example, 55% of the SYGMA (Symbicort Given as Needed in Mild Asthma) populations included patients considered by their physicians to have controlled asthma on ICS or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA).

In addition, our review revealed that the patient populations included in previous studies of mild asthma have been heterogeneous and rarely consistent with the above definitions. Inclusion criteria for clinical trials have typically been based on symptom frequency (sometimes with an upper frequency limit), treatment degree, minimum values of FEV 1, or a combination of these factors. Many studies also require patients to have some impairment of FEV 1 and significant bronchodilator responsiveness at entry (to confirm the diagnosis of asthma), but these are also typical features of uncontrolled asthma.

A standardized definition of mild asthma for clinical research could decrease heterogeneity among studies, thereby making comparisons of study results more generalizable. However, the undertaking of defining it is fraught with challenges. Specific challenges include the following
1 An inherent difficulty is that asthma severity by its own definition/nature varies over time. This makes it impossible to select a cutoff point to define categorical severity groups during cross-sectional assessments.
2 In addition to variable disease activity, definitions underappreciate the heterogeneity in this population, such as not including patients with infrequent (rare but significant) events.
3 Moreover, there is a risk of failing to identify patients who may be at higher risk of poorer outcomes or disease progression and would thus require more aggressive management approaches.
4 It is essential that a standardized definition have utility for the fields in which it will be used (e.g. clinical practice, clinical trials).

Future research on mild asthma, suggested in this document, will provide the tools instrumental to circumventing these challenges, bridging knowledge gaps, and hence developing a widely accepted definition. In the interim, this ad hoc committee proposes the following working definition of mild asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111sFA1U]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for asthma, more specifically with respect to severity definitions, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to define severe asthma as asthma remaining uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or requiring high-dose ICS-LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. Distinguish severe asthma (disease that is relatively refractory to corticosteroid treatment) from asthma that is difficult to treat due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, or problems with adherence or comorbidities, such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity since correction of these comorbidities or risk factors ("treatable traits") can significantly improve asthma control.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111XN5KB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma Severity

By consensus, asthma severity is assessed retrospectively, after at least 2–3 months of treatment, from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. GINA does not distinguish between so-called "intermittent" and "mild persistent" asthma because this historical distinction was arbitrary, with no evidence of a difference in the treatment response. Severe asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA or that requires such treatment to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma (i.e. asthma that may be uncontrolled because of other factors, such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and comorbidities such as obesity and environmental exposures).

Rationale

This definition of asthma severity works well at the severe end of the spectrum but is less useful for describing mild asthma (see TRFR). For example, patients with infrequent or no interval symptoms can still have severe exacerbations. This risk is reduced to a similar extent by either daily ICS treatment or by ICS–formoterol taken only for symptom relief, and the baseline symptom frequency does not predict the need for daily ICS.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Identifying' well-controlled'and' not well-controlled'asthma using the asthma control questionnaire [^112xBMzq]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) has been validated to measure the goals of asthma management as defined by international guidelines (minimisation of day- and night-time symptoms, activity limitation, beta(2)-agonist use and bronchoconstriction). Responses are given on a 7-point scale and the overall score is the mean of the responses (0 = totally controlled, 6 = severely uncontrolled). The aim of this analysis was to determine the cut-point on the ACQ that best differentiates between 'well-controlled' and 'not well-controlled' for (a) clinical practice (low risk of missing 'not well-controlled') and (b) clinical trials (low risk of including 'well-controlled'). All 1323 patients who provided data sets at week 12 in the Gaining Optimal Asthma Control (GOAL) clinical trial were included in the analysis. The gold standard for 'well-controlled' was a composite based on the GINA/NIH guidelines and derived from data collected in the clinical trial diaries and clinic records. The analysis showed that the crossover point between 'well-controlled' and 'not well-controlled' is close to 1.00 on the ACQ. However, to be confident that a patient has well-controlled asthma, the optimal cut-point is 0.75 (negative predictive value = 0.85). To be confident that the patient has inadequately controlled asthma, the optimal cut-point is 1.50 (positive predictive value = 0.88). In conclusion, knowledge of these cut-points will enhance practising clinicians ability to identify patients whose asthma requires additional treatment, enable investigators to enroll poorly controlled patients into studies and for both clinicians and investigators to evaluate whether treatment goals are being achieved.

### Assessment of asthma control and severity [^111HkXb3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a conceptual framework for defining severity and control in asthma, to describe recent advances in measuring asthma control, and to discuss the role of severity and control in asthma disease management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles published between 1998 and July 2003. Additional sources included key references cited in these articles, national and international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, and the author's personal bibliography.

Study Selection

All studies that reported on the development and validation of formal measures of asthma control, as well as the few editorials that focused on the distinction between asthma severity and control, were included. The author's professional judgment was used to select for illustrative purposes from among the many purported measures of asthma severity in the literature.

Results

Although several standardized measures of asthma control exist, no direct comparisons of the performance and properties of these control measures have been published. The available instruments appear more similar than dissimilar. All share the common trait of assessing multiple aspects of asthma control, which is believed to provide better discrimination than a single measure.

Conclusions

Asthma control is different from asthma severity and may be useful as a clinical vital sign for patients with asthma. Ultimately, no one measure may be better than any of the others or the optimal measure may depend on the intended use of the scale.

Asthma-COPD overlap — terminology and definitions — 'asthma-COPD overlap' is used as a descriptive label for a heterogeneous group of patients and does not denote a single disease entity; another common descriptor is 'asthma+COPD'. Asthma is characterized by respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity together with variable expiratory airflow limitation, COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition with chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction, and 'asthma-COPD overlap'/'asthma +COPD' collectively describe patients with persistent airflow limitation and clinical features consistent with both asthma and COPD and is not a definition of a single disease entity but a descriptive term for clinical use.

### Asthma exacerbations. 5: assessment and management of severe asthma in adults in hospital [^113KwSff]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge discrepancy between the management of severe asthma recommended by evidence-based guidelines and that observed in clinical practice. The recommendations are relatively straightforward and have been widely promoted both in guidelines and reviews. Specialist physicians need to be more proactive in their implementation of such guidelines through the use of locally derived protocols and assessment sheets, reinforced by audit. The common occurrence of severe asthma and its considerable burden to the community would support such an approach.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnostic flowchart for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years in clinical practice outlines an approach for patients presenting with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms in clinical practice. The algorithm begins by asking "Are symptoms typical of asthma?", then evaluates objective testing feasibility with "Is spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) available and feasible?" and directs to "Perform lung function test(s) as in Box 1–2, e.g. spirometry or PEF before and after bronchodilator" to determine whether "Is variable expiratory airflow limitation confirmed?". A branch conducts "Further history and tests for alternative diagnoses" with "Is alternative diagnosis confirmed?", leading to "Treat for alternative diagnosis" when confirmed. If other diagnoses are unlikely, it advises to "treat empirically with ICS-containing treatment (Boxes 4–5 & 4–11)", then "Review response in 1–3 months, including PEF or spirometry if available" and, if improved, "Treat for asthma with ICS-containing treatment See Boxes 4–5 & 4–11". The footnote states that "Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, but it is better than having no objective measurement of lung function", and that readings "may vary by up to 20% between different meters" and to use "only the highest of three readings".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111eRZXy]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Implementing asthma management strategies — methodology and adaptation note that when asthma care is consistent with evidence-based recommendations, outcomes improve; rigorous methodologies such as GRADE for developing recommendations and ADAPTE for adapting them have assisted in reducing biased opinion in asthma programs; adaptation of recommendations to local conditions using the GRADE method is costly and often requires expertise not available locally, with regular revision required; the GINA annual report is not a formal guideline but an evidence-based strategy, updated yearly from a review of the evidence published in the last 18 months; and, as with other evidence-based clinical recommendations, the GINA strategy must be adapted to the local context for implementation in clinical practice.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^115nG8db]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition

Advances in the understanding of severe asthma accelerated ∼20 years ago when severe asthma was recognized as a distinct grouping of entities. Severe asthma was specifically defined, first in 2000 by an American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop, then by the World Health Organization (for a more global definition with relevance to poorly developed and developing countries), and most recently by the European Respiratory Society (ERS)–ATS guidelines. Underlying obstructions with reversibility or reactivity, current or previous, remain at the heart of identifying severe asthma, such that confirmation of an asthma diagnosis, by original ATS definitions, is mandatory. This need to link to current or historical reversible obstruction is sometimes lost when evaluating symptomatic patients, despite guideline-appropriate therapy, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, lack of reversibility to normal should not invoke a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; rather, it is a hallmark of severe asthmatic disease.

Once an asthma diagnosis is established, ERS–ATS–defined severe asthma (Box 1) is "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (CSs), plus a second controller, to remain controlled or which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy". Control is defined by symptoms, exacerbations, and degree of obstruction. Yet the current severe asthma definition remains an umbrella definition. It can encompass smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers and a broad range of underlying pathobiologies or molecular phenotypes. Dissecting them is critical to improving treatment.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111D9HCv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of Mild Asthma

Current Knowledge and Challenges

The lack of a standardized definition of mild asthma has been a major challenge for clinical research (Table 1 and Figure 1). In the current ATS definition, published in 2008 and 2009 by an ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force, asthma severity is defined by difficulty in controlling asthma with treatment; mild asthma is considered as asthma that can be controlled with low-intensity treatment. The task force included both symptoms and exacerbations in the assessment of control but recognized that exacerbations could be experienced even by patients with mild asthma. It emphasized that severity could be assessed only once patients had been taking controller treatment for several months, as uncontrolled asthma before starting treatment could turn out to be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the response to ICS.

GINA, following the ATS/ERS definition, defines mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled on steps 1 and 2 of treatment (with both steps containing ICS). However, the 2020 focused update of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines retains the NAEPP 2007 division of mild asthma before controller treatment is started (i.e. in treatment-naive patients or in patients receiving SABAs alone), into "intermittent" versus "persistent" on the basis of daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, interference with daily activity, and exacerbations in the setting of normal lung function. Before controller treatment is started, GINA (unlike NAEPP) does not distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma because, as noted above, severity can be assessed only after the patient is on controller treatment, because of a lack of evidence to support specific symptom frequency criteria, and because both groups experience similarly large reductions in exacerbations with ICS treatment. After controller treatment is started, NAEPP continues to distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma: intermittent if it can be controlled by SABA-only treatment and persistent if step 2 treatment or higher is required.

Diagnosis confirmation in suspected difficult-to-treat asthma — spirometry, thresholds, and bronchodilator withholding: Confirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12–50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not found to be the correct diagnosis; perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function and seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and if initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤ 200 mL or ≤ 12% increase in FEV1), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic or stepping controller treatment before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing; check full flow-volume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction; if spirometry is normal or is not available, provide a peak flow meter and diary and consider bronchial provocation testing if able to withhold bronchodilators (short-acting beta2 agonist [SABA] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to 2 days depending on duration of action).

### Future research directions in asthma. An NHLBI working group report [^114sQeXK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease without cure. Our understanding of asthma onset, pathobiology, classification, and management has evolved substantially over the past decade; however, significant asthma-related morbidity and excess healthcare use and costs persist. To address this important clinical condition, the NHLBI convened a group of extramural investigators for an Asthma Research Strategic Planning workshop on September 18–19, 2014, to accelerate discoveries and their translation to patients. The workshop focused on (1) in utero and early-life origins of asthma, (2) the use of phenotypes and endotypes to classify disease, (3) defining disease modification, (4) disease management, and (5) implementation research. This report summarizes the workshop and produces recommendations to guide future research in asthma.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111E4h1y]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The new GINA strategy report and supporting resources provide a substantial array of new, practical, evidence-based materials that supplement current national asthma guidelines, or can be adapted for local use, in both high- and low-resource countries. In the 2014 revision and 2015 update, GINA has moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk in a practical, practice-centred format. The aim is to reduce the burden of asthma, both for patients who suffer from this disease and for health-care systems.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

5.8 Research priorities

Research is needed to persuade governments that there are better ways to diagnose and manage asthma in children. We need targeted research into better diagnosis, particularly in younger children, with a review of new and existing biomarkers to identify different endotypes. Exacerbation risk research is needed with the recognition that factors driving it will be different between and within high‐income countries and LMICs. We should start by a meeting of policymakers to determine data requirements that are needed to facilitate policy changes which improve important outcomes.

How do we move from a global philosophy where management of acute attacks is the priority to one where longitudinal care or preferably prevention of symptom development is the rule? We now have measures of asthma burden such as the Composite Asthma Severity Index and Asthma Severity Scoring System 104, 105, 106 and tools to predict who is at risk for seasonal exacerbations. 36, 37 These tools need studying and probably modifying in LMICs. Ultimately, we need to progress toward a primary prevention strategy for childhood asthma, which should be part of the research plan.

Asthma data are inadequately collected at a national level with no global international vision. In contrast, the success of the cystic fibrosis registries and their quality improvement programs is enviable. 107, 108 Setting up local, national, and global severe children's asthma registries will help, progressing then to other asthma categories. These registries should contain longitudinal information on lung trajectories, the frequency of asthma attacks, medication adherence patterns, patient behaviors, and environmental details.

Further research into the feasibility of an international standard for asthma care is needed with transparent benchmarks for diagnosis, management outcomes and medications prescribed, organized and funded at a national level and data shared with international registries, similar to that developed for adults with severe asthma. 109 It will improve asthma care 11 and inform policymakers. Financial support is required for the implementation of minimal standards together with real world‐research into its outcomes.

Technology advances will enable electronic medication monitoring, as well as the organization of medical records to identify those children with frequent hospital admissions. Such technology could be used to identify children receiving suboptimal care. While these potential advances may not be available in LMICs, they are feasible in high‐income countries containing deprived communities. The asthma community needs to encourage research into these techniques. If benefits are shown, such advances will enter into asthma guidelines with subsequent adaptation in both high income and LMICs. Table 4 summarises the key elements of research policy and public expectation needed to really make a difference.
