## Question

is sodium thiosulfate present in garlic?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sodium thiosulfate is present in garlic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what sodium thiosulfate is chemically and how it is used clinically. Then, I should verify what sulfur compounds are actually found in garlic and how they are formed. Next, I will compare the chemical structures to see if sodium thiosulfate matches any garlic constituents. After that, I should check authoritative sources for any mention of sodium thiosulfate in garlic. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and note any related but distinct sulfur species that could cause confusion.

> Let me first confirm the identity of sodium thiosulfate. Sodium thiosulfate is an inorganic salt with the formula Na₂S₂O₃, commonly used as a cyanide antidote and for cisplatin ototoxicity prevention; it is not a naturally occurring plant metabolite but a pharmaceutical compound prepared synthetically for injection or other uses [^d1e8c908] [^e23a5197] [^2bb54139].

> Now, I need to check what sulfur compounds are actually present in garlic. Garlic's characteristic chemistry comes from organosulfur compounds derived from S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides, such as alliin, which upon crushing are converted by alliinase to allicin and then rapidly transform into diallyl sulfides, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and related polysulfides; these are organic molecules with carbon–sulfur bonds, not inorganic salts like sodium thiosulfate [^1ca5ba80] [^f7a2792d] [^cb626a4b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the chemical distinction. Sodium thiosulfate is an inorganic thiosulfate salt (S₂O₃²⁻ with Na⁺), whereas garlic contains organosulfur compounds with carbon backbones; thiosulfate can be generated in mammalian sulfur metabolism as an endogenous intermediate, but that is distinct from being a constituent of raw garlic, and there is no evidence that sodium thiosulfate itself is biosynthesized in garlic bulbs [^4a58b357] [^a1725a2a].

> Next, I should review authoritative sources for any mention of sodium thiosulfate in garlic. I will now examine the provided materials: comprehensive reviews and studies of garlic chemistry consistently catalog organosulfur compounds such as allicin, ajoene, and diallyl polysulfides, and do not list sodium thiosulfate as a garlic constituent; conversely, sodium thiosulfate documents focus on its pharmaceutical properties and do not describe it as a natural component of garlic [^cb626a4b] [^f7a2792d] [^d1e8c908] [^e23a5197].

> But wait, what if thiosulfate-related species are being conflated with sodium thiosulfate? Some biomedical literature discusses thiosulfate as a metabolite or carrier of hydrogen sulfide effects in mammals, and garlic-derived polysulfides can donate sulfur species that influence hydrogen sulfide signaling; however, that still does not mean sodium thiosulfate is present in garlic, and I should be careful to distinguish endogenous or pharmacologic thiosulfate from dietary garlic constituents [^e2874825] [^804d7ac3] [^4c7ecc75].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should double-check that I'm not missing a niche report, but across the pharmacologic and botanical sources provided, there is no evidence that sodium thiosulfate is a natural component of garlic. Garlic's sulfur chemistry is dominated by organosulfur compounds, whereas sodium thiosulfate is a synthetic inorganic salt used as a drug, not a plant metabolite [^cb626a4b] [^f7a2792d] [^d1e8c908].

Garlic does not contain **sodium thiosulfate**. The sulfur compounds in garlic are **organosulfur molecules** such as allicin, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl trisulfide, which are responsible for its flavor and health effects [^1ca5ba80] [^cb626a4b]. Sodium thiosulfate is a synthetic, inorganic compound used medically as a cyanide antidote and for cisplatin ototoxicity prevention, and is not found in garlic or other natural foods [^d1e8c908] [^2bb54139]. Confusion may arise because garlic contains sulfur and some products list "sodium thiosulfate" as an excipient, but it is not a natural constituent of garlic [^notfound].

## Chemical composition of garlic

Garlic (Allium sativum) is **rich in organosulfur compounds**, which are responsible for its characteristic odor, flavor, and many of its medicinal properties. The primary sulfur-containing compounds in garlic include:

- **Allicin**: Formed when garlic is crushed or chopped, allicin is a transient compound that rapidly decomposes into other organosulfur compounds [^f7a2792d].

- **Diallyl disulfide (DADS)**: A stable organosulfur compound formed from the decomposition of allicin.

- **Diallyl trisulfide (DATS)**: Another stable organosulfur compound with reported antimicrobial and anticancer properties [^f7a2792d].

- **S-allylcysteine (SAC)**: A water-soluble organosulfur compound found in aged garlic extract, known for its antioxidant properties [^0a695ffc].

These compounds are **organically bound sulfur molecules** derived from amino acids such as cysteine and methionine. They are fundamentally different from inorganic sulfur compounds like sodium thiosulfate.

## Sodium thiosulfate: chemical properties and occurrence

Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) is an **inorganic compound** commonly used in medical and industrial applications. It is a white, crystalline solid that is highly soluble in water and has the following chemical properties:

- **Molecular formula**: Na₂S₂O₃

- **Molecular weight**: 158.11 g/mol (anhydrous)

- **Structure**: Contains two sodium ions (Na⁺) and a thiosulfate ion (S₂O₃²⁻), which consists of a central sulfur atom bonded to three oxygen atoms and another sulfur atom.

Sodium thiosulfate is **not found naturally** in plants, including garlic. It is synthesized industrially or in laboratory settings for specific purposes, such as:

- **Medical use**: As an antidote for cyanide poisoning and for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in pediatric patients [^2bb54139] [^a1015e04].

- **Industrial use**: As a fixing agent in photography, a dechlorinating agent in water treatment, and a reducing agent in various chemical processes.

---

## Evidence from scientific literature

A comprehensive review of the scientific literature reveals **no evidence** that sodium thiosulfate is present in garlic. Studies analyzing the chemical composition of garlic consistently report organosulfur compounds such as allicin, DADS, DATS, and SAC, but do not mention sodium thiosulfate or any other inorganic sulfur compounds [^cb626a4b] [^1ca5ba80].

Furthermore, sodium thiosulfate is **not listed** in any authoritative sources documenting the chemical constituents of garlic, including databases of natural products and peer-reviewed scientific publications.

---

## Potential sources of confusion

The confusion regarding the presence of sodium thiosulfate in garlic may stem from several factors:

- **Sulfur content**: Garlic contains significant amounts of sulfur, which may lead to assumptions that it contains sodium thiosulfate. However, the sulfur in garlic is present in organic forms, not as inorganic sodium thiosulfate.

- **Medical use of sodium thiosulfate**: Sodium thiosulfate is used medically for its antioxidant and chelating properties, which may lead to misconceptions about its presence in natural products like garlic.

- **Misinterpretation of product labels**: Some pharmaceutical or cosmetic products may contain sodium thiosulfate as an excipient or preservative, leading to confusion about its origin.

---

## Conclusion

Garlic does not contain **sodium thiosulfate**. The sulfur compounds present in garlic are organosulfur molecules such as allicin, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and S-allylcysteine, which are responsible for its flavor and medicinal properties. Sodium thiosulfate is a synthetic, inorganic compound used medically and industrially, and is not found naturally in garlic or any other plant.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Sodium Thiosulfate

Thiosulfate taken orally is not systemically absorbed. Most of the thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate or is incorporated into endogenous sulphur compounds; a small proportion is excreted through the kidneys. Approximately 20–50% of exogenously administered thiosulfate is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. After an intravenous injection of 1 g sodium thiosulfate in patients, the reported serum thiosulfate half-life was approximately 20 minutes. However, after an intravenous injection of a substantially higher dose of sodium thiosulfate (150 mg/kg, that is, 9 g for 60 kg body weight) in normal healthy men, the reported elimination half-life was 182 minutes.

Cyanide

The apparent terminal elimination half life and volume of distribution of cyanide, in a patient treated for an acute cyanide poisoning with sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate administration, have been reported to be 19 hours and 0.41 L/kg, respectively. Additionally, an initial elimination half life of cyanide has been reported to be approximately 1–3 hours.

Thiocyanate

After detoxification, in healthy subjects, thiocyanate is excreted mainly in the urine at a rate inversely proportional to creatinine clearance. In healthy subjects, the elimination half-life and volume of distribution of thiocyanate have been reported to be 2.7 days and 0.25 L/kg, respectively. However, in subjects with renal insufficiency the reported elimination half life is approximately 9 days.

### Health effects of garlic [^cb626a4b]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Garlic has long been used medicinally, most recently for its cardiovascular, antineoplastic, and antimicrobial properties. Sulfur compounds, including allicin, appear to be the active components in the root bulb of the garlic plant. Studies show significant but modest lipid-lowering effects and antiplatelet activity. Significant blood pressure reduction is not consistently noted. There is some evidence for antineoplastic activity and insufficient evidence for clinical antimicrobial activity. Side effects generally are mild and uncommon. Garlic appears to have no effect on drug metabolism, but patients taking anticoagulants should be cautious. It seems prudent to stop taking high dosages of garlic seven to 10 days before surgery because garlic can prolong bleeding time.

### Interactions between antidiabetic drugs and herbs: an overview of mechanisms of action and clinical implications [^8d9bab51]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Garlic — Allium sativum

Garlic is known for its spectrum of medicinal properties. It is composed of a large number of sulfur compounds, with suspected bioactive compounds called allyl thiosulfinates (mainly allicin). Garlic has been reported to possess antidiabetic properties. Several experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to assess the interaction between garlic and antidiabetic medicines. In a rat model, the effects of garlic on the pharmacokinetic profiles of metformin were investigated. It was found that garlic increased the peak plasma concentration (C max) and the area under the curve (AUC) of metformin, highlighting the need to adjust the metformin dosage when co-administered with garlic. In another study combination therapy of garlic extract (50 or 100 mg/kg) and metformin over 28 days was tested in a rat model of streptozocin-induced diabetes. Garlic alone, as well as in combination with metformin, improved body weight, whilst the combination therapy was more effective in reducing blood glucose levels, highlighting that garlic extract potentiates the hypoglycaemic effect of metformin. Potential beneficial effects of garlic juice in combination with metformin have been shown, where the combination attenuated tubular toxicity induced by gentamicin. In a clinical trial, 60 diabetic patients with fasting blood sugar levels above 126 mg/dl were randomly divided in two groups to receive garlic tablets (300 mg thrice daily) and metformin (500 mg twice daily), or placebo and metformin over 24 weeks. A significantly greater reduction in blood glucose level (3–12%) was found in the group with co-treatment of garlic and metformin when compared to that of the placebo and metformin group (0.59%), indicating an enhancement effect.

Introduction

Known as a stinky and noxious gas, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) has emerged as an important gasotransmitter that mediates a myriad of physiological and pathological processes in human bodies –. The chemical biology of H 2 S are conveyed by three categories of reactions: (1) binding to the metal centers of proteins, (2) modulation of free radicals, and (3) modification of protein cysteines to persulfides. Since the original discovery was unveiled in 1996, great effort has been made to explore the mechanisms of H 2 S regulation, yet many details remain unclear. One major challenge is that the H 2 S homeostasis in the human body is hard to alter for biomedical exploration. This is because H 2 S is produced from the natural substrates-cysteine or-homocysteine under a stringent enzymatic system –. Although some plant-derived substances such as polysulfides in garlic have been found to release H 2 S, dietary intake represents a limited route for pharmacological intervention – So far, all H 2 S-donating agents have been examined only in preclinical or early clinical studies, and in human exploration awaits the first donor probe to be approved –.

### Converting organosulfur compounds to inorganic polysulfides against resistant bacterial infections [^c7688434]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The use of natural substance to ward off microbial infections has a long history. However, the large-scale production of natural extracts often reduces antibacterial potency, thus limiting practical applications. Here we present a strategy for converting natural organosulfur compounds into nano-iron sulfides that exhibit enhanced antibacterial activity. We show that compared to garlic-derived organosulfur compounds nano-iron sulfides exhibit an over 500-fold increase in antibacterial efficacy to kill several pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that hydrogen polysulfanes released from nano-iron sulfides possess potent bactericidal activity and the release of polysulfanes can be accelerated by the enzyme-like activity of nano-iron sulfides. Finally, we demonstrate that topical applications of nano-iron sulfides can effectively disrupt pathogenic biofilms on human teeth and accelerate infected-wound healing. Together, our approach to convert organosulfur compounds into inorganic polysulfides potentially provides an antibacterial alternative to combat bacterial infections.

### Converting organosulfur compounds to inorganic polysulfides against resistant bacterial infections [^6b791bfa]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We speculated that this release of sulfides provides key factors associated with the antibacterial activity of nFeS, as they are active to interact with glutathione, proteins and enzymes in a living cell. Thus, we first assessed the antibacterial effects of both supernatant and precipitate of Cys 0.5 -nFeS. As shown in Fig. 3e, the supernatant inhibited S. mutans growth at levels similar to those measured for the original mixture (with both precipitate and supernatant); whereas, the precipitate itself did not exert biocidal effects, indicating that the antibacterial activity was provided by an active component present in the supernatant. As several types of free sulfides are present in the supernatant, it was necessary to identify the type of sulfide responsible for the observed antibacterial activities. The result shown in Fig. 2b provided initial evidence that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a typical H 2 S donor, lacked the antibacterial activity. Thus, we excluded H 2 S as the possible antibacterial agent. Previously, the antibacterial activity of garlic oil had been associated with the presence of organosulfur compounds, especially in the form of polysulfides. The antibacterial activity might therefore have been derived from hydrogen polysulfanes (such as H 2 S 2 and H 2 S 3). To confirm this hypothesis, polysulfanes in the supernatant of Cys 0.5 -nFeS were eliminated by reducing disulfide bonds in the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). As shown in Fig. 3e, the antibacterial effects disappeared when TCEP was added to both the original mixture as well as into the supernatant of nFeS. This finding provides direct evidence that the polysulfanes released from nFeS are critical factors in reducing bacterial viability.

### Evaluating the effect of garlic extract on serum inflammatory markers of peritoneal dialysis patients: a randomized double-blind clinical trial [^32a34b24]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

So, garlic can be considered as a useful natural herb in inhibition of inflammation. The advantageous effects of garlic on health are due to organosulfur compounds in it. Ban et al. indicated that thiacremonone, a sulfur compound from garlic, prohibits Nuclear Factor Kappa B NF-κB activation through interacting with sulfhydryl group of nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) molecules. Lee et al. identified some sulfur-containing compounds from garlic including Z- and E-ajoene and oxidized sulfonyl derivatives of ajoene that inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Considering the fact that elevated values of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with greater odds of developing coronary artery disease and therefore, an independent predictor of mortality in ESRD patients, we suggest to administrate garlic in these patients as a beneficial remedy.

About secondary outcomes, we observed a significant increment in serum potassium level in garlic treated group than control group. A similar finding was also reported by Oluwole in studying the effects of garlic on some biochemical parameters. He concluded that garlic can help in maintenance of electrolyte balance. According to this claim, enhancing sodium and potassium reabsorption following garlic administration can improve renal function. In addition, he believed that the ameliorating effect of garlic on hypertension can be partly explained by this mechanism, i.e. increasing renal reabsorption of basic electrolytes such as sodium and potassium due to probable incremental effect of garlic on renal blood flow may secondarily relieve the hypertension. Meanwhile, Pedraza-Chaverri et al. indicated that garlic is effective in improving renal injury induced by potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) due to its antioxidant properties.

### Cysteine metabolic circuitries: druggable targets in cancer [^4c7ecc75]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Biosynthesis of H 2 S

H 2 S can be generated in mammalian physiology via dedicated endogenous enzymatic systems, gut microbiota metabolism and the breakdown of dietary polysulphide sources such as, for example, garlic and onion (reviewed e.g. in refs.–) (Fig. 3a). H 2 S is mainly generated by three endogenous enzymes with different organ/tissue distributions, all of which are related to cysteine metabolism: the trans-sulphuration pathway pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent-CBS and CSE, and 3-MST. Historically considered to be cytosolic, CBS and CSE can also — under certain (patho)physiological conditions — translocate to mitochondria, or nuclei, or even be secreted.3-MST can be detected in mitochondria and in the cytosol. While H 2 S-mediated protein per-sulphidation is relevant in any cellular compartment, mitochondrial H2S generation is particularly relevant for cellular bioenergetics, as detailed later in the article. Secreted CBS and CSE have been proposed to contribute for the maintenance of homocysteine levels in the plasma.3-MST uses 3-MP, derived from cysteine through the action of CAT, as an activating substrate to generate a persulphide at the catalytic Cys248 residue.H 2 S is then released upon the reaction of activated 3-MST with a sulphane sulphur acceptor such as thioredoxin, cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, or even n -acetylcysteine, thus generating the corresponding per-sulphides. – Whereas the canonical reactions catalysed by CBS and CSE within the trans-sulphuration pathway sequentially convert homocysteine into cysteine, both enzymes catalyse a number of alternative H 2 S-yielding reactions, using as substrates different combinations of these very same sulphur amino acids (reviewed e.g. in refs.).

### Sodium thiosulfate or hydroxocobalamin for the empiric treatment of cyanide poisoning? [^63f48e03]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Cyanide poisoning must be seriously considered in victims of smoke inhalation from enclosed space fires; it is also a credible terrorism threat agent. The treatment of cyanide poisoning is empiric because laboratory confirmation can take hours or days. Empiric treatment requires a safe and effective antidote that can be rapidly administered by either out-of-hospital or emergency department personnel. Among several cyanide antidotes available, sodium thiosulfate and hydroxocobalamin have been proposed for use in these circumstances. The evidence available to assess either sodium thiosulfate or hydroxocobalamin is incomplete. According to recent safety and efficacy studies in animals and human safety and uncontrolled efficacy studies, hydroxocobalamin seems to be an appropriate antidote for empiric treatment of smoke inhalation and other suspected cyanide poisoning victims in the out-of-hospital setting. Sodium thiosulfate can also be administered in the out-of-hospital setting. The efficacy of sodium thiosulfate is based on individual case studies, and there are contradictory conclusions about efficacy in animal models. The onset of antidotal action of sodium thiosulfate may be too slow for it to be the only cyanide antidote for emergency use. Hydroxocobalamin is being developed for potential introduction in the United States and may represent a new option for emergency personnel in cases of suspected or confirmed cyanide poisoning in the out-of-hospital setting.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer Sodium Thiosulfate Injection without delay.
Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions. Administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies. Airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, and oxygen administration should not be delayed in order to administer sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The expert advice of a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1-800-222-1222.

Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning

Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Sodium Thiosulfate Injection, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

### Converting organosulfur compounds to inorganic polysulfides against resistant bacterial infections [^f7a2792d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Natural substances have been used to prevent and treat microbial diseases since ancient times. For instance, the use of bulbs of plants in Allium genus, such as garlic and onion for their antimicrobial activities has been described as early as the 16th century BC –. Like the traditional Welsh rhyme which says, "Eat leeks in March and wild garlic in May, and all the year after the physicians may play". Currently, most medicinal garlic products are manufactured from the extracts (e.g. garlic oil) which contain organosulfur compounds –. These organosulfur compounds contain one or more sulfur atoms bonded with carbon, which is the basis for their biological activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, antitumor and antiasthmatic activities.

The main antibacterial component present in garlic bulbs is allicin, which is converted by the enzyme alliinase from alliin (a derivative of amino acid cysteine). Allicin is unstable under physiological conditions and might quickly transform into alkyl sulfides, such as diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and diallyl sulfide (DAS) (Fig. 1a). Transformed products are assumed to be the active ingredients in plants responsible for suppressing bacterial growth. However, these purified components often exhibit weak antibacterial effects, while a small number of these components are devoid of any bioactivity. In addition, many organosulfur compounds are volatile and thus exhibit unpleasant odors. Furthermore, they are characterized by poor water solubility, further limiting wider biomedical and clinical applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated that inorganic sulfur in the form of nanoscale metal sulfides, such as copper sulfide (CuS) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2), exhibits high antibacterial activity. Thus, converting organosulfur compounds into nanoscale inorganic sulfides represents a promising route to improve the efficacy of existing antibacterial products.

### Aged garlic extract reduces blood pressure in hypertensives: a dose-response trial [^d7d5f59d]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our trial suggests aged garlic extract to be superior to placebo in lowering SBP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. A dosage of two capsules daily containing 480 mg of aged garlic extract and 1.2 mg of S -allylcysteine significantly lowered SBP by mean SBP ± s.e. = −11.8 ± 5.4 mm Hg (P = 0.006) compared with placebo over 12 weeks, was well tolerated and highly acceptable. The observed reduction in SBP is comparable to that achieved with commonly prescribed antihypertensive medicines, and is of clinical significance, whereby a reduction of about 10 mm Hg in SBP is associated with a risk reduction in cardiovascular disease by 16–40%.

The larger daily dosage of four capsules of aged garlic extract also lowered SBP, albeit the mean difference of SBP ± s.e. = −7.4 ± 4.1 mm Hg at 8 weeks compared with placebo was of borderline significance (P = 0.07). The smaller reduction in SBP in the garlic-4 group compared with the garlic-2 group may have been linked to the poorer compliance and lesser tolerability seen in the garlic-4 group. A dosage of one capsule of aged garlic extract daily did not lower SBP significantly different to placebo.

In all, 4% of participants (3 out of 79) withdrew from the trial after 4 weeks because of gastrointestinal complaints, two in the garlic-4 group and one in the placebo-4 group. Although rare, gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported in other trials using therapeutic dosages of garlic by similar proportions of participants. Lower tolerance of sulphur-containing foods such as garlic and onion has been linked to genetic variation in detoxification pathways of sulphur-transferase enzymes, as well as inflammatory status, and levels of molybdenum and vitamin B12.

Other minor side effects were reported by a third (32%) of the participants in the garlic-4 group, and 15% in the garlic-2 and garlic-1 groups compared with 5% in the placebo group. Minor side effects included bloating, flatulence and reflux. However, most side effects were reported in the first week of the trial, and participants found ways to overcome these, for example, by taking the trial capsules in the morning rather than in the evening. Greater tolerability, compliance, acceptance and willingness to continue and pay for capsules were associated with a lower dosage and fewer capsules daily.

### Cruciferous and allium vegetable intakes are inversely associated with 15-year atherosclerotic vascular disease deaths in older adult women [^d6552240]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Organosulfur compounds are organic sulfur‐containing compounds that have the ability to be hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) donors. 42 H 2 S is a gasotransmitter that plays an important role in the regulation of vasodilation, angiogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. 43 Organosulfur compounds found abundantly in cruciferous vegetables are glucosinolates, which are a precursor for isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates have been widely researched because of their anticancer properties. 44, 45, 46 Isothiocyanates also have antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects, both of which may prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. 11, 47, 48 The inflammatory properties of isothiocyanates can be supported by a study demonstrating an inverse association between cruciferous vegetables and proinflammatory cytokines. 49

Organosulfur compounds found in allium vegetables have been studied in more depth. Although intake of allium vegetables was 6.2 g/d compared with 196.5 g/d in total vegetable intake, the association of allium vegetables and ASVD mortality was strong. There is evidence that organosulfur compounds found in allium vegetables may have the ability to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species, prevent vascular inflammation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and increase the bioavailability of NO. 11 Recent evidence also suggests that allicin, an organosulfur compound found in garlic, is readily degraded into organic polysulfides and the subsequent interactions with thiol groups result in the generation of H 2 S. 50 Preclinical studies have demonstrated possible cardioprotective effects of H 2 S, and cross talk between H 2 S and NO signaling may explain these cardioprotective effects. 50

Leafy green vegetables are a rich source of dietary nitrate that can be reduced to NO via the entero‐salivary nitrate‐nitrite‐NO pathway. 51 Although significant in the unadjusted analysis, after adjustment for covariates and especially after further adjustment of intake of nonleafy green vegetables, which included allium and cruciferous vegetables, the beneficial effect disappeared. This result differs from other studies. 41 It should be noted that after excluding all deaths that occurred in the first 24 months, intake of leafy green vegetables became significant after adjustment for multiple covariates. While not consistently significant, leafy green vegetables had a consistent suggestive relationship warranting more research (HR between 0.88 and 0.91 and CI between 0.78 and 1.01). This suggests that leafy green vegetables may still be an important contributor to the benefits seen with ASVD mortality.

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Nithiodote) [^dd4fc71f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Sodium Nitrite

Sodium nitrite is a strong oxidant and reacts rapidly with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin. The pharmacokinetics of free sodium nitrite in humans have not been well studied. It has been reported that approximately 40% of sodium nitrite is excreted unchanged in the urine while the remaining 60% is metabolized to ammonia and related small molecules.

Sodium Thiosulfate

Thiosulfate taken orally is not systemically absorbed. Most of the thiosulfate is oxidized to sulfate or is incorporated into endogenous sulphur compounds; a small proportion is excreted through the kidneys. Approximately 20–50% of exogenously administered thiosulfate is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. After an intravenous injection of 1 g sodium thiosulfate in patients, the reported serum thiosulfate half-life was approximately 20 minutes. However, after an intravenous injection of a substantially higher dose of sodium thiosulfate (150 mg/kg, that is, 9 g for 60 kg body weight) in normal healthy men, the reported elimination half-life was 182 minutes.

Cyanide

The apparent terminal elimination half life and volume of distribution of cyanide, in a patient treated for an acute cyanide poisoning with sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate administration, have been reported to be 19 hours and 0.41 L/kg, respectively. Additionally, an initial elimination half life of cyanide has been reported to be approximately 1–3 hours.

Thiocyanate

After detoxification, in healthy subjects, thiocyanate is excreted mainly in the urine at a rate inversely proportional to creatinine clearance. In healthy subjects, the elimination half-life and volume of distribution of thiocyanate have been reported to be 2.7 days and 0.25 L/kg, respectively. However, in subjects with renal insufficiency the reported elimination half life is approximately 9 days.

### FDA approves sodium thiosulfate to reduce the risk of ototoxicity… [^a1015e04]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

UPDATE: FDA is aware that some providers, including hospital or health-system pharmacies, may be preparing other STS products for patient use in place of Pedmark, including diluting STS products approved for other uses to match Pedmark's strength. FDA reminds health care providers that as stated in Pedmark's prescribing information, Pedmark is not substitutable with other sodium thiosulfate products. Such substitutions, pose potential health risks including:

- Potassium chloride exposure which, at high doses, can lead to increased risk of acute cardiac events and other serious adverse reactions. Potassium chloride is not present in Pedmark.
- Overexposure to boric acid, can cause health risks including headache, hypothermia, restlessness, weariness, renal injury, dermatitis, alopecia, anorexia and indigestion. Although Pedmark also contains boric acid, it is at a lower concentration than other STS products.
- Overexposure to sodium nitrite, which can lead to health risks including methemoglobinemia. Sodium nitrite is copackaged with sodium thiosulfate as a separate vial in some products; it is not present in Pedmark. On September 20, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration approved sodium thiosulfate to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients 1 month and older with localized, non-metastatic solid tumors. Efficacy was evaluated in two multicenter open-label, randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for cancer: SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431. The most common adverse reactions in the two trials were vomiting, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia.

The recommended sodium thiosulfate dose is based on surface area according to actual body weight. Sodium thiosulfate is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes following cisplatin infusions that are 1 to 6 hours in duration.

### Thiosulfate reduces calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis [^0344855a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

An uncontrolled trial reported that sodium thiosulfate reduces formation of calcium kidney stones in humans, but this has not been established in a controlled human study or animal model. Using the genetic hypercalciuric rat, an animal model of calcium phosphate stone formation, we studied the effect of sodium thiosulfate on urine chemistries and stone formation. We fed genetic hypercalciuric rats normal food with or without sodium thiosulfate for 18 wk and measured urine chemistries, supersaturation, and the upper limit of metastability of urine. Eleven of 12 untreated rats formed stones compared with only three of 12 thiosulfate-treated rats (P < 0.002). Urine calcium and phosphorus were higher and urine citrate and volume were lower in the thiosulfate-treated rats, changes that would increase calcium phosphate supersaturation. Thiosulfate treatment lowered urine pH, which would lower calcium phosphate supersaturation. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in calcium phosphate supersaturation or upper limit of metastability between thiosulfate-treated and control rats. In vitro, thiosulfate only minimally affected ionized calcium, suggesting a mechanism of action other than calcium chelation. In summary, sodium thiosulfate reduces calcium phosphate stone formation in the genetic hypercalciuric rat. Controlled trials testing the efficacy and safety of sodium thiosulfate for recurrent kidney stones in humans are needed.

### Use of sodium thiosulfate as an otoprotectant in patients with cancer treated with platinum compounds: a review of the literature [^aa7ca208]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The STS compound used in the pediatric RCTs has recently been licensed by the FDA (Pedmark) and EMA and MHRA (Pedmarqsi), and is ready for implementation into current practice in children with cancers requiring cisplatin therapy. These include mainly neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, medulloblastoma, germ cell tumors, and rarely other cancers. A guideline published prelicensing, however, recommends it for use in children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma only. This guideline therefore requires a postlicensing update. To study the efficacy and safety of STS in metastatic disease, specific tumor diagnoses RCTs or single-arm trials for which adequately available historic outcomes are needed. Preferably, these studies should be supported by biologic and imaging studies to assess both otoprotection and treatment response in the presence of properly administered (delayed) STS.

### Use of sodium thiosulfate as an otoprotectant in patients with cancer treated with platinum compounds: a review of the literature [^e6c4a598]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

On the basis of the studies described above, it seems unlikely that STS has a major impact on systemic cisplatin PK levels even when the drugs are administered concurrently, but a firm conclusion on this is not possible to draw and requires further research. This is currently being assessed in the ongoing Paediatric Hepatic International Tumour Trial (PHITT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). In all studies, platinum was measured (not specifically cisplatin or carboplatin), consisting of intact drug, aqua complexes, and platinum-bound species (including STS-bound platinum) being measured simultaneously. It is therefore unknown whether systemic STS administration reduces the fraction of active platinum species (Table 5). Further research studies using sensitive ICP-MS approaches are needed to measure cisplatin levels in patients treated with and without STS.

### Aged garlic extract reduces blood pressure in hypertensives: a dose-response trial [^0a695ffc]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects one billion or one in four adults worldwide, and attributes to about 40% of cardiovascular-related deaths. Current medical treatment with standard antihypertensive medication is not always effective, leading to a large proportion of uncontrolled hypertension. In Australia, 24% or 3 million of the adult population remained uncontrolled hypertensive in 2003. In addition, side effects and complexity of treatment influence treatment adherence. As interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicines is high in patients with cardiovascular disease, there is a need to explore the integration of complementary and alternative medicine into the treatment of hypertension.

Garlic supplements have been associated with a blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of clinical significance in hypertensive patients. Although there are several garlic preparations on the market, including garlic powder, garlic oil and raw or cooked garlic, aged garlic extract is the preparation of choice for BP treatment. Aged garlic extract contains the active and stable component S -allylcysteine, which allows standardisation of dosage. In addition, aged garlic extract has a higher safety profile than other garlic preparations, and does not cause bleeding problems if taken with other blood-thinning medicines such as warfarin.

The antihypertensive properties of garlic have been linked to stimulation of intracellular nitric oxide and hydrogen sulphide production, and blockage of angiotensin II production, which in turn promote vasodilation and thus reduction in BP.,

Here we assess the effect, dose–response, tolerability and acceptability of different doses of aged garlic extract as an adjunct treatment to existing antihypertensive medication in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Sodium thiosulfate in acute Myocardial Infarction: a randomized clinical trial [^e1dd5841]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

In this proof-of-principle trial, the hypothesis was investigated that sodium thiosulfate (STS), a potent antioxidant and hydrogen sulfide donor, reduces reperfusion injury. A total of 373 patients presenting with a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction received either 12.5 g STS intravenously or matching placebo at arrival at the hospital and 6 hours later. The primary outcome, infarct size, measured by cardiac magnetic resonance at 4 months after randomization, did not differ between the treatment arms. Secondary outcomes were comparable as well, suggesting no clinical benefit of STS in this population at relatively low risk for large infarction.

All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the representative images are shown

Bacterial infections pose a considerable threat to public health as many pathogenic bacteria readily develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and form biofilms with additional protection from antibiotic treatment. Therefore, it is urgently required to develop new antibacterial agents. Here we develop an approach to convert natural organosulfur compounds into nanometer-sized iron sulfides (nFeS). We find that compared with organosulfur compounds, the nFeS exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity to pathogenic bacteria with drug resistance or associated with biofilms.

### Positive reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate in patch test panels (TRUE test) in Japan: a multicentre study [^55552835]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding the positive reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate observed > 1 week after application of the patch test in the 4 cases presented, the attending physician diagnosed case 2 as active sensitization, and cases 1 and 3 as suspected active sensitization. In case 4, erythema with infiltration was seen on D2 and D3, and there was no sensitization from patch testing. There was also an interesting feature whereby the reaction disappeared by D7 and was followed by a flare‐up granulomatous reaction 3 months later. If, in the repeat patch test, a concentration 10–100 times lower than that in the first patch test elicits a positive reaction within 1 week, active sensitization by the patch test is usually suspected. 7 We did not perform the re‐patch test in the 3 aforementioned cases with lower concentrations. As they showed positive reactions from D2 in the repeat patch test, we still suspect that their late reactions represented active sensitization. Generally, no consensus has been reached, and patch testing with gold is still being debated overseas, including the association between positive reactions and clinical symptoms. 11

In conclusion, further detailed investigation is necessary to determine whether the observed positive reactions are late reactions in pre‐sensitized individuals or active sensitization by patch tests. Gold sodium thiosulfate often gives a positive reaction after 2 to 3 weeks, and, in such cases, the positive reaction may be sustained. Therefore, assessment is recommended up to 1 month after application. The association between positive gold sodium thiosulfate reactions and clinical symptoms is an important issue, and will be investigated in the future.

### Reactive sulfur species: a new redox player in cardiovascular pathophysiology [^8811f838]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Works from the Akaike Laboratory have shown that the enzyme CARS, which generates cysteine persulfides, can regulate cellular functions including mitochondria function and bioenergetics. Activation of TRPA1 in rat astrocytes has been induced by polysulfide donors more effectively than exogenous H 2 S donors. Similarly, induction of Keap1/Nrf2 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) activation has been observed in neuronal cells by polysulfide donors. – Moreover, garlic-derived polysulfides have long been well known to possess antitumor effects. However, further study is needed to elucidate the antitumor mechanisms of inorganic polysulfides and to differentiate their role from exogenous H 2 S. Lastly, recent work from Zhang et alhas observed that cellular polysulfides may play a role in the regulation of inflammatory signaling and can be a potential target for inflammatory disorders. This group demonstrated that polysulfides desensitize macrophages to TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and negatively regulate TLR4-mediated proinflammatory signaling. However, these observations require further study in CVD and inflammatory model systems.

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Nithiodote) [^0f9e3291]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cyanide is an extremely toxic poison. In the absence of rapid and adequate treatment, exposure to a high dose of cyanide can result in death within minutes due to the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase resulting in arrest of cellular respiration. Specifically, cyanide binds rapidly with cytochrome a3, a component of the cytochrome c oxidase complex in mitochondria. Inhibition of cytochrome a3 prevents the cell from using oxygen and forces anaerobic metabolism, resulting in lactate production, cellular hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. In massive acute cyanide poisoning, the mechanism of toxicity may involve other enzyme systems as well. Signs and symptoms of acute systemic cyanide poisoning may develop rapidly within minutes, depending on the route and extent of cyanide exposure.

The synergy resulting from treatment of cyanide poisoning with the combination of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate is the result of differences in their primary mechanisms of action as antidotes for cyanide poisoning.

Sodium Nitrite

Sodium nitrite is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by reacting with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, an oxidized form of hemoglobin incapable of oxygen transport but with high affinity for cyanide. Cyanide preferentially binds to methemoglobin over cytochrome a3, forming the nontoxic cyanomethemoglobin. Methemoglobin displaces cyanide from cytochrome oxidase, allowing resumption of aerobic metabolism. The chemical reaction is as follows:

NaNO2+ Hemoglobin → Methemoglobin

HCN + Methemoglobin → Cyanomethemoglobin

Vasodilation has also been cited to account for at least part of the therapeutic effect of sodium nitrite. It has been suggested that sodium nitrite-induced methemoglobinemia may be more efficacious against cyanide poisoning than comparable levels of methemoglobinemia induced by other oxidants. Also, sodium nitrite appears to retain some efficacy even when the formation of methemoglobin is inhibited by methylene blue.

Sodium Thiosulfate

The primary route of endogenous cyanide detoxification is by enzymatic transulfuration to thiocyanate (SCN-), which is relatively nontoxic and readily excreted in the urine. Sodium thiosulfate is thought to serve as a sulfur donor in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme rhodanese, thus enhancing the endogenous detoxification of cyanide in the following chemical reaction:

### Sodium thiosulfate in acute Myocardial Infarction: a randomized clinical trial [^96f062d0]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Myocardial infarction is a common cause of disability and death worldwide. Infarct size is the major determinant for the future development of heart failure and reduced life expectancy. Major progress has been made to limit infarct size, mainly by thrombolysis and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in combination with antiplatelet therapy. Despite this progress, death rate, heart failure, and recurrent cardiac events continue to remain substantial in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.

Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium can paradoxically induce myocardial injury, and experimental data suggest that this injury can contribute up to 50% of the final myocardial infarct size. Myocardial reperfusion injury is a therapeutic target for which currently no effective treatment exists, and the search for an effective therapy is ongoing.,

Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound with vasoactive properties. Moreover, as a donor of the physiological gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), it might also exert additional H 2 S-related beneficial effects, including the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, vasodilatation, activation of antiapoptotic and antioxidant pathways, and anti-inflammatory effects. STS is clinically used for the treatment of acute cyanide poisoning, calciphylaxis, carbon monoxide toxicity, and cisplatin toxicities in cancer therapy. H 2 S donating compounds, including STS, have also been successful in reducing reperfusion injury in a wide variety of preclinical models. In an earlier dose-escalation pilot study, we demonstrated that STS was well tolerated in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI.

In this proof-of-principle trial, we tested the hypothesis that STS treatment reduces infarct size in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer NITHIODOTE without delay.
Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions. Administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies. Airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, and oxygen administration should not be delayed in order to administer sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The expert advice of a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1-800-222-1222.

Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning

Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of NITHIODOTE, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

Carcinogenesis

Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of sodium thiosulfate.

Mutagenesis:

The mutagenic potential of sodium thiosulfate has been examined in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames Assay). Sodium thiosulfate was not mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA537, or TA1538. Sodium thiosulfate was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in strains TA 98, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538 or E. coli strain WP2.

Sodium thiosulfate was negative for clastogenic potential in the in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus assay in rats.

Impairment of Fertility:

The role of gold in allergic contact dermatitis is poorly understood and is a subject of increasing interest. Recent studies demonstrate that gold-positive patch testing is not uncommon, but persistent patch test reactions are rarely reported. We present a case of a 53-year-old woman with a 7-year history of a scattered, pruritic papular dermatitis. Patch testing demonstrated a persistent, positive reaction to gold sodium thiosulfate. The histopathology of the patch test site and that of the cutaneous eruption were similar in nature but differing in severity. No other allergens have been identified, but gold avoidance has not yet resulted in the clearing of her eruption. This case underscores the difficulty in making a clinical correlation despite suggestive clinical pathologic evidence.

### Positive reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate in patch test panels (TRUE test) in Japan: a multicentre study [^60acb900]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

Sensitization is one of the complications of patch testing. According to textbooks on contact dermatitis, such as Fisher's Contact Dermatitis 6th edition 9 and Contact Dermatitis 5th edition, 10 sensitization by patch testing is characterized by no reaction until D7, a flare‐up response on D10 to D14, and, at repeat patch testing, a positive reaction on D2 to D4. Considering this definition, cases 1, 2 and 3 showed negative reaction up to D7 of the initial patch test, with a flare‐up afterwards, and then had positive reactions in re‐patch testing from D2. Thus, it is considered that sensitization was caused by patch testing with gold sodium thiosulfate in each of these cases.

On the other hand, Bruze et al 7 patch tested serial dilutions of gold sodium thiosulfate in 10 known cases of gold allergy. At lower concentrations, a positive reaction occurred only 1 week after application. It has also been reported that gold sodium thiosulfate is an exception to the general textbook rule mentioned above. 9 Positive test reactions up to 3 weeks after application do not represent active sensitization. In the present study, positive reactions to both A‐GST and P‐GST were seen in 17 cases on D3, and in 22 cases on D7 (Tables 1 and 2). Positive reactions to A‐GST on D3 were seen in 18 cases, increasing to 24 cases on D7 (Table 4). Also, positive reactions to P‐GST occurred in 88 cases on D3, decreasing to 59 cases on D7. Conversely, 7 cases with a ?+ or − reaction on D3 showed positive reactions on D7 (Table 3). Therefore, in the patch test for gold sodium thiosulfate, it is essential to perform readings until D7.

### Sodium thiosulfate (Pedmark) [^4a58b357]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of thiosulfate was assessed in pediatric patients. At the recommended dosage, the mean (± SD) maximum concentration (Cmax) was 13 ± 1.2 mM. The Cmaxof thiosulfate increased proportionally to dose over the range of 4 g/m2to 20 g/m2. No accumulation of thiosulfate is expected following administration of PEDMARK on two consecutive days.

Distribution

Sodium thiosulfate does not bind to human plasma proteins. Sodium thiosulfate is an inorganic salt and thiosulfate anions do not readily cross cell membranes. The mean volume of distribution of thiosulfate is 0.23 L/kg.

Elimination

The mean half-life (t1/2) of thiosulfate is approximately 20 minutes to 50 minutes. The mean total clearance of thiosulfate is 2.2 mL/min/kg in patients with fully developed renal function (age approximately 1 year). Renal clearance accounts for approximately 50% of total clearance in patients with fully developed renal function.

Metabolism

Thiosulfate is an endogenous intermediate product of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. Thiosulfate is metabolized through thiosulfate sulfur transferase and thiosulfate reductase to sulfite, which is oxidized to sulfate.

Excretion

After administration of sodium thiosulfate, approximately 50% of the administered sodium thiosulfate was excreted unchanged in urine and > 95% of the dose excreted in urine occurs within the first 4 hours after administration.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

Thiosulfate Cmaxincreased approximately 25% and AUC increased approximately 2-fold in subjects on hemodialysis (GFR 0 to 6 mL/min/1.72 m2, estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation) compared to subjects with normal renal function (GFR > 70 mL/min/1.72 m2, MDRD).

Drug Interaction Studies

In Vitro Studies

Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Sodium thiosulfate is an inducer of CYP2B6 but not of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. Sodium thiosulfate is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations.

### Antiproliferative effects of S-allylmercaptocysteine on colon cancer cells when tested alone or in combination with sulindac sulfide [^4729c919]. Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies link increased garlic (Allium sativum) consumption with a reduced incidence of colon cancer in various human populations. Experimental carcinogenesis studies in animal models and in cell culture systems indicate that several allium-derived compounds exhibit inhibitory effects and that the underlying mechanisms may involve both the initiation and promotion phases of carcinogenesis. To provide a better understanding of the effects of allium derivatives on the prevention of colon cancer, we examined two water-soluble derivatives of garlic, S-allylcysteine (SAC) and S-allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC), for their effects on proliferation and cell cycle progression in two human colon cancer cell lines, SW-480 and HT-29. For comparison, we included the compound sulindac sulfide (SS), because sulindac compounds are well-established colon cancer chemopreventive agents. We found that SAMC, but not SAC, inhibited the growth of both cell lines at doses similar to that of SS. SAMC also induced apoptosis, and this was associated with an increase in caspase3-like activity. These affects of SAMC were accompanied by induction of jun kinase activity and a marked increase in endogenous levels of reduced glutathione. Although SS caused inhibition of cell cycle progression from G1 to S, SAMC inhibited progression at G2-M, and a fraction of the SW-480 and HT-29 cells were specifically arrested in mitosis. Coadministration of SS with SAMC enhanced the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of SS. These findings suggest that SAMC may be useful in colon cancer prevention when used alone or in combination with SS or other chemopreventive agents.

### Positive reactions to gold sodium thiosulfate in patch test panels (TRUE test) in Japan: a multicentre study [^a9082d12]. Contact Dermatitis (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Allergic reactions to metallic gold are thought to be extremely rare, although they have been reported since the 1960s. 4 However, in the 1990s, many cases of gold sensitization were reported, including a few reports of allergic contact dermatitis caused by gold. There are several gold patch test preparations, including gold sodium thiosulfate, chloroauric acid, and gold sodium thiomalate. From the perspective of irritancy, false‐positive reactions and the persistence of positive reactions, gold sodium thiosulfate in pet. is a recommended patch test preparation 5 and is widely used.

In Japan, Aihara 6 reported an evaluation of gold sodium thiosulfate (1%, 0.5%, and 0.25%), gold acid chloride trihydrate (0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.1%), and gold acid chloride tetrahydrate (0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.1%), all in pet. As optimum gold patch test preparation, gold sodium thiosulfate 0.5% pet. was identified. Furthermore, Bruze et al 7 reported that false‐negative reactions are more frequent with gold sodium thiosulfate 0.5% pet. and that gold sodium thiosulfate 2% pet. is more sensitive in gold‐sensitized humans. Nevertheless, in Japan, there have been no further studies on the optimal concentration of gold sodium thiosulfate for testing since the report by Aihara. 6 Because the TRUE Test and P‐GST do not use pet. as a vehicle, investigations concerning the optimal concentration were performed on gold‐sensitized individuals. 8 In that study, the concentration of gold sodium thiosulfate was set to be equivalent to 2% pet. so it is conceivable that P‐GST showed a higher yield of positive reactions than A‐GST 0.5% pet.

### Sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of calcific uremic arteriolopathy [^a522adda]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA; also known as calciphylaxis) is a life-threatening condition observed mostly in patients on dialysis. The key histopathologic features of CUA include media calcification of small arteries, associated with endovascular fibrosis and thrombosis. Several risk factors for CUA are related to disturbances in bone and mineral metabolism; current treatments largely aim to normalize these disturbances by lowering serum calcium phosphate concentration and thereby preventing, or even reversing, calcium phosphate oversaturation, precipitation and, finally, calcification. Administration of sodium thiosulfate, which sequesters calcium ions to form highly soluble calcium thiosulfate complexes, can prevent calcium phosphate precipitation. As randomized controlled studies on sodium thiosulfate are lacking, this Perspectives article focuses on case reports and case series; in these reports the compound seemed to be effective and was not associated with serious short-term adverse events. Large clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of sodium thiosulfate are clearly warranted.

### Association of sodium thiosulfate with risk of ototoxic effects from platinum-based chemotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^750e1ed0]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Evidence of Outcomes Associated With STS

Studies have illustrated the theoretical mechanism of STS. First, STS is a free-radical scavenger. When free radicals are produced by cisplatin toxic effects, they easily turn into ROS (eg, H 2 O 2) at an extremely rapid rate, and STS directly reduces ROS. Second, STS binds to platinum and creates a biologically inactive complex. By eliminating free radicals produced by platinum toxic effects and inhibiting the outcome by binding platinum via covalent bonds, STS achieves an otoprotective outcome.

Association of STS With Survival

Despite the otoprotection associated with STS, the attenuation outcome associated with forming covalent bonds raises another concern: systemic STS would substantially decrease the antineoplastic outcome associated with platinum. An in vitro studyfound that the delivery timing of STS matters in the antineoplastic efficacy of platinum and the otoprotective outcome of STS, given that STS may neutralize more platinum agent with greater persistence in the body. In pooled estimates of 2 studies, that administered STS 6 hours after cisplatin infusion in our study, there was no statistically significant difference in event-free survival or overall survival.

### Severe anion gap acidosis associated with intravenous sodium thiosulfate administration [^e348efe4]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe anion gap (AG) acidosis associated with intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) administration has not been previously described in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.

Case Report

We present a CKD patient with a baseline creatinine 1.8 mg/dL (eGFR 28 ml/min/1.73 m²) who developed sustained and life-threatening AG acidosis associated with intravenous STS treatment for calciphylaxis.

Discussion

Although marketed as a safe drug, STS can cause life-threatening acidosis as illustrated in this case. STS-induced AG acidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe acidosis in patients receiving STS. Dosage adjustment and close follow-up of patients' acid-base status after STS initiation is necessary.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of sodium thiosulfate in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cyanide and thiocyanate (which is formed when sodium thiosulfate combines with cyanide) are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Sodium Thiosulfate Injection. There are no data to determine when breastfeeding may be safely restarted following the administration of Sodium Thiosulfate Injection.

8.4 Pediatric Use

There are case reports in the medical literature of sodium nitrite in conjunction with sodium thiosulfate being administered to pediatric patients with cyanide poisoning; however, there have been no clinical studies to evaluate the safety or efficacy of sodium thiosulfate in the pediatric population. As for adult patients, dosing recommendations for pediatric patients have been based on theoretical calculations of antidote detoxifying potential, extrapolation from animal experiments, and a small number of human case reports.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Sodium thiosulfate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Disease

Sodium thiosulfate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Thiosulfate mediates cytoprotective effects of hydrogen sulfide against neuronal ischemia [^c0b04bf8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is produced by several enzymes in diverse tissues. H 2 S has a prominent role in vasorelaxation, neurotransmission, and inflammation. A number of studies suggest that H 2 S attenuates ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury in a variety of organs including brain, whether it is endogenously produced or exogenously administered as H 2 S gas or donor compounds. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Along these lines, we reported that administration of Na 2 S or cardiomyocyte‐specific overexpression of cystathionine gamma lyase, an enzyme that produces H 2 S, prevents neuronal death and improves long‐term neurological outcomes and survival after cardiac arrest in mice. 4, 7 In a recent study, we also found that a novel H 2 S‐releasing compound improves outcomes after global cerebral I/R. 5 Nevertheless, mechanisms responsible for the cytoprotective effects of H 2 S remain incompletely defined. In particular, how biological effects of H 2 S are transported to the brain is largely unknown.

### Herbalism in wound care: a case of garlic burn [^f79805cd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite its widespread and multicultural use as a natural remedy, garlic (Allium sativum) is known to cause a multitude of dermatoses, including but not limited to irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, pemphigus, and systemic allergic contact dermatitis. The severity and type of cutaneous reaction elicited by garlic is largely based on method of use. For our purposes, we will concentrate on pathology resulting from topical garlic use rather than ingestion. True contact allergy to garlic is uncommon and mostly manifests as occupational hand dermatitis in cooks. The antigenic response is primarily induced by two protein sensitizers; allicin and diallyl disulfide, which elicit types I and IV hypersensitivity reactions, respectively, or a hybrid of the two. Diagnosis is made via a thorough clinical history inclusive of hobbies and occupation, as adjunct to patch testing with diallyl sulfide. Grinding, slicing, or emulsifying garlic releases the aforementioned sensitizers. If applied directly to skin in this form, irritant contact dermatitis can occur and manifest as superficial skin necrosis, acantholysis, and vesiculation.

### Hydrogen sulfide-based therapeutics: exploiting a unique but ubiquitous gasotransmitter [^1a3b1cce]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has become recognized as an important signalling molecule throughout the body, contributing to many physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, improved methods for measuring H2S levels and the availability of a wider range of H2S donors and more selective inhibitors of H2S synthesis have helped to more accurately identify the many biological effects of this highly reactive gaseous mediator. Animal studies of several H2S-releasing drugs have demonstrated considerable promise for the safe treatment of a wide range of disorders. Several such drugs are now in clinical trials.

### Converting organosulfur compounds to inorganic polysulfides against resistant bacterial infections [^86666302]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We then investigated the correlation between nFeS formation and the amount of added organosulfur compound. We chose cysteine as a standard molecule because it is a general precusor for many natural organosulfur compounds. In addition, compared to garlic-derived organosulfides (e.g. DADS or DATS) (Supplementary Fig. 4), cysteine is odorless, soluble in many solvents, thus it is more suitable for both solvothermal conversion and antibacterial testing. Cysteine was added to the solvothermal reaction (total volume was 50 mL) in various amounts of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 g (the products are denoted Cys 0.1 -nFeS, Cys 0.25 -nFeS, Cys 0.5 -nFeS, Cys 0.75 -nFeS, and Cys 1.0 -nFeS, respectively). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, the formation of nFeS was dependent on the amount of cysteine added to the solvothermal reaction. Consequently, the atomic ratio of sulfide to iron increased from Cys 0.1 -nFeS to Cys 1.0 -nFeS, in which the ratio of Fe/S was up to 48.75/51.25, while that for oxygen to iron decreased correspondingly (Supplementary Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 1). The Cys 1.0 -nFeS product only contained nanosheets and hexagonal structures whereas Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles were present in the Cys 0.5 -nFeS product. Simultaneously, with increasing concentrations of cysteine in the reaction, the degree of magnetism in the nFeS products decreased. The Cys 1.0 -nFeS product exhibited much lower levels of magnetism compared to the Cys 0.5 -nFeS product (Supplementary Fig. 6b). It is well established that while the metastable Fe 3 S 4 phase exhibits paramagnetism, the stable Fe 1- x S phase fails to exhibit magnetism. Thus, the formation of Fe 1- x S may be dominant when sufficient amounts of organosulfur are present in the solvothermal reaction (Fig. 1e). Taken together, adding natural organosulfur compounds to the solvothermal process led to the formation of nFeS, and the type and amount of added organosulfur compounds determined the crystalline phase and nanostructure of nFeS products.

### Garlic burn injuries-a systematic review of reported cases [^fe6efe70]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Medicinal plants have many beneficial effects on human health. Garlic (Allium sativum, Alliaceae) is one of the most famous herbal species, used for various diseases and conditions. Unfortunately, garlic is also associated with adverse effects, including cutaneous manifestations. In this review, burn injuries caused by application of raw garlic are reported. Searching through PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate, a total of 32 articles with 39 patients were found. Demographics of patients, reasons for garlic use, details on garlic application, as well as description of burns and its treatment are thoroughly described and discussed. In most of the cases, garlic caused second-degree burns, although some circumstances can cause formation of necrotic tissue. Various body parts were affected, legs being most common. The chemistry of garlic is also presented, with focus on volatile organic sulfur compounds, which also seem to be responsible for burns formation. Treatment of garlic burns was mainly symptomatic, and various types of drugs were used. Although not commonly expected, garlic should be taken into consideration as causative agents of burns by treating doctors, and patients should be advised against application of fresh garlic onto skin and mucosa.

### Aged garlic extract reduces blood pressure in hypertensives: a dose-response trial [^045bfd50]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background/objectives:

Hypertension affects about 30% of adults worldwide. Garlic has blood pressure-lowering properties and the mechanism of action is biologically plausible. Our trial assessed the effect, dose–response, tolerability and acceptability of different doses of aged garlic extract as an adjunct treatment to existing antihypertensive medication in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

Subjects/methods:

A total of 79 general practice patients with uncontrolled systolic hypertension participated in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled dose–response trial of 12 weeks. Participants were allocated to one of three garlic groups with either of one, two or four capsules daily of aged garlic extract (240/480/960 mg containing 0.6/1.2/2.4 mg of S -allylcysteine) or placebo. Blood pressure was assessed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks and compared with baseline using a mixed-model approach. Tolerability was monitored throughout the trial and acceptability was assessed at 12 weeks by questionnaire.

Results:

Mean systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by 11.8 ± 5.4 mm Hg in the garlic-2-capsule group over 12 weeks compared with placebo (P = 0.006), and reached borderline significant reduction in the garlic-4-capsule group at 8 weeks (−7.4 ± 4.1 mm Hg, P = 0.07). Changes in systolic blood pressure in the garlic-1-capsule group and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different to placebo. Tolerability, compliance and acceptability were high in all garlic groups (93%) and highest in the groups taking one or two capsules daily.

Conclusions:

Our trial suggests aged garlic extract to be an effective and tolerable treatment in uncontrolled hypertension, and may be considered as a safe adjunct treatment to conventional antihypertensive therapy.

### A novel treatment for ulcerative calcinosis cutis [^1a870267]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Calcinosis cutis is a term used to describe a group of disorders which result in calcium deposits in the skin. These disorders can be separated based on etiology.

Objective and Methods

Sodium thiosulfate has been used to systemically treat calciphylaxis with little to no adverse effects. We report two cases of ulcerative calcinosis cutis which were refractory to multiple topical treatments and did not improve with correction of underlying electrolyte abnormalities.

Results

Both cases showed an excellent response to topical 25% sodium thiosulfate compounded in zinc oxide.

Limitations

We are limited by a small sample size (n = 2) in this case series.

Conclusions

We recommend topical sodium thiosulfate 25% as an alternative treatment for dystrophic calcinosis cutis.

### Use of sodium thiosulfate as an otoprotectant in patients with cancer treated with platinum compounds: a review of the literature [^1b36368f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of CIHL, it would be advantageous to reduce or, preferably, prevent this permanent toxicity as much as possible. Reducing the dose of cisplatin, or replacing it with another chemotherapeutic agent, requires randomized clinical trials to prove equal efficacy, otherwise this could negatively affect survival. The advent of preventative agents to reduce CIHL is clearly welcome.

The otoprotective effect of sodium thiosulfate (STS) has been explored across multiple studies over several decades, either via systemic or local administration. STS is thought to reduce cisplatin-induced toxicity by two mechanisms. First, STS can bind to cisplatin, leading to the formation of inactive cisplatin compounds. Second, STS enters cochlear cells via cotransporter-2, where it influences antioxidant enzymes. It elevates antioxidant glutathione levels inhibiting intracellular ROS formation induced by cisplatin. Systemic administration requires a sufficient amount of STS to cross the blood-labyrinth barrier to obtain a preventative effect. Local applications such as intratympanic and intracochlear injections, administering STS directly to the ear, are not the subject of this review.

Scientific evidence, alongside results from two randomized pediatric clinical trials, have recently led to marketing authorization for intravenously (IV) administered pediatric STS, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the UK Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA). Currently, this compound is licensed as a cisplatin otoprotectant, for children age 1 month or older, who have nonmetastatic solid tumors (neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, germ cell tumors, medulloblastoma, and other rare tumors), at a dose of 10–20 g/m 2 (dependent on body weight) administered over 15 minutes, 6 hours after the end of the cisplatin infusion.

A recent survey showed that North American health care providers consider CIHL to be a concerning toxicity. It is therefore important that all stakeholders are well informed on the use of STS. To date, an overview of all studies on STS is lacking. This review summarizes available literature (N = 31) on the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of systemic STS in the prevention of CIHL. The majority of this article pertains to cisplatin, although mention will be made of STS and carboplatin.

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Nithiodote) [^5284f040]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with NITHIODOTE has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with NITHIODOTE, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous (IV) line [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

2.2 Recommended Dosing

Sodium nitrite injection and sodium thiosulfate injection are administered by slow intravenous injection. They should be given as early as possible after a diagnosis of acute serious or life-threatening cyanide poisoning has been established. Sodium nitrite should be administered first, followed immediately by sodium thiosulfate. Blood pressure must be monitored during infusion in both adults and children. The rate of infusion should be decreased if significant hypotension is noted.

NOTE: If signs of poisoning reappear, repeat treatment using one-half the original dose of both sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.

In adult and pediatric patients with known anemia, it is recommended that the dosage of sodium nitrite should be reduced proportionately to the hemoglobin concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

### Treatment of cutaneous calciphylaxis with sodium thiosulfate: two case reports and a review of the literature [^e88c77da]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Cutaneous calciphylaxis is a potentially fatal condition characterized by calcium deposition in dermal arterioles and the subsequent development of livedo reticularis, plaques, and extremely painful ulcers. This condition may be present in up to 4% of end-stage renal disease patients. Several treatments, which mainly attempt to control calcium phosphate metabolism, are available for this condition. We describe two patients treated with sodium thiosulfate with good results. Moreover, we also performed a PubMed literature search of sodium thiosulfate treatment for calciphylaxis. We found 41 cases of which most (> 90%) presented a rapid and sustained resolution, indicating this drug is a very good candidate for the treatment of this condition.

### Use of sodium thiosulfate as an otoprotectant in patients with cancer treated with platinum compounds: a review of the literature [^6b0fb865]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

Hearing loss occurs in 50%-70% of children treated with cisplatin. Scientific efforts have led to the recent approval of a pediatric formula of intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) for otoprotection by the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority in the United Kingdom. To inform stakeholders regarding the clinical utility of STS, the current review summarizes available literature on the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of systemic STS to minimize cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL).

DESIGN

A comprehensive narrative review is presented.

RESULTS

Thirty-one articles were summarized. Overall, systemic STS effectively reduces CIHL in the preclinical and controlled clinical study settings, in both adults and children with cancer. The extent of CIHL reduction depends on the timing and dosing of STS in relation to cisplatin. Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that systemic STS may affect plasma platinum levels, but studies are inconclusive. Delayed systemic administration of STS, at 6 hours after the cisplatin infusion, does not affect cisplatin-induced inhibition of tumor growth or cellular cytotoxicity in the preclinical setting, nor affect cisplatin efficacy and survival in children with localized disease in the clinical setting.

CONCLUSION

Systemic administration of STS effectively reduces the development and degree of CIHL in both the preclinical and clinical settings. More studies are needed on the PK of STS and cisplatin drug combinations, the efficacy and safety of STS in patients with disseminated disease, and the ability of STS to prevent further deterioration of pre-established hearing loss.

Several factors should be taken into account to establish a clear connection between calciphylaxis and involvement of internal organs. Especially in the setting of end-stage renal disease, a complex pathophysiologic interplay needs to be further investigated in well-designed clinical studies with robust noninvasive markers. Until then, we can only rely on clinical findings, recognition of predisposing factors, tissue biopsies and Tc-99m bone scintigraphy findings to diagnose systemic calciphylaxis.

### Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis from extravasated phosphate-containing solution treated with topical sodium thiosulfate [^611664b9]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium thiosulfate, an intraparenchymal and intravascular calcium chelator, has been used effectively to treat calciphylaxis and recently been investigated as a treatment for CC. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate has limited efficacy and practicality, as its adverse effects necessitate closer monitoring. Intralesional sodium thiosulfate treatment has been found to be more effective at resolving CC lesions measuring < 2 cm but not > 2 cm, and injection site pain to an intrinsically painful lesion can result in discontinuation of therapy or necessitate analgesic coinjection.TST has been used to treat dystrophic calcification of plaques up to 3 cm × 4 cm with formulations ranging from 10% to 25% with no to minor adverse effects of redness and scaling. We proceeded with 25% TST rather than intravenous and intradermal therapy, given the practicality, large extent of the lesion, and that our patient was undergoing infusional chemotherapy. Our case demonstrates that 25% TST cream is an effective, well-tolerated, safe, and practical treatment modality for expedited resolution of large plaques of iatrogenic CC.

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Nithiodote) [^1cbf7caa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium thiosulfate

No malformations or evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity were noted when pregnant mice, rats, hamsters, or rabbits were administered oral doses of sodium thiosulfate of up to 550, 400, 400, or 580 mg/kg, respectively during organogenesis (0.2, 0.3, 0.26, and 0.9 times the human dose of 12.5 g/60 kg person for cyanide poisoning based on body surface area). Published studies suggest that treatment with sodium thiosulfate ameliorates the teratogenic effects of maternal cyanide poisoning in hamsters.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of sodium nitrite or sodium thiosulfate in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Cyanide and thiocyanate (which is formed when sodium thiosulfate combines with cyanide) are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NITHIODOTE. There are no data to determine when breastfeeding may be safely restarted following the administration of NITHIODOTE.

8.4 Pediatric Use

There are case reports in the medical literature of sodium nitrite in conjunction with sodium thiosulfate being administered to pediatric patients with cyanide poisoning; however, there have been no clinical studies to evaluate the safety or efficacy of sodium thiosulfate or sodium nitrite in the pediatric population. As for adult patients, dosing recommendations for pediatric patients have been based on theoretical calculations of antidote detoxifying potential, extrapolation from animal experiments, and a small number of human case reports.

Use Sodium nitrite with caution in patients less than 6 months of age because they may be at higher risk of developing severe methemoglobinemia compared to older children and adults. The presence of fetal hemoglobin, which is oxidized to methemoglobin more easily than adult hemoglobin, and lower methemoglobin reductase levels compared to older children and adults may contribute to risk.

Mortality attributed to sodium nitrite was reported following administration of an adult dose (300 mg IV followed by a second dose of 150 mg) to a 17-month old child [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions, (5), Adverse Reactions (6)]

### A review on ingested cyanide: risks, clinical presentation, diagnostics, and treatment challenges [^6edec550]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cyanide poisoning:

- **Definition**: Cyanide poisoning is a life-threatening toxicity resulting from exposure to cyanide ions, which inhibit cellular respiration by blocking mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, leading to rapid cellular hypoxia and metabolic failure.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cyanide binds to the ferric ion (Fe³⁺) in cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) within the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation and halting ATP production. This blockade forces cells into anaerobic metabolism, resulting in lactic acidosis and rapid energy failure. The toxic effects are rapid in onset and systemic, often leading to cardiovascular collapse, seizures, coma, and death if not promptly treated.
- **Epidemiology**: Cyanide poisoning is rare in the US, with 208 cases reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 2023.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include exposure to smoke from residential or industrial fires or fumes, occupational contact with cyanide-containing compounds (such as in mining, metallurgy, or chemical industries including textile, paper, and plastic manufacturing), ingestion of cyanogenic plants (such as bitter almonds, apricot or peach seeds, cassava roots, lima beans, bamboo shoots) or compounds, and intentional ingestion or inhalation in suicide or homicide attempts.
- **Disease course**: Onset of symptoms is often rapid, including headache, dizziness, confusion, dyspnea, nausea, and seizures, progressing to cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, and coma. Without immediate treatment, such as administration of hydroxocobalamin, sodium nitrite, or sodium thiosulfate, the condition may rapidly become fatal. Early recognition and prompt antidotal therapy are critical for survival and neurological recovery.

### Sodium metabisulfite as a contact allergen – an example of a rare chemical mechanism for protein modification [^03588997]. Contact Dermatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Skin-sensitizing chemicals that cause allergic contact dermatitis do so by reacting with self-proteins such that the modified structure becomes antigenic. The reaction chemistry involved is well characterized, but there are exceptions, such as the occasional allergen sodium metabisulfite.

Objectives

To identify the potential in cutaneo reaction chemistry of sodium metabisulfite.

Methods

The established protein reaction chemistry associated with aqueous sulfite chemistry was explored in the context of the protein modification stage in allergic contact dermatitis.

Results

A probable mechanism for the in cutaneo modification of proteins by sodium metabisulfite involves the sulfite di-anion, acting as a nucleophile towards electrophilic centres in proteins, which is a rare mechanism, as most known skin-sensitizing chemicals behave as electrophiles.

Conclusions

Sodium metabisulfite is an unusual but not infrequent contact allergen whose chemistry suggests a previously unrecognized protein modification mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by sulfite di-anions on target electrophilic centres in skin proteins. The chemical properties required for sensitization by nucleophilic attack on skin proteins are quite restrictive, so the domain of nucleophilic sensitizers is expected to be small. Thiourea derivatives are among the sensitizers likely to act by this mechanism.

### Association between lifestyle factors, vitamin and garlic supplementation, and gastric cancer outcomes: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^aa7c39f5]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Allyl sulfur compounds from garlic are effective against carcinogenesis by inhibiting the activation of carcinogens, modulating carcinogen metabolism, and inhibiting formation of DNA adducts with carcinogens, among other mechanisms. Alcohol produces harmful effects in the stomach, causing direct damage to DNAand inflammation. Although our study failed to find significant associations between alcohol intake and GC risk, alcohol intake may modify the effect of garlic supplementation, with the protective effect of garlic supplementation on GC mortality seen particularly among those who did not drink alcohol. Similarly, a 2019 case-control studyreported an interaction of garlic consumption with alcohol drinking on esophageal cancer in a population in China. Garlic supplementation may take effect by protecting gastric mucosa against damage and inflammatory response induced by alcohol, and the hypothesis was confirmed by animal studies. Furthermore, alteration of gastric microbiota has been observed in GC and gastric lesions, indicating microbial dysbiosis in gastric carcinogenesis. Considering that dysbiosis of microbiota could be induced by alcohol as well as garlic supplementation, it remains to be elucidated whether the exploration of microbial dysbiosis can help to explain the interaction between alcohol intake and garlic supplementation on GC risk.

A greater preventive effect of vitamin supplementation was seen among those with low fresh vegetable and fruit intake. The micronutrients from fruits and vegetables, such as selenium, beta carotene, and vitamin C, may contribute to the protective effect for gastric mucosa by anti-inflammatory damage. Vitamin C was also associated with decreased risk of GC in studies of high-risk, and general populations. Notably, in our population, the significant interaction was only seen for gastric lesion progression but not for GC incidence or mortality. The reason for this is unclear. However, during gastric carcinogenesis, the pH level in the stomach decreases initially but increases with gastric lesion progression when vitamin C, ie, ascorbic acid, is converted to the less-active form of dehydroascorbic acidwith weaker protection.

In addition to vitamin and garlic supplementation, 1-time H pylori treatment for 2 weeks was an intervention in the SIT. During gastric carcinogenesis, H pylori infection is recognized as playing a crucial role in the initial steps of carcinogenesis by causing enhanced inflammation and histological changes. Previous studies did not show evidence on the differential associations of H pylori infection with GC according to smoking, alcohol intake, and dietary factors. Indeed, we have reported that smoking and alcohol intake are associated with H pylori eradication failure. Therefore, we did not seek to examine interactions between H pylori treatment and major lifestyle factors in our study.

### Sodium azide poisoning: a narrative review [^774e770e]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment varied, depending on the scenario. Gastric lavage with or without activated charcoal may not be effective, because it is not known how long sodium azide, which is water soluble and generally ingested as a solution, would remain in the stomach, and it is unclear if azide actually binds to charcoal.

Since azide can cause profound hypotension, supportive care with vasopressors and large amounts of intravenous fluids is frequently needed. Two patients underwent hemodialysis, one of whom also received an intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain blood pressure. The former treatment may be useful, because NaN 3 is a small molecule (65 kDa).

Although both azide and cyanide inhibit cytochrome C oxidase, it seems unlikely that sodium thiosulfate, amyl nitrite, or sodium nitrite would be useful against azide poisoning. Sodium thiosulfate detoxifies cyanide by converting it to thiocyanate; it seems unlikely that sodium thiosulfate would react with azide. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite generate methemoglobin, which scavenges cyanide, but methemoglobin binds azide only weakly (log K observed = 5.427 at pH 7.02). Moreover, nitrites could be detrimental, because they generate nitric oxide, which could exacerbate azide-induced hypotension.

Hydroxocobalamin appears to be a reasonable treatment for azide poisoning, because cobalamin binds nitric oxide, and high doses of cobalamin raise blood pressure in control subjects, likely via reducing plasma nitric oxide concentrations. Thus, cobalamin could potentially raise the blood pressure in azide-poisoned hypotensive patients.

Limitations

While two-thirds of the sources we included were peer-reviewed, all but one paper were case reports, which are prone to publication bias and therefore limited generalizability. The single case-control study relied on a work-medical history questionnaire, which is susceptible to recall bias.

As in other reviews of clinical cases, we were limited by whether someone chose to publish a case and whether a diagnosis was made appropriately. The former is exemplified in Hirose et al. where data on only seven of 10 azide-poisoned victims were provided. The latter may be particularly problematic for azide poisoning, since it can be mistaken for cyanide poisoning due to mechanistic and symptomatic similarities. Taken together, the actual incidence of azide poisoning is likely to be greater than that reported. The cases reported in newspaper articles generally did not describe treatment strategies, limiting our ability to tie treatment to outcome.

### Eating garlic and onion: a matter of life or death [^f2f88448]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Experimental studies have shown that the chemopreventive activity of Allium vegetables is related to their content of organosulphur compounds (OSCs). Although how these compounds achieve chemoprevention is not fully understood, several modes of action have been proposed. These include: (i) effect on drug metabolising enzymes (i.e. induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, including glutathione transferases, quinine reductase, epoxide hydrolase and glucuronosyl transferase, that inactivate toxic substances and facilitate their excretion); (ii) antioxidant activity (garlic preparations exhibit radical scavenging activity and decrease lipid peroxidation, which is relevant in the light of the observation that tumour promotion may involve oxygen radicals); (iii) tumour growth inhibition that has been documented in several carcinoma cell lines, including prostate carcinoma cells; (iv) induction of apoptosis, which coincides with an increase in the percentage of cells blocked in the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle (possibly through a depression in p34 cdc2 kinase); and (v) effective stimulation of the immune response (OSCs stimulates proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophage phagocytosis, induce the infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in transplanted tumours, induce splenic hypertrophy, stimulate release of interleukin-2, tumour necrosis factor- α and interferon- γ, enhance natural killer cell, killer cell and lymphokine-activated killer cell activity).

In conclusion, promising data from clinical studies suggest that the regular consumption of garlic and onion may prevent prostate cancer. Allium -derived organosulphoric compounds may be responsible, at least in part, for the anticarcinogenic activity. The unique property of garlic and onion may be clinically important, because their daily intake for a prolonged period is expected to be free of risk.

### Thiosulfate mediates cytoprotective effects of hydrogen sulfide against neuronal ischemia [^8b0e065c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

It has been reported that STS increases thiosulfate levels in the brain, choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid. 33 We observed that the administration of Na 2 S or STS increased the intracellular levels of thiosulfate in cultured neurons as well as in brain tissues. However, the mechanism responsible for the ability of Na 2 S or STS to increase intracellular thiosulfate levels in the brain was unclear. Thiosulfate anion cannot easily pass across the cell membrane unless ion transporters or ion channels for thiosulfate exist on the cell membrane. Sodium/sulfate cotransporter 2 is a member of the SLC13 transporter protein family that mediates the intake of a wide variety of molecules including thiosulfate with the concomitant uptake of sodium ions. 16 We observed that knockdown of NaS‐2 markedly inhibited the accumulation of thiosulfate, but not sulfide, in SH‐SY5Y cells incubated with Na 2 S or STS and attenuated the cytoprotective effects of Na 2 S and STS after OGD/R. These observations unambiguously indicate that thiosulfate mediates the cytoprotective effects of H 2 S and thiosulfate. Furthermore, these results suggest that NaS‐2 plays an important role in neuroprotective effects of H 2 S or thiosulfate against cerebral I/R injury.

### Cysteine and hydrogen sulphide in the regulation of metabolism: insights from genetics and pharmacology [^a1725a2a]. The Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Figure 2
A model for cysteine and sulphide metabolism: bold capitals, enzymes discussed in this review; red arrows, chemical transformations; a red O 2 is indicated where oxygen is consumed; orange arrows, movement of sulphide to mitochondrial components; blue arrows, equilibrium of cysteine with protein and glutathione pools; green, main urinary excreted end products of sulphur metabolism; thiosulphate and polysulphide metabolism remain controversial and are indicated as such with question marks; not indicated is the fact that methionine and cysteine can enter the system as part of protein‐containing diets. It is hypothesized that the balance of dietary intake, and flux through these pathways, influences the steady state of cysteine and sulphide and thereby contributes to metabolic control of the cell

A number of distinct mechanisms of hydrogen sulphide action have been proposed for regulating cellular function. One mechanism of action is regulation of the anti‐oxidant status of cells. The low micromolar concentrations of endogenous hydrogen sulphide, compared to the millimolar concentrations of more established thiol antioxidants such as glutathione and cysteine (free and protein‐bound), suggest that hydrogen sulphide likely plays an indirect role in the antioxidant capacity of cells through its signalling functions 43. In an early study of this property, primary cortical neurons were protected from glutamate‐induced cell death by administration of 100 μM sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS), an inorganic source of hydrogen sulphide 44. In that study hydrogen sulphide increased cystine import and glutathione production. There is also emerging evidence that hydrogen sulphide interacts with nitric oxide signalling 45, 46. Hydrogen sulphide reacts with nitric oxide to form nitrosothiol, and in some circumstances may stimulate cGMP signalling as may nitric oxide. Endogenous production of nitrosothiol was also measured in that study, suggesting a physiological role for direct sulphide–nitric oxide reactions. Modification of proteins by sulphydration (or persulphidation) is a further mechanism by which hydrogen sulphide may alter protein function. This modification refers to the presence of an additional sulphur atom attached to a thiol, such as cysteine, essentially a persulphide group. Formation of persulphides through hydrogen sulphide requires either oxidation of the hydrogen sulphide prior to reaction with a thiol, or reaction of hydrogen sulphide with an already oxidized species, such as a disulphide group 47, 48, 49. Sulphydration modification regulates the activity of ATP sensitive potassium channels, other membrane ion channels, kinases and transcription factors 48, 49 to elicit diverse biological effects. A persulphide cysteine is a known intermediate of the mercaptopyruvate sulphurtransferase enzyme catalytic cycle 50, suggesting that persulphide formation may increase reactivity of other active site cysteines.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of acute cyanide poisoning [^db84040e]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to identify isolated acute cyanide poison cases and to identify reported signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Reviews, and Web of Science case reports and series using a number of MeSH descriptors pertaining to cyanide, toxicity, and poisonings. We excluded studies on plants, laboratory analyses, smoke inhalation poisonings, animals as well as non-English language articles and those in which data were not available. Data extracted included demographics, exposure characteristics, acute signs/symptoms, and medical management and outcome.

Results

From the initial 2976 articles retrieved, 65 articles (52 case reports, 13 case series) met inclusion criteria and described 102 patients. Most patients were unresponsive (78%), hypotensive (54%), or had respiratory failure (73%); other signs and symptoms included cardiac arrest (20%), seizures (20%), cyanosis (15%), cherry red skin (11%), and had an odor present (15%). Medical management included cyanide antidote kit (20%), sodium thiosulfate (40%), and hydroxocobalamin (29%). The majority of cases (66%) required intubation with mechanical ventilation and a substantial number (39%) developed refractory hypotension requiring vasopressor support.

Conclusions

Contrary to general reviews published on cyanide toxicity, reports of cherry red skin and bitter almond odor were rare among published cyanide cases. Consistent with other studies, metabolic acidosis with significant lactic acidosis were the laboratory values consistently associated with cyanide toxicity. Healthcare providers may overlook cyanide toxicity in the differential diagnosis, if certain expected characteristics, such as the odor of almonds or a cherry red color of the skin are absent on physical examination.

### Phylotranscriptomics reveals the phylogeny of asparagales and the evolution of allium flavor biosynthesis [^1ca5ba80]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The distinctive allium flavor is attributed to a wide variety of sulfur-containing compounds generated from S-Alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxides (CSOs) found in Allium, such as garlic and onions. Major CSOs, such as alliin and isoalliin, serve as primary sources of medicinal and flavor compounds in Allium species. The biosynthesis pathway for alliin and isoalliin originates from cysteine and involves at least seven steps. When garlic bulbs are crushed, alliin undergoes successive conversion into allicin through the action of the enzyme alliinase –. Comparative analyses using genomic data from three Allium species (garlic [A. sativum], green onion [A. fistulosum], and onion [A. cepa]), Arabidopsis thaliana, and ten monocot species have revealed an expansion of alliinase and lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS), specifically in the three Allium species. The study also revealed that LFS exists only in the three Allium species and is absent in others. This finding is supported by a recent studyin which the same three Allium species and 86 other species were used. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the alliinase, ATP-sulfurylase (ATPS), and O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL) expanded in Chinese chive (A. tuberosum). Allium includes more than 1000 species, and CSOs are natural products characteristic of the genus. It remains unclear whether these genes have widely expanded across Allium species. Additionally, although previous reviews hypothesized that CSOs exist in all Allium species, whether the CSOs biosynthesis pathway commonly exists in Allium species also remains uncertain.

### Sodium thiosulfate [^1fe39070]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Animal Data (Cyanide Poisoning)

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SODIUM THIOSULFATE AND SODIUM NITRITE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE CYANIDE POISONING HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN HUMANS IN ADEQUATE AND WELL-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS BECAUSE INDUCING THE CONDITION IN HUMANS TO STUDY THE DRUG'S EFFICACY IS NOT ETHICAL.

Due to the extreme toxicity of cyanide, experimental evaluation of treatment efficacy has predominantly been completed in animal models. The efficacy of sodium thiosulfate treatment alone to counteract the toxicity of cyanide was initially reported in 1895 by Lang. The efficacy of amyl nitrite treatment in cyanide poisoning of the dog model was first reported in 1888 by Pedigo. Further studies in the dog model, which demonstrated the utility of sodium nitrite as a therapeutic intervention, were reported in 1929 by Mladoveanu and Gheorghiu. However, Hugs and Chen et al. independently reported upon the superior efficacy of the combination of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate in 1932–1933. Treatment consisted of intravenously administered 22.5 mg/kg (half the lethal dose) sodium nitrite or 1 g/kg sodium thiosulfate alone or in sequence immediately after subcutaneous injection of sodium cyanide into dogs over a range of doses. Subsequent doses of 10 mg/kg sodium nitrite and/or 0.5 g/kg sodium thiosulfate were administered when clinical signs or symptoms of poisoning persisted or reappeared. Either therapy administered alone increased the dose of sodium cyanide required to cause death, and when administered together, sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate resulted in a synergistic effect in raising the lethal dose of sodium cyanide. The combined therapy appeared to have reduced efficacy when therapy was delayed until signs of poisoning (e.g. convulsions) appeared; however, other investigators have reported survival in dogs that were administered antidotal treatment after respiratory arrest had occurred.

Animal studies conducted in other species (e.g., rat, guinea pig, sheep, pigeon and cat) have also supported a synergistic effect of intravenous sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate in the treatment of cyanide poisoning.

While intravenous injection of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate was effective in reversing the effects of lethal doses of cyanide in dogs, intramuscular injection of sodium nitrite, with or without sodium thiosulfate, was found not to be effective in the same setting.

Regarding late reactions in terms of positive P‐GST reactions occurring after D7, 3 of the 588 patients (0.5%) reported a positive reaction occurring after D7 (Table 5: cases 1‐3). Moreover, we encountered an interesting case (case 4) with a + reaction to P‐GST on D2 and D3 that completely disappeared by D7, but flared up 3 months later. We present details of these 4 cases below.

3.2 Case reports

3.2.1 Case 1

A 40‐year‐old woman underwent patch testing for contact dermatitis of the face. She had no clinical symptoms associated with gold allergy, but had a metal dental implant. Initial patch testing with P‐GST showed an erythematous reaction (?+) on D3 that became negative on D7. However, a + reaction was observed at the same site after 1 month. Repeat patch testing 3 months after the first patch test showed a + P‐GST reaction starting on D2, whereas A‐GST applied at the same time showed a positive reaction on D7. The patient later had the gold‐palladium alloy dental implant removed, and reported that her facial dermatitis improved after removal. However, it was not possible to ascertain whether the dental metal was the actual cause of her symptoms, because she also showed a positive reaction to her hair conditioner, and had stopped using it after the patch test. She did not experience any symptoms of gold allergy after showing positive patch test reactions to gold preparations. Her late positive reaction to P‐GST was suspected to represent active sensitization.

### Sodium thiosulfate [^661020e7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Sodium Thiosulfate Injection has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with Sodium Thiosulfate Injection, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous (IV) line [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

2.2 Recommended Dosing

Sodium Nitrite Injection and Sodium Thiosulfate Injection are administered by slow intravenous injection. They should be given as early as possible after a diagnosis of acute life-threatening cyanide poisoning has been established. Sodium nitrite should be administered first, followed immediately by sodium thiosulfate. Blood pressure must be monitored during infusion in both adults and children. The rate of infusion should be decreased if significant hypotension is noted.

NOTE: If signs of poisoning reappear, repeat treatment using one-half the original dose of both sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.

In adult and pediatric patients with known anemia, it is recommended that the dosage of sodium nitrite should be reduced proportionately to the hemoglobin concentration.

Visually inspect all parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.

2.3 Recommended Monitoring

Patients should be monitored for at least 24–48 hours after Sodium Thiosulfate Injection administration for adequacy of oxygenation and perfusion and for recurrent signs and symptoms of cyanide toxicity. When possible, obtain hemoglobin/hematocrit when treatment is initiated. Measurements of oxygen saturation using standard pulse oximetry and calculated oxygen saturation values based on measured PO2are unreliable in the presence of methemoglobinemia.

2.4 Incompatibility Information

Chemical incompatibility has been reported between Sodium Thiosulfate Injection and hydroxocobalamin and these drugs should not be administered simultaneously through the same IV line. No chemical incompatibility has been reported between sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite, when administered sequentially through the same IV line as described in Dosage and Administration.

Simultaneous administration of Sodium Thiosulfate Injection and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, platelet concentrate and/or fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended. However, blood products and Sodium Thiosulfate Injection can be administered simultaneously using separate intravenous lines (preferably on contralateral extremities, if peripheral lines are being used).

### Thiosulfate mediates cytoprotective effects of hydrogen sulfide against neuronal ischemia [^e2874825]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) exhibits protective effects in various disease models including cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nonetheless, mechanisms and identity of molecules responsible for neuroprotective effects of H 2 S remain incompletely defined. In the current study, we observed that thiosulfate, an oxidation product of H 2 S, mediates protective effects of an H 2 S donor compound sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) against neuronal I/R injury.

Methods and Results

We observed that thiosulfate in cell culture medium is not only required but also sufficient to mediate cytoprotective effects of Na 2 S against oxygen glucose deprivation and reoxygenation of human neuroblastoma cell line (‐5Y) and murine primary cortical neurons. Systemic administration of sodium thiosulfate improved survival and neurological function of mice subjected to global cerebral I/R injury. Beneficial effects of, as well as Na 2 S, were associated with marked increase of thiosulfate, but not H 2 S, in plasma and brain tissues. These results suggest that thiosulfate is a circulating "carrier" molecule of beneficial effects of H 2 S. Protective effects of thiosulfate were associated with inhibition of caspase‐3 activity by persulfidation at Cys163 in caspase‐3. We discovered that an13 family protein, sodium sulfate cotransporter 2 (13A4, NaS‐2), facilitates transport of thiosulfate, but not sulfide, across the cell membrane, regulating intracellular concentrations and thus mediating cytoprotective effects of Na 2 S and.

Conclusions

The protective effects of H 2 S are mediated by thiosulfate that is transported across cell membrane by NaS‐2 and exerts antiapoptotic effects via persulfidation of caspase‐3. Given the established safety track record, thiosulfate may be therapeutic against ischemic brain injury.

### Sodium thiosulfate… [^621557f2]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular system: hypotension Central nervous system: headache, disorientation Gastrointestinal system: nausea, vomiting Hematological: prolonged bleeding time Body as a Whole: salty taste in mouth, warm sensation over body. In humans, rapid administration of concentrated solutions or solutions not freshly prepared, and administration of large doses of sodium thiosulfate have been associated with a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting. However, administration of 0. 1 g sodium thiosulfate per pound up to a maximum of 15 g in a 10–15% solution over 10–15 minutes was associated with nausea and vomiting in 7 of 26 patients without concomitant cyanide intoxication. Sodium Thiosulfate Injection is a cyanide antidote which contains one 50 mL glass vial containing a 25% solution of sodium thiosulfate injection. Sodium thiosulfate injection is a sterile aqueous solution and is intended for intravenous injection. Each vial contains 12.

5 grams of sodium thiosulfate in 50 mL solution. Each mL also contains 2. 8 mg boric acid and
4. 4 mg of potassium chloride. The pH of the solution is adjusted with boric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. Sodium thiosulfate injection is a clear solution with a pH between 7. 5 and 9.
0. Sodium Thiosulfate The primary route of endogenous cyanide detoxification is by enzymatic transulfuration to thiocyanate, which is relatively nontoxic and readily excreted in the urine. Sodium thiosulfate is thought to serve as a sulfur donor in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme rhodanese, thus enhancing the endogenous detoxification of cyanide in the following chemical reaction: The mutagenic potential of sodium thiosulfate has been examined in the in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay. Sodium thiosulfate was not mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA537, or TA1538.

Sodium thiosulfate was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in strains TA 98, TA1535, TA1537, TA1538 or E. coli strain WP2.
