## Question

physical exam tests for concussion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which physical examination tests can be used in sideline concussion screening to help establish the diagnosis of concussion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that no single test suffices and that a multimodal approach is required. Then, I should appraise the core domains and the diagnostic performance of their tools. Next, I will integrate these elements into the SCAT6/Child SCAT6 framework and clarify operational thresholds and removal-from-play decisions. After that, I need to examine the role of baseline and serial assessments, consider special populations like children and para athletes, and address practical implementation challenges. Finally, I will consolidate evidence-based recommendations and caveats to ensure we don't overstate what the tools can do relative to clinical judgment.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: no single sideline test is sufficient to diagnose or exclude concussion, and injury heterogeneity requires coverage of multiple domains, including symptoms, cognition, balance/vestibular function, and ocular motor performance. Wait, I should verify that this is consistently supported across high-credibility sources; yes, the 6th International Consensus endorses a multimodal approach and provides updated tools, while a prospective BJSM study shows variable performance across tests and a systematic review notes low overall strength of evidence for single instruments, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive battery rather than reliance on one element [^112bCcxq] [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1].

> I will now examine symptom assessment because it typically offers the highest diagnostic yield on the sideline. Let me verify the operating characteristics: in a prospective case-control cohort, a 3-point increase from baseline in symptom severity yielded 81–91% sensitivity with 81–94% specificity and an AUC around 0.95, which is excellent discrimination and supports symptom scales as the anchor of sideline screening. Hold on, I should confirm the exact thresholds; yes, a 3-point increase was optimal in that dataset, though thresholds should still be interpreted within context and with serial reassessment given symptom evolution over hours to days [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1].

> Next, I should review ocular motor screening with the King-Devick test. Let me check the numbers before drawing conclusions: sensitivity was about 85% with specificity near 76%, and time worsening from baseline is an abnormal result. This profile favors use as a sensitive adjunct to detect impairment that athletes may not spontaneously report, particularly because the test is rapid and portable for the sideline, though it should not be used in isolation to clear an athlete [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1].

> Now, balance assessment with the modified Balance Error Scoring System needs careful interpretation. I need to ensure I'm precise: the m-BESS shows lower sensitivity, around 40%, but higher specificity, around 92%, and an increase of about 5 errors from baseline suggests impairment, meaning a clearly abnormal m-BESS materially raises the likelihood of concussion even if its absence does not rule it out. Wait, let me verify the AUC for completeness; an AUC near 0.71 was reported, consistent with a specific rule-in tendency rather than high sensitivity [^113kzb49].

> Cognitive screening via SAC adds an essential domain despite modest standalone performance. I should double-check these figures: sensitivity approximately 44% and specificity about 72% with a 2-point decline from baseline as a pragmatic threshold, which means it contributes to the multimodal picture rather than serving as a solitary diagnostic gatekeeper. But wait, what if we apply this in children and adolescents; the CDC cautions against using SAC exclusively to diagnose pediatric mTBI, so in youth it must be embedded within a broader, age-appropriate battery with clinical judgment overriding any single score [^113kzb49] [^117KtR7E].

> I will now examine smooth pursuit tracking metrics like EYE-SYNC. Let me verify their discriminative ability: reported sensitivities were around 48–52% with specificities near 58–61%, which is suboptimal for primary sideline decision-making. Hold on, I should clarify the implication; these tools may still detect clinically meaningful oculomotor deficits and could be used as supplementary information, but they should not drive removal or clearance decisions by themselves on the sideline [^113kzb49] [^114y3REZ].

> Next, I should integrate these elements in the SCAT6/Child SCAT6 framework to ensure a systematic flow. Let me think about sequence: rapid red flag screening and observable signs, structured symptom evaluation, cognitive assessment, neurological screen, m-BESS for balance, and delayed recall allow serial sampling of multiple neural domains within a standardized toolset designed by the Amsterdam consensus process. Hold on, I should verify that CRT6 complements recognition and that SCOAT6 supports office follow-up; yes, these were updated in the 2022 process, emphasizing standardization across the acute and subacute continuum [^112bCcxq] [^112KMH7T].

> Now I need to set operational thresholds for sideline decision-making while being cautious about overstatement. Initially, I might say that a 3-point increase in symptom severity, any King-Devick slowing from baseline, a 5-error increase on m-BESS, or a 2-point SAC decline "establishes the diagnosis" of concussion. Wait, that is too strong; I should correct this to "triggers high suspicion, immediate removal from play, and structured clinical evaluation", because final diagnosis remains a clinical decision and normal results do not exclude concussion, especially early after injury when signs may be evolving. Let me ensure alignment with consensus: any positive element in a credible mechanism context warrants removal and conservative management pending further assessment and serial testing [^113kzb49] [^112bCcxq] [^116iiS8q].

> I should confirm the role of baseline testing and serial assessments because individual variability is high. Let me verify reliability metrics: King-Devick shows good test-retest reliability near ICC 0.71, m-BESS and SAC around 0.33, and symptom agreement is low at baseline, which paradoxically increases the clinical salience of post-injury changes from one's own baseline. Hold on, I need to emphasize serial reassessment; repeating elements, including delayed recall and symptoms at 5–10 minute intervals, often increases diagnostic yield, consistent with the concept that multimodal, multi-time evaluation improves accuracy over a single snapshot [^113kzb49] [^116iiS8q].

> But wait, what about pediatric athletes specifically; I should ensure we adapt tools and decisions for age. Child SCAT6 should be used for those 5–12 years, and clinicians should not use SAC exclusively to diagnose pediatric mTBI, instead combining age-appropriate cognitive testing, symptom tracking, and balance measures with careful counseling on return to school and activity that is gradually escalated based on tolerance and absence of symptom exacerbation. Let me verify the return guidance; the CDC advises stepwise return with close monitoring and individualized accommodations for academics and sport [^112bCcxq] [^117KtR7E] [^1161JYbm] [^116Bzuq7].

> I need to address para athletes because standard tools can be misleading in this group. Hold on, I should verify limits of validity; the CIPS position statements note that SCAT5/6 may not be fully valid and that individualized baselines and collateral history are especially important, such that a "normal" SCAT does not exclude concussion in para athletes and clinical context must dominate decision-making [^113zbRtq] [^117D6diX].

> Next, I should review implementation challenges so we don't assume ideal conditions on the sideline. Let me consider practicalities: proper administration requires trained healthcare professionals, the full SCAT6 can take 15–20 minutes, and environmental distractions can degrade test performance, which argues for structured protocols, training, and, when necessary, removal-for-evaluation policies that favor safety over speed. I should confirm that team physician guidance emphasizes serial assessments and a distraction-free environment where possible [^116iiS8q] [^114y3REZ].

> Red flag integration and return-to-play rules cannot be overlooked. I need to ensure I state this clearly: the presence of red flags mandates emergency evaluation, and any athlete with suspected concussion should be immediately removed from play, with no same-day return if concussion is confirmed; if no licensed provider is available, there is no same-day return even if symptoms appear to resolve. Wait, let me double-check that final diagnosis and disposition are explicitly designated as medical decisions; yes, clinical judgment is paramount and overrides any single tool result [^112bCcxq] [^116iiS8q].

> To conclude and tie this together, the critical elements of sideline concussion screening comprise a multimodal assessment across symptoms, cognition, balance, and ocular motor function, organized within SCAT6/Child SCAT6 to standardize sequence and facilitate serial reassessment. Let me reiterate the practical rule: any deterioration from individual baseline in one or more domains in the context of a plausible mechanism should trigger removal from play, red flag screening, and a structured clinical evaluation, while recognizing that normal initial testing does not exclude concussion and that final diagnosis rests on clinical synthesis rather than a single score. I should confirm that this conclusion aligns with the contemporary evidence base combining prospective accuracy data, consensus tools, and systematic reviews [^112bCcxq] [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1].

Physical exam tests for concussion include a **multidomain assessment** of symptoms, cognition, balance, oculomotor/vestibular function, and cervical spine [^112SaQBK]. The SCAT6/Child SCAT6 are the standard tools for sideline and office use [^112bCcxq], with the King-Devick test providing additional oculomotor data [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1]. No single test is definitive [^11537mX9]; a **multimodal approach** improves diagnostic accuracy and guides safe return-to-play decisions [^112TypB1] [^111sWRmp] [^1179xhUJ].

---

## Symptom assessment

Symptom checklists in **SCAT6/Child SCAT6** document headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms [^112bCcxq]. Also screen for **red flag symptoms** — severe headache, repeated vomiting, worsening confusion, seizures, focal deficits, or declining consciousness — which require urgent evaluation [^117D9WHM] [^112VqMDY] [^111jTkta].

---

## Cognitive assessment

The **Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC)** briefly assesses orientation, immediate memory, concentration, and delayed recall; it is included in SCAT6 [^111jTkta] [^112bCcxq]. Neurocognitive testing tools such as **ImPACT** assess attention, memory, processing speed, and reaction time [^1137rUGV] [^1124gYoL]; these tools are useful for tracking recovery but not for initial diagnosis [^115BtFiY].

---

## Balance and postural stability assessment

- **Balance error scoring system (BESS)**: Evaluates postural stability in double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stances on firm and foam surfaces; included in SCAT6 [^1115awNj] [^112bCcxq] [^111jTkta].

- **Modified BESS (m-BESS)**: Sideline-friendly version with three stances on firm ground [^11537mX9] [^113kzb49].

- **Romberg test**: Assesses proprioceptive and vestibular function with eyes closed [^112SaQBK].

---

## Oculomotor and vestibular assessment

- **Vestibular/ocular motor screening (VOMS)**: Assesses smooth pursuit, saccades, convergence, vestibulo-ocular reflex, and visual motion sensitivity; detects common concussion-related deficits [^11687uGt] [^114y3REZ].

- **King-Devick test**: Rapid number-naming test for saccadic eye movements and attention [^113kzb49]; moderate sensitivity and specificity [^1179xhUJ].

- **Near point of convergence (NPC)**: Measures convergence distance; abnormal (> 5 cm) is common after concussion [^114y3REZ] [^113TW69m].

---

## Cervical spine assessment

Cervical range of motion and palpation assess pain, tenderness, or **limited range of motion** that may contribute to symptoms [^112KBEQW]. Spurling's test screens for **cervical radiculopathy**, which can mimic or exacerbate concussion symptoms [^11687uGt].

---

## Reliability and validity of physical exam tests

| **Metric** | **Symptom checklist** | **SAC** | **BESS** | **King-devick** | **VOMS** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | High (81–91%) | Moderate (44%) | Moderate (40%) | Moderate (85%) | Moderate |
| Specificity | Moderate (81–94%) | Moderate (72%) | High (92%) | Moderate (76%) | Moderate |
| Reliability | High | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate |

---

Multimodal assessment — combining tests — improves **diagnostic accuracy** and reduces false negatives [^112TypB1] [^111sWRmp] [^1179xhUJ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Subjectivity in **symptom reporting** and cognitive testing can be influenced by effort, motivation, and baseline variability [^11537mX9]. Environmental factors such as noise, distractions, and fatigue can impair balance and cognitive performance [^11537mX9]. No single definitive test exists; diagnosis relies on clinical judgment and multiple complementary tests [^112TypB1] [^112bCcxq] [^115BtFiY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **SCAT6/Child SCAT6**: Standardized tools for sideline and office assessment [^112bCcxq] [^112KMH7T].

- **Immediate removal from play**: Athletes with suspected concussion should not return the same day [^116iiS8q] [^112bCcxq].

- **Gradual return-to-play**: Stepwise progression after symptom resolution and normal exam findings [^1161JYbm] [^117SD9yo] [^114aDJFH].

---

Physical exam tests for concussion span symptoms, cognition, balance, oculomotor/vestibular function, and cervical spine; a **multimodal approach** is essential for accurate diagnosis and safe return-to-play decisions [^114U6mAc].

### Diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion evaluation: a prospective, case-controlled study in college athletes comparing newer tools and established tests [^113kzb49]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion tests in college athletes. Athletes completed baseline concussion tests including the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Standardised Assessment of Concussion (SAC), modified Balance Error Scoring System (m-BESS), King-Devick test, and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuits. Testing was repeated in athletes diagnosed acutely with concussion and compared to a matched teammate without concussion.

Data were collected on 41 concussed athletes and 41 matched controls. The test-retest reliability for symptom score and symptom severity, assessed using control athletes, was 0.09 (-0.70 to 0.88) and 0.08 (-1.00 to 1.00) (unweighted kappa), respectively. Intraclass correlations were as follows: SAC at 0.33 (-0.02 to 0.61), m-BESS at 0.33 (-0.2 to 0.60), EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit tangential variability at 0.70 (0.50 to 0.83), radial variability at 0.47 (0.19 to 0.69), and King-Devick test at 0.71 (0.49 to 0.84).

The maximum identified sensitivity and specificity of each test for predicting clinical concussion diagnosis were as follows:

- **Symptom score**: 81% sensitivity and 94% specificity (3-point increase)
- **Symptom severity score**: 91% sensitivity and 81% specificity (3-point increase)
- **SAC**: 44% sensitivity and 72% specificity (2-point decline)
- **m-BESS**: 40% sensitivity and 92% specificity (5-point increase)
- **King-Devick**: 85% sensitivity and 76% specificity (any increase in time)
- **EYE-SYNC smooth pursuit**:
	- **Tangential variability**: 48% sensitivity and 58% specificity (any increase)
	- **Radial variability**: 52% sensitivity and 61% specificity (any increase)

The adjusted area under the curve was:

- **Symptom score**: 0.95 (0.89 to 0.99)
- **Symptom severity score**: 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)
- **SAC**: 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.79)
- **m-BESS**: 0.71 (0.60 to 0.83)
- **King-Devick**: 0.78 (0.69 to 0.87)
- **Radial variability**: 0.47 (0.34 to 0.59)

### Consensus statement on concussion in sport: The 6th international conference on concussion in sport-Amsterdam, October 2022 [^112bCcxq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

For over two decades, the Concussion in Sport Group has held meetings and developed five international statements on concussion in sport. This 6th statement summarizes the processes and outcomes of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Amsterdam on 27–30 October 2022 and should be read in conjunction with the (1) methodology paper that outlines the consensus process in detail and (2) 10 systematic reviews that informed the conference outcomes. Over 3½ years, author groups conducted systematic reviews of predetermined priority topics relevant to concussion in sport. The format of the conference, expert panel meetings, and workshops to revise or develop new clinical assessment tools, as described in the methodology paper, evolved from previous consensus meetings with several new components. Apart from this consensus statement, the conference process yielded revised tools, including the Concussion Recognition Tool-6 (CRT6) and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-6 (SCAT6, Child SCAT6), as well as a new tool, the Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool-6 (SCOAT6, Child SCOAT6). This consensus process also integrated new features, including a focus on the para athlete, the athlete's perspective, concussion-specific medical ethics, and matters related to both athlete retirement and the potential long-term effects of SRC, such as neurodegenerative disease. This statement summarizes evidence-informed principles of concussion prevention, assessment, and management, and emphasizes those areas requiring more research.

### What are the critical elements of sideline screening that can be used to establish the diagnosis of concussion? A systematic review [^112TypB1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sideline detection is the first and most significant step in recognizing a potential concussion and removing an athlete from harm. This systematic review aims to evaluate the critical elements aiding sideline recognition of potential concussions, including screening tools, technologies, and integrated assessment protocols.

- **Data sources**: Bibliographic databases, grey literature repositories, and relevant websites were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2016. A total of 3,562 articles were identified.

- **Study selection**: Original research studies evaluating a sideline tool, technology, or protocol for sports-related concussion were eligible, of which 27 studies were included.

- **Data extraction**: A standardized form was used to record information. The QUADAS-2 and Newcastle-Ottawa tools were used to rate risk of bias. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group system.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies assessing symptoms, the King-Devick test, and multimodal assessments reported high sensitivity and specificity. Evaluations of balance and cognitive tests described lower sensitivity but higher specificity. However, these studies were at high risk of bias, and the overall strength of evidence examining sideline screening tools was very low. A strong body of evidence demonstrated that head impact sensors did not provide useful sideline concussion information. Low-strength evidence suggested a multimodal, multitime-based concussion evaluation process incorporating video review was important in the re-evaluation.

### Sensitivity of the concussion assessment battery [^111sWRmp]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Sports medicine clinicians commonly use multiple tests when evaluating patients with concussion. The specific tests vary but often include symptom inventories, posturography, and neurocognitive examinations. The sensitivity of these tests to concussion is vital in reducing the risk of additional injury by prematurely returning an athlete to play. Our study investigated the sensitivity of concussion-related symptoms, a postural control evaluation, and neurocognitive functioning in concussed collegiate athletes.

From 1998 to 2005, all high-risk athletes completed a baseline concussion-assessment battery that consisted of a self-reported symptom inventory, a postural control evaluation, and a neurocognitive assessment. Postconcussion assessments were administered within 24 hours of injury to 75 athletes who had physician-diagnosed concussion. Individual tests and the complete battery were evaluated for sensitivity to concussion.

The computerized Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing and HeadMinder Concussion Resolution Index (neurocognitive tests) were the most sensitive to concussion (79.2% and 78.6%, respectively). These tests were followed by self-reported symptoms (68.0%), the postural control evaluation (61.9%), and a brief pencil-and-paper assessment of neurocognitive function (43.5%). When the complete battery was assessed, sensitivity exceeded 90%.

Currently recommended concussion-assessment batteries accurately identified decrements in one or more areas in most of the athletes with concussion.

### The sport concussion assessment tool 5th edition (SCAT5): Background and rationale [^111jTkta]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This paper presents the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5th Edition (SCAT5), which is the most recent revision of a sport concussion evaluation tool for use by healthcare professionals in the acute evaluation of suspected concussion. The revision of the SCAT3, first published in 2013, culminated in the SCAT5. The revision was based on a systematic review and synthesis of research, public input, and expert panel review, as part of the 5th International Consensus Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Berlin in 2016. The SCAT5 is intended for use in individuals who are 13 years of age or older. The Child SCAT5 is a tool for those aged 5–12 years, which is discussed elsewhere.

### Concussion guidelines in national and international professional and elite sports [^113mjAoi]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

The Berlin statement on sport-related concussion was published in 2017 using evidence-based recommendations. We aimed to examine the following areas:

- **Implementation and education**: The implementation, distribution, and education based on the Berlin recommendations, along with the development of sport-specific protocols and guidelines among professional and elite sports.
- **Community level implementation**: The implementation of guidelines at the community level.
- **Translation**: The translation of guidelines into different languages.
- **Research activities**: Examination of ongoing research activities.

Senior medical advisers and chief medical officers from organizations like the Australian Football League, All Japan Judo Federation, British Horseracing Authority, Cricket Australia, Fédération Equestre Internationale, Football Association, Gaelic Athletic Association, International Boxing Association, Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Hockey League, National Rugby League, and World Rugby completed a questionnaire.

The results demonstrated that all 14 sporting organizations have published concussion protocols and guidelines based on the Berlin recommendations, including key steps such as recognize, removal from play, re-evaluation, rest, recovery, and return to play. There is variable inclusion of prolonged symptoms, prevention and risk reduction, and long-term effects in the guidelines, rules, regulations, or sport-specific research. Additionally, there is variability in education programs, monitoring compliance with guidelines, and publication in other languages, though all sporting bodies are actively involved in concussion research. We conclude that the Berlin recommendations have been included in concussion management across various sports at different organizational levels.

### Managing sports-related concussions from time of injury through return to play [^111Tb6NU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age under 18 years, female sex, and a history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist in diagnosis.

Management for suspected concussions begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest.

- **Stepwise return-to-play protocol**: A gradual increase in activity should be implemented until the athlete can perform full activity without symptoms, taking into consideration state laws. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a management tool.

- **Prolonged concussion management**: Physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbances may be required.

- **Prevention**: Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in the prevention of concussions.

The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.

### Diagnostic predictive values for sport-related concussions: A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis [^1179xhUJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussions (SRCs) can cause significant neurological symptoms, and approximately 10%-15% of athletes with SRCs experience a prolonged recovery. Given the lack of visible injury on brain imaging and their varied presentations, concussions can be difficult to diagnose. A variety of tests and examination methods have been used to elicit a concussion diagnosis; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are variable. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of standardized tests and visible signs like balance and vision changes in the diagnosis of SRC.

Methods involved a PRISMA-adherent systematic review of concussion diagnostic examinations using the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases on December 1, 2022. Search terms included "concussion", "traumatic brain injury", "diagnosis", "sensitivity", and "specificity". Each method of examination was categorized into larger group-based symptomatologic presentations or standardized tools. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of concussion. Pooled specificity and sensitivity for each method were calculated using a meta-analysis of proportion and were hierarchically ranked using P-scores calculated from a diagnostic frequentist network meta-analysis.

Thirty full-length articles were identified for inclusion, 13 of which evaluated grouped symptomology examinations (balance and overall clinical presentation), and 17 of which evaluated established formalized tools (ImPACT, King-Devick test).

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^1161JYbm]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2018 guidelines offer specific recommendations for managing concussions in pediatric patients, particularly when considering the return to activity. They advise counseling patients and their families to gradually resume activities that do not exacerbate symptoms, following the initial several days post-injury. It is crucial to closely monitor both the number and severity of symptoms during this gradual return to activity.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high, and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. With no valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury adds complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms.

While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and Balance Error Scoring System, have been developed specifically for concussion, most tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of postconcussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following a concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area.

The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on concussion:

- **Definition**: Concussion is an mTBI induced by direct or indirect biomechanical force transmitted to the head, characterized by reversible symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.

- **Pathophysiology**: Concussion is caused by biomechanical force transmitted to the head in settings like the work environment, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreation, and falls at home among the elderly.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and occasionally malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may cause post-traumatic epilepsy, post-concussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration, leading to dementia and movement disorders.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Concussion is associated with an increased mortality risk in the elderly, with an adjusted HR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.16–1.34).

### The new concussion in sport guidelines are here. But how do we get them out there [^114C5fFa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2016 Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport has recently been published in BJSM, serving as the major conduit for informing sports medicine practitioners and clinicians worldwide about the importance of this condition, its assessment, and management. This information dissemination strategy has worked well for previous concussion statements and has certainly raised the profile of the issue in sports medicine circles.

### Infographic. The first position statement of the concussion in para sport group [^113zbRtq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations for para athletes are essential to establish a baseline reference point for concussion symptoms, though they pose challenges for interpreting clinicians. Concussions in the para athlete population should be managed according to existing concussion consensus guidelines using the CIPS assessment tools. While SCAT5 baseline testing cannot be mandated for para athletes, the clinician attending to a para athlete with a suspected concussion has a greater need for a comprehensive understanding of the athlete's pre-injury cognitive function and physical abilities to effectively diagnose and manage the concussion.

Due to the lack of validity of the SCAT5 in general populations and even greater variability of baseline scores between different disability groups, a para athlete may have a concussion even if their SCAT5 is deemed to be 'normal' Despite their limitations, regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations, along with the SCAT5, help guide the assessment of a suspected concussion for each para athlete impairment group.

As part of the overall assessment, an attending medical professional may choose to seek a corroborative history from suitable family members, caregivers, or members of the athlete's entourage who are familiar with the athlete's baseline level of function, if available, to assist in clinical decision-making. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that a team clinician with prior knowledge of the athlete is involved.

### A simple field-based tool to assess concussion symptom reporting behavior [^117DJ2b6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Prevention and treatment of sport-related concussions is an important public health issue and has led to increased research on concussion symptom reporting behavior. At the time of writing, there is neither a common understanding of what constitutes concussion symptom reporting behavior nor measures that capture key features of concussion symptom reporting behavior. Concussion symptom reporting behavior can be initiated by an athlete, an athletic trainer, coach, or teammate and can occur in competition, practice, or days after symptoms appear. Follow-up diagnostics range from asking athletes initial questions about their symptoms to conducting rapid standardized sideline assessments to conducting full comprehensive concussion screens. Currently, for athletes who are not formally diagnosed with concussion, no information about concussion symptom reporting behavior sources, screening methods, or context is collected.

- **Methods**: Pilot data were collected from four National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football programs. Athletic trainers recorded data about key concussion symptom reporting behavior features during the 2016 and 2017 football seasons. The 2016 data were analyzed in Spring 2017 and the reporting form was adapted for the Fall 2017 season. Two programs completed records during the 2017 season. These records were analyzed in Spring 2018.

### Clinical evaluation of concussion: The evolving role of oculomotor assessments [^114y3REZ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussion is a change in brain function following a direct or an indirect force to the head, identified in awake individuals and accounting for a considerable proportion of mild traumatic brain injury. Although the neurological signs and symptoms of concussion can be subtle and transient, there can be persistent sequelae, such as impaired attention and balance, that make affected patients particularly vulnerable to further injury. Currently, there is no accepted definition or diagnostic criteria for concussion, and there is no single assessment that is accepted as capable of identifying all patients with concussion. In this paper, the authors review the available screening tools for concussion, with particular emphasis on the role of visual function testing. In particular, they discuss the oculomotor assessment tools that are being investigated in the setting of concussion screening.

### Amsterdam 2022 process: A summary of the methodology for the Amsterdam international consensus on concussion in sport [^112KMH7T]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to summarise the consensus methodology that was used to inform the International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport (Amsterdam 2022). Building on a Delphi process to inform the questions and outcomes from the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport, the Scientific Committee identified key questions. The answers to these questions would help encapsulate the science in sport-related concussion and help guide clinical practice. Over 3½ years, delayed by 2 years due to the pandemic, author groups conducted systematic reviews on each selected topic.

The 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport was held in Amsterdam (27–30 October 2022) and consisted of 2 days of systematic review presentations, panel discussions, question and answer engagement with the 600 attendees, and abstract presentations. This was followed by a closed third day of consensus deliberations by an expert panel of 29 with observers in attendance.

The fourth day, also closed, was dedicated to a workshop to discuss and refine the sports concussion tools: Concussion Recognition Tool 6 (CRT6), Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 6 (SCAT6), Child SCAT6, Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool 6 (SCOAT6), and Child SCOAT6. We include a summary of recommendations for methodological improvements for future research that grew out of the systematic reviews.

### Onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete [^117H4J16]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete is challenging, given the elusiveness of injury, the sensitivity and specificity of the sideline assessment tools, and the evolving nature of concussive injury. This paper reviews the evidence related to onfield assessment and considers questions related to same-day return to play, what to do when no physician is available onsite, as well as the benefit of remote notification of potential concussive events.

- **Objective**: To review the evidence regarding the onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete. Additional key issues to consider include same-day return to play for the adult athlete with concussion, what to do in a community setting when no doctor is present, and whether there is any benefit from remote notification of potential concussive events that occur on the playing field.

- **Data sources**: Systematic literature review of concussion assessment and management. PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases were reviewed using the MeSH keywords concussion and mild traumatic brain injury combined with athletic injuries. Each was refined by adding the keywords 'adult', 'sideline assessment', 'onfield assessment', and 'return to play'.

- **Results**: For the MEDLINE search using 'concussion' and 'athletic injuries' as keywords, there were 880 results, and refining by 'adult' resulted in 292 results. When 'traumatic brain injury' and 'athletic injuries' were combined, there were 210 results, further refined to 89 results by 'adult'. Many of these results overlapped.

### Sideline assessment tools for the evaluation of concussion in athletes: A review [^113ioHgD]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions, which have become more prevalent in the past decade, are an extremely common phenomenon in organized athletics and create a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, they can have devastating impacts on the athletic careers and long-term health of athletes. However, concussion evaluation remains a controversy with respect to diagnosis, management, and return-to-play guidelines for sports-related concussions. This is especially true of the immediate evaluation of sports-related concussion on the sidelines, where decisions must be made quickly and effectively with limited diagnostic resources.

Considerable effort has been directed toward developing reliable and valid sidelines assessment modalities for concussion evaluation, with a goal of accurately determining whether an athlete requires rapid removal from or is able to return to competition. This paper discusses the role of the concussion specialist on the sidelines during athletic competition and examines the tools and resources available for the sidelines assessment of concussion. Additionally, new technologies, including electronic applications for smartphones and tablets, as well as future directions in sidelines assessment of concussion, are examined.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: Evidence for subtype classification [^114sirfd]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

The results of this large, heterogeneous, and generalizable sample of adults and children support trends in the clinical consensus of subtype-oriented concussion diagnosis. This study identified evidence for concussion subtypes within the acute time frame of 3 days following injury, capturing patients that may have shortened courses of symptomatology and impairments following injury and indicating that subtype assessments should begin within the first clinical encounter.

A limited number of studies were included for analysis because many potentially applicable studies failed to report individual outcomes and had wide variability in acute concussion assessment times. Additionally, the lack of literature reporting robust objective assessment in this acute time period limited subtype-specific meta-analysis largely to symptom reports. None of the studies ultimately included for analysis within the reported time frame informed the cervical strain associated condition, and we could not comment on its prevalence as an associated condition. The number of studies informing the ocular-motor subtype and sleep disturbance were also limited, with these topics representing newer areas of investigation. For the purposes of this research, and relevant to clinical care, the accurate and timely report of postconcussive symptoms is critical to the reliability and stability of their assessments and descriptions. This study examined the prevalence of concussion subtypes within the acute time frame to identify the need for targeted diagnostic and management approaches in the acute setting.

### Median time to return to sports after concussion is within 21 days in 80% of published studies [^114aDJFH]. Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

To perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate the return to play (RTP) time frame following a concussion diagnosis, our secondary purpose was to analyze and compare different prognostic variables affecting concussions, time to return to school, time to symptom resolution of concussive symptoms, and time each patient spent in the RTP protocol.

Methods

A PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library database literature review was performed in August 2022. The studies needed to report, in days, the length of time a patient/athlete was removed from play due to concussion management. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool was used for risk of bias for each study, and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria were used for quality assessment.

Results

There were 65 studies included in the systematic review and a total of 21,966 patients evaluated. The RTP time intervals ranged from 1 to 1,820 days, with 80.7% of the median RTP time frames for each study within 21 days. Preconcussion risk factors for prolonged RTP included female sex, younger age, presence of psychiatric disorders, and history of previous concussion. Postconcussion risk factors included severe symptom scores at initial clinic visit, loss of consciousness, nonelite athletes, and delayed removal from competition. The most common sports resulting in concussion were contact sports, most commonly football and soccer. Median time to return to school was 3 to 23 days. Median time to symptom resolution ranged from 2 to 11 days.

### What are the most appropriate return-to-play guidelines for concussed child athletes [^115hfBKo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To examine concussion literature for specific guidelines regarding return to play (RTP) following sport-related concussion in child athletes, recommendations were made regarding the most appropriate RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion.

- **Design**: A literature review of concussion literature was conducted.

- **Intervention**: A literature search was carried out using Medline and Embase databases from 1998 to 2008, reviewing more than 60 articles and two websites.

- **Results**: There is a paucity of research on sport-related concussion in child athletes, particularly younger children (age 5–12 years). Notably, there is no research on RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion. It is observed that child athletes take longer to recover from concussions than adults. Concussion symptoms may resolve before cognitive function has completely recovered. Assessment and management of concussion in children can be complicated by their growth and development, as well as the lack of trained medical personnel involved with youth sports. Moreover, there are no child-specific assessment tools for concussion.

- **Conclusions**: RTP decisions in children should be made cautiously and should be individualized. Under no circumstances should a concussed child athlete be allowed to RTP on the same day. Physical and cognitive rest is critical to allow for the resolution of concussion symptoms. Child athletes should remain symptom-free for several days before starting a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol. Further research is needed to elucidate the effects of concussion in children and to determine appropriate guidelines.

### Defining asymptomatic status following sports concussion: fact or fallacy [^115PRhym]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The management of sports concussions involves a return to the baseline 'asymptomatic' status prior to returning to play and training. Unfortunately, although the term 'asymptomatic' is widely used, it has not been operationally defined. This review identifies the need to formally define the term 'asymptomatic' as used in sports concussion, discusses some of the challenges associated with its definition, and offers some possible solutions for further debate. The operational definition of the term 'asymptomatic' may provide the stimulus for further informed discussion at a future meeting of the international Concussion in Sport group and by other peak sports medicine bodies involved in management guideline development.

### Assessing the predictive value of primary evaluation with the immediate post-concussion assessment and cognitive test following head injury [^115fYnTA]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Concussions are a major public health concern, especially for high school and college student athletes. However, there are few prognostic metrics that can accurately quantify concussion severity to anticipate recovery time and symptom regression. The Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) is a widely used neurocognitive assessment that can diagnose and track recovery from concussions. This study assesses whether initial ImPACT scores, collected within 48 hours of the injury, can predict the persistence of concussion at follow-up.

Results from 6912 ImPACT tests were compiled in 2161 unique student athletes, ages 12–22 years. The authors defined a novel metric, the Severity Index (SI), which is a summation of the number of standard deviations from baseline at the 80% CI for each of the 5 composite scores reported by ImPACT. Patients were binned into groups based on SI (0–3.99, 4–7.99, 8–11.99, 12+), and the relationships between SI groups, composite scores, symptom profiles, and recovery time were characterized using 1-way and 2-way ANOVAs and Kaplan-Meier plots. A logistic regression assessed the value of SI for predicting concussion at follow-up.

Patients with a higher SI at diagnosis were more likely to still be concussed at their first follow-up (F3,2300 = 93.06; p < 0.0001). Groups with a higher SI also displayed consistently slower recovery over a 42-day period and were more likely to report symptoms in all 4 symptom clusters: migraine, cognition, sleep, and neuropsychiatric.

### Sport-related concussion: Optimizing treatment through evidence-informed practice [^112FZvMU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion is one of the most common injuries in sport and recreation today. Reports of concussion have increased in recent years, likely due to increased societal awareness and the risk of longer-term sequelae. Presently, treatment includes a period of prescribed rest in the acute period following injury, followed by a protocol of graded exertion. Despite an initial period of rest and attempts at a gradual return to play, up to 30% of individuals may have ongoing symptoms past the acute period. The goal of this viewpoint is to introduce the reader to the most common symptoms of concussion and the need for a new, more active paradigm during treatment.

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^113ATDsU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions presents unique challenges as each patient exhibits different symptoms. It is critical that an athlete not return to play until they are completely asymptomatic. Current classification systems for concussions lack a basis in scientific evidence and instead reflect some practitioners' educated guesses regarding safety for young athletes. Despite this, many experienced team physicians believe it is safe to allow an athlete to play if they present no symptoms at rest and remain symptom-free with increasing exercise intensity.

Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance assessments show promise for field use, enhancing the sensitivity of neurological evaluations for injured athletes. These evaluations are most beneficial when baseline data is available for comparison before the athlete sustains an injury.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of mild TBI (concussions): What you need to know [^114U6mAc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents and is a form of mild traumatic brain injury that surgeons will see in their acute care practice. With a rapidly changing evidence base for diagnosis and management, we will focus on the importance of timely identification and diagnosis, as well as the early initiation of active management of pediatric concussion immediately after injury through recovery. This approach involves the application of targeted therapies for specific deficits identified after concussion, addressing the individual pattern of symptoms experienced by patients following concussion.

We will review what is known about the underlying pathophysiology that drives the clinical manifestations of concussion, and the targeted clinical assessments that can both aid in the diagnosis of concussion as well as drive the active rehabilitation of deficits seen after concussion. The standardized approach to the return to activities will also be described, including return to learning and sports.

### American medical society for sports medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of the statement**: To provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion; to establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps, and areas requiring additional research.

- **Importance of an AMSSM statement**: Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. They are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

- **Definition**: Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. It is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

- **Pathophysiology**: Animal and human studies support the concept of post-concussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to subsequent impacts.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a prevalent injury among children and adolescents. The challenge in diagnosis arises because athletes rarely report concussive symptoms. The management strategy for sport-related concussions has evolved significantly in recent years, moving away from traditional grading systems and return-to-play guidelines to more individualized assessments and management plans. Neuropsychological testing is increasingly used to assist in management. It is recommended that, after recovery, an athlete's return to play should progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion, under the monitoring of a healthcare provider. Proper assessment and management of sport-related concussions are critical, as repeated concussions can lead to decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptoms, and, in some cases, catastrophic outcomes.

### Sideline concussion assessment: The current state of the art [^11537mX9]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

More than 200 million American adults and children participate in organized physical activity. Growing awareness has highlighted that concussion, especially when repeated, may be associated with prolonged neurological, cognitive, or neuropsychiatric sequelae. Objective diagnosis of concussion remains challenging, as some concussion symptoms may be apparent even to nonmedical observers. Diagnosis and removal from play for evaluation depend on validated assessment tools and trained, vigilant healthcare personnel.

Over the past two decades, sideline concussion measures have undergone significant revision and augmentation. These have become more comprehensive batteries capable of detecting a wide spectrum of symptomatology, such as neurocognitive function, post-concussive symptoms, gait/balance, and saccadic eye movements. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art concussion evaluation instruments, ranging from the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) and tools that may enhance concussion detection, to near-term blood-based biomarkers and emerging technology (e.g. head impact sensors, vestibulo-ocular/eye-tracking, and mobile applications).

- **Feasibility, utility, and generalizability**: Special focus is directed at the feasibility, utility, generalizability, and challenges to implementation of each measure on-field and on the sidelines. This review finds that few instruments beyond the SCAT provide guidance for removal from play, and establishing thresholds for concussion detection and removal from play in qualification/validation of future instruments is of high importance. Integration of emerging sideline concussion evaluation technologies is crucial to advancing the field.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC / mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: A consensus statement [^116iiS8q]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Obtain a more detailed history and perform a more detailed physical examination. A distraction-free environment optimizes the evaluation. Assess for cognitive, somatic, and affective signs and symptoms of SRC with particular attention paid to the number and severity of symptoms because of their prognostic significance. Perform and repeat neurological assessments, with particular emphasis on cognitive function, cranial nerve, and balance testing until the athlete is stable (e.g. SCAT).

Athletes with suspected SRC should be immediately removed from practice or competition. If no licensed healthcare provider is present to evaluate the athlete with suspected SRC, there is no RTP even if symptoms resolve. If SRC is confirmed by a licensed healthcare provider, there is no same-day RTP. If evaluated by a licensed healthcare provider who determines an SRC did not occur, same-day RTP is an option. The athlete should not be left unsupervised until a disposition decision is made.

Determine disposition for symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes, including serial assessments and post-injury follow-up (options include home with observation or transport to hospital). Provide post-event instructions to the athlete and others (e.g. medications, driving, alcohol, physical and cognitive exertion, and medical follow-up). Final determination regarding SRC diagnosis and management is a medical decision based on clinical judgment.

It is essential the team physician:

- **Know the signs and symptoms of suspected SRC**: Recognize red flags, signs and symptoms, and a protocol for emergency hospital transportation.

### Summary of evidence-based guideline update: Evaluation and management of concussion in sports [retired]: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1115awNj]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

To update the 1997 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter regarding sports concussion, this guideline addresses four key questions:

- **Concussion risk factors**: What factors increase or decrease concussion risk?
- **Diagnostic tools**: What diagnostic tools identify those with concussion and those at increased risk for severe/prolonged early impairments, neurologic catastrophe, or chronic neurobehavioral impairment?
- **Clinical risk factors**: What clinical factors identify those at increased risk for severe/prolonged early post-concussion impairments, neurologic catastrophe, re-concussions, or chronic neurobehavioral impairment?
- **Interventions**: What interventions enhance recovery, reduce re-concussion risk, or diminish long-term sequelae?

The complete guideline on which this summary is based is available as an online data supplement to this article.

We systematically reviewed the literature from 1955 to June 2012 for pertinent evidence. We assessed the evidence for quality and synthesized conclusions using a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. Moreover, we employed a modified Delphi process to develop recommendations.

Specific risk factors can either increase or decrease concussion risk. Diagnostic tools that help identify individuals with concussion include graded symptom checklists, the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, neuropsychological assessments, and the Balance Error Scoring System. Ongoing clinical symptoms, concussion history, and younger age identify those at risk for post-concussion impairments. Risk factors for re-concussion include a history of multiple concussions.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: Concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and presents significant challenges for clinicians in terms of diagnosis and management. Debate exists regarding not only the incidence of long-term risks associated with multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes following sports-related head injuries. Decisions about returning athletes to competition can be difficult due to limited prospective data available for making these decisions. Consequently, various published guidelines and consensus statements have been developed for the management of concussion in athletes.

Athletes who sustain a concussion require appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments may be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma can result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. The delivery of care and decisions about return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Preliminary use of the physical and neurological examination of subtle signs for detecting subtle motor signs in adolescents with sport-related concussion [^116LwAHq]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Sensitive examination tools are essential to optimize evaluation after sports-related concussion. The Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs was preliminarily examined for sensitivity to motor changes in a pilot cohort of adolescents aged 13–17 years with sports-related concussion. A total of 15 adolescents (5 female) with sports-related concussion were evaluated up to three times: within 2 weeks of injury, approximately 1 month later (mean, 35 days between visits), and for those not recovered at the second visit, again after clinical recovery (mean, 70 days between the first and last visits for all participants). Comparison data were acquired from 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control athletes with no history of concussion who were evaluated twice (mean, 32 days apart).

- **Main effects of group, time, and interaction effects**: These effects were evaluated with an analysis of covariance, which controlled for socioeconomic status, times tested, and days between testing sessions. Adolescents with concussion had poorer Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs performance than controls did at all time points. Performance improved between visits within the concussion group, with no change within the control group.

These findings suggest that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs merits additional study in larger cohorts and in combination with other markers of injury to facilitate an enhanced understanding of sports-related concussion and recovery.

### Current concepts in concussion: Initial evaluation and management [^112VqMDY]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head, resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. Concussion can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom.

Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before a diagnosis is established. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management. Initial management also involves patient education, reassurance, and symptom management.

Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a cautious approach is often recommended.

### Physical examination tests for assessing a torn meniscus in the knee: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^1161wxvt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Systematic review and meta-analysis aim to identify, analyze, and synthesize the literature to determine which physical examination tests accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus.

Knee pain has a lifetime prevalence of up to 45%, and as many as 31% of individuals with knee pain will consult a general practitioner. Roughly 5% of these individuals will undergo a tibial meniscectomy, and many more will undergo partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair. Determining which of these individuals is appropriate for surgical consult depends on clinical examination findings.

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus from 1966 to August 2006 and extracted all English- and German-language studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of individual physical examination tests for a torn meniscus. We retrieved data regarding true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to create 2-by-2 tables for each article and test. Like tests were then subjected to meta-analysis and subanalysis. Cochran Q test and the I² statistic were used to examine the presence and extent of heterogeneity, respectively. A qualitative analysis was also performed using the QUADAS tool.

Eighteen studies qualified for the final analyses. Three physical examination tests (McMurray's, Apley's, and joint line tenderness) were examined in more than 7 studies and had enough data to consider meta-analysis. However, study results were heterogeneous, and pooled sensitivity and specificity were not fully reported in the excerpt provided.

### A scoping review of magnetic resonance modalities used in detection of persistent postconcussion symptoms in pediatric populations [^1139RgHQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical and experimental application of neuroimaging modalities:

For the detection of acute and persistent concussions, there is no established universal diagnostic test or marker that can be relied upon. Physicians rely primarily on self-reported symptoms from the patient. Although there has been no consensus reached on the use of neuroimaging for diagnostic assessment of concussion or persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS), the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation guidelines recommend the urgent use of conventional methods (computed tomography [CT] or T1- and/or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in youth with PPCS where a structural brain abnormality is suspected. However, neuroimaging remains an optional step in assessing a potential concussion, as most conventional brain scans show minimal abnormal findings, indicating that neuroimaging techniques are not yet sensitive enough. In fact, some experts in the field recommend excluding standard neuroimaging (e.g. CT) from diagnosis, as scans typically appear normal and do not represent an accurate picture of concussions.

In addition to conventional MRI, there are multiple advanced and functional neuroimaging techniques that have shown potential for characterizing subtle microstructural changes that occur from a brain injury. As MRI continues to evolve and advance over time, certain modalities appear more sensitive to detecting neurological abnormalities that would otherwise appear normal on a CT scan. For example, advanced MRI techniques such as functional MRI, perfusion-weighted imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging show great promise for future applications.
