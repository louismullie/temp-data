## Question

How often to check blood sugar if patient is taking Lantus every morning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to check blood sugar when taking Lantus (insulin glargine) every morning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, including diabetes type and concomitant therapies. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about monitoring during insulin initiation and titration. Next, I will review high-quality guidelines for SMBG frequency in insulin-treated patients. After that, I should consider practical titration algorithms and how they drive monitoring needs. Finally, I will tailor recommendations to common scenarios and summarize a clear, actionable plan with safety caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the monitoring cadence hinges on whether this is basal-only therapy versus basal-bolus, whether the patient is insulin-naive, and what other glucose-lowering drugs are on board. Lantus is a once-daily basal insulin for type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and its dose is individualized and titrated to fasting glucose targets, which means SMBG is integral to safe and effective use [^115ximwo] [^112mBopx].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling instructs that during changes to an insulin regimen, including initiation or dose adjustments, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased, and dose changes should occur under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring, which establishes a principle of intensified checks during titration and during any regimen modification [^112mBopx] [^111fSzGL].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommends that all persons using insulin perform blood glucose monitoring at least twice daily and ideally before any insulin injection, with more frequent BGM needed for those on multiple injections, not at A1C target, or with a history of hypoglycemia. This sets a practical floor of two checks per day during active insulin therapy [^116SUNhy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought "once daily fasting checks might suffice" for basal-only therapy, but that would under-capture hypoglycemia and limit titration responsiveness. Let me reconsider in light of treat-to-target algorithms and safety. Multiple trials and reviews show that basal insulin titration relies on frequent fasting SMBG to adjust dose every few days toward a fasting target, and that patient-led titration improves outcomes when supported by structured SMBG, which argues for more than sporadic testing during active titration [^115cobjQ] [^111kDpP5] [^114SnhwC].

> I will now examine practical titration cadence to anchor monitoring frequency. Treat-to-target protocols commonly adjust basal insulin every 2–3 days based on median fasting SMBG over the prior 2–3 days, which implies patients should obtain fasting values at least several times per week during titration. Some programs use weekly adjustments, but even then, patients are typically asked to record fasting SMBG multiple days per week to inform dose changes [^113JoRih] [^115cobjQ] [^112JBDBA].

> Let me think about scenario-based specifics. For insulin-naive type 2 diabetes starting once-daily morning Lantus, I would recommend fasting SMBG daily during the first 2–4 weeks to enable safe, responsive titration, then, once the fasting target is consistently achieved, reduce to fasting checks several times per week with periodic daytime profiles to detect daytime hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. If A1C remains above goal despite a good fasting, I should add postprandial checks after the largest meal to evaluate for prandial excursions [^116SUNhy] [^1121yzed].

> For type 1 diabetes on basal-bolus therapy with morning Lantus, I should confirm that premeal and bedtime SMBG are standard, often totaling four or more checks per day, because both basal and prandial insulins require ongoing adjustment and hypoglycemia surveillance. This aligns with guideline language for multiple daily injections and with trial operations that collect 7–8 point profiles periodically [^116SUNhy] [^115jgGtb].

> But wait, what if the patient is on other agents that increase hypoglycemia risk, such as sulfonylureas, or has renal impairment? In those cases, I need to ensure more frequent SMBG, including occasional daytime and nocturnal checks, because hypoglycemia risk is higher and awareness may be blunted. The FDA label highlights renal/hepatic risk and the need for intensified monitoring in higher-risk patients [^112oPWRz] [^112tXwD6] [^116FpoeU].

> I should double-check the role of continuous glucose monitoring. While not universally required, CGM can meaningfully increase detection of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and guide basal titration, and professional societies increasingly support CGM for insulin-treated patients, particularly with hypoglycemia unawareness or frequent lows. If available, CGM can complement or partially replace fingersticks, but SMBG remains essential for calibration and when CGM is not available [^116SUNhy] [^116p5Hy8].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-conscious plan. During active titration of morning Lantus, aim for daily fasting SMBG with periodic daytime profiles (for example, a 4-point day before each clinic visit or when control is suboptimal), then after the fasting target is stable, maintain fasting checks at least 2–3 times per week and expand to postprandial testing if A1C is not at goal. Always increase frequency during illness, medication changes, or suspected hypoglycemia, and ensure the patient knows how to respond to lows and when to call for support [^116SUNhy] [^112mBopx] [^111Hdj7m].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and reference-aligned: for once-daily morning Lantus, check fasting blood glucose daily during titration, then at least twice weekly once stable, with additional daytime checks as indicated. If on basal-bolus therapy, check before meals and at bedtime. And increase frequency with hypoglycemia risk, intercurrent illness, or regimen changes, consistent with FDA labeling and AACE guidance [^112mBopx] [^116SUNhy].

---

For patients on once-daily morning Lantus, **check fasting glucose daily** during titration or when adjusting therapy, and **reduce to 2–3 times per week** once stable and at target. Increase to **daily checks** if hypoglycemia occurs, illness develops, or other medications change. For type 1 diabetes, monitor more frequently (often before meals and bedtime) because of prandial insulin needs. Always individualize based on A1C, hypoglycemia risk, and comorbidities, and use CGM when available to improve safety and titration accuracy [^116SUNhy] [^111Hdj7m].

---

## General principles of glucose monitoring with Lantus

- **Daily monitoring during titration**: During initiation or dose adjustments, check fasting glucose daily to guide safe, effective titration and detect hypoglycemia early [^116SUNhy] [^113JoRih].

- **Stable maintenance monitoring**: Once stable and at target, fasting glucose can be checked 2–3 times per week, with more frequent checks if A1C is above goal or hypoglycemia risk is higher [^111Hdj7m].

- **Increased frequency with changes**: Check daily during illness, medication changes, or altered activity, as these can increase hypo- or hyperglycemia risk [^112mBopx] [^111fSzGL].

---

## Specific recommendations by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended frequency of glucose monitoring** |
|-|-|
| Initial titration or dose adjustment | Daily fasting glucose checks |
| Stable maintenance (at target, no recent changes) | 2–3 times per week fasting glucose |
| Hypoglycemia episodes or unawareness | Daily checks, including occasional daytime profiles |
| Illness, medication changes, or altered activity | Daily checks |
| Type 1 diabetes (basal-bolus regimen) | Multiple daily checks (pre-meal, bedtime, occasionally 2–3 am) |

---

## Role of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)

CGM is recommended for patients with **frequent hypoglycemia**, **hypoglycemia unawareness**, or **A1C not at target** despite optimized therapy, as it provides real-time data to improve safety and titration accuracy [^116SUNhy] [^114TPXyY].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting monitoring frequency

- **Treat-to-target trials**: Daily fasting SMBG underpinned successful titration to fasting glucose targets and improved A1C with low hypoglycemia risk [^115cobjQ] [^114SnhwC].

- **AT.LANTUS**: Patient-led titration with frequent SMBG achieved greater A1C reductions and low severe hypoglycemia rates [^111kDpP5] [^114SnhwC].

- **Real-world data**: Frequent SMBG correlates with better glycemic control and fewer complications, supporting ongoing monitoring during therapy [^112ughe7].

---

## Individualized monitoring plans

Monitoring should be tailored to **A1C level**, **hypoglycemia risk**, **comorbidities** (renal/hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease), and **patient preferences**. Shared decision-making and education improve adherence and outcomes [^1178Zxq6] [^114c7brc].

---

## Practical tips for patients

- **Consistent timing**: Check fasting glucose at the same time each morning for reliable titration [^notfound].

- **Record results**: Keep a log to guide dose changes and identify patterns [^117L4Z2w].

- **Recognize hypoglycemia**: Educate on symptoms and treatment, and check glucose when symptoms occur [^116YRwpY].

- **Adjust for changes**: Increase monitoring during illness, medication changes, or altered activity [^112mBopx].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Daily fasting glucose checks** during titration or dose changes.

- **2–3 times per week** once stable and at target.

- **Increase frequency** with hypoglycemia, illness, or medication changes.

- **Use CGM** when appropriate to enhance safety and titration.

- **Individualize** based on A1C, risk, comorbidities, and preferences.

---

Patients on once-daily morning Lantus should **monitor fasting glucose daily during titration**, then 2–3 times per week once stable, with more frequent checks when hypoglycemia, illness, or therapy changes occur. Individualize to A1C, risk, and comorbidities, and consider CGM to optimize control and safety [^116SUNhy] [^114TPXyY].

5.3 Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including LANTUS. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

The long-acting effect of LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of LANTUS may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

### Dosing of insulin glargine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115cobjQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance and declining beta-cell function, often leading to a requirement for insulin therapy to maintain good glycemic control and prevent diabetes-associated complications. Adequate insulin dosing is crucial to the achievement of good glycemic control with minimal hypoglycemia, and dose titration immediately following insulin initiation is needed to ensure its success. Insulin may be initiated as an add-on therapy to oral treatment using a single evening basal insulin dose and titrating according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (with an ideal target of < 5.5 mmol/L [< 100 mg/dL] to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7%).

Objective

This review investigated options for, and clinical efficacy of, titration algorithms of insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified through searches of MEDLINE (years: 2000–2006). Search terms included insulin glargine, titration, algorithm, and type 2 diabetes. Studies were assessed and included in this review if they provided information regarding the method of dose titration of insulin glargine used.

Results

A total of 12 studies were identified and included in this review. In the 24-week Treat-to-Target study, in which 756 patients were randomized to receive either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, once-daily using a simple titration regimen (titration of daily insulin dose by 0–2, 2, 4, or 6–8 IU if mean fasting plasma glucose over the 3 previous days was ≥ 5.6- < 6.7, ≥ 6.7- < 7.8, ≥ 7.8- < 10.0 or ≥ 10 mmol/L [≥ 100- < 120, ≥ 120- < 140, ≥ 140- < 180, or ≥ 180 mg/dL], respectively, in the absence of plasma glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]) more patients reached HbA1c ≤ 7% without nocturnal hypoglycemia with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (33.2% vs 26.7%; P < 0.05). In the 24-week AT.LANTUS (A Trial comparing LANTUS Algorithms to achieve Normal blood glucose Targets in subjects with Uncontrolled blood Sugar) study, 4961 patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine with either clinic-managed (as in the Treat-to-Target study) or patient-managed dose titration (increase insulin dose by 2 IU every 3 days in the absence of blood glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]). Greater reductions in HbA(1c) were found with patient- versus clinic-managed titration (-1.22% vs -1.08%; P < 0.001), and fewer patients experienced hypoglycemia with clinic-managed titration (29.8% vs 33.3%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results from the studies discussed in this review suggest that adequate titration of the insulin dose, either by physicians or by patients, can help patients reach treatment goals, including HbA(1c) < 7% and FBG < 5.5 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The choice between algorithms may depend on clinical circumstance and a patient's willingness and ability to become more involved in management of therapy.

In Study G, the baseline dose of basal or total insulin was the first
available on-treatment dose prescribed during the study (on visit month 1.5).

LANTUS Timing of Daily Dosing (see Table
11).

The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre-breakfast, pre-dinner, or
at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study in patients
with type 1 diabetes (study H, n = 378). Patients were also treated with insulin
lispro at mealtime. LANTUS administered at different times of the day resulted
in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 11). In these patients, data are available from
8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed
just prior to injection of LANTUS regardless of time of administration.

In this study, 5% of patients in the LANTUS-breakfast arm discontinued
treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two arms
discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered
pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized,
active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2
diabetes not adequately controlled on oral anti-diabetic therapy. All patients
in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. LANTUS given before
breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime
or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 11).

Different Timing of LANTUS Administration in Diabetes Type 1 and Diabetes Type 2

The safety and efficacy of once daily LANTUS administered either at pre-breakfast, pre-dinner, or at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study H, n = 378). Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years.

LANTUS administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to LANTUS injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the LANTUS-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason.

The safety and efficacy of once daily LANTUS administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. LANTUS given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12).

### Lantus insulin overdose: a case report [^112nMCa8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin glargine is a relatively new medication in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and there have only been six case reports of overdoses in the literature with this specific insulin.

Objectives

We present a unique case of insulin glargine overdose that presented with persistent hypoglycemia and required prolonged in-hospital treatment.

Case Report

A 51-year-old woman with insulin-dependent diabetes and a history of suicide attempts by medication overdose presented to the Emergency Department the morning after she had self-administered 2700 units of her insulin glargine in an attempted suicide. She was treated with continuous intravenous dextrose infusion with liberal oral intake, and continued to have recurrent hypoglycemic episodes 96 h into her hospital stay. She was discharged on hospital day 5 after psychiatric clearance without any permanent complications.

Conclusions

A single massive overdose of insulin glargine can present with prolonged hypoglycemia. Emergency physicians should have a low threshold for initiating continuous dextrose infusions and admitting these patients for frequent blood glucose and serum electrolyte monitoring, preferably in an intensive care setting.

### Insulin glargine (insulin glargine U-300) [^1132ipCt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of Insulin Glargine, U-300 given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with Insulin Glargine, U-300 titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. Insulin Glargine, U-300 and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when Insulin Glargine, U-300 was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Intensification of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective, non-interventional cohort study of patients treated with insulin glargine or biphasic human insulin in daily clinical practice [^111fdT5A]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin administration in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has proved to be the most effective treatment modality, which should be initiated early in the course of the disease in case lifestyle modification and/or metformin administration fail to achieve recommended glycaemic standards. Insulin can be administered in addition to oral hypoglycaemic therapy and in different therapeutic schemes which can be prospectively modified based on close glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose (BG) monitoring.

The primary objective of the present retrospective study (LANTus utilisation in real life versus PREmix Insulin, PRELANTI) was to assess the efficacy of intensification of treatment, by measuring the change in HbA1c, of two main insulin treatment schemes: (a) glargine once daily in the evening and (b) biphasic human insulin twice daily (bd) in patients with T2DM on concomitant therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD). Secondary objectives were to examine for changes in fasting BG, body weight, treatment with OAD or insulin and safety, by assessing the frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes. In both treatment groups, fast acting insulin was added if needed.

2.3 Treatment and procedures

All patients who met the eligibility criteria at the end of the run‐in period were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice and web‐response system to receive once‐daily subcutaneous injection of Gla‐100 (Lantus SoloSTAR®, Sanofi‐Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) at a standard starting dose (0.2 U/kg) or a higher starting dose (0.3 U/kg). Randomization was stratified by baseline sulphonylurea or glinide use to minimize bias due to a possibly short washout period duration (the 3‐day run‐in period). Patients were advised to administer the insulin dose at the same time each day, preferably at dinner time. While patients, investigators and site staff remained unmasked to treatment, the statistician and sponsor remained masked until after database lock and completion of analyses.

All patients were required to measure and record the values of their four‐point self‐monitoring of blood glucose (before breakfast and 2 hours after breakfast, lunch, and dinner) on the last day of the run‐in period and ≥ 3 consecutive days within the week prior to each visit during the treatment period. Patients were instructed to adjust the insulin doses at each visit based on their median self‐monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels prior to the visit, to achieve a self‐monitored FBG target of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL) using the same titration algorithm (Table S1).

Patients attended their scheduled clinic visits during the screening, run‐in and randomization periods, then at weeks 2, 6, 12 and 16 during the treatment period. In addition, telephone follow‐ups were conducted at 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 weeks after randomization, and 1 week after the end of treatment. The self‐monitoring of blood glucose values and daily insulin dose were also recorded at each study visit, and additional assessments (HbA1c, body weight) were conducted at week 16. Adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia events were recorded throughout the study, and were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 20.1.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

Plain Language Summary

The phase III clinical trial reported here compared two similar basal insulin products, namely, Lilly insulin glargine (Basaglar ®) and a reference insulin glargine product (Lantus ®), used to treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Some patients were using basal insulin prior to entry, and others were insulin naïve. The main racial groups were Asian (48% of the study population), White (46%), and African American (6%). Patients were recruited from India, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, Turkey, the USA, and Puerto Rico. Efficacy and safety measures were acquired over 24 weeks. The main efficacy measures evaluated blood glucose, including glycated hemoglobin, an indicator of blood glucose levels over approximately 3 months, and self-monitored blood glucose taken at several time points over the course of the day. Safety measures included incidence and rate of low blood sugar, incidence of adverse events, and incidence and levels of insulin antibodies. Dose and weight assessments were also obtained. In general, the two treatments provided similar results for these measures. Only one result showed a statistically significant difference between treatments, namely, the reduction in premorning meal self-monitored blood glucose was greater in patients on Lantus ® at 24 weeks. To further evaluate this finding, we analyzed treatment effects on this measure across different sets of patient subgroups. No significant differential treatment effects were observed. Considering this and other results, the difference was not expected to be clinically meaningful. Findings from this study extend the body of evidence from other trials supporting the similarity of these two insulin glargine products.

How to Dose?

There are several important concepts to remember when dosing basal insulin: (a) the starting dose will be wrong; (b) there is no maximal insulin dose; (c) titration of insulin dose is the key. Each of these concepts needs to be explicitly discussed and understood by the patient in order for titration to be successful. Despite 92% of physicians agreeing that "insulin intensification is an essential element of diabetes management", 30% of primary care physicians "never or rarely" personally intensified insulin (vs 4% of specialists) in the multinational survey MODIFY. Interestingly, in a recent multinational survey, HCPs generally preferred a gradual and safe approach to titration to avoid hypoglycemia whereas patients are frustrated by time to reach goal. It is therefore important to manage the patient's expectations.

The starting dose for basal insulin recommended by this panel is 10 U/day. The dose should be incrementally increased on a regular basis using target FBG as the determinant for dose adjustments. At initiation, educating patients that many people will need at least 40–50 units of basal insulin to achieve target FBG is useful for goal setting and behavior shaping. This may help mitigate patient fear/reluctance to up-titrate.

Box 1A details the recommendations by the panel for basal insulin dose and titration.

Basal Insulin Intensification Protocols

The American Diabetes Association consensus statement for managing hyperglycemia recommends that basal insulin be initiated if a patient is symptomatic or has an HbA 1c < 8.5% while using metformin in conjunction with lifestyle intervention. Several recently published studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of patient-directed basal insulin algorithms.–

The primary objective of the AT.LANTUS trial (A Trial Comparing Lantus Algorithms to Achieve Normal Blood Glucose Targets in Subjects With Uncontrolled Blood Sugar) was to compare the safety and efficacy of insulin adjustments. Over a period of 26 weeks, 4500 patients were given insulin glargine (Lantus) once daily. Half the patients were randomized to clinic-based weekly dose adjustments based upon the average blood glucose levels taken 3 days prior to the week's end as shown in Table 2. In AT.LANTUS the incidence of nocturnal, severe, and symptomatic hypoglycemia were not statistically significant between the two groups of patients. In the patient-led titration algorithm, the fasting blood sugar levels (achieved by the patients) were lower than those in the physician-led titration algorithm. This was also evidenced with a higher dose of insulin that was used in the patient-led treatment algorithms. The most significant change was a significant drop in HbA 1c in the patient-led titration algorithm. The reduction in HbA 1c for the patient self-directed protocol was −1.22% vs. −1.08% for the clinic-based algorithm (P < 0.001). These compelling data suggest that treatment goals can be achieved by patients who are empowered to titrate their own insulin regimens.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

Insulin Glargine, U-300 is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens:
The Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar prefilled pen contains 450 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection.
The Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen contains 900 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day.
When changing between Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar and Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen.
The dose counter of the Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of Insulin Glargine, U-300 to be injected and no conversion is required.
Inject Insulin Glargine, U-300 subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day.
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Individualize and titrate the dosage of Insulin Glargine, U-300 based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
Titrate the dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Initiation of insulin glargine therapy in type 2 diabetes subjects suboptimally controlled on oral antidiabetic agents: results from the AT.LANTUS trial [^114SnhwC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

For many patients with type 2 diabetes, oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) do not provide optimal glycaemic control, necessitating insulin therapy. Fear of hypoglycaemia is a major barrier to initiating insulin therapy. The AT.LANTUS study investigated optimal methods to initiate and maintain insulin glargine (LANTUS, glargine, Sanofi-aventis, Paris, France) therapy using two treatment algorithms. This subgroup analysis investigated the initiation of once-daily glargine therapy in patients suboptimally controlled on multiple OADs.

Research Design and Methods

This study was a 24-week, multinational (59 countries), multicenter (611), randomized study. Algorithm 1 was a clinic-driven titration and algorithm 2 was a patient-driven titration. Titration was based on target fasting blood glucose ≤ 100 mg/dl (≤ 5.5 mmol/l). Algorithms were compared for incidence of severe hypoglycaemia [requiring assistance and blood glucose < 50 mg/dl (< 2.8 mmol/l)] and baseline to end-point change in haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)).

Results

Of the 4961 patients enrolled in the study, 865 were included in this subgroup analysis: 340 received glargine plus 1 OAD and 525 received glargine plus > 1 OAD. Incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was < 1%. HbA(1c) decreased significantly between baseline and end-point for patients receiving glargine plus 1 OAD (-1.4%, p < 0.001; algorithm 1–1.3% vs. algorithm 2–1.5%; p = 0.03) and glargine plus > 1 OAD (-1.7%, p < 0.001; algorithm 1–1.5% vs. algorithm 2–1.8%; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

This study shows that initiation of once-daily glargine with OADs results in significant reduction of HbA(1c) with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The greater reduction in HbA(1c) was seen in patients randomized to the patient-driven algorithm (algorithm 2) on 1 or > 1 OAD.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were Caucasian, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Comparison of treatment with insulin degludec and glargine U100 in patients with type 1 diabetes prone to nocturnal severe hypoglycaemia: the hypoDeg randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover trial [^111Q2Dm6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2 Randomization and procedures

We randomized patients to start basal‐bolus therapy with insulin degludec/insulin aspart (Tresiba/NovoRapid) or insulin glargine U100/insulin aspart (Lantus/NovoRapid). A web‐based electronic case report form generating site‐specific randomization lists in blocks of four patients randomized 73 patients to receive insulin degludec first, and 76 patients to receive insulin glargine U100 first.

Insulin degludec or insulin glargine U100 were administered subcutaneously by insulin pen once daily with the evening meal. This timing provides more consistent overnight glucose control with insulin glargine U100 than administration in the morning. A stringent treat‐to‐target design was not considered feasible in these hypoglycaemia‐prone patients. We set the glycaemic target to maintain baseline glycaemic control in both treatment periods at the investigators' discretion. We reduced both basal and prandial insulin doses by 20% at entry into both treatment arms and uptitrated to the patients' usual fasting and preprandial glucose targets to prevent increased rates of severe hypoglycaemia during the run‐in and crossover periods.

We instructed patients to perform and record four‐point SMBG profiles twice‐weekly (before breakfast, before lunch, before dinner, and at bedtime) throughout the study. Patients were seen at their local outpatient clinic every third month, nine visits in total. At every visit, blood pressure, pulse, and weight were recorded, and HbA1c was measured. At the randomization, crossover, and end‐of‐study visits, we measured fasting blood glucose and C‐peptide. Furthermore, we assessed hypoglycaemia awareness by three validated methods.

Adverse events were recorded and graded according to current good clinical practice guidelines.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require
insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring.

The following are examples of drugs that may increase the
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and, therefore,
increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic products,
pramlintide, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide,
fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, propoxyphene,
pentoxifylline, salicylates, somatostatin analogs, and sulfonamide
antibiotics.

The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS: corticosteroids,
niacin, danazol, diuretics, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., epinephrine,
albuterol, terbutaline), glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives,
somatropin, thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestogens (e.g., in oral
contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications
(e.g. olanzapine and clozapine).

Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts, and alcohol may either potentiate or
weaken the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause
hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.

The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking
sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and
reserpine.

Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism, requiring insulin dose
adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose. (7)
The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking
anti-adrenergic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and
reserpine). (7)

### Efficacy and safety of a morning injection of insulin glargine 300 units / mL versus insulin glargine 100 units / mL in adult patients with type 1 diabetes: a multicentre, randomized controlled trial using continuous glucose monitoring [^111zwXB7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Video abstract: View a video abstract for this article.

Aims

This multicentre (N = 104), randomized controlled phase 4 study compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300units/mL (Gla-300) with insulin glargine 100units/mL (Gla-100) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Materials and Methods

Patients were randomized 1:1 to self-perform morning Gla-300 or Gla-100 injections daily for 16weeks. The primary endpoint was percentage of time blood glucose remained in the target range (70-180mg/dL) during Week 15/16, measured by blinded continuous glucose monitoring. Secondary endpoints included incidence and rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia (≤ 70mg/dL), glycaemic variability parameters and safety assessments. Exploratory analyses were performed in patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7.5% at Week 16.

Results

Overall, 638 patients with T1D were included (Gla-300, n = 320; Gla-100, n = 318). In the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, no differences between Gla-300 and Gla-100 were observed in time in range, in glycaemic variability, or in incidence or rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia. In exploratory analyses of patients with HbA1c < 7.5% at Week 16, Gla-300 recipients had greater improvement in time in range over 24hours, during the day and at night compared with Gla-100 recipients (P < 0.05), with small increases in overall hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

Time in range and glycaemic variability were similar for Gla-300 and Gla-100 recipients at the end of study in the mITT population of relatively well-controlled patients with T1D. In patients with end-of-study HbA1c < 7.5%, exploratory analyses suggested that Gla-300 provided improvements in time in range compared with Gla-100.

### Insulin glargine benefits patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic treatment: an observational study of everyday practice in 12, 216 patients [^117CTEG1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

This observational study aimed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of adding insulin glargine (LANTUS((R))) to support oral antidiabetic (OAD) treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes in everyday practice.

Methods

A 9-month, open-label, multicentre, observational study, with an optional 20-month extension phase, in which add-on insulin glargine therapy was initiated in 12,216 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on OADs. The insulin glargine dose was adjusted at the physician's discretion, reflecting everyday practice. The main outcome measures were changes in HbA(1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin dose and body mass index (BMI).

Results

At baseline, mean (± s.d.) age was 63.9 ± 11.3 years; disease duration was > 5 years in 47% of patients, 1–5 years in 39% of patients and < 1 year in 10% of patients, while 4% of patients were newly diagnosed. Addition of insulin glargine to OAD therapy led to reductions in mean HbA(1c) (-1.5% from 8.7%) and FBG (-69 mg/dl from 202 mg/dl) levels after 3 months, which were maintained after 9 months [HbA(1c): -1.7%; FBG: -71 mg/dl (-3.9 mmol/l)] without an increase in BMI. Similar glycaemic control was observed after 20 months in the 2721 patients in the extension study. Adverse drug reactions were documented in 26 patients (0.2%). Of 47 adverse events documented, 19 were due to hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

In everyday practice, patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on OADs benefit from add-on basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine as they demonstrate improved glycaemic control without weight gain.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, Insulin Glargine, U-300 has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300 monitor glucose daily, titrate Insulin Glargine, U-300 as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

Results

Patients

More than 90% of randomized patients (455/493) completed the 24-week treatment period; patient decision was the most common reason for discontinuation (ESM Fig. S2). Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were balanced between arms (Table 1). The population was predominantly Asian (48%) or White (46%), in contrast to the earlier ELEMENT 2 T2D trial (Asian, 9% and White, 78%). The mean duration of diabetes was 12 years. Of the patients on prestudy basal insulin, 63% were taking IGlar (all QD), which was the only prestudy insulin used in the ELEMENT 2 trial. Other prestudy insulins included IDet (22%) and NPH (15%), which were primarily administered QD (< 10% administered BID). A minority of patients were insulin naïve (45%), and a majority (84%) were taking a SU in combination with one or more additional OAMs. Mean age, HbA1c level, and BMI were 57.4 years, 8.6%, and 29.0 kg/m 2, respectively.

### No evidence for accumulation of insulin glargine (LANTUS): a multiple injection study in patients with type 1 diabetes [^117STVj2]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that is metabolically active for at least 24 h. We investigated the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glargine to determine whether daily injections lead to the accumulation of circulating insulin levels and a corresponding decrease in blood glucose levels in patients with Type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Fifteen patients using preprandial insulin lispro (mean age 36 ± 9 years, body mass index 24.6 ± 2.2 kg/m(2)) completed the study. Each patient's optimal insulin glargine dose was determined during a dose-finding phase. After a washout period, patients were treated over 12 days with a constant daily dose of insulin glargine injected in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue at 22:00 h, and with preprandial insulin lispro. Free serum insulin (FSI) and blood glucose concentrations were assessed hourly after the first, fourth, and eleventh injection, after which patients fasted for 24 h and did not use any other insulin preparation.

Results

There were no changes in daily insulin doses during the dose-finding phase (insulin glargine: initial dose 24 ± 6 IU, mean change 0 ± 3 IU; insulin lispro: 18 ± 9 IU, 0 ± 7 IU). The time course of FSI was comparable on the three pharmacokinetic study days. Notably, the trough FSI at the end of the sampling periods was almost identical (day 1, 79 ± 56 pmol/l, day 4, 77 ± 56 pmol/l, day 11, 86 ± 60 pmol/l). No changes occurred in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters studied.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that insulin glargine accumulates after multiple injections over 12 days. These results indicate that the predetermined dose of insulin glargine will not need to be reduced after commencing treatment because of a risk of accumulation.

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose: a prerequisite for diabetes management in outcome trials [^116YRWnc]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence for the value of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with regard to the achievement of treatment targets, detection of postprandial glucose excursions, and minimization of glycemic variability is increasing. In large clinical trials, SMBG is a key component for the optimization of diabetes treatment in insulin-treated diabetes. It also plays an essential role in outcome studies. However, details of SMBG use in both the methods and results sections of clinical articles are frequently scarce. Also, a discussion of the SMBG data and its impact on insulin therapy is valuable. In the recently completed Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine INtervention (ORIGIN) trial, SMBG was described in detail and insulin titration was largely driven by SMBG. Both aspects largely contributed to the fact that near-normal control was achieved over a long-term period.

5.3	Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

The long-acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

5.4	Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine-yfgn and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

### Insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 1-year, randomized, Treat-to-target trial (BEGIN once long) [^111KFeQs]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

At randomization (week 0), eligible participants discontinued all OADs, with the exception of metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor (the latter was continued if country-specific approved labeling allowed combining a DPP-4 inhibitor with insulin), maintaining their pretrial dose and dosing frequency, and were randomized to treatment with degludec or glargine in parallel groups. Insulin degludec was administered once daily, with the main evening meal, and glargine was administered once daily at the same time every day, as chosen by patient and investigator, in accordance with approved labeling. The starting dose for both insulins was 10 units. In the subsequent 52 treatment weeks, each participant's insulin dose was titrated on the basis of the average of prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) values of 3 consecutive days preceding a visit, ensuring titration toward a predefined prebreakfast plasma glucose (PG) target of 3.9−4.9 mmol/L. Participants measured blood glucose with a glucose meter (Abbott Diabetes Care, Abbott Park, IL), with test strips calibrated to plasma values to obtain PG readings. The frequent visit schedule for first 26 weeks and treat-to-target approach were chosen to ensure optimal titration.

The primary end point was change in A1C from baseline after 52 weeks. Other efficacy assessments included change from baseline in central laboratory–measured fasting PG (FPG), SMBG, A1C < 7% responders, and functional health status (assessed by the 36-item short-form health survey version 2.0 [SF-36]).

Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycemic episodes, insulin dose, body weight, injection site reactions, abnormal findings related to physical examination, vital signs, fundoscopy, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests (including insulin antibodies). Confirmed hypoglycemic episodes included either episodes confirmed by SMBG corresponding to PG value < 3.1 mmol/L or severe episodes requiring assistance (no SMBG confirmation). Hypoglycemic episodes occurring from 0001 to 0559 h (inclusive) were classified as nocturnal. Treatment-emergent events were described as occurring on or after the first day of exposure to treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of treatment with insulin degludec or insulin glargine.

### Switching from premixed insulin to glargine-based insulin regimen improves glycaemic control in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes: a retrospective primary-care-based analysis [^116mZdfv]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

For patients who are inadequately controlled with premix, switching to a glargine-based regimen may offer advantages in terms of glycaemic control, tolerability and patient satisfaction with treatment. In a retrospective sub-analysis of the AT.LANTUS (A Trial comparing Lantus Algorithms to achieve Normal blood glucose Targets in subjects with Uncontrolled blood Sugar with type 2 diabetes mellitus) study, including 686 patients with type 2 diabetes taking premix at baseline, poorly controlled patients who switched to glargine ± OADs/prandial insulin showed significantly improved glycaemic control and a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia after 6 months on treatment. Consistent with these findings, a 12-week observational study showed that patients with type 2 diabetes who switched from premix to glargine plus OAD showed significant improvement in mean HbA 1c (-1.1 ± 1.0%, p ≤ 0.001) and reduction in body weight (-1.5 ± 3.3 kg, p ≤ 0.001). However, whether these benefits extend to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in routine clinical practice has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of switching from premix to a glargine-based regimen on glycaemic control, body weight and insulin use in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in a daily practice setting.

Randomisation and Study Intervention

Participants are to be followed for approximately 18 weeks, which includes 1–2 weeks of screening followed by a 4-week run-in period, a 12-week treatment period and a 2- to 4-day follow-up period (Fig. 1). During the 4-week run-in period (weeks – 4 to – 1), participants undergo stabilisation of their current basal and mealtime insulin treatment and are trained on study-related procedures (weeks – 4 to – 3), and baseline CGM values are determined using the blinded CGM device (weeks – 3 to – 1). To be eligible for randomisation, a minimum of 10 days (not necessarily consecutive) of useable CGM data must be generated during the run-in period. During the run-in period, participants titrate their basal and mealtime insulin to a fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) target of ≥ 70 to < 100 mg/dL (≥ 3.9 to < 5.6 mmol/L), and 2-h postprandial SMPG to a target of ≥ 130 to ≤ 180 mg/dL (≥ 7.2 to ≤ 10 mmol/L) [Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) Table 1]. At week 0, participants satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, including CGM handling and compliance with manufacturer's instructions, are randomised 1:1 (stratified by screening HbA 1c values of < 8.0 vs. ≥ 8.0%) to receive once-daily Gla-300 or IDeg-100 by subcutaneous injection in the morning. The randomised treatment period (weeks 0–12) includes an insulin titration period (weeks 0–8) and a CGM data collection period (over 20 consecutive days during weeks 9–12). During the titration period, doses of Gla-300 or IDeg-100 are titrated at least weekly (but no more often than every 3 days) until participants achieve the target fasting SMPG of ≥ 70 to < 100 mg/dL (≥ 3.9 to < 5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycaemia episodes (ESM Table 1). Dose adjustments are based on median fasting SMPG values from the last 3 days, including values recorded on the day of titration, as measured by the participant using glucometers and other provided accessories. CGM data is blinded to both the investigators and participants. Participants are followed-up 2–4 days after their last dose to collect post-treatment safety information.

### Initiation of insulin glargine in suboptimally controlled patients with type 2 diabetes: sub-analysis of the AT.LANTUS trial comparing treatment outcomes in subjects from primary and secondary care in the UK [^112R6UFV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The AT.LANTUS study compared insulin glargine initiation and titration using one of two algorithms in suboptimally controlled subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on a primary outcome of severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes included other categories of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic control, weight changes and insulin dose. Here, we report the results of a subanalysis of the trial, which investigated whether insulin glargine can be initiated and titrated as effectively in primary [general practitioner (GP)] as secondary (hospital) care in patients with T2DM in the UK.

Methods

The main study was a multicentre (n = 611), multinational (n = 59), open-label, 24-week randomized trial in 4,588 suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM. Insulin glargine was titrated to target fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels of ≤ 5.5 mmol/l according to algorithm 1 (clinic-driven titration) or algorithm 2 (patient-managed titration). In this substudy, 819 subjects (GP, n = 215; hospital, n = 604) from 57 primary and 130 secondary care centres were included in the subanalysis; subjects were switched to once-daily insulin glargine from baseline treatments that consisted primarily of oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) (38%) only or premixed insulin ± OAD (23%).

Results

Both the GP and the hospital groups of subjects experienced a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (< 1%), with significant decreases in HbA1c levels (-0.51 and -0.95% respectively; p < 0.001), large reductions in FBG levels (-2.72 and 3.0 mmol/l respectively; p < 0.001) and modest weight gain of 1 and 1.2 kg respectively (p < 0.05). With the exception of absolute reductions in HbA1c and reductions in basal and prandial insulin made on switching to insulin glargine, there were few significant differences in subjects managed in primary compared with secondary care.

Conclusions

This study shows that despite differences in diabetes duration and baseline glycaemic control, an insulin glargine-based therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in a diverse range of suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM in both primary and secondary care settings in the UK. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low and consistent with the results of the main study. Absolute reductions in HbA1c were greatest in the secondary care setting, but similar levels of glycaemic control were achieved in both groups due to differences in baseline HbA1c. In the patients managed in primary care, there was an overall reduction in prandial and basal insulin used when switching to a basal insulin regimen and a lack of titration of prandial insulin. Therefore, the role of prandial insulin, its initiation and titration, appears to be an area that requires more focus in primary care.

### Basal insulin regime change from lantus to toujeo resulted in fewer hypoglycaemic episodes in a 28-year-old man with diabetes mellitus [^111WZG3D]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An active 28-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus reported a reduced number of hypoglycaemic episodes following change in basal regime insulin glargine from U100 Lantus to U300 Toujeo. Consequently, an improved quality of life was also reported. Flash-based glucose monitoring was utilised to record 24-hour continuous glucose levels throughout two comparable 60-day periods before and after the change in regimen. Low blood glucose was most likely between 03:00 and 08:00. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 3.9mmol/L) reduced by an average of 2.5 episodes per week. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 2.9mmol/L) reduced to an average of 0.4 per week, down from 1.5 per week. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes reduced in frequency and severity. Furthermore, nocturnal hypoglycaemia episodes occurred in a more predictable time window. This was especially important in the reported reduction of impact on the patient's quality of life, as the episodes tended to be associated with anxiety and low mood. Patient education needed to facilitate this change was minimal, and benefits to the patient were great, including decreased sleep disturbances and reduced risk of associated anxiety symptoms.

### Impact of switching from twice-daily basal insulin to once-daily insulin glargine 300 U / mL in people with type 1 diabetes on basal-bolus insulin: phase 4 OPTIMIZE study [^113kGyhV]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment

At the end of the run-in period, the prior basal insulin was stopped and Gla-300 OD was self-administered in the morning by subcutaneous injection. The injection had to be administered at the same time each day between 06:00 and 10:00 and before breakfast. The Gla-300 dose was started on a unit-to-unit basis for those transferring from Gla-100 units/mL, unless the investigator thought it was necessary to reduce the dose to 80% of the prior Gla-100 dose for the patient's safety. Those transferring from other basal insulins BID to Gla-300 OD were recommended to start at 80% of the previous total daily basal insulin dose. Gla-300 was titrated at least weekly, and preferably every 3 days, to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) of 4.4–7.2 mmol/L (80–130 mg/dL). If the median fasting SMBG was > 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) the dose was increased by 1 U (or more, at the discretion of the investigator). If the median fasting SMBG was between 4.4 and 7.2 mmol/L (80–130 mg/dL) the dose was maintained. If the median fasting SMBG was < 4.4 mmol/L (80 mg/dL) the dose was reduced by 1 U (or at the discretion of the investigator). In case of a single fasting SMBG measurement of < 3.9 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL), it was recommended to decrease the Gla-300 dose by 1 U. Prandial insulin was continued and doses were adjusted at the discretion of the investigator and the patient.

Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint was the mean HbA 1c change from baseline to week 24.

### A randomized clinical trial comparing breakfast, dinner, or bedtime administration of insulin glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes [^1174XWkj]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin glargine (Lantus), a long-acting human insulin analog, provides effective glycemic control when administered at bedtime. This open-label, randomized, parallel group, multicenter study investigated whether insulin glargine is equally effective if administered before breakfast, before dinner, or at bedtime.

Research Design and Methods

Patients with type 1 diabetes on basal-bolus therapy (n = 378, 18–68 years, HbA(1c) 5.5–9.8%) were treated with once-daily individually titrated insulin glargine in combination with prandial insulin lispro for 24 weeks.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in the three groups (overall age 40.9 ± 11.9 years, diabetes duration 17.3 ± 11.5 years). Median total daily insulin dose was similar at baseline (0.65, 0.65, and 0.66 IU/kg for breakfast, dinner, and bedtime, respectively) and remained relatively constant over the study period; however, the insulin glargine-to-total insulin dose ratio increased more in the breakfast group than in the dinner and bedtime groups. A similar reduction of adjusted mean HbA(1c) from baseline to end point occurred in all patients (7.6–7.4, 7.6–7.5, and 7.6–7.5% for breakfast, dinner, and bedtime, respectively), and a similar percentage achieved HbA(1c) < 7.0% at end point in all groups (29.5, 29.8, and 25.8%, respectively). The 24-h blood glucose profiles in relation to injection time were similar in all groups. The incidences of total symptomatic and severe hypoglycemia did not differ between the three treatment groups; however, nocturnal hypoglycemia occurred in significantly fewer patients in the breakfast group (59.5%) compared with the dinner (71.9%) and bedtime (77.5%) groups (P = 0.005).

Conclusions

These data suggest that insulin glargine, in combination with insulin lispro, is safe and effective when administered before breakfast, before dinner, or at bedtime.

Study Procedures

Participants were given a glucose meter and test strips (Accu-Chek; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and training in recording self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) results in a diary. Injections were to be administered from before the evening meal until bedtime, but at the same time of day throughout the 6-month treatment period. Starting dose was 0.2 U/kg body weight for both insulins, rounded down to the closest whole number divisible by three. When more than one injection was needed (> 80 U with Gla-100, > 90 U with Gla-300), injection doses were given at the same time.

Insulin dose was adjusted once weekly (and not more than every 3 days), aiming for a fasting SMPG of 4.4–5.6 mmol/l (80–100 mg/dl) in the absence of hypoglycaemia. Adjustments were restricted by protocol to changes in multiples of 3 U, the smallest equal adjustment possible for both pen injectors. Dosage was to increase by 3 U for SMPG > 5.6 and < 7.8 mmol/l, and by 6 U if ≥ 7.8 mmol/l and to decrease by 3 U if SMPG was ≥ 3.3 and < 4.4 mmol/l, and by ≥ 3 U (with investigator discretion) for SMPG < 3.3 mmol/l or if severe or multiple symptomatic hypoglycaemic events occurred. Participants stopped some background therapies as described above, but otherwise continued previous therapies at unchanged doses. Rescue treatment was allowed at the investigators' discretion.

Assessment visits occurred at screening (week −2), baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, and months 4 and 6. Interim telephone contacts were scheduled at weeks −1, 1, 3, 5–7, 9–11 and 22. Samples for central laboratory measurement of both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration were collected during clinic visits at baseline, week 12 and month 6. Eight-point SMPG profiles (at 03:00 hours, before and 2 h after breakfast, lunch and dinner, and at bedtime) were performed at baseline and before each study visit.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to TOUJEO from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

### Continuous glucose monitoring-based time-in-range using insulin glargine 300 units / mL versus insulin degludec 100 units / mL in type 1 diabetes: the head-to-head randomized controlled inRange trial [^115Jnu1P]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Baseline CGM values were determined using the blinded CGM device (G6, Dexcom Inc, San Diego, CA) for 20 days at the end of the run‐in period after stabilization of current insulins. To be eligible for randomization, a minimum of 10 days (not necessarily consecutive) of useable CGM data generated during the run‐in period was required. Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a once‐daily subcutaneous injection of Gla‐300 or IDeg‐100 in the morning. The randomization scheme was provided by the study statistician to an interactive response technology (IRT) system, which generated the randomization list and allocated participants to treatment arms. At the screening visit, the investigator contacted the IRT centre to receive the participant number.

The randomized treatment period (weeks 0‐12) included an insulin titration period (expected to be up to week 8) and a CGM data collection period over 20 consecutive days during weeks 10‐12 (to ensure 10 days of evaluable data). Initiation doses of Gla‐300 or IDeg‐100 corresponded to the previous BI dose. During the titration period, doses of Gla‐300 or IDeg‐100 were titrated until participants achieved the target fasting SMPG of 70 mg/dl or higher to less than 100 mg/dl (≥ 3.9 to < 5.6 mmol/L), while avoiding hypoglycaemia. Dose adjustments for Gla‐300 and IDeg‐100 were based on median fasting SMPG values from the previous 3 days, including values recorded on the day of titration, as measured by the participants using glucometers. The mealtime insulin analogue was also actively titrated to achieve the 2‐hour postprandial SMPG target (≥ 130 to ≤ 180 mg/dl [≥ 7.2 to ≤ 10 mmol/L]), while avoiding hypoglycaemia. The dose was titrated at least weekly (but not more often than every 3 days). The best efforts were made to reach the targets by 8 weeks after randomization; thereafter, the dose was maintained until the end of the study. CGM data were blinded to both investigators and participants. Post‐treatment safety information was collected 2‐4 days after the last insulin dose.

### Best practices and tools for titrating basal insulins: expert opinion from an Indian panel via the modified Delphi consensus method [^113BtUQi]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance of SMBG in the Optimization of Titration

The desired frequency of SMBG testing for insulin dose adjustments is often debated in clinical practice. In persons with T2DM on bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or only a basal insulin, only fasting state (i.e. before breakfast) SMBG is required. In persons taking more than one insulin, SMBG testing before each meal and before the bedtime snack is needed. The guideline-recommended frequency of SMBG testing is very unrealistic in practice. Therefore, a defined frequency of SMBG testing during titration and after achievement of the agreed-upon targets, which is more realistic and practical, is the need of the hour.

### Glimepiride combined with morning insulin glargine, bedtime neutral protamine hagedorn insulin, or bedtime insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes. A randomized, controlled trial [^113QNY7G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with type 2 diabetes are often treated with oral antidiabetic agents plus a basal insulin.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of glimepiride combined with either morning or bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design

Open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

111 centers in 13 European countries.

Patients

695 patients with type 2 diabetes who were previously treated with oral antidiabetic agents.

Intervention

Randomization to treatment with morning insulin glargine, bedtime NPH insulin, or bedtime insulin glargine for 24 weeks in addition to 3 mg of glimepiride. The insulin dose was titrated by using a predefined regimen to achieve fasting blood glucose levels of 5.56 mmol/L or lower (≤ 100 mg/dL).

Measurements

Hemoglobin A(1c) values, blood glucose levels, insulin dose, and body weight.

Results

Hemoglobin A(1c) levels improved by -1.24% (two-sided 90% CI, -1.10% to -1.38%) with morning insulin glargine, by -0.96% (CI, -0.81% to -1.10%) with bedtime insulin glargine, and by -0.84% (CI, -0.69% to -0.98%) with bedtime NPH insulin. Hemoglobin A(1c) improvement was more pronounced with morning insulin glargine than with NPH insulin (0.40% [CI, 0.23% to 0.58%]; P = 0.001) or bedtime insulin glargine (0.28% [CI, 0.11% to 0.46%]; P = 0.008). Baseline to end-point fasting blood glucose levels improved similarly in all three groups. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was less frequent with morning (39 of 236 patients [17%]) and bedtime insulin glargine (52 of 227 patients [23%]) than with bedtime NPH insulin (89 of 232 patients [38%]) (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

The risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia was lower with glimepiride in combination with morning and bedtime insulin glargine than with glimepiride in combination with bedtime NPH insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Morning insulin glargine provided better glycemic control than did bedtime insulin glargine or bedtime NPH insulin.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^111Hdj7m]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)

SMBG in diabetes management helps in making treatment decisions and correcting insulin dose. For optimal use of SMBG, regular review and interpretation by both the patients and physicians is required. In those individuals injecting insulin more than two times per day, SMBG should be done at least three times per day. However, there is insufficient evidence on the number of times SMBG needs to be done in individuals on once-daily insulin therapy, with or without OADs. Evidence from East Africa on the adherence to SMBG has shown suboptimal glycemic control, especially among those who had to pay for glucose strips. For optimal diabetes care in the region, to achieve adherence to SMBG and optimal glycemic control, it has been suggested that patient education be given alongside free glucose strips. Once-daily testing (preferably in the morning) should be done to assess the efficacy of the basal insulin dose. When HbA1c is > 7.0% (> 53 mmol/mol) in spite of a satisfactory FPG, a second test should be performed after the largest meal of the day to exclude postprandial hyperglycemia. In a low-resource setting, it may be considered not cost-effective to perform a postprandial test if the HbA1c is at target.

Recommendation

Pragmatic suggestions for SMBG should accompany insulin prescriptions (Grade D, EL IV)
Basal insulin is best monitored by FPG, 1–2 times a week (Grade A, EL II)
Prandial insulin is best monitored by paired premeal and postmeal glucose values (Grade A, EL II)
Premixed insulin is initially monitored by prebreakfast and predinner glucose values, followed by postprandial values (Grade A, EL 2)

Exercise

Exercise increases insulin sensitivity, and blood glucose should be checked before and after exercise and appropriate action taken.

Recommendation

Check blood glucose before and after exercise, and take appropriate action. If exercise is enduring, e.g. bicycle riding, check blood glucose in between exercise and take appropriate action (Grade A LE I)

Obtaining a pre-operative glucose measurement prior to induction of general anesthesia is prudent in any diabetic patient. But the timing of this pre-operative glucose check is less clear-cut as it involves judgment based on multiple parameters such as recent prior glucose values, the types of medications given preoperatively for glycemic control and their timings, as well as NPO status. In this particular case our last glucose check was 0.5 h after administration of regular insulin or 1.5 h prior to anesthesia induction. Regular insulin has an onset of action of about 30 min and its duration peaks between 2 and 4 h after dosing. The patient received long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus) 6 h prior to surgery; though it does not really peak, its duration of action can be as long as 12–24 h. This, combined with the regular insulin, whose effect was still increasing at the time of induction, meant that the last pre-op check at 1.5 h prior to induction did not capture the nadir glucose trajectory. In hindsight, a pre-operative glucose measurement closer to induction would have been more reflective of the situation.

Sometime patients are scheduled to undergo anesthesia for an elective surgery at a given time but unforeseen developments delay the procedure by a few hours. In this case the hyperglycemia took hours to correct and this resulted in a morning scheduled surgery instead delayed to the afternoon. The unintended consequence of this was an extended NPO period which further contributed to poor glycemic control. Early-on in management, when the hyperglycemia was being aggressively corrected, a low-dose concurring infusion of D5W sugar could have benefited this patient by reducing the likelihood of hypoglycemia from over correction.

If we knew that the patient was hypoglycemic, we would have delayed induction and instead treated the hypoglycemia. However, the patient only started complaining of hypoglycemic symptoms on induction after we started infusing the anesthetic. The intra-operative glucose check immediately after induction was prompted because of inkling from what the patient verbally expressed on induction.

2.3 Interventions

After randomization, Gla‐300 was self‐administered subcutaneously once daily, with doses according to the European Union label, taking into account history of insulin use (Table S2). The time of daily administration was defined at the randomization visit by the participant and investigator, and maintained for the duration of the study, with occasional variation of ± 3 h in injection time if necessary.

Paper diaries were dispensed to participants at each on‐site visit, and collected for review at each subsequent on‐site visit. Diaries contained instructions for managing glycaemic values according to each participant's allocated titration arm. Participants were trained at visits 1 and 2 (and re‐trained as necessary during the study) in how to complete these diaries to record information related to hypoglycaemic events, self‐monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and insulin doses. Insulin dose was to be adjusted to a fasting SMPG target of 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L as per 2015 ADA recommendations, while avoiding hypoglycaemia. 11 During telephone call "visits", participants were also asked about their last fasting SMPG values, insulin dose and any adverse event (including hypoglycaemic events) they had experienced. In both arms, the Gla‐300 dose was to be adjusted based on the median of the last three consecutive fasting SMPG values from the past 3 to 4 days and including the day of adjustment, according to the titration algorithm presented in Table S3. In the physician‐managed titration algorithm, doses were titrated at each visit according to study design (weekly for the first 8 weeks, bi‐weekly until week 12, and then monthly until week 24). In the self‐managed titration algorithm, the dose was titrated every 3 to 4 days. Participants in the self‐managed group were instructed on the use of the algorithm but made decisions regarding titration on their own. All participants received the same training on use of the injection device and titration algorithm prior to randomization, at the first and second site visit, and training was repeated as often as necessary until participants could demonstrate competent unaided use. It was expected that most titrations to reach the target fasting SMPG would occur during the first 12 weeks of treatment with Gla‐300, but titration to achieve target could continue until week 24.

Treatments

All patients received a single daily subcutaneous (SC) injection of insulin glargine, the initial dose being 50% of the total daily insulin dose from the patient's previous treatment. The timing of insulin glargine administration was based on the needs of individual patients. A change in timing was permitted during the first 6 months after randomization if deemed appropriate by the investigator; however, the change could be made only once per patient. Weekly dose titration was based on the mean of the fasting 3-day SMBG values to achieve a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of < 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) and an HbA 1c level of < 7.0% (Table 1). The dose increase could be split into two or more incremental increases over the course of the week.

5.3 	Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patients and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

The long-acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between SEMGLEE and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been estimated that more than 30 million people in the United States, ~9.4% of the total US population, are living with diabetes. 1 Of these, the majority has type 2 diabetes. 1 Given the progressive loss of β‐cell function in type 2 diabetes, most patients will eventually require insulin therapy to achieve and maintain glycaemic targets. 2 The introduction of basal insulin analogues more than a decade ago has made it easier for primary care physicians to engage in the treatment of insulin‐requiring patients and to intensify insulin therapy, with lower rates of hypoglycaemia achieved compared with non‐modified human insulins. 3 This is critically important because ~90% of type 2 diabetes care is carried out in the primary care setting. 4, 5 Treat‐to‐target titration trials have helped define the initiation and titration of basal insulin analogues contingent on achieving fasting plasma glucose (FPG) targets. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, although basal insulin provides a steady level of insulin throughout the day and helps to control FPG levels by lowering baseline plasma glucose, it has no direct effect on postprandial plasma glucose (PPG). 10, 11 As diabetes progresses, β‐cell function diminishes, resulting in greater PPG excursions and high levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). 12, 13 Increasing basal insulin doses in such patients has limited effect on PPG, and higher doses may result in "over‐basalization", 12 which has been reported to increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. 12, 13 At this point, treatment intensification is required.

Study treatment and procedures

Gla-300 was to be administered before breakfast, between 6:00 and 10:00 AM. The injection time was defined at the start of the study, maintained as reference time for the whole duration of the study, and should be documented daily. By study protocol, the recommended starting dose of Gla-300 was as follows: (1) when switching from BID Gla-100 to Gla-300, the recommended starting OD dose was the same as the previous daily Gla-100 dose; (2) when switching from other BID basal insulin products to OD Gla-300, the recommended initial Gla-300 dose was 80% of the total daily dose of basal insulin agent that was discontinued. The dose of Gla-300 was adjusted to a target range according to fasting SMBG between 70 and 130 mg/dL (3.9–7.2 mmol/L) as per ADA 2015 Clinical Practice recommendations. The algorithm for titration of Gla-300 is shown in Supplement Table 1. In case of a single fasting SMBG measurement below 3.9 mmol/L (below 70 mg/dL), it was recommended to decrease Gla-300 dose by 1 U.

Hypoglycemia prevalence in people with T2D

In a trial of participants with T2D treated with insulin glargine, hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose ≤ 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL)) was detected in 56.9% of the participants by open-label, 3-day, blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) as compared with 26.4% of the participants by their 8-point profile, self-monitored blood glucose. In a study using 5-day blinded CGM, Gehlaut et al found that 75% of participants with T2D were unaware of hypoglycemic episodes (defined as glucose < 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)) detected by CGM. While best practice is to confirm suspected or CGM-identified hypoglycemia by self-monitored blood glucose, it is clear that much hypoglycemia objectively identified by CGM is not checked when CGM readings are not available in real-time. These studies suggest that the frequency of hypoglycemia in T2D is much higher than previously appreciated by both clinicians or people with T2D themselves.

Insulin treatment duration and hypoglycemia rates

In a multicenter observational study, UK researchers recruited individuals with either T2D or T1D to participate in a 9-month to 12-month prospective study in which their hypoglycemic burden was measured by questionnaires and CGM. People with T2D were divided into three treatment groups: insulin for < 2 years, insulin for > 5 years and sulfonylureas. The study reported in 2007 that self-reported severe hypoglycemic episodes occurred in about 7% of the group with T2D who had been taking insulin for < 2 years, a frequency comparable to the group taking sulfonylureas. The group with T2D taking insulin for over 5 years had a significantly higher risk of severe hypoglycemia, with around 25% reporting a severe hypoglycemic episode during the study. Thus, between 2 and 5 years of insulin treatment, rates of self-reported severe hypoglycemia in individuals with T2D had tripled.

The UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group also reported that the proportion of patients with T2D taking insulin for over 5 years who reported at least one severe hypoglycemic event was comparable to that of adults with T1D diagnosed within the last 5 years, and lower than adults with T1D for > 15 years. Although reported per-person-year rates of hypoglycemia are higher for T1D than insulin-treated T2D, there are many more people with insulin-treated T2D, resulting in more events of hypoglycemia (especially severe hypoglycemia resulting in hospitalization) among the insulin-treated T2D population.

### BeAM value: an indicator of the need to initiate and intensify prandial therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving basal insulin [^115kCv9s]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adequate glycemic control is associated with reduction in the risk of developing long-term complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, owing to the progressive nature of the disease, persistent treatment modifications are often required. When lifestyle modifications and treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) fail to achieve normoglycemia, timely initiation of single-dose basal insulin treatment is a convenient, effective, and widely recommended strategy. Initiation of basal insulin has become an acceptable option more readily implemented by primary care providers. However, a common barrier to achieving glycemic goals is the inadequate titration of basal insulin dose. Several provider-driven or patient-driven algorithms have been established to promote easy upward titration of basal insulin doses, and most of them focus on achieving a specific fasting blood glucose (FBG) target. Even studies using forced titration algorithms fail to achieve the intended FBG targets, or do so at the expense of frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia. Despite basal insulin titration, A1C and FBG eventually reach a plateau, and primary providers may continue up-titration of basal insulin to reduce A1C and/or FBG levels, causing inadvertent overinsulinization. In a study using forced titration algorithms of basal insulin to five different FBG targets, a 20 U dose difference between the extreme groups resulted in only 0.25% difference in A1C, and a post hoc analysis of three insulin glargine trials also found that with titration beyond 0.5 U/kg, there was little fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reduction, and further consideration of whether continued up-titration of basal insulin alone with little evidence for further reductions in blood glucose measures is the best therapeutic approach.

a Responses are individualized. Monitoring blood glucose levels before and after exercise and every 60 min during a long bout of exercise will help identify trends in glucose levels

Many of the new agents to treat diabetes are less likely to cause hypoglycemia than the older classes of medications. In addition to metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV) inhibitors and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are all excellent choices for people who are at risk of hypoglycemia. Older medication classes, such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides, should generally be avoided by patients who are at high risk for hypoglycemia.

An understanding of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the various insulin preparations is important when the aim is to modify insulin dosing to prevent hypoglycemia. In addition, there are insulins that are associated with less frequent hypoglycemia, and thus a change in insulin preparation may help reduce the frequency of low glucose readings. The pharmacokinetics of common insulin types is shown in Table 6. Most notably, the intermediate-action insulin isophane, also known as NPH, and regular insulin are associated with more frequent hypoglycemic episodes than the long-acting glargine, detemir and degludec insulins, particularly at night. The authors of a 2017 study comparing degludec insulin (a once-daily ultra-long-acting insulin) to glargine insulin in over 7000 patients at high risk for CVD reported that compared to patients using glargine, patients on degludec showed a 40% reduction in severe hypoglycemia and a 53% reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia (p < 0.001).

### An overview of insulin therapy for the non-specialist [^115hGYym]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Usually what will be considered is the use of basal insulin, as the recommended starter insulin in T2DM, often following the use or trial of a GLP‐1RA and oral agents (Figure 3). One relatively new advantage of this scenario is that the patient will often be familiar with injections and pen injectors, but as a minimum, the following expertise should be present in any insulin management team: (1) Familiarity with one type of insulin pen injector usually dispensing insulin Gla100 — these devices are very easy to use, but there can be issues around for example storage and checking for problems before each injection, and these need to be understood and communicated. Originator and biosimilar versions are available, but the injectors are often brand‐specific, so need to be so prescribed. (2) Familiarity with a finger‐prick self‐monitoring system — devices from the major long‐established manufacturers are recommended as more reliably accurate and precise. Again such familiarity is easily gained, but must be enough to instil confidence in prospective users. (3) Materials to support a simple continuing dose‐escalation algorithm such as a starting dose of 10 U/day and escalation every 2–3 days by 2 U if no evidence of hypoglycaemic glucose levels, and the expectation that support for this will last a small number of months. (4) Other diabetes education facilities and materials; will be present from earlier activities of the diabetes team, but issues around calorie intake and risk of hypoglycaemia will need to be addressed again for emphasis, as well as foreign travel and sick day rules.

FIGURE 3
A scheme to guide starting insulin in routine ambulatory care for the non‐specialist. The dose titration regimen follows from reference. The scheme can be adapted to differing levels of team expertise. T2DM, type 2 diabetes.

It is not enough simply to start inulin. The final dose expectation will be around 30–80 U/day taken late evening, with a range of 10–150 U/day, so may only be reached after some months. Given human nature continued supportive contact is needed to ensure continued dose titration (Figure 3). Once the FPG target is achieved, active titration will cease, but with the expectation of a slow increment in dose over the years as endogenous insulin secretion further declines. Concomitant glucose‐lowering medication should be tailed off, with the exception of metformin and GLP‐1RAs if tolerated — beware of precipitating a rapid deterioration in glucose control before an adequate insulin dose is achieved (Figure 3).

2.1	Important Administration Instructions

Administer Insulin glargine subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day.
Prior to initiation of Insulin glargine, train patients on proper use and injection technique.
Patient should follow the Instructions for Use to correctly administer Insulin glargine.
Administer Insulin glargine subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6)].
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Visually inspect Insulin glargine vials and SoloStar prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles.
The Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments.
Use Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose.
Refrigerate unused (unopened) Insulin glargine vials and SoloStar®prefilled pens.
Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump.
Do not dilute or mix Insulin glargine with any other insulin or solution.
The SoloStar prefilled pen is for single patient use only [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin glargine based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Self-monitoring of blood glucose: practical aspects [^112ughe7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) should be part of a regular management plan for patients with diabetes. Self-monitoring of blood glucose provides information regarding an individual's dynamic blood glucose profile. This information can help with the appropriate scheduling of food, activity, and medication. It is also required for understanding of the timing of blood glucose variations. Lack of regular SMBG predicts hospitalization for diabetes-related complications. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential tool for people with diabetes who are taking insulin or for those who experience fluctuations in their blood glucose levels, especially hypoglycemia. Application of practical aspects that aid in easy management of SMBG makes the task of checking blood glucose more achievable. For patients taking insulin and adjusting their dose, SMBG is needed for self-management. For others receiving oral medication, profiling glucose trends and the confirmation of high or low blood glucose can be a useful addendum to successful management.

2.2 Basal insulin titration

All patients were instructed to self‐administer a daily subcutaneous injection of Gla‐300 (Toujeo SoloStar®, Sanofi) in the evening, anytime from dinner to bedtime. Gla‐300 was administered at a starting dose of 0.2 U/kg and then adjusted at each visit in the physician‐managed arm, and weekly or even more frequently (but no more often than every 3‐4 days) in the patient (nurse‐assisted) managed arm to achieve a fasting self‐monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) of 80‐110 mg/dL. In both groups, changes in the insulin dose were based on the median of the fasting SMPG values measured on three consecutive days, of which the last was the day when titration was scheduled. Patients randomized to self‐managing insulin titration received a specific educational session regarding self‐adjustment of insulin dose from the study nurse, who monitored algorithm application without however exerting any influence on titration. The patient‐ and physician‐managed titration algorithm is shown in Table S1.

Rescue therapy, if needed, either by adding a new OAD and/or by increasing the dose of an existing antihyperglycaemic non‐study drug, was based on the Investigator's judgement, considering primarily the patient's individual clinical needs, but also local guidelines and Gla‐300 labelling. 17 Further details of the titration protocol are also provided in the Appendix.

At randomization, investigators provided patients with a blood glucometer (MyStar Extra®; Sanofi) and diary to assess and record daily fasting SMPG until it was stable at the target. A seven‐point SMPG profile was measured at Week 12 and Week 24. The investigator explained the need to measure glucose at the times requested by the study and to record the values correctly in the diary that the patients brought along with the glucometer at each office visit.

Patients were instructed to measure capillary plasma glucose whenever they experienced symptoms of hypoglycaemia. All hypoglycaemia episodes were recorded in the patient's diary or documented in the "hypoglycaemia screen/page" of the electronic case report form (e‐CRF). Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was any event that occurred between 00:00 and 05:59. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate or glucagon or to perform other resuscitative actions.

### Which patients should be evaluated for blood glucose variability? [^113qLrqk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is characterized by glycaemic disorders that include both sustained chronic hyperglycaemia and acute fluctuations (i.e.g.lycaemic variability). Increasing attention is being paid to the role of glycaemic variability as a relevant determinant for diabetes control and prevention of its vascular complications. As a consequence, it is strongly suggested that a global antidiabetic strategy should be aimed at reducing to a minimum the different components of glycaemic control (i.e. HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, as well as glycaemic variability). Subjects at risk of hypoglycaemia, subjects with postprandial hyperglycaemia and patients who need to adjust or start insulin seem to be the categories that require glycaemic variability monitoring. The analysis of blood glucose variability represents an additional tool in the global assessment of glycaemic control and can serve as a guide to the clinician in the management of therapy and for the patients both in the prevention of acute complications, in particular hypoglycaemia, and chronic disease, in particular macrovascular complications.

Tools for Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Second-generation basal insulin analogues (Gla-300 and degludec) are associated with the lowest risk of hypoglycemia, which can be further reduced by implementing timely therapy initiation, proper patient education, and SMBG. Hypoglycemia and need for monitoring is reduced with BOT as compared with basal bolus.
Regular SMBG is recommended in patients with diabetes on multiple daily insulin injections, with a history of hypoglycemia, and with poor metabolic control with multiple GLAs and/or basal insulin.
SMBG should be performed at least as often as insulin is administered. The ideal SMBG requirement is seven tests/day, i.e. three before and three after each meal and one test at 3 am. As a compromise, one fasting test and three each after breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily may be more feasible as well as acceptable. This can be further individualized to twice or thrice a week in pregnant patients as the pregnancy advances. Two-hour post-meal monitoring may be easier to remember, as this timing is routinely used. For patients on intensive insulin regimens who are on multiple doses of insulin or on insulin pumps, testing should be carried out three or more times daily (all pre-meals, post-meals, at bedtime, and prior to exercise). Some patients may require testing 6–10 (or more) times daily. Pregnant women with insulin-treated diabetes must be advised to perform SMBG on a daily basis. However, in case of any failure to do so, at least weekly monitoring should be encouraged. Meal-based testing schemes such as 5- and 7-point regimens and the staggered-frequency regimen can help to show the effect of food consumed on the rise in blood glucose after specific mealtimes.
Monitoring hypoglycemia in patients: Severe hypoglycemia is a common acute complication in people with diabetes being treated with insulin, and its incidence increases with the duration of insulin therapy. A basal insulin switch from conventional to long-acting or to ultra-long-acting preparations may be indicated if a particular insulin cannot be uptitrated due to hypoglycemia or glycemic variability.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). There are separate Instructions for Use for TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar.

Never Share a TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar Pen Between Patients

Advise patients that they must never share TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar pen with another person even if the needle is changed. Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia

Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., impaired ability to concentrate and react). This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Inform patients that if they change to TOUJEO from other basal insulins they may experience higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy. Advise patients to monitor glucose daily when initiating TOUJEO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Low-volume insulin degludec 200 units / mL once daily improves glycemic control similarly to insulin glargine with a low risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week, randomized, controlled, multinational, Treat-to-target trial: the BEGIN LOW VOLUME trial [^116QGQ91]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The limitations of the trial should be considered when interpreting the results. First, this study was not conducted in a double-blind fashion. Open-label trial designs pose an underlying risk for greater caution with adjustment of doses for the new drug (in this case IDeg 200 units/mL) and can impose bias in patient-reported outcomes. Second, the duration of the study (26 weeks) may be regarded as a limitation of the trial, especially in comparison with other 52-week insulin trials. From this and other trials of longer duration, however, it is evident that HbA 1c levels stabilize by 26 weeks, thus allowing a relevant estimate of treatment effect. The results from this trial comparing IDeg 200 units/mL with IGlar are consistent with results from the previously published 52-week phase 3 (BEGIN) trials comparing IDeg 200 units/mL with IGlar. The shorter duration of 26 weeks may, however, have led to an underestimation of the potential benefits of IDeg 200 units/mL, because as T2DM progresses more patients are likely to require larger doses of insulin. Third, although IDeg 200 units/mL resulted in a statistically significantly greater FPG reduction than did IGlar after 26 weeks of treatment as measured in the central laboratory, this was not seen in the SMBG data. This difference probably reflects a higher degree of accuracy from the central laboratory compared with the individual self-reported fingerstick test results seen in the SMBG data. Moreover, the weekly titrations were based on the mean of the preceding 3 days' SMBG values, recorded by a handheld home monitoring meter and measured prebreakfast (and thus often early in the morning), whereas the target FPG was based on a single central laboratory value taken at the clinic. Overall, about a third of the patients achieved the fasting glucose target, although the algorithm appeared to be adhered to as evaluated by the concordance between the prescribed dose and the dose recommended by the algorithm. Finally, the timing of the daily dose of basal insulin was not recorded unless there was a hypoglycemic event associated with treatment administration, so the potential effects of differences in daily dose timing of IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar on hypoglycemia cannot be evaluated.

This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Risk of clinically relevant hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes self-titrating insulin glargine U-100 [^113VZ6P3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since its introduction to the market in 2000, insulin glargine (IGlar) 100 U/mL has been perceived as the gold standard basal insulin analogue 1 and continues to be a benchmark for other therapies. 2 Lessons from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for IGlar, including effective use of titration algorithms (treat‐to‐target), have been adopted broadly in clinical practice for glargine and other basal insulins. 3 Simplicity of treatment regimen and the relatively low risk of hypoglycaemia contribute to the growing popularity of adding basal insulin analogues to existing treatments as a way to introduce insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who are no longer controlled with oral glucose‐lowering medications. 4

Despite the high efficacy of insulin treatment shown in RCTs, patients in the real world frequently fail to achieve the desired level of glycaemic control. 5 There are multiple explanations, but one is lack of effective up‐titration, with patients continuing therapy at suboptimal doses of basal insulin. Reluctance to increase an insulin dose might be related to the fear of hypoglycaemia or of weight gain among patients or health care providers (HCPs). Also, the HC may lack expertise in dose adjustment, or may not have the resources or ability to monitor the titration process. 6

### Switching from glargine + insulin aspart to glargine + insulin aspart 30 before breakfast combined with exercise after dinner and dividing meals for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients with poor glucose control-a prospective cohort study [^116jaUen]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Meal adjustment algorithm in patients receiving glargine+premixed insulin before breakfast. All the patients were required to exercise 30 min (moderate intensity) after dinner

In addition, patients were given oral administration of acarbose at dinner (minimum and maximum doses of 50 mg qd and 100 mg tid) and metformin (minimum and maximum doses of 0.5 g bid and 1.0 g bid). At the same time, they stopped taking secretagogues, TZDs, and DPP-IV inhibitors. The doses of insulin and oral drugs were adjusted according to the blood profiles. Patients were asked to have regular meal times. The purpose of the treatment was to achieve 2 h PG < 11.0 mmol/L and the target HbA1c level was set to 7.5%.

Stable period (5–16 weeks)

Once adjusted, the treatment protocol was maintained for 12 weeks, and had to remain unchanged. Nevertheless, if fine adjustments were needed due to disease conditions, the dose of glargine and variety of oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin tablet and acarbose tablet) could only be reduced rather than increased, while the doses of insulin aspart 30 could be increased or decreased.

Data collection

The following baseline data were recorded: age, gender, course of disease, insulin dose, BMI, HbA1c, fasting glucose, glucose before and 2 h after meals, glucose before sleep and insulin injection time-point before main meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner). At the 16th weekend, HbA1c was measured.

Study drugs

In this study, insulin glargine (Lantus) (Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France) and insulin aspart 30 (NovoMix 30 Flexpen) (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) were selected, both of which were injected simultaneously and separately on both sides around the umbilicus before breakfast. Other drugs included metformin tablet (Glucophage) (Bristol-Meyer Squibb, New York, NY, USA) and 100 mg Glucobay (acarbose tablet) (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Montville, NJ, USA).

### Effect of insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 on hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes: the SWITCH 2 randomized clinical trial [^1128uBQT]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypoglycemia, a serious risk for insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, negatively affects glycemic control.

Objective

To test whether treatment with basal insulin degludec is associated with a lower rate of hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target crossover trial including two 32-week treatment periods, each with a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period. The trial was conducted at 152 US centers between January 2014 and December 2015 in 721 adults with type 2 diabetes and at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor who were previously treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 (n = 361) or to receive insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec (n = 360) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed [< 56 mg/dL]) during the maintenance period. Secondary end points were the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed, occurring between 12:01 am and 5:59 am) and the proportion of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period.

Results

Of the 721 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [10.5] years; 53.1% male), 580 (80.4%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 185.6 vs 265.4 episodes per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE) (rate ratio = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.61–0.80]; P < .001; difference, -23.66 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, -33.98 to -13.33]), and the proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 22.5% vs 31.6% (difference, -9.1% [95% CI, -13.1% to -5.0%]). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 55.2 vs 93.6 episodes/100 PYE (rate ratio = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.46–0.74]; P < .001; difference, -7.41 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, -11.98 to -2.85]), and the proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 9.7% vs 14.7% (difference, -5.1% [95% CI, -8.1% to -2.0%]). The proportions of patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.7%) for insulin degludec vs 2.4% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.7%) for insulin glargine U100 (McNemar P = 0.35; risk difference, -0.8% [95% CI, -2.2% to 0.5%]). Statistically significant reductions in overall and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were also seen for the full treatment period.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor, 32 weeks' treatment with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 resulted in a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Basal and prandial insulin dosing considerations emphasize flexibility, dose differences, and interchangeability. For degludec, "Flexible dosing with at least 8 to 40 hours between injections was not associated with increased hypo- or hyperglycemia". For detemir, "Up to 40% to 50% of persons may require twice daily dosing (with 12 hours after the morning dose)". For glargine U300, "Persons with type 1 diabetes may require ~15% to 30% higher dose compared with glargine U100". The biosimilars section notes interchangeability and substitution: "Biosimilar designation allows the drugs to be interchangeable with the reference drug and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow pharmacists to substitute without the need for an authorized prescription", and advises, "Clinicians should refer to the FDA — approved prescribing information for the most current official product information on any of the insulins". For prandial insulins, "Based on onset of action, insulin should be taken at appropriate time to match the postprandial glucose absorption. All can be used in insulin pumps with preference given to rapid-acting insulins".

Web-Based Technology

The internet provides a readily accessible platform for real-time communication between patients and HCPs, exchange of information, and remote health monitoring. Patients can upload their BG readings to secure web-based platforms for the clinician to review and subsequently send back suggested changes in insulin dose and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) frequency, or even to provide feedback. Alternatively, platforms can be built to provide insulin titration advice directly to the patient, based on a built-in titration algorithm. Web-based platforms can reduce the need for appointments with a physician solely for the purpose of insulin titration, and can be a more cost-effective method of follow-up, especially for patients who live in rural areas.

A study showed significant improvements in glycemic control for patients with T2DM using an internet-based glucose monitoring system (IBGMS) for insulin titration compared with standard care (i.e. face-to-face appointments with the endocrinologist). Patients in the standard care group were required to keep a record of their SMBG readings in a diary between visits to the endocrinologist. Patients in the IBGMS group had statistically significant HbA 1c improvements after 3 months that were sustained over 6 months, which was not observed in patients in the standard care group. Biweekly communication with the endocrinologist through the IBGMS system allowed patients to have more accurate adjustments of their insulin dose. In addition, SMBG testing reminders and ease of data tracking and analysis through the system's tables/graphs were all hypothesized to aid patients in the IBGMS group to achieve greater glycemic control than those receiving standard care.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114TPXyY]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Basal insulin management — risk reduction and overbasalization signals — states that long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine and degludec or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, that longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine, and that an initial dose reduction is reasonable and typically needed when switching from insulin detemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin; evaluation for overbasalization should be prompted by clinical signals such as bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥ 50 mg/dL [≥ 2.8 mmol/L].

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2022 guideline — glucose monitoring frequency recommends that A1C should be measured at least semiannually in all persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) and at least quarterly in persons not at their glycemic target (Grade B; BEL 2). It further states that all persons who use insulin should use CGM or perform blood glucose monitoring (BGM) a minimum of twice daily and ideally before any insulin injection, with more frequent BGM needed for those taking multiple injections, not at A1C targets, or with a history of hypoglycemia; persons not requiring insulin or insulin secretagogues may often benefit from BGM.

Table 1
Baseline patient characteristics (visit 1)

On the day of visit 1, all patients randomized into one of the groups receiving insulin were educated by a qualified diabetes nurse or a physician on the following topics: i) use of the insulin pen ii) injection techniques and dosage iii) hypoglycemia awareness and self treatment according to the guidelines of the German Diabetes Association. Patients receiving oral medication were educated concerning hypoglycemia awareness and self treatment only. All patients entering this trial were supplied with a device for blood glucose self monitoring (Accu-Check Aviva®, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim Germany). In patients randomized to receive either glargine or NPH insulin, therapy was initiated with subcutaneous injection of 4 international units at bedtime (usually around 10 p.m.). The dose was adjusted according to morning fasting glucose levels using a titration scheme that was handed out to each participant and aiming at fasting glucose levels < 100 mg/dl. Patients on oral medication were titrated to maximum dose using the following combinations: metformin alone, DPP4-inhibitors alone, sulfonylurea alone, metformin + DPP4-inhibitors, metformin + sulfonylurea, metformin + glinides, acarbose could be added to any of these combinations. All patients were provided with a diabetes diary at visit 1 in which daily insulin dose, daily morning fasting glucose self- measurements, one diurnal glucose profile weekly (4 pre-meal values) and possible hypoglycemic episodes were documented.

In order to discuss possible adverse events and to further adjust treatment telephone calls of the investigators with the participants took place 2 weeks and 2 months after the entry visit.

The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg (Ethic-Committee-No: AFm0-023/2007); all patients entered the study according to the guidelines after giving informed consent.

Laboratory parameters

On the day of all three visit time-points, ~ 20 mL of venous whole blood was drawn from the participants for measurement of the following routine parameters: HbA1c, glucose, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium), liver transaminases (GOT, GPT), creatinine and urea. The samples for routine parameters were sent to the department of clinical chemistry for analysis within 60 minutes after blood was drawn.

5.3 Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including BASAGLAR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). BASAGLAR, or any insulin, should not be used during episodes of hypoglycemia [see Contraindications (4)].

Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7)], or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.

Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia

The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of BASAGLAR may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The risk of hypoglycemia generally increases with intensity of glycemic control. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia

Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.

The long-acting effect of BASAGLAR may delay recovery from hypoglycemia.

5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors

Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between BASAGLAR and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.

### Comparison of insulin glargine 300 units / mL and 100 units / mL in adults with type 1 diabetes: continuous glucose monitoring profiles and variability using morning or evening injections [^114owB3b]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare glucose control in participants with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla-300) or glargine 100 units/mL (Gla-100) in the morning or evening, in combination with mealtime insulin.

Research Design and Methods

In this 16-week, exploratory, open-label, parallel-group, two-period crossover study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01658579), 59 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomized (1:1:1:1) to once-daily Gla-300 or Gla-100 given in the morning or evening (with crossover in the injection schedule). The primary efficacy end point was the mean percentage of time in the target glucose range (80–140 mg/dL), as measured using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), during the last 2 weeks of each 8-week period. Additional end points included other CGM glycemic control parameters, hypoglycemia (per self-monitored plasma glucose [SMPG]), and adverse events.

Results

The percentage of time within the target glucose range was comparable between the Gla-300 and Gla-100 groups. There was significantly less increase in CGM-based glucose during the last 4 h of the 24-h injection interval for Gla-300 compared with Gla-100 (least squares mean difference -14.7 mg/dL [95% CI -26.9 to -2.5]; P = 0.0192). Mean 24-h glucose curves for the Gla-300 group were smoother (lower glycemic excursions), irrespective of morning or evening injection. Four metrics of intrasubject interstitial glucose variability showed no difference between Gla-300 and Gla-100. Nocturnal confirmed (< 54 mg/dL by SMPG) or severe hypoglycemia rate was lower for Gla-300 participants than for Gla-100 participants (4.0 vs. 9.0 events per participant-year; rate ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.24–0.82]).

Conclusions

Less increase in CGM-based glucose levels in the last 4 h of the 24-h injection interval, smoother average 24-h glucose profiles irrespective of injection time, and reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia were observed with Gla-300 versus Gla-100.

Importance of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Following Initiation of Insulin Therapy

Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) constitutes one of the key tools for the management of diabetes mellitus. The self-monitoring of glucose levels encourages, empowers, and enables persons with diabetes to understand the effects of lifestyle changes and medications on their blood glucose levels. It also allows persons with diabetes to implement the required interventions to help improve their glycemic control. Evidence suggests improved glycemic control in persons with T2DM who regularly use SMBG. Self-monitoring of the blood glucose levels also helps persons detect hypoglycemia and adjust their insulin dosage appropriately.

At the initiation visit, clear instructions should be given to persons on how to self-monitor their blood glucose level. Simple and specific steps should be used to teach SMBG, based on each person's level of comprehension. Written recommendations for the frequency of testing and time of testing with desired results should be provided. The SMBG procedure should be taught at the initial visit and re-emphasized at follow-up visits.

Key Recommendations from Experts on Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose Following Insulin Initiation

### The importance of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients [^114c7brc]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

In addition, blood glucose monitoring (BGM), using any of the widely available self- monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) or interstitial glucose sampling using continuous glucose monitors (CGM); is an important part of management of diabetes; especially for people who experience hypoglycemic episodes. BGM provides an immediate evaluation of blood glucose levels; information that can be used to guide the therapy and to detect the hypoglycemia, and offers important feedback both to patients and to the health cares about glycemic control and patient treatment satisfaction. CGM may be particularly important for patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or patients experiencing frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.

It is important that in patients with a history of recurrent hypoglycemia, the time of episodes be identified and the treatment regimen be adjusted accordingly. With a basal-bolus insulin regimen, morning fasting hypoglycemia may be caused by the long- or intermediate- acting insulin; daytime hypoglycemia is implicated by rapid or short acting insulin; and nocturnal hypoglycemia may be implicated by either. Substitution of short-acting (regular) insulin with rapid-acting insulin (e.g. lispro or aspart) reduces frequency of daytime hypoglycemia. Substitution of long-acting (e.g. glargine or determir) insulin for intermediate- acting insulin (e.g. NPH or premix 70/30) reduces frequency of nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a rapid-acting insulin analog improves the glycemic control and reduces the rate of hypoglycemia compared with multiple daily insulin injection.

Patients on oral anti-diabetic drugs are also at risk for developing hypoglycemia. Agents such as metformine, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidines are preferable to sulfonylureas in minimizing hypoglycemic risks.

Glycemic goals should be individualized with some degree of safety particularly for patients with long duration of diabetes; patients who have a high risk of severe hypoglycemia development, and/or subjects with multiple co-morbidities. Individualized treatment should be determined by a close working relationship between diabetes care team and the patients. The health care professionals may improve patient knowledge and produce positive changes in life style and self-care decisions. The diabetes care team involvement not only provides the initial patient's guidance, but also monitors the short and long term complications for early detection and management.

### Glycemic variability and time in range during self-titration of once daily insulin glargine 300 U / mL versus neutral protamine hagedorn insulin in insulin-naïve Chinese type 2 diabetes patients [^113aQneL]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Each patient was randomized to either Gla-300 or NPH insulin to be administered once daily between 9 p.m. and 12 midnight at approximately the same time every day. The starting doses of Gla-300 and NPH were both 0.2U/kg for comparison. Insulin was self-titrated weekly based on an average of three fasting SMBG readings per week, aiming for a mean fasting SMBG target of 4.4–6.0 mmol/l. Insulin was increased by 1U per week if the mean value was greater than the pre-set target. Patients were asked to contact the study team for adjustment of insulin doses if the average SMBG was ≥ 3.3 and < 4.4 mmol/l. The study team would decrease insulin by ≥ 2 U (according to investigator discretion) if SMBG < 3.3 mmol/l or severe or multiple symptomatic hypoglycemic events occurred.

The study consisted of seven pre-specified on-site visits at weeks − 1, 0, 4, 11, 12 and 24 and three telephone visits. Following randomization at week 0, phone visits were conducted at week 1, 2 and 8 to report on SMBG, insulin titration, and any hypoglycemia or adverse events. Patients were instructed on the self-titration algorithm at randomization, reinforced as necessary during the first 12 weeks of self-titration. Masked CGMs for determination of GV and TIR were collected for 7 consecutive days at baseline (week – 1), week 11 and week 24 using the Medtronic iPro2™ with Elite sensor (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) with frequency of calibrations as recommended by the manufacturer. Raw CGM data were inspected and only patients with at least 70% valid sensor data were included in the analysis. Other secondary outcomes were measured at weeks 0, 12 and 24.

Rescue Medications

The doses and regimen of concomitant OGLDs remained stable throughout the study unless the patient fulfilled the rescue criteria. After week 12, rapid-acting acting prandial insulin (Actrapid or Humulin R) was added before the largest meal at the investigators' discretion, if FPG could not be lowered below < 11 mmol/l or HbA1c < 8.5% (< 69.4 mmol/mol). Participants were continued on OGLDs throughout the study, with doses of sulfonylureas/glinides adjusted if ≥ 2 symptomatic or one severe hypoglycemic episode occurred, even after adjustment of insulin.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^116nihrb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Choosing a more aggressive starting dose may save approximately 15 days of titration based on a 10‐unit difference and the typical rate at which insulin can be titrated. As prompt glycemic control is typically considered 6 months, the 15 days saved during titration may be more or less meaningful. Potential, though perhaps not established, benefits of starting with a more conservative basal insulin dose include minimising the risk for hypoglycaemia and increased tolerability, as rapid correction of hyperglycemia may precipitate feelings of hypoglycaemia even with blood glucose concentration greater than 70 mg/dL. Regardless, most initial doses are likely to be under what the patient needs; therefore, avoiding clinical inertia is paramount. Basal insulin titration is typically continued until the FPG goal is reached or a total dose of 0.5 units/kg/day is reached, at which time a holistic review of antidiabetic therapy should be made and prandial targeted therapy considered to avoid overbasalisation. Basal insulin doses are typically decreased following hypoglycaemic events, typically by 10%–20% for an FPG of < 70 mg/dL and by 20%–40% for an FPG of < 40 mg/dL. The competing concern with titration schedules is attempting to keep insulin regimens simple to prevent hypoglycaemia and maintain quality of life. One approach to maintaining simple insulin regimens is using GLP‐1 RAs to address prandial control before bolus insulin.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Population

This was a multicentre, open-label, two-arm parallel-group study conducted between 15 December 2011 and 4 September 2013 in 13 countries (three in North America and nine in Europe and South Africa). The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT01499082. The appropriate ethics committees approved the protocol and the study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.

Comprehensive details of the study design and participant population have been reported previously. In summary, participants ≥ 18 years of age with T2DM (World Health Organization definition) using basal insulin plus meal-time insulin analogue were randomized (1: 1) to receive once-daily injections of either Gla-300 or Gla-100 with meal-time insulin. Candidates were excluded if they used human meal-time insulin or any premixed or basal insulin other than insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn or had started using new glucose-lowering agents and/or weight loss drugs in the 3 months before the screening visit. Further details on exclusion criteria have been reported previously. As previously described, once-daily injections of Gla-300 or Gla-100 in the evening were to be individually titrated once weekly throughout the study following the same dosing recommendations in both groups and seeking a fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) of 4.4–5.6 mmol/l (80–100 mg/dl). Dose adjustments of both insulins were limited to 3-unit increments or decrements because of the characteristics of the pen injectors used. Meal-time insulin was to be adjusted at the discretion of the site investigator based on SMPG data, including, when appropriate, preprandial or 2-h postprandial plasma glucose and consideration of the carbohydrate content of the meal, with the aim of optimizing glucose patterns while limiting hypoglycaemia. Participants who completed the 6-month treatment period continued to receive either Gla-300 or Gla-100 according to initial randomization, along with their meal-time insulin, for a further 6-month open-label extension phase. After the 6-month visit, only one visit to the study site (month 9) and two phone contacts (months 7.5 and 10.5) were required for participants before their 12-month visit.

Patients and Methods

A total of 18 patients with poorly controlled T1DM were recruited for this pilot study during routine outpatient visits (from County Hospital Cakovec, University Hospital Center Osijek and University Hospital Center "SestreMilosrdnice" Zagreb). In this observational longitudinal study, 18 patients (9 females, 9 males) that had been treated with an intensified insulin regimen (glargine at bedtime (09:00 or 10:00 p.m.) + lispro/aspart/glulisine prior to meals) for at least 1 year with an average Hba1c value ≥ 7%, frequent nocturnal and/or morning hypoglycemic episodes and high pre-dinner BG (blood glucose) values (≥ 7.1 mmol/L) were directly switched to morning administration (09:00 or 10:00 a.m.) of insulin glargine injection. The basal insulin was titrated using a simple algorithm seeking a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, while dosages of short acting insulin were calculated according to carbohydrates and pre-meal BG values. Prior the transition of glargine administration, there was a 12-week screening phase where patients continued their usual insulin regimen and were encouraged to achieve optimal glycemic control. Patients were also instructed to obtain 4-point and 8-point BG values determined by self-monitoring BG (SMBG). In addition, frequencies of hypoglycemic events were assessed using standard patient diaries. Frequent hypoglycemia was defined as approximately two to four times per week or more, nocturnal hypoglycemia applied to hypoglycemic events from bedtime to 06:00 a.m. whereas morning hypoglycemia encompassed all events from 06:00 a.m. until breakfast. Hypoglycemic episodes were defined as events with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia in which the patient had a BG level < 3.9 mmol/L or the event was associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate or intravenous glucose or subcutaneous glucagon administration and required another person's assistance (severe hypoglycemic episode). In addition, all events that were not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but a measured plasma glucose concentration was ≤ 3.9 mmol/L were included. At the end of the 12-week screening period, HbA1c levels and lipid profiles were determined. SMBG values and patient diaries were also assessed. All patients included at the screening phase maintained poor regulation of diabetes with an HbA1c level ≥ 7% (mean value 8.02 ± 0.5%). They also continued to have frequent nocturnal and/or morning hypoglycemic events and were therefore transitioned to morning application of insulin glargine. The primary objective was to investigate changes in HbA1c values 12 weeks after the transition (the end point). The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of transition on glucose variability, incidence of hypoglycemia, insulin doses, lipid profile and weight.

### Optimizing glycemic control through titration of insulin glargine 100 U / mL: a review of current and future approaches with a focus on Asian populations [^1134a39x]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The management of insulin therapy is a multidisciplinary team effort that involves specialists, primary care physicians, nurse educators, and patients. Due to the high prevalence of T2DM in Asia, it is vital that primary care providers, patients, and other HCPs are able to adequately manage insulin therapy; to achieve this, greater education and resources on the optimal titration of basal insulin need to be targeted at these groups.

The time and resource constraints that primary care physicians face could potentially be relieved through the use of modern technology, including web-based tools, mobile applications, cell-phone-based support, glucometers capable of uploading data to the web, and telephone hotlines. As an example, one of the authors of this paper has implemented the titration of insulin through the medium of SMS in his clinical practice in Indonesia. Patients send their SMBG readings by SMS every 3–7 days to their clinician (author) and receive advice via a return SMS regarding changes in their insulin dose. The author has reported that patients are satisfied with this method of communication because of its efficiency and the amount of attention from the physician that it affords. In another author's clinical practice in the Philippines, patients relay their SMBG readings through SMS or by phone call and accordingly receive advice on their readings through phone calls. Patients have reported satisfaction with this method as it saves on travel time to the clinic and circumvents the need to take time off work to attend clinic appointments.

Insulin Therapy

Since the introduction of exogenous insulins, insulin therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of diabetes, especially insulin-dependent forms, where different formulations can be used to meet patients' individual needs. These formulations include rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, and long-acting insulins, each designed to mimic the body's natural insulin response to meals.

The timing of long-acting insulin injections depends on factors like blood glucose levels, food consumption, exercise, and the types of insulin adopted. The optimal timing for administering long-acting insulin in clinical practice remains an area of ongoing investigation. While an evening administration is commonly employed, a 2015 study by Porcellati et al directly compared the PK and PD of insulin glargine after evening vs morning subcutaneous injection in individuals with T2DM, showing that the pharmacodynamic profile of insulin glargine differed based on the timing of administration. With morning dosing, insulin activity was greater during the initial 0 to 12-hour period. Conversely, evening administration resulted in enhanced activity in the subsequent 12- to 24-hour window post-injection. However, glargine PK, plasma C-peptide levels, and overall 24-hour PD were comparable between the 2 administration time points.

These results highlight that the differences in insulin activity are driven by circadian variations in insulin sensitivity, which is typically lower during the night and early morning hours compared to the afternoon, rather than an inherent property of insulin glargine itself. This study also highlights the need to consider the role of diurnal rhythms in insulin action when optimizing basal insulin therapy in patients with T2DM. For instance, morning administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients who receive glucocorticoids in the morning and experience glycemic spikes in the afternoon. In summary, evening administration of long-acting insulin is recommended for patients with T2DM not taking glucocorticoids, although it is not mandatory. For optimal blood glucose management, it is important to take long-acting insulin at the same time(s) each day, whether in the morning or at another consistent time (Fig. 1B).

For example, for a patient with elevated BG before dinner, an insulin injection at lunchtime would be introduced (dose based on BG reading and corresponding dose recommended in Table 1). G+L, insulin glargine plus lispro; LM50/50, insulin lispro mix 50/50; LM75/25, insulin lispro mix 75/25.

Hypoglycaemia events were assessed as to incidence (proportion of patients who experience hypoglycaemia), rate (per person per 30 days) and severity. Hypoglycaemia was defined as any time a patient experienced an associated sign or symptom, or had a BG level of < 3.9 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl), even if it was not associated with signs, symptoms or treatment. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia was defined as any hypoglycaemic event that occurred between bedtime and waking. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as an episode with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia in which the patient required the assistance of another person, and was associated with either a BG level of < 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, glucagon or intravenous glucose.

Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy measure was change in A1C from baseline to endpoint. Secondary efficacy measures were A1C, percentages of patients achieving A1C ≤ 6.5, < 7 and ≤ 7.0% and 7-point SMBG profiles over time; insulin dose (total, basal and prandial); number of injections per day; and safety, including hypoglycaemia (described earlier), weight change and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Blood, urine and serum samples were collected at screening (week 2). A1C was analysed by a central laboratory (Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA).

2.3 Randomization and monitoring

After initial screening, participants undertook a 2‐week run‐in period to assess adherence to CGM requirements (Figure 1). A criterion for randomization was that subjects were able and willing to adhere to the protocol including requirements and tolerability in regard to wearing the FreeStyle Libre Pro sensor, based on the investigator's opinion. During the study, participants were asked to conduct the CGM periods on days representing their normal daily life, not coinciding with any planned activities that would require assessments to be postponed (e.g. vacations, unusual strenuous exercise, overseas travel), or during local daylight‐saving clock shifts or travel across time zones. At the study start (Week 0), eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to either degludec or glargine 100 U/mL glargine U100, each once daily at the same time every day and according to local labels. Participants treated with one or more permitted OADs continued their pre‐trial OAD treatment throughout the trial, with no change of dose unless required for safety reasons. Each treatment period consisted of a 16‐week titration followed by a 2‐week maintenance period, during which participants wore the CGM device. They were then switched to the other trial product (glargine U100 or degludec) for a second treatment period (16‐week titration period followed by 2‐week maintenance period). Titration was performed once weekly (recommended blood glucose target: 3.9–5.0 mmol/L), with investigator guidance, based on a mean of three pre‐breakfast self‐measured blood glucose (SMBG) values (performed on 2 days prior to titration, and on the day of each visit, from Week 0 to Week 36 using a blood glucose meter provided by Novo Nordisk). For values in the target range, no adjustment was made. For values of 5.1 to 7.0 mmol/L, the basal insulin dose was increased by 2 units (U) and, for values of 7.1 to 8.0 mmol/L, it was increased by 4 U. Conversely, if one of the SMBG values was in the range 3.1 to 3.8 mmol/L, the basal insulin dose was reduced by 2 U; if it was < 3.1 mmol/L, the dose was reduced by 4 U. No maximum insulin dose was specified. Subjects were discontinued from the trial if there was initiation of bolus insulin, GLP‐1 receptor agonists, or other diabetes medication(s) for more than 14 continuous days. Intermittent bolus insulin treatment for periods of 14 days or fewer were permitted prior to the day of screening.

2 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

2.1 Study selection population

Data from participants in eligible studies were included in the analysis. Studies were eligible if they were at least 24 weeks in length and were prospective, randomized controlled treat‐to‐target trials, with protocol titration algorithms targeting an FPG < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). For inclusion in the present analysis, participants were required to have type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on insulin glargine U100 in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea and to have had at least six measurements of FPG taken during the study.

2.2 Outcomes

The HbA1c values, FPG level, and insulin dose values by 0.1‐IU/kg/d increases were assessed for each of the participants in the identified eligible studies at baseline and study endpoint; glycaemic data and incidence of hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose threshold: < 3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL] are presented for patients categorized by insulin dose at the study endpoint. Change in body weight during the course of the study was analysed from baseline, and end‐of‐study data for participants were grouped by daily final basal insulin doses (≤ 0.5 or > 0.5 IU/kg/d).

2.3 Statistical analysis

Participant demographics, baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were summarized descriptively. The changes in FPG and HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint were calculated across all insulin doses, and additionally for each incremental 0.1‐IU/kg/d dose increase, from ≤ 0.3 to 0.7 IU/kg/d. Assessment of the number of participants reaching HbA1c < 7.0% at study endpoint was limited to participants with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). Overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was assessed for the entire study period, also categorized by final insulin dose. Rates of daytime, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia have been previously assessed for this study population and are presented elsewhere. 21 An evaluation of change in body weight was made, categorized for the participants who exceeded a maximum insulin dose of 0.5 IU/kg/d and for those whose maximum dose was ≤ 0.5 IU/kg/d during the 24‐week treatment period. Within the > 0.5 IU/kg/d group, body weight change was also separately assessed for the time periods when participants received an insulin dose ≤ 0.5 and > 0.5 IU/kg/d.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, many patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are suboptimally controlled, which contributes to excess morbidity and mortality for the patients and to increased costs for the healthcare system. 1 When facing elevated HbA1c levels, patients are often daunted by factors such as their own or their provider's reluctance to change ('therapeutic inertia'), regimen complexity or cost. There are often long 2 and detrimental 3 delays in initiating or intensifying insulin as a result.

Once‐daily injections of basal insulin are often initiated to manage patients with poorly controlled fasting glucose on non‐insulin therapies, and many algorithms have been developed to facilitate basal insulin titration by patients themselves or by healthcare professionals. These algorithms uniformly adjust basal insulin based on fasting values obtained by self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). 4 The strategy of bedtime dosing confers a comparatively low risk of hypoglycaemia 5 and is moderately effective at reducing HbA1c levels, with approximately half of participants in clinical studies achieving HbA1c levels of less than 7% or other individualized targets. 6 Unfortunately, basal insulin regimens that rely on infrequent SMBG testing and emphasize the control of fasting glucose and avoiding night‐time hypoglycaemia ignore the problems of daytime premeal and sustained postprandial hyperglycaemia, placing a ceiling effect on obtainable HbA1c reductions. Of greater concern, real‐world evidence shows that only ~30% of patients with T2D who use basal insulin maintain HbA1c levels of less than 7%. 6, 7, 8, 9 There are many potential explanations for the discrepancy between evidence gained from clinical trials versus clinical practice. These include poor adherence to insulin, inadequate initialization and titration of insulin, 10, 11, 12 and concerns about hypoglycaemia. 13
