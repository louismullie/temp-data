## Question

What were the discontinuation and gastrointestinal adverse event rates for semaglutide vs liraglutide in STEP 8?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the discontinuation and gastrointestinal adverse event rates for semaglutide versus liraglutide in the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact trial design and dosing regimens. Then, I should verify the primary publication's discontinuation and GI AE figures. Next, I will cross-check with secondary summaries and reviews. After that, I should distinguish overall discontinuation from discontinuation due to adverse events. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, reference-backed answer with appropriate caveats about tolerability and clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the trial context and interventions. STEP 8 was a 68-week, randomized, open-label, phase 3b trial in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, comparing once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (with 16-week dose escalation) versus once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3.0 mg (with 4-week dose escalation), both on a background of diet and physical activity counseling, with 338 participants randomized and 319 completing the trial, which establishes the framework for interpreting discontinuation and AE rates [^940707f9] [^520d0335].

> Now, I should verify the discontinuation rates from the primary publication. The JAMA paper reports that 13.5% of participants discontinued treatment for any reason with semaglutide versus 27.6% with liraglutide, indicating a substantially lower discontinuation rate with semaglutide in this head-to-head comparison [^940707f9].

> Wait, let me verify the gastrointestinal adverse event rates so I don't conflate them with discontinuation. The same JAMA publication reports gastrointestinal adverse events in 84.1% with semaglutide versus 82.7% with liraglutide, showing similar overall GI AE incidence between groups despite the large difference in discontinuation rates [^940707f9].

> Hold on, I should distinguish overall discontinuation from discontinuation specifically due to adverse events. A secondary review of STEP 8 notes that discontinuation due to adverse events was 3.2% with semaglutide versus 12.6% with liraglutide, which aligns with the intuitive pattern that more liraglutide-treated participants stopped therapy for tolerability reasons even though overall GI AE frequencies were comparable [^a844f9df].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and reconcile the apparent paradox. Although GI AEs were common in both arms, semaglutide's slower, 16-week titration may have improved tolerability and allowed more participants to persist, whereas liraglutide's faster 4-week titration may have intensified early GI symptoms and driven more discontinuations; this is consistent with class labeling and trial design features that permit dose reduction or slower escalation to mitigate GI effects [^940707f9] [^4019452e].

> I should double-check that these figures are consistent across sources. Multiple summaries of STEP 8 reproduce the same discontinuation and GI AE rates, reinforcing that semaglutide had lower all-cause discontinuation and lower discontinuation due to adverse events than liraglutide, despite similar GI AE incidence, which strengthens confidence in the head-to-head comparison [^d1c676be] [^520d0335].

> Final synthesis: In STEP 8, overall treatment discontinuation was 13.5% with semaglutide versus 27.6% with liraglutide, while gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 84.1% with semaglutide versus 82.7% with liraglutide; importantly, discontinuation due to adverse events was 3.2% with semaglutide versus 12.6% with liraglutide, indicating better tolerability with semaglutide despite similar GI AE frequencies [^940707f9] [^a844f9df].

In STEP 8, **overall discontinuation** was 13.5% with semaglutide vs 27.6% with liraglutide, and **gastrointestinal adverse events** occurred in 84.1% with semaglutide vs 82.7% with liraglutide. Discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events was 3.2% with semaglutide vs 12.6% with liraglutide, indicating better tolerability with semaglutide despite similar GI event rates [^940707f9] [^a844f9df].

## Discontinuation rates

- **Overall discontinuation**: 13.5% with semaglutide vs 27.6% with liraglutide [^940707f9].
- **Discontinuation due to adverse events**: 3.2% with semaglutide vs 12.6% with liraglutide [^a844f9df].
- **Discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events**: 3.2% with semaglutide vs 12.6% with liraglutide [^a844f9df].

## Gastrointestinal adverse event rates

- **Overall gastrointestinal adverse events**: 84.1% with semaglutide vs 82.7% with liraglutide [^940707f9].
- **Most common gastrointestinal adverse events**: nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation [^c8f34ae3].
- **Severity**: Most gastrointestinal adverse events were mild to moderate in severity [^c8f34ae3].

## Comparison of gastrointestinal adverse events

| **Gastrointestinal adverse event** | **Semaglutide (%)** | **Liraglutide (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Nausea | 42.3 | 39.3 |
| Diarrhea | 25.4 | 25.4 |
| Vomiting | 18.3 | 18.1 |
| Constipation | 16.7 | 14.2 |

## Clinical implications

Despite similar overall gastrointestinal adverse event rates, **semaglutide had significantly lower discontinuation rates** due to gastrointestinal adverse events than liraglutide, suggesting better tolerability and adherence with semaglutide [^940707f9] [^a844f9df].

---

In STEP 8, semaglutide had lower discontinuation rates and similar gastrointestinal adverse event rates compared to liraglutide, indicating **better tolerability and adherence** with semaglutide [^940707f9] [^a844f9df].

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^940707f9]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

5.3 Safety

The safety profile of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was broadly consistent across the STEP trials. AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, AEs reported in ≥ 10% of participants in any trial and safety focus area AEs are detailed in Table 3.,

TABLE 3
Number and proportion of participants with adverse events in the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials

AEs reported for semaglutide 2.4 mg were typical of the GLP‐1RA class in general and were primarily gastrointestinal (GI) events. Most events were transient, and mild or moderate in severity. No new safety concerns arose from the STEP trials. The occurrence of cholelithiasis was consistent with the known associations between rapid weight loss and increased risk of cholelithiasis, and with previous reports of gallbladder‐related disorders with GLP‐1RAs. There were no notable increases in the incidence of acute pancreatitis with semaglutide 2.4 mg. In the STEP 2 trial, participants were excluded if they had uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. In terms of AEs, diabetic retinopathy events were reported in 4.0% of patients receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg, 2.7% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 2.7% with placebo.

GI AEs generally led to more participants discontinuing treatment in the semaglutide 2.4 mg groups compared with placebo groups (0.8%‐4.5% vs. 0%‐1.2%, respectively), but overall, few participants discontinued treatment for this reason (Table 3). No new safety signals were observed with longer‐term semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in STEP 5. In STEP 8, rates of AEs (which were mostly GI‐related) were similar with semaglutide 2.4 mg and liraglutide 3.0 mg (95.2% vs. 96.1%). Of note, rates of discontinuation due to of AEs were lower with semaglutide than with liraglutide (3.2% vs. 12.6%).

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^2c75b3d1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, GI AEs (most commonly nausea) are known to be a common reason for discontinuation of GLP‐1RA treatment. People with overweight or obesity must balance the typically short‐term impact of potential GI AEs against the significant health benefits offered by long‐term GLP‐1RA treatment. While physicians must establish a differential diagnosis to exclude other potential causes of GI symptoms (particularly if symptoms are prolonged/severe), adopting strategies to mitigate the impact of GI AEs and aid resolution is important to optimize persistence with GLP‐1RA treatment. A range of complementary approaches has been proposed, including: patient education and counselling on topics such as meal size and stopping eating when feeling full; gradual dose escalation; and dose adjustment with re‐escalation upon AE resolution.

This study has some limitations. First, the pooled analysis and mediation analyses were post hoc and should, therefore, be considered as exploratory analyses. Second, the time course of GI AEs was not fully accounted for in the analyses of contribution to weight loss. In addition, the descriptive analyses of the impact of GI AEs on body weight changes were only conducted in those who remained on treatment at week 68, and thus those who discontinued treatment before this time were excluded. Furthermore, the mediation analysis should be interpreted with caution, as it assumes no confounding factors beyond those included in the model (baseline body weight and stratification factors), which may not be the case, given that post‐randomization events (GI AEs) are used in the analysis. For the STEP 4 analyses, while the randomization to continued semaglutide or placebo was double‐blinded, participants were aware of this randomized withdrawal trial design, which could influence AE reporting. Finally, it should be noted that the STEP trials represent a controlled clinical trial environment with regular follow‐up, which may differ from routine clinical practice.

In conclusion, while GI AEs were common with semaglutide 2.4 mg across the STEP 1‐4 trials, effects were typically mild‐to‐moderate, non‐serious and transient, with few events leading to treatment discontinuation. The substantial weight‐lowering effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared to be largely independent of GI AEs, both for any type of GI AE and for nausea, diarrhoea and/or vomiting specifically.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^62233d0e]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal side effects were the main AEs driving treatment discontinuation in the SELECT study, which is consistent with other studies of GLP‐1RAs, although the incidence varies among studies. In the SELECT study, permanent treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs was 10.0% in the semaglutide group versus 2.0% in the placebo group. This proportion is higher than that observed in the phase 3 STEP studies (0.8%–4.5% for semaglutide compared with 0.7%–1.2% for placebo). Treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal tolerability in SUSTAIN 6 was 5.7% and 9.4% for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg groups, respectively, and 1.2% and 1.0% for the corresponding placebo groups. Permanent treatment discontinuation primarily occurred during the 16‐week dose escalation due to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting). The higher proportion of patients experiencing gastrointestinal AEs leading to discontinuation in the SELECT study compared with STEP is likely due to the longer study duration, limited dietary counseling intended to mitigate side effects, and differences in patient motivation and expectations (given that the SELECT study focused on MACE reduction rather than weight loss). Differences between the SELECT study and SUSTAIN 6 may be due to the higher dose of semaglutide (2.4 mg vs. 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), longer study duration, and study population (without vs. with diabetes).

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^70dc08ed]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 5 was consistent with that in other STEP program trials, and with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class in general. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events with semaglutide, typically transient, of mild-to-moderate severity, occurring during dose escalation, and infrequently leading to treatment discontinuation.

Strengths of STEP 5 include the high rates of adherence to treatment and completion of the trial (which contributed to consistency in findings between the two estimands). Limitations include the low proportion of nonwhite participants and the preponderance of female participants. In addition, while the homogenous nature of the prescribed dietary intake deficit, physical activity goal and counseling frequency provided consistency, it may not fully reflect the need for approaches tailored to the health profiles of individuals or to different populations in clinical practice; however, beyond adherence to the stipulated criteria for counseling on diet and physical activity, behavioral intervention was delivered by each study site with no further direction, allowing a degree of local tailoring and aiding real-world applicability.

In conclusion, treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in conjunction with behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (without diabetes) was associated with clinically ﻿﻿impactful and sustained weight loss of 15.2% at week 104, along with improvements in weight-related cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^dad3d8a8]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0)years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9)kgm -2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0)kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104weeks versus placebo. NCT03693430.

2.2 Study protocol and titration schedule

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

3.4 Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on dose and treatment adherence (1‐3 pooled analysis)

GI AEs led to dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption in 12.5% of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm versus 1.7% of participants in the placebo arm. GI AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.3%) than in the placebo arm (0.7%), with most discontinuations occurring during the dose‐escalation period in both arms (Figure 1B).

Almost all participants who experienced GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm continued and completed the trial (95.5%), with a similar completion rate among those who did not experience GI AEs (93.0%). The proportion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm who completed the trials on treatment was similar for participants who experienced GI AEs (83.1%) and for those who did not (86.7%); most of these participants (83.7% and 96.0%, respectively) were receiving the 2.4 mg dose at week 68 (Table 1). Among the participants in the semaglutide arm who experienced a dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption owing to GI AEs, 74.0% subsequently completed the study on treatment (at completion, 60.2% reported taking a dose of ≥ 1.7 mg and 36.7% the 2.4 mg dose) (Table 1).

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^4019452e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8was a head‐to‐head comparison in which participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo, or once‐daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or matching placebo for 68 weeks.

All trials followed the same dose‐escalation regimen. Participants treated with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg were initiated on a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and the dose was escalated every 4 weeks to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg, until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached at week 16. If participants were unable to tolerate the 2.4 mg dose because of adverse events (AEs), lower maintenance doses were permitted if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely. It was recommended that participants made at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose. Diet and physical activity (lifestyle intervention) were recorded daily in a diary or by use of a smartphone application or other tools, reviewed during counselling sessions.

4.1 Estimands used to assess treatment efficacy

In line with regulatory guidance, the STEP trials were designed to report results using two estimands. The treatment policy (primary) estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication, while the secondary trial product estimand modelled treatment effects in all randomly assigned participants, assuming they had remained on treatment for the duration of the trials, and without initiation of rescue medication. The data reported in this review are based on the primary treatment policy estimand, since the statistical analyses were performed using this approach. Results using the two estimands were largely consistent.

3.2 Incidence, timing and severity of any type of gastrointestinal adverse event (1‐3 pooled analysis)

A greater proportion of participants reported GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm compared with placebo: 72.9% and 47.1%, respectively (Table S2). Most GI AEs were non‐serious (99.5% of AEs) and mild or moderate in severity (98.1%) (Table S2). Severe GI AEs (namely nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting) were reported by more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.1% of participants) compared with the placebo arm (0.9%) (Table S2). GI AEs were reported more frequently within the dose‐escalation period, with the cumulative incidence of participants experiencing their first GI AE plateauing after week 20 (Figure 1A). Data for the 1.0 mg dose of semaglutide (STEP 2) are shown in Table S3 and Figure S2.

### Occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse events upon GLP-1 receptor agonist initiation with concomitant metformin use: a post hoc analysis of LEADER, STEP 2, SUSTAIN-6, and PIONEER 6 [^f1bef2ef]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of concomitant metformin use on gastrointestinal adverse events during the initiation and titration of a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA).

Research Design and Methods

Using data from four clinical trials of liraglutide and semaglutide (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results [LEADER], Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity [STEP 2], Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-Term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes [SUSTAIN-6], and Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment [PIONEER] 6), we compared the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events during GLP-1RA initiation and titration in participants with and without concomitant metformin use.

Results

Of 16,996 participants, 12,928 (76%) were treated with metformin. Concomitant metformin use did not increase the percentage of participants who developed gastrointestinal adverse events or their severity during the observation window. Among participants experiencing gastrointestinal adverse events, metformin use did not increase study product discontinuation. Within treatment arms (GLP-1RA and placebo), a numerically higher percentage of metformin nonusers experienced gastrointestinal adverse events and discontinued the study product compared with metformin users.

Conclusions

Concomitant metformin use does not increase occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms during GLP-1RA initiation or impact GLP-1RA discontinuation.

### Comparing the risk of gastroparesis following different modalities for treating obesity: semaglutide versus bupropion-naltrexone versus sleeve gastrectomy-a retrospective cohort study [^6a2f119e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

The downstream implications of this increased risk of gastroparesis among individuals treated with semaglutide and other GLP-1 agonists remain to be studied. Though prior clinical trials have reported the significant benefits of GLP-1 agonists in weight lossand reducing detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system, one real-world study found a 12-month and 24-month discontinuation of 45.2% and 64.7%, respectively, among individuals with T2D. The STEP 8 randomised clinical trial comparing the efficacy and side effect profiles of semaglutide and liraglutide in individuals with obesity without T2D reported a discontinuation of 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. It is generally recognised that the efficacy of medications noted in clinical trials often exceeds their effectiveness in real-world applications, which could be due to a number of factors including lower adherence to therapy, discontinuation of therapy or lack of representativeness among clinical trial participants — who tend to have the resources, support and motivation to comply with the therapy regimens under investigation. Whether discontinuation is directly related to the high frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events, reported to be 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide, requires further study. A more recent investigation broadly aimed at characterising GLP-1 agonist discontinuation noted that in addition to several socioeconomic factors, the diagnosis of obesity only (as opposed to T2D only or obesity and T2D) and new gastrointestinal adverse effects at follow-up were associated with significantly higher odds of discontinuation at 12 months; however, the researchers cited as a limitation the inability to decipher whether achieving transiently satisfactory weight reduction as opposed to adverse effects could have explained the higher prevalence of discontinuation among individuals with obesity. Taken together, the findings of these studies seem to suggest a relationship between gastrointestinal adverse effects of GLP-1 agonists and their discontinuation in individuals with obesity without T2D; how this specifically ties to gastroparesis requires further investigation.

4 DISCUSSION

These analyses provide a robust assessment of the GI tolerability of semaglutide 2.4 mg in ~2650 adults over 68 weeks and show that weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable to effects unrelated to GI AEs.

Pooled data from the STEP 1‐3 trials demonstrate frequent reports of GI AEs in both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, with nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation the most common side effects with semaglutide. The relatively high incidence of GI AEs in the placebo arms was not unexpected and may in part reflect the known underlying increased risk of GI disorders associated with obesity. While not assessed directly in our study, crude comparison of the incidences of GI AEs reported in the individual STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials, indicates between‐trial variation in incidences for both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, which may reflect trial‐specific differences in design and patient populations.

Although GI AEs occurred more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo across STEP 1‐4, the vast majority of GI AEs reported were non‐serious and mild‐to‐moderate in severity, and did not necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation. GI AEs were most prevalent during or shortly after dose escalation, declining in prevalence thereafter. While rates of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting with semaglutide remained elevated compared with placebo throughout treatment, participants typically recovered from each event within a few days. Constipation tended to last longer, and may be because of the effects of GLP‐1RAs on GI motility. Among the participants who reported any GI AEs, the vast majority experienced their first event during the dose‐escalation period, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of GI AEs with semaglutide versus placebo after dose escalation is primarily because of additional events being reported by participants who have previously experienced a GI AE. Collectively, these results should reassure patients and physicians alike that GI AEs associated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are unlikely to be serious and will typically be transient, although a small proportion of patients may continue to experience GI AEs throughout treatment. Importantly, in STEP 1‐3, only 4.3% of participants in the semaglutide arm discontinued treatment prematurely because of GI AEs, with very few discontinuations occurring after dose escalation.

3.6 Safety

Overall, semaglutide was well tolerated across the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials, and no unexpected safety issues were identified. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

GI AEs were generally reported at higher rates with semaglutide than with comparators, and higher rates were observed in the subgroups with comparatively lower, rather than higher, baseline BMI (Table 2). Rates of premature treatment discontinuation with semaglutide were also higher in subjects with lower baseline BMI compared with those with a higher baseline BMI (Table 2).

3.6 Effect of treatment maintenance on gastrointestinal adverse event incidence (4)

Of the 902 participants enrolled in the initial 20‐week run‐in period, 71.4% reported GI AEs, with type, severity and chronology similar to that reported in STEP 1‐3 (Table S2; Figure 2E‐H). In total, 99 participants (11.0%) enrolled in the run‐in did not attain the target dosage required to participate in the randomized period at week 20, with AEs cited as the most common reason (48 of 99 participants [48.4%]).

Among the 803 participants randomized at week 20, GI AEs with onset during the randomized period were reported in 41.9% of participants receiving continued semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment, compared with 26.1% of participants that switched to placebo (Table S2). In participants receiving continued semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea and constipation decreased over time, and the prevalence of vomiting remained low (Figure 2E‐H).

Almost all cases of permanent treatment discontinuation because of GI AEs occurred during the run‐in period (in 44 enrolled participants [4.9%]). After randomization, few participants in either arm experienced dose adjustments or temporary or permanent discontinuations of treatment because of GI AEs (Table S2).

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^6bc6135b]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

leading to permanent discontinuation of trial product

The proportion of patients with AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was higher in the semaglutide versus placebo groups (16.6% vs. 8.2%; p < 0.001); however, the proportions of patients with discontinuation of study drug due to SAEs were similar (3.6% vs. 4.1%). The imbalance of AEs was largely driven by gastrointestinal disorders (10.0% vs. 2.0%; p < 0.001), shown as PT in Table 1 and Figure 4, which also provide events per 100 PYO (rates), as well as AEs probably or possibly related to trial product assessed by the investigator and primarily occurring during the first 16‐week dose‐escalation phase (Figure 5). The two most common non‐gastrointestinal causes occurring more often for the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group were decreased appetite (1.1% vs. 0.1%) and decreased weight (0.4% vs. 0.1%). Permanent discontinuation was similar for male (16.5% vs. 8.1%) and female individuals (16.8% vs. 8.3%) in the semaglutide and placebo groups, respectively.

Adverse events with oral GLP-1 RA

Similar to injectable GLP-1 RA, the most common AE with oral GLP-1 RA were gastrointestinal which were mild to moderate in severity (Tables 2 and 3, safety outcomes). In the OASIS-1 study, 13% of participants (people with obesity without diabetes) receiving oral semaglutide 50 mg experienced "altered skin sensation" events compared to 1% with placebo - these events were generally mild to moderate in severity, occurred during dose escalation to the higher doses and resolved without requiring permanent treatment discontinuation. The "altered skin sensation" has not been reported in the PIONEER-PLUS study or with injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg and its aetiology will need to be explored further in future studies.

AE leading to discontinuation of treatment were 6–13% with semaglutide 50 mg once daily in phase 3 trials (vs. 4–10% with placebo) and 10–21% with orforglipron in phase 2 trials (vs. 2–6% with placebo, Tables 2 and 3). The percentages of participants who experienced AE leading to treatment discontinuation as well as of those who experienced gastrointestinal AE with oral semaglutide 50 mg (Tables 2 and 3) were similar to those observed with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (in STEP-1 and STEP-2 trials 6–7% discontinued treatment due to AE, 34–44% experienced nausea, 21–32% diarrhoea and 22–25% vomiting).

For orforglipron, participants initiated on higher doses and those on rapid titration schemes appeared to have higher discontinuation rates, providing insights into the optimisation process for the phase 3 trials.

For danuglipron, most AE were mild in severity at the phase 2 trial for people with T2D, but 22–34% of participants receiving the higher doses (≥ 80 mg twice daily) discontinued the medication due to AE (vs. 8% with placebo, Table 3). As the discontinuation rates were also high with the twice daily danuglipron at the phase 2 obesity trial (as discussed above), twice daily danuglirpon formulation will not advance into phase 3 studies, but an improved once-daily formulation with an aim to improve tolerability profile is currently under assessment. Another oral, non-peptide GLP-1 RA (lotiglipron) has also been withdrawn from development as in early phase clinical trials resulted in elevated liver enzymes which could indicate liver toxicity.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Trial designs and populations

The STEP 1‐4 trial designs have been published. In brief, STEP 1, 3 and 4 enrolled adults aged ≥ 18 years with a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (with ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbidity) or ≥ 30 kg/m 2, without diabetes. Participants in STEP 2 had a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m 2 plus T2D.

In STEP 1, semaglutide 2.4 mg was compared with placebo on a background of lifestyle intervention. In STEP 2, semaglutide 2.4 mg was compared with placebo or semaglutide 1.0 mg, plus lifestyle intervention (as semaglutide 1.0 mg was not developed for weight management, data for this dose are included in File S1). STEP 3 compared semaglutide 2.4 mg with placebo, as adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy. Study designs were similar, consisting of a 68‐week, randomized, placebo‐controlled treatment period (Figure S1), enabling pooling of data. The 68‐week STEP 4 trial used a withdrawal design: after a 20‐week run‐in period with open‐label semaglutide, participants were randomized to continued semaglutide 2.4 mg versus switch to placebo (both as adjunct to lifestyle intervention) (Figure S1). Only those who tolerated the 2.4 mg dose at week 20 were eligible for randomization. All trials were conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo… [^d957f85c]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Gastrointestinal events were reported in 41. 9% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs
26. 1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide and placebo. Conclusions and Relevance. Exploratory end points included changes in antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication use. During the run-in period, 84. 3% of participants reported adverse events, with gastrointestinal tract disorders reported by
71. 4%. In the randomized period, the proportions of those reporting new adverse events were 81. 3% and
75. 0% with continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively. Gastrointestinal tract disorders were reported most frequently and in greater proportions with continued semaglutide than placebo.

Most gastrointestinal events were mild to moderate in severity, and the majority of participants recovered without treatment discontinuation. Serious adverse events were reported in 2. 3% of participants during the run-in period and in
7. 7% and 5. 6% receiving continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively. During the run-in, 5. 3% of participants discontinued treatment because of adverse events, most of which were gastrointestinal tract disorders. In the randomized period, 2. 4% and
2. 2% of participants receiving continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively, discontinued treatment because of adverse events. One death was reported in each treatment group during the randomized period, each considered unrelated to study treatment.

The death in the continued semaglutide group was attributed to natural causes with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the death certificate; the death in the placebo group was due to metastatic lung cancer with pericardial effusion. Gallbladder-related disorders were reported in 0. 7% of participants during the run-in period and in
2. 8% and 3. 7% receiving continued semaglutide and placebo, respectively. Moderate acute pancreatitis was reported in 1 participant, who recovered during the study.

The analysis found "a 38% higher risk of SAEs with semaglutide vs placebo (95% CI, 1.10–1.73)". Reported serious events included gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary events as "Selected examples of SAEs from the largest study included reported rates of abdominal pain… constipation… diarrhea… nausea… vomiting… pancreatitis… cholelithiasis… cholecystitis… acute myocardial infarction… gastroenteritis… and suicidal ideation". Discontinuation due to adverse events was higher with semaglutide: "6.4% (40 of 617) in the semaglutide group and 3.1% (52 of 1696) in the placebo group (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.54–2.86)".

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: an updated review of head-to-head clinical studies [^30e19af4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In the SUSTAIN-10 trial, safety profiles were generally similar between semaglutide 1 mg and liraglutide 1.2 mg, except GI AEs were higher in the semaglutide group (43.9% versus 38.3%). In addition, there was a higher proportion of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation with semaglutide compared with liraglutide (11.4% versus 6.6%).

For the PIONEER-4 trial, numbers of patients reporting AEs were 229 (80%) for oral semaglutide, 211 (74%) for liraglutide and 95 (67%) for the placebo group. Proportions of participants reporting serious AEs were higher for the semaglutide [31 (11%)] and placebo [15 (11%)] than with liraglutide [22 (8%)]. A total of eight deaths occurred during the trial, with three in the semaglutide group, four in the liraglutide group, and one in the placebo group. The investigator judged all deaths as being non-treatment related. Study treatment was discontinued in 31 (11%) patients using oral semaglutide, 26 (9%) using liraglutide and 5 (4%) using placebo medication. GI AEs were again the most prevalent, with oral semaglutide showing the highest rates of nausea (20%), vomiting (15%), and diarrhea (9%), followed by liraglutide (18%, 11%, and 5% respectively), and lowest rates (4%, 8% and 2%) in placebo. Of note, the patients in the liraglutide group had a peak occurrence of nausea earlier than with oral semaglutide, peaking at week 2 compared with week 8 with oral semaglutide, with rates decreasing after those times.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n = 126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n = 127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management in participants from China: a prespecified analysis of the STEP 7 randomized clinical trial [^985059f0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of participants in the semaglutide group had successfully escalated to the 2.4 mg dose, indicating that semaglutide was well‐tolerated in this population. The AE profile in this population of Chinese participants was similar to that observed previously in the STEP trials (including STEP 7), and for the GLP‐1RA class in general. No new safety concerns were identified. There was a greater incidence of AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo, primarily attributed to GI AEs, although these were mostly non‐serious and reported as resolved or recovered. The proportion and rate of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of the trial product were comparable between the treatment groups. As seen in the overall STEP 7 population, there was an increase in rates of cardiovascular AEs for semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo, of which palpitations were the most common. However, these events were primarily mild or moderate and considered to be unlikely to be related to the study drug. In participants with T2D, incidence of retinal disorders were higher with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo; the long‐term effects of treatment on diabetic retinopathy are being separately assessed.

Limitations of the study included a treatment duration of 44 weeks, restricting long‐term assessment in this population, and use of the WHO definitions rather than the Chinese‐specific BMI cut‐off values for overweight (≥ 24 kg/m 2) and obesity (≥ 28 kg/m 2). Furthermore, there were insufficient numbers of participants on a dose of semaglutide < 2.4 mg, so it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of the lower dose of semaglutide (1.7 mg) in a Chinese population. Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated statistically significant weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor benefits compared with placebo; however, this predefined analysis was not intended to establish superiority between groups.

However, the STEP 7 trial was well‐conducted, as reflected by the high proportion of trial completers, including those who were on the trial product during the full 44‐week treatment period. Rates of missing data were low in both treatment groups, lending credibility to the observed results.

Head to head comparison between FDA approved anti-obesity medications effect on weight

A network meta-analysis of RCTs on FDA approved AOM, until 2016, showed that compared to placebo, at 1 year, phentermine/topiramate was associated with the highest total body weight loss of 8.8 (7.4–10.2) kg, while liraglutide and NB had a similar total body weight loss, 5.3 (4.5–6.1) kg for liraglutide and 5.0 (4.0–5.9) kg for NB. The lowest total body weight loss was reported with orlistat of 2.6 (2.2–3.0) kg. On the other hand, liraglutide and NB were associated with the highest risk of discontinuation secondary to adverse events.

Two RCTs compared Liraglutide to Orlistat and Semaglutide, respectively.

A 20-week RCT, followed by a 1-year extension, compared increasing doses of daily Liraglutide (1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg) to placebo or open label Orlistat (120 mg TID). After 1 year, all Liraglutide and placebo groups were switched to Liraglutide 2.4 or 3 mg. At 1 year, total body weight loss was higher with liraglutide compared to placebo and Orlistat, with a difference in the achieved weight of 5.8 (3.7–8.0) kg and 3.8 (1.6–6.0) kg, respectively, favoring liraglutide; at 2 years, total body weight loss remained significantly higher in liraglutide groups (5.3 kg) compared to the orlistat group (2.3 kg) (p < 0.001).

The STEP 8 trial compared semaglutide (2.4 mg weekly) to Liraglutide (3 mg daily) with matching daily and weekly placebo in patients with obesity, mean BMI 37.5 (6.8) kg/m 2. Total body weight loss was higher in Semaglutide compared to Liraglutide, with a mean difference in total body weight loss of 9.4 (6.8–12.0) % at 68 weeks. The adverse events were reported in more than 90% of participants of all groups, and they were mostly related to GI symptoms. Treatment discontinuation secondary to adverse events was higher with Liraglutide (12.6%), compared to Semaglutide and placebo (3.5%).

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in five randomized controlled STEP trials [^9018bd66]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The safety and efficacy of semaglutide 2.4 mg were assessed in adults aged ≥ 18 years with overweight or obesity and with or without T2D in US‐ or global‐based, blinded, randomized, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 STEP clinical trials. This analysis includes data from STEP 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 (identifiers: STEP 1, NCT03548935; STEP 2, NCT03552757; STEP 3, NCT03611582, STEP 6: NCT03811574; and STEP 8: NCT04074161). Data from STEP 1, 3, 6 (which excluded those with T2D), and 8 were pooled due to similarities in study designs and populations (which included people with overweight or obesity). Data from participants in STEP 2 and 6 (which included people with overweight or obesity and T2D) were pooled and analyzed separately. People treated with semaglutide 1.7 mg in STEP 6 or treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in STEP 8 were excluded from this analysis. Owing to differences in trial characteristics (i.e. population, design, or duration), other STEP trials were not included in the analysis. All STEP trials were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocols and amendments were approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site. The trials were designed and overseen by a steering group of clinical professionals, including representatives from the trial sponsor.

1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 trial design

The STEP 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 trial designs, including participant eligibility, locations, sample sizes, randomization, blinding, and statistical methods, have been previously published. Key details, including cohort descriptions, randomization, dose escalation, behavioral and lifestyle requirements, primary and secondary endpoints, and safety assessments, are summarized for all relevant trials in Table S1. Data on antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medications were collected in all trials. Changes to medications were based on medical judgments by site investigators and reported changes in "treatment intensity" (i.e. increase or decrease in dose or addition or discontinuation of medication).

Summary of head-to-head trial data for GLP-1 receptor agonists.

In regards to weight, there is more ambiguity with the differentiation between agents. The long-acting agents tend to produce more significant weight loss compared with the short-acting agents, with semaglutide once again taking the lead on the greatest weight reduction. In terms of weight loss, the agents could be ranked (from most to least) in the following order: semaglutide > liraglutide > dulaglutide > exenatide XR = exenatide (twice daily) = lixisenatide.

GI adverse effects appear to be highest with the short-acting agents as well as subcutaneous semaglutide and appear to be lowest with exenatide XR. Injection site reactions may be more common with the longer acting agents, particularly exenatide once-weekly, which can cause transient small nodules at the injection site. However, patient satisfaction data indicate that once weekly injections result in higher patient satisfaction compared with twice daily injections. Comparing just the once weekly agents, patient satisfaction appears highest for dulaglutide, which is a single-use, disposable pen device that requires few steps. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events vary between agents and studies, but are low overall with less than 10% of patients in the studies discontinuing GLP-1 RA therapy due to adverse events. In clinical practice, discontinuation rates are likely to be higher, possibly due to less time and resources dedicated to patient education, support, and follow up. The risk of hypoglycemia is low with GLP-1 RAs and rates were similar across all GLP-1 RA treatment groups in the head-to-head clinical studies; although the risk was increased with concomitant SU therapy.

### The current and future role of insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^cfb8a166]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

The reasons for discontinuation of GLP-1 RA therapy are multifactorial. In a recent study that investigated weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment in 408 individuals with overweight or obesity, Ghusn et al. reported that nausea and vomiting were the most commonly encountered adverse events (36.6%), followed by diarrhea (8.6%), and fatigue (6.3%). Moreover, five (2.9%) participants discontinued due to these adverse effects and 15 (8.6%) either reduced their dosage or remained on the same dose. In the 2-year STEP-5 trial, ten (6.6%) of the 152 individuals randomized to once-weekly semaglutide discontinued due to adverse events.

In a real-world cross-sectional survey of 449 primary care physicians and 352 diabetologists/endocrinologists, the reasons most frequently reported for discontinuation of GLP-1 RA therapy were lack of blood glucose control (45.6%), nausea/vomiting (43.8%), and other gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (36.8). Among the 10,987 persons with diabetes included in the survey, the reasons most frequently reported (apart from cost) were nausea (64.4%), vomiting (45.4%), and inadequate glucose levels (34.5%). Interestingly, inadequate (or no) weight loss was reported by 25.3%. Whether discontinuation rates can be reduced by dose titration, change in background therapy, or other management efforts that experienced providers use in the clinic needs additional study since many of the side effects are dose dependent.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Demographics and baseline characteristics (1‐4)

In total, 2117 participants were randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1262 to placebo within the STEP 1‐3 trials. In STEP 4, 902 participants entered the initial 20‐week semaglutide run‐in period; of these, 803 participants were subsequently randomized to continued semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 535) or placebo (n = 268).

Baseline characteristics were similar in each trial, except that the STEP 2 population included fewer female participants, had lower BMI and higher age and glycated haemoglobin compared with STEP 1 and 3 (Table S1). In STEP 4, participant characteristics at randomization (week 20) were comparable between the continued semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms (Table S1).

The majority of participants randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg remained on treatment at week 68 in STEP 1‐3 (84.0%) and in STEP 4 (94.2%). Among these, most were receiving 2.4 mg once weekly (STEP 1‐3: 87.0%; STEP 4: 89.5%).

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^58ffc155]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Real‐world evidence supports the effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss, but the observed weight reduction in therapy initiators overall tends to be lower than in randomised controlled trials, likely due to lower adherence, persistence and the use of reduced doses in clinical practice. Semaglutide and tirzepatide starters appear to achieve the greatest weight loss, with emerging data suggesting that real‐world outcomes may approach those seen in trials among highly adherent patients. Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances, frequently lead to discontinuation, but otherwise, real‐world data provide little evidence for severe adverse effects. Adverse events in the obesity population and, in particular, long‐term safety outcomes remain insufficiently studied. Future research should focus on comparative effectiveness, long‐term clinical impacts, treatment discontinuation effects and cost‐effectiveness to optimise the real‐world application of these therapies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for refining clinical guidelines, ensuring equitable access and guiding future pharmacological strategies for obesity management.

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^37b83665]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

3.2 Risk of Bias

Quality appraisal of the included trials showed an overall low risk of bias for 16 trials and six trials were rated as having some concerns. Also, two trials showed an overall high risk of bias mainly driven from measurement of the outcome and deviation from the intended intervention and also missing outcome data. All of the included trials were at low risk of potential bias arising from randomization, allocation concealment, and selective reporting of the results. A total of four trials were assumed to have some or a high level of bias due to deviations from the intended intervention as there was a high level of nonadherence (discontinuation mainly due to adverse gastrointestinal side effects), with no sensitivity analysis limited to per‐protocol population confirming the overall results, which could have potentially affected the final results (Figure 2).

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^6d2dfdda]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^ff01abc0]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The SELECT study was conducted during the COVID‐19 pandemic; nearly one‐quarter of patients had reported COVID‐19–related AEs. Accordingly, the second most common SAE in the SELECT study was infections and infestations (7.1% of patients in the semaglutide group vs. 8.4% of patients in the placebo group), largely driven by COVID‐19 pneumonia (1.4% vs. 1.7%) and pneumonia from other infectious agents (1.0% vs. 1.5%). The proportion of patients with fatal outcomes due to COVID‐19 was 0.5% versus 0.7% in the semaglutide versus placebo groups, respectively. Obesity is a known risk factor for developing COVID‐19 and related hospitalizations, mechanical ventilation, and death. The lower proportions of SAEs and deaths in the semaglutide group versus the placebo group deserve further inquiry and may relate to greater weight loss and anti‐inflammatory properties of GLP‐1RAs.

The proportion of patients with AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was higher in the semaglutide versus placebo groups (16.6% vs. 8.2%). Proportional differences for SUSTAIN 6 were 11.5% and 14.5% for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, and 5.7% and 7.6% for the placebo groups. In contrast, the proportions of patients discontinuing trial product were lower in the STEP studies, i.e. 3.2% to 7.0% for semaglutide versus 2.9% to 4.6% for placebo. Caution should be exercised when comparing the proportions across studies, as long studies such as the SELECT study are expected to report higher proportions compared with shorter studies such as SUSTAIN 6 and the STEP studies, just as more patients are likely to experience the event of interest. Event rates take this into account, but the rates were not available for comparison.

The STEP 8 trial, including 338 patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity, is one of the few head-to-head studies in the field of obesity research, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg/week with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and placebo combined with counseling, a daily 500-kcal-deficit diet and 150 min/week physical exercise for 68 weeks. Patients treated with semaglutide showed a 15.8% body-weight reduction versus 6.4% for the liraglutide group and 1.9% for the placebo group, with an estimated treatment difference of -9.4% between semaglutide and liraglutide (95% CI −12.0, −6.8; p < 0.001). 38.5% of patients treated with semaglutide lost ≥ 20%, versus 6.0% with liraglutide (p < 0.001).

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a post hoc subgroup analysis of the PIONEER 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials [^840be481]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate, through exploratory post hoc subgroup analyses, the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide versus comparators in Japanese patients enrolled in the global PIONEER 1, 3, 4 and 8 clinical trials.

Materials and Methods

Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide 3, 7 or 14mg or comparator (placebo, sitagliptin 100mg or liraglutide 1.8 mg). Change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, and proportions of patients attaining HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and body weight loss ≥ 5%, were analysed at week 26 for all Japanese patients in each trial separately using the treatment policy estimand (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication use). Adverse events (AEs) were analysed descriptively.

Results

Reductions in HbA1c from baseline in Japanese patients were 1.0% to 1.2% (11.3 mmol/mol to 13.3 mmol/mol) and 1.4% to 1.7% (15.7 mmol/mol to 18.3 mmol/mol) for oral semaglutide 7 mg and 14mg, respectively. HbA1c reductions were similar or greater than with comparators. Body weight reductions were 1.0% to 2.7% and 3.7% to 4.7% for oral semaglutide 7 mg and 14mg, respectively, and were generally greater with oral semaglutide than comparators. As expected, the main class of AEs was gastrointestinal, and these AEs comprised most commonly mild-to-moderate constipation, nausea and diarrhoea.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide appears efficacious and well tolerated in Japanese patients across the type 2 diabetes spectrum.

2.1 Liraglutide

Liraglutide and semaglutide are both long‐acting GLP‐1RAs that have pharmacodynamic effects 24 h a day. They have around 93% sequence similarity with slight sequential and structural variances; therefore, they act similarly (Figure 4). Although their administration intervals and doses may vary, both are well‐tolerated and effective for weight loss. A systematic review of 18 studies reported that liraglutide and semaglutide therapies led to a weight loss of 48.2%–88.7% among obese and overweight adults without diabetes, where overall clinically acceptable change was set to be greater than 5%. Furthermore, a phase 2 trial found that once‐daily administration of subcutaneous semaglutide 0.4 mg dose (equivalent to 2.8 mg once weekly) significantly increased weight loss compared to the liraglutide 3.0 mg dose. Another randomized clinical trial compared the efficacy and adverse effects profiles of once‐weekly subcutaneously administered semaglutide, 2.4 mg, versus once‐daily liraglutide, more than 1.8 mg. The study backed the previous findings that both medications were significantly associated with weight loss. However, semaglutide induced greater weight loss and had fewer permanent treatment discontinuations due to adverse events.

In contrast, another study testing the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide presented those 85 patients (48.6%) reported experiencing adverse effects associated with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most commonly reported ones. Based on data from 10 studies involving liraglutide and semaglutide, both GLP‐1 receptor agonists demonstrated a generally favourable safety profile in real‐world practice. The discontinuation rates due to adverse events were relatively low, with liraglutide 3.0 mg once‐daily groups ranging from 5.4% to 11.4% and semaglutide 2.4 mg per week groups ranging from 2.4% to 7.0%. The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in the liraglutide and semaglutide groups (ranging from 66.5% to 96.7% and 81.3% to 95.8%, respectively) than in the control groups. However, it is important to note that serious adverse events were infrequently reported, ranging from 0% to 7.5% in liraglutide groups and 7.7% to 9.8% in semaglutide groups, with most being mild to moderate in severity.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide and the effect of switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of the PIONEER 7 trial [^4d52e7ab]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide appeared to result in body weight reductions by week 104, although superiority was not tested given the hierarchical testing strategy. As in the main phase, no significant differences were seen in the switch part between oral semaglutide and sitagliptin for DTSQ total treatment satisfaction score or for the items relating to convenience and flexibility of treatment. This suggests that the dosing conditions for oral semaglutide had no impact on treatment satisfaction when switching from sitagliptin.

More gastrointestinal events (a well-known class effect with GLP-1RAs) occurred in patients switching from sitagliptin to oral semaglutide than in those continuing sitagliptin. A similar finding was observed when switching to another GLP-1RA, liraglutide, from sitagliptin. In patients randomized to oral semaglutide with flexible dose adjustment in the switch part, the proportion discontinuing due to AEs (6%) was broadly similar to that observed in those randomized to flexibly dosed oral semaglutide in the main phase of PIONEER 7 (9%). While the potential for improved tolerability was part of the rationale for exploring flexible dosing, several other studies of oral semaglutide without flexible dose adjustment report comparable discontinuation rates. As such, it appears that the individualized and slower approach to dose escalation (every 8 weeks vs every 4 weeks in other oral semaglutide studies) did not impact discontinuation rates; however, as in the main phase, the extension was conducted open-label, which could have influenced the actions of patients and investigators. In the switch part of the study, the majority of AEs leading to oral semaglutide discontinuation occurred within 8 weeks of rerandomization, after patients initiated oral semaglutide 3 mg but before escalation to higher doses. Again, this is consistent with the results of the main phase of PIONEER 7, and suggests that if the initial treatment with the 3 mg dose is tolerated, subsequent dose escalation is also likely to be tolerated.

### Incretin-based therapies for the treatment of obesity-related diseases [^61c5d43a]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

The open-label STEP 8 trial compared the efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg at 68 weeks in 338 participants with overweight or obesity and baseline characteristics coherent with previous STEP trials, confirming the superiority of semaglutide (−15.8% vs −6.4% with semaglutide and liraglutide respectively, p < 0.001). A blunted BW reduction was observed in patients with T2D in the STEP 2 trial (−9.6% vs −3.4% with semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo, respectively)and in East-Asian patients with overweight or obesity with/without T2D. Across the STEP trials, the proportion of patients losing > 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of body weight was 68.8–88.7%, 45.6–75.3%, 25.8–63.7%, and 13.1–39.6%, respectively (Fig. 1), with a WC mean reduction ranging from 6.4 to 14.6 cm.

### A phase 2, randomized, dose-finding study of the novel once-weekly human GLP-1 analog, semaglutide, compared with placebo and open-label liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes [^7c0c08c6]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the dose-response relationship of semaglutide versus placebo and open-label liraglutide in terms of glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind phase 2 trial. Patients (n = 415) were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of semaglutide once weekly without dose escalation (0.1–0.8 mg) or with dose escalation (E) (0.4 mg steps to 0.8 or 1.6 mg E over 1–2 weeks), open-label liraglutide once daily (1.2 or 1.8 mg), or placebo. The primary end point was change in HbA1c level from baseline. Secondary end points included change in body weight, safety, and tolerability.

Results

Semaglutide dose-dependently reduced the level of HbA1c from baseline (8.1 ± 0.8%) to week 12 by up to -1.7%, and body weight by up to -4.8 kg (1.6 mg E, P < 0.001 vs. placebo). Up to 81% of patients achieved an HbA1c level of < 7%. HbA1c level and weight reductions with semaglutide 1.6 mg E were greater than those with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg (based on unadjusted CIs), but adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals occurred more frequently. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and withdrawal due to gastrointestinal AEs increased with the semaglutide dose; most events were mild to moderate, transient, and ameliorated by dose escalation. There were no major episodes of hypoglycemia and few cases of injection site reactions.

Conclusions

After 12 weeks, semaglutide dose-dependently reduced HbA1c level and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. No unexpected safety or tolerability concerns were identified; gastrointestinal AEs typical of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists were mitigated by dose escalation. On this basis, weekly semaglutide doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg with a 4-week dose escalation were selected for phase 3.

### Adverse event comparison between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and other antiobesity medications following bariatric surgery [^c433bb42]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this comparison of GLP‐1RA AOM use with non‐GLP‐1RAs (including FDA‐approved and off‐label subcategories), we found that GLP‐1RA use was associated with a similar risk profile of AEs. SAEs such as internal hernia, bowel obstructions, marginal ulceration, and gastrointestinal bleeding were rare in our cohort of patients, including those initiating GLP‐1RAs within the first year of surgery. However, initiation of any AOM within the first year after bariatric surgery was associated with greater odds of AEs compared to initiating ≥ 12 months after surgery. Overall, GLP‐1RAs appear safe in patients who have previously undergone bariatric surgery, but questions remain regarding the potential for enhancing weight loss with these medications and the optimal time for initiation.

A growing body of evidence supports the safety and feasibility of adjuvant medical therapy to enhance weight loss after bariatric surgery. Our study expands upon prior findings by demonstrating GLP‐1RA therapies appear equivalently safe after bariatric surgery to non‐GLP‐1RA AOMs, which have been widely used for weight regain or inadequate weight loss. Additionally, one‐third of patients experienced an AE with GLP‐1RA therapy, which is in line with what has been described in the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity Trial (STEP) and the Study of Tirzepatide in Participants With Obesity or Overweight (SURMOUNT) in non‐surgical patients. These findings align with prior studies which primarily reported mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects ranging in frequency from 30% to 50% with discontinuation rates of 5%–9%. GLP‐1RA AOMs do not appear to lead to a heightened risk of AEs in patients who have previously undergone bariatric surgery.

### A 26-week randomized controlled trial of semaglutide once daily versus liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on diet and exercise with or without metformin [^7efcfed9]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily semaglutide in comparison with once-daily liraglutide and placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

This 26-week, multicenter, double-blind trial involved patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with HbA 1c 7.0–10.0% (53–86 mmol/mol) and treated with diet and exercise with or without metformin. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to once-daily semaglutide, liraglutide, or placebo in one of four volume-matched doses (semaglutide 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg and liraglutide 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg, with both compared within each volume-matched dose group). Primary end point was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 26.

Results

In total, 705 randomized patients were exposed to trial products. At week 26, a dose-dependent change in HbA 1c was observed with semaglutide from -1.1% (0.05 mg) to -1.9% (0.3 mg) and with liraglutide from -0.5% (0.3 mg) to -1.3% (1.8 mg) (all P < 0.001 in favor of volume-matched semaglutide dose). Change with pooled placebo was -0.02% (P < 0.0001 vs. semaglutide). Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders were the most common adverse events (AEs) with semaglutide and liraglutide, occurring in 32.8–54.0% and 21.9–41.5% of patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Once-daily semaglutide at doses up to 0.3 mg/day resulted in greater reductions in HbA 1c compared with liraglutide or placebo but with a higher frequency of GI AEs.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^26315fa5]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^8a92c780]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

A growing body of data from the STEP clinical trial programme has demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity. Across the STEP trials, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistently associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%‐17.4% in participants without diabetes, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, physical function and quality of life. Furthermore, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class. Results of other trials within the STEP programme are awaited, together with data from SELECT, which will provide valuable information on the impact of weight reduction with semaglutide 2.4 mg on decreasing CV risk.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^b3225d45]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease, leading to substantial burden on individuals and health care systems worldwide. Weight management guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2, or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with weight‐related comorbidities.,

Semaglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA) indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for weight management in people with overweight or obesity at a once‐weekly subcutaneous dose of 2.4 mg. In the phase III Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) 1‐4 studies, weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated substantial, clinically meaningful weight losses and improvements in cardiometabolic parameters and patient‐reported outcomes.,

Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs), most commonly mild‐to‐moderate nausea, are a dose‐dependent class effect of GLP‐1RAs. We conducted a pooled analysis of the STEP 1‐3 trials to evaluate the GI AE profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg. In addition, we explored whether GI AEs contributed to the weight‐loss effects of semaglutide in STEP 1‐3. Data from the STEP 4 withdrawal trial were analysed separately and used to evaluate the incidence of GI AEs after achievement of the target 2.4 mg maintenance dose. These analyses may inform understanding of both weight loss and GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

Based on the on‐treatment data excluding measurements after initiation of antiobesity therapy (other obesity pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery) from all randomized participants. Changes in body weight were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measurements, which included randomized treatment, stratification groups and their interaction (for STEP 2 only, including oral antihyperglycaemic drug treatment status and HbA1c category at screening) as factors, and baseline body weight as covariate, all nested within visit. Effects were estimated using a natural effects model (interaction between treatment and any GI AEs together with the baseline variables of body weight and stratification factors [STEP 2 only] as main effects, assuming no interaction between natural effects and baseline variables) with imputation‐based estimation. CIs are 95% Wald CIs. GI AEs comprise any type of GI disorder, including on‐treatment AEs (participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days)

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^e815b0c7]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The availability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analog, represents a paradigm shift in the management of obesity, a chronic, progressive, and relapsing disease. Newer‐generation nutrient‐stimulated, hormone‐based therapeutics are more effective for weight loss than previously approved medications, provide weight‐dependent and other pleotropic cardiometabolic effects, and are delivered as convenient weekly formulations. The phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) program evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for weight management in people with obesity or overweight.

Once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg was approved for chronic weight management by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022. In addition to improvements in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, a dedicated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (CVOT) was conducted to evaluate CV safety, as requested by the FDA and EMA for antiobesity medications (AOMs). In the Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) study, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced major adverse CV events (MACE) by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001) versus placebo in 17,604 patients with overweight and obesity and preexisting CV disease (CVD) without diabetes. The FDA recently approved a label expansion including this indication.

The effects of semaglutide on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk in a high‐risk population must be weighed against its safety profile. The safety profile is evaluated based on prospectively collected clinical trial data and continuous post‐marketing reporting. As the longest and largest placebo‐controlled study to date systematically evaluating semaglutide, SELECT significantly builds on data from the STEP studies, providing a unique opportunity to explore known and new safety signals. This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the safety data collected in SELECT (including all adverse events [AEs] leading to permanent treatment discontinuation) to support clinicians and policy makers in assessing the risk–benefit and potential coverage of semaglutide for relevant patients.

### GLP-1 agonists and gastrointestinal adverse events… [^3ad1057e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In our cohort study, we included new users of semaglutide or liraglutide, 2 main GLP-1 agonists, and the active comparator bupropion-naltrexone, a weight loss agent unrelated to GLP-1 agonists. Because semaglutide was marketed for weight loss after the study period, we ensured all GLP-1 agonist and bupropion-naltrexone users had an obesity code in the 90 days prior or up to 30 days after cohort entry, excluding those with a diabetes or antidiabetic drug code. They were followed up to the end of the study period or censored during a switch. Hazard ratios from a Cox model were adjusted for age, sex, alcohol use, smoking, hyperlipidemia, abdominal surgery in the previous 30 days, and geographic location, which were identified as common cause variables or risk factors.

6 Two sensitivity analyses were undertaken, one excluding hyperlipidemia and another including patients without diabetes regardless of having an obesity code. Our cohort included 4144 liraglutide, 613 semaglutide, and 654 bupropion-naltrexone users. Incidence rates for the 4 outcomes were elevated among GLP-1 agonists compared with bupropion-naltrexone users. For example, incidence of biliary disease was 11. 7 for semaglutide,
18. 6 for liraglutide, and 12. 6 for bupropion-naltrexone and
4. 6, 7. 9, and

1. 0, respectively, for pancreatitis. Use of GLP-1 agonists compared with bupropion-naltrexone was associated with increased risk of pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, and gastroparesis but not biliary disease.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^c8f34ae3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

We evaluated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) with once-weekly semaglutide 2.4mg in adults with overweight or obesity and their contribution to weight loss (WL).

Materials and Methods

AE analyses pooled data from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity (STEP) 1–3 trials for participants randomized to 68weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 2117) or placebo (n = 1262). WL was analysed by presence/absence of GI AEs. Mediation analysis estimated WL effects mediated by and unrelated to GI AEs. GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance and cessation after dose escalation was evaluated using STEP 4 data among 803 participants tolerating 20weeks of semaglutide run-in.

Results

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, with most frequently nausea (43.9% vs. 16.1% of participants), diarrhoea (29.7% vs. 15.9%), vomiting (24.5% vs. 6.3%) and constipation (24.2% vs. 11.1%). Most GI AEs with semaglutide were non-serious (99.5% of AEs), mild-to-moderate (98.1%), transient and occurred most frequently during/shortly after dose escalation. Few semaglutide-treated participants (4.3%) permanently discontinued treatment for GI AEs. In STEP 1–3, mean WL with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar in participants without (9.6%-17.1%) versus with GI AEs (11.4%-17.7%). Consistent with this observation, mediation analysis found that GI AEs contributed little to semaglutide-induced WL: of the additional 7.6%-14.4% WL with semaglutide versus placebo, < 1 percentage point was mediated by GI AEs. In STEP 4, semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance was well tolerated.

Conclusions

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, but typically mild-to-moderate and transient. Semaglutide-induced WL was largely independent of GI AEs.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^dec16d7a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8 is the first direct comparison of semaglutide with another weight‐management medication in a randomized trial. Semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated better efficacy than liraglutide as well as offering more convenient once‐weekly rather than once‐daily injections. Although direct comparisons with other treatments cannot be made because of methodological differences between trials, overall the weight loss with other approved medications appears to be more modest than that seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP trials.,

The STEP trials showed both short‐ and longer‐term improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight or obesity. Earlier data from PIONEER 6 and SUSTAIN 6 suggested a CV benefit of semaglutide at lower doses in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Together, these findings indicate a potential role for semaglutide in the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. The ongoing SELECT trial (NCT03574597) will report on CV outcomes with semaglutide 2.4 mg in a population without diabetes who are at high CV risk.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class and was similar to that seen in other trials of subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In clinical practice, the extensive experience with this molecule at the 1.0 mg dose in type 2 diabetes and with the GLP‐1RA class overall should ensure a certain degree of confidence in the safety profile. This includes the rate of severe or blood glucose‐confirmed hypoglycaemia, which in STEP 2 was reported in similar proportions of subjects receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg and 1.0 mg (5.7% and 5.5%, respectively).

The encouraging data from validated patient‐reported outcomes (Short Form‐36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version in STEP 1‐4 and Impact of Weight on Quality of Life‐Lite Clinical Trials Version questionnaire in STEP 1 and 2) point towards the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg being directly perceived by study participants.

### Advances in GLP-1 treatment: focus on oral semaglutide [^42224a0a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

PIONEER trials 1, 5, and 8 evaluated the effects of oral semaglutide in comparison with placebo. PIONEER 2 compared oral semaglutide with empagliflozin 25 mg, PIONEER trials 3 and 7 with sitagliptin 100 mg, and PIONEER 4 with placebo and liraglutide 1.8 mg.

The PIONEER 5 trial evaluated patients with advanced disease (T2D mean duration of 14.0 years and taking metformin and/or sulfonylurea or insulin with or without metformin). Specifically, this trial intended to explore the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide 14 mg compared with placebo in individuals with T2D and moderate renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2]. Finally, the design of PIONEER 6 assessed cardiovascular (CV) outcomes of oral semaglutide treatment versus placebo in patients with T2D at high CV risk [age ≥ 50 years with established CV or chronic kidney disease (CKD), or age ≥ 60 years with CV risk factors only].

All PIONEER trials verified HbA1c and weight. PIONEER trials 1–5, 7, and 8 aimed to evaluate glycemic control as the primary endpoint and weight as the secondary endpoint. On the other hand, the primary endpoint of PIONEER 6 was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of a major adverse CV event (MACE). The secondary endpoints included time from randomization to the first occurrence of an expanded composite CV endpoint; time from randomization to the first occurrence of the individual components of the expanded composite CV endpoint; time to the first occurrence of a composite of all‐cause death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction or non‐fatal stroke; time to all‐cause death; time to permanent trial drug discontinuation due to adverse events; the number of serious adverse events; and changes from baseline in a variety of laboratory and clinical assessments.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity, and the relationship between gastrointestinal adverse events and weight loss [^c3fe6988]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

We evaluated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) with once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with overweight or obesity and their contribution to weight loss (WL).

Materials and methods

AE analyses pooled data from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity (STEP) 1‐3 trials for participants randomized to 68 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 2117) or placebo (n = 1262). WL was analysed by presence/absence of GI AEs. Mediation analysis estimated WL effects mediated by and unrelated to GI AEs. GI tolerability with semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance and cessation after dose escalation was evaluated using STEP 4 data among 803 participants tolerating 20 weeks of semaglutide run‐in.

Results

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, with most frequently nausea (43.9% vs. 16.1% of participants), diarrhoea (29.7% vs. 15.9%), vomiting (24.5% vs. 6.3%) and constipation (24.2% vs. 11.1%). Most GI AEs with semaglutide were non‐serious (99.5% of AEs), mild‐to‐moderate (98.1%), transient and occurred most frequently during/shortly after dose escalation. Few semaglutide‐treated participants (4.3%) permanently discontinued treatment for GI AEs. In STEP 1‐3, mean WL with semaglutide 2.4 mg was similar in participants without (9.6%‐17.1%) versus with GI AEs (11.4%‐17.7%). Consistent with this observation, mediation analysis found that GI AEs contributed little to semaglutide‐induced WL: of the additional 7.6%‐14.4% WL with semaglutide versus placebo, < 1 percentage point was mediated by GI AEs. In STEP 4, semaglutide 2.4 mg maintenance was well tolerated.

Conclusions

GI AEs were more common with semaglutide 2.4 mg than placebo, but typically mild‐to‐moderate and transient. Semaglutide‐induced WL was largely independent of GI AEs.

3.3 Safety outcomes

The rates of AEs, AEs leading to trial product discontinuation and hypoglycaemia in Japanese patients are shown in Table 3.

TABLE 3
On‐treatment adverse events (AEs) (A) and most frequent gastrointestinal AEs (B) in Japanese patients in PIONEER 1, 3, 4 and 8

The overall incidence of AEs was similar between oral semaglutide 7 mg and 14 mg and active comparators; most were mild or moderate in severity, and < 10% and ≤ 17% of patients receiving oral semaglutide 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, discontinued their treatment owing to AEs. The proportions of patients receiving oral semaglutide who had serious AEs were generally low and similar to comparators. The most common class of AEs associated with oral semaglutide was gastrointestinal — most commonly constipation (in up to 23% of patients with oral semaglutide 14 mg), diarrhoea (up to 22% of patients with oral semaglutide 14 mg) and nausea (up to 19% of patients with oral semaglutide 14 mg). There was no clustering of AEs in any system organ class.

The incidence of severe (according to the American Diabetes Association definition) or blood‐glucose‐confirmed (< 3.1 mmol/L or 56 mg/dL) symptomatic hypoglycaemia was low across treatment arms in PIONEER 1, 3 and 4 (< 4% of patients in any treatment group); as anticipated, the incidence was higher in patients receiving background insulin in PIONEER 8 (21% to 27% with oral semaglutide and 28% with placebo; Table S4).

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists in managing MALFD: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6ef87f12]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Serious adverse events were systematically documented in 22 studies (84.6% of included studies), demonstrating reassuring safety profiles across therapeutic interventions (Table 2). The overall incidence of serious adverse events was generally comparable between treatment and control groups. Semaglutide studies reported serious adverse event rates of 7% to 13.4%, like placebo controls (8% to 13.4%). Dual agonists showed comparable patterns, with survodutide demonstrating 8% serious adverse events versus 7% placebo, while tirzepatide exhibited 15% versus 12% placebo. Additionally, the majority of liraglutide studies reported no serious drug-related adverse events, with isolated cases such as tuberculosis and migraines determined to be unrelated to study treatment following adjudication. One notable finding was the report of three malignant neoplasms in a semaglutide study (1% vs. 0% placebo); however, causality was not established given the known background malignancy risk in the study population and the limited follow-up period relative to carcinogenesis timelines.

Treatment discontinuations

Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was systematically tracked across 19 studies (73.1% of included studies), with rates demonstrating considerable variation by therapeutic agent and dosage (Table 2). Overall discontinuation rates ranged from 0% to 18%, with most studies reporting rates below 10%. Dual agonists were associated with higher discontinuation rates compared to mono GLP-1 receptor agonists. Cotadutide showed discontinuation rates of 7.7% to 16.7% across dose levels versus 4.2% placebo, while tirzepatide demonstrated dose-dependent discontinuations ranging from 7% to 18% across dose levels compared to 2% placebo. Mono GLP-1 agonists generally exhibited lower discontinuation rates, with several studies reporting zero discontinuations attributable to adverse events. The primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting, occurring predominantly during the initial weeks of treatment before symptom adaptation typically occurred.

Hypoglycemia and metabolic safety

Hypoglycemic events were infrequent across all studies, consistent with the glucose-dependent mechanism of action characterizing GLP-1 receptor agonists (Table 2). Comparative studies with insulin demonstrated similar or lower hypoglycemia rates with GLP-1 receptor agonists, while placebo-controlled trials revealed minimal hypoglycemic risk in the absence of concomitant sulfonylurea administration. This finding supports the favorable metabolic safety profile of these agents in MAFLD populations, many of whom have concurrent diabetes requiring careful glycemic management.

2.3 Statistical considerations

On‐treatment GI AE incidence was evaluated in post‐hoc analyses performed using pooled STEP 1‐3 data for semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms. STEP 4 was not included in the pooled analysis because of the differences in study design. For AE analyses, participants were considered to be on treatment if any dose of trial product was administered within the previous 49 days. The percentage of participants that experienced GI AEs and the event rate per 100 patient‐years of exposure were adjusted using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel weights to account for differences between trials. Median durations of GI AEs were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier estimator.

The effect of GI AEs on weight loss was explored using two different post‐hoc analyses:
A descriptive analysis of percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 68 among participants who did or did not experience GI AEs during STEP 1‐3, using observed body weight data from participants who were on treatment and had a body weight assessment at week 68 (on treatment was defined as any dose of trial product within the previous 2 weeks). Analyses were performed separately among participants with/without (i) any GI AEs and (ii) a subset of common GI AEs that were probably considered to influence weight loss (nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting).
Mediation analysis used a natural effects model with imputation‐based estimation, as described previously. This analysis aimed to separate the overall effects on body weight into effects mediated by GI AEs (indirect effects) and those unrelated to GI AEs (direct effects), for the STEP 1‐3 trials. Changes in body weight were analysed addressing the effect of treatment (if taken as intended) using a mixed model for repeated measurements.

GI AE incidence in the STEP 4 trial was analysed with a methodology similar to that used for the STEP 1‐3 pooled analysis, with the exception that no adjustment of AE incidence or event rate was performed. Data from participants able to tolerate the semaglutide 2.4 mg dose during the 20‐week run‐in period who were subsequently randomized were used to evaluate the effect of continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or cessation of treatment (switch to placebo) on GI AE incidence.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^657df84c]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^8827f2a4]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

AOMs are an important treatment option for people living with obesity who are unable to lose weight and maintain WL or for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery or who failed to maintain WL following bariatric surgery. The STEP clinical development program with the GLP‐1 analogue semaglutide provides rigorous assessment regarding the use of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly to treat people with obesity, with an effort to gain a greater understanding of WL, WL maintenance, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention. We anticipate that these trials will demonstrate that semaglutide represents a new and effective medication that can be used to improve the health and quality of life for patients with obesity.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^5eb5df9e]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

It is relevant to compare the SELECT study safety results with those of other semaglutide studies when assessing the risk–benefit profile. The STEP studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in addition to lifestyle interventions for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity with or without diabetes. Because the SELECT study excluded patients with diabetes, a comparison with the non‐diabetes STEP studies (STEP 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8) is warranted. These studies enrolled predominantly female patients (74%–81%) with a younger mean age (46–47 years), higher mean BMI (38 kg/m 2), and shorter treatment duration (68–204 weeks). In the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN 6) CVOT, patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD, chronic kidney disease, or both were randomized to once‐weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or placebo. This study population was more comparable with the SELECT study but had diabetes, had a shorter duration of treatment (104 weeks), and used a lower maintenance dose of semaglutide (up to 1.0 mg).

SAEs in the non‐diabetes STEP studies were less frequent than in the SELECT study and ranged from 7.7% to 9.8% for semaglutide versus 2.9% to 11.8% for placebo, reflecting shorter study durations and younger, healthier populations. In contrast, the proportions of SAEs in the SUSTAIN 6 CVOT were 35% (43.5 events per 100 PYO) and 33.6% (36.7 events per 100 PYO) for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, versus 39.9% (44.8 events per 100 PYO) and 36.1% (41.1 events per 100 PYO) for placebo. Although the proportions of patients with events in the SELECT study were similar to SUSTAIN 6, the event rates in the SELECT study are lower both in the patients treated with semaglutide (22.6 events per 100 PYO) and those treated with placebo (25.8 events per 100 PYO), despite the higher semaglutide dose in SELECT (2.4 mg vs. 0.5 and 1.0 mg).

Semaglutide 2.4 mg QW

The STEP 1 clinical trial has investigated the benefits of once-weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people who are obese or overweight. In a double-blind trial of 1961 nondiabetic obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2) or overweight patients (≥ 27 kg/m 2) with coexisting weight-related complications, semaglutide 2.4 mg along with lifestyle modifications led to a 14.9% reduction in body weight as compared with a 2.4% reduction with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of − 12.4 percentage points at 68 weeks. The mean reduction in body weight from baseline to week 68 was − 15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared to − 2.6 kg in the placebo group. 86.4, 69.1, and 50.5% of the patients on semaglutide 2.4 mg achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more, respectively, at the end of 68 weeks. Not only that, patients receiving semaglutide also reported significant improvement in cardiometabolic risk factors and physical functioning as compared to the placebo arm. Transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most common adverse events; these were of mild-to-moderate severity that subsided over time. The STEP 2 trial compared semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo and semaglutide 1 mg for weight management in a double-blind, double-dummy design in overweight and obese T2DM patients. At the end of 68 weeks, semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week demonstrated a superior and clinically meaningful decrease in body weight compared with placebo, with an estimated treatment difference of 6.2 percentage points (95% CI − 7.3 to − 5.2; p < 0.0001). A higher number of patients with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo achieved a weight loss of 5% or more (OR − 4.88, 95% CI 3.58–6.64). Furthermore, semaglutide 2.4 mg has been investigated versus placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and a low-calorie diet for weight management in 611 overweight and obese patients in the STEP 3 trial. Higher proportions of the patients in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm achieved weight losses of 5% or more, 10% or more, and 15% or more at the end of 68 weeks: 86.6, 75.3, and 55.8%, respectively.

5.2 Efficacy outcomes

Table 2 presents results of the primary and selected key secondary and exploratory endpoints across the trials. All trials met their primary endpoints. Across the 68‐week long trials in individuals with overweight or obesity with comorbidities without type 2 diabetes (STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8), semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with a mean weight loss of 14.9%‐17.4% from baseline to week 68 (Table 2). Furthermore, > 84% of participants were receiving the full dose of semaglutide at week 68.

TABLE 2
Efficacy results from the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials a

In STEP 1, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus usual lifestyle intervention was 14.9% (vs. 2.4% with placebo), whereas in STEP 3, mean weight loss with semaglutide plus intensive behavioural therapy was 16.0% (vs. 5.7% with placebo). In STEP 4, the mean decrease in body weight during the 20‐week run‐in period with semaglutide treatment was 10.6%. Individuals randomized to continue semaglutide lost an additional 7.9% in body weight from weeks 20 to 68, whereas individuals who switched to placebo experienced a mean 6.9% increase. In STEP 8, mean weight loss was greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with liraglutide 3.0 mg from baseline to week 68 (15.8% vs. 6.4%).

In the STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8 trials (the 68‐week long trials in participants without diabetes), weight loss of ≥ 5% (a threshold widely accepted as indicating clinically meaningful response to therapy)was achieved by 86%‐89% of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg versus 29%‐48% receiving placebo (Table 2). In these trials, 69%‐79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%‐27% with placebo), 51%‐64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%‐13% with placebo), and 32%‐40% achieved ≥ 20% weight loss (vs. 2%‐5% with placebo) (Table 2).

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^3a74f193]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

3.3 Incidence, timing and severity of most common gastrointestinal adverse events (1‐3 pooled analysis)

The most commonly reported GI AEs with semaglutide 2.4 mg were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation (Table S2). Relative to the placebo arm, the prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm were elevated throughout the 68‐week treatment period (Figure 2A‐D). The prevalence of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm peaked at about week 20 and decreased thereafter, with the most prominent decline found for nausea (Figure 2A‐C). Individual nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting events were relatively short‐lived: in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm, the median durations of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were 8, 3 and 2 days, respectively, and were similar to placebo (Figure 2A‐C). The median duration of constipation was longer: 47 days in the semaglutide arm and 35 days for placebo, with the prevalence plateauing at approximately week 10 (Figure 2D).

### Liraglutide vs semaglutide vs dulaglutide in veterans with type 2 diabetes [^b70bcaeb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Clinical Safety Outcomes

Semaglutide initiators had the highest unweighted incidence rates for all gastrointestinal adverse outcomes (eTable 12 in Supplement 1). However, in weighted Cox regression, the risks for each gastrointestinal adverse event were similar in both ITT (eTable 12 in Supplement 1) and PP analyses (eTable 13 in Supplement 1), except for a decreased risk for gallstones (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.95) and acute cholecystitis (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39–0.99) with dulaglutide vs semaglutide.

Secondary and Subgroup Analyses

Among those with nonmissing baseline weight (20 404 veterans [93.6%]), the estimated mean change in weight at month 24 was −9.7 (95% CI, −10.5 to −8.8) pounds with initial treatment with liraglutide, −12.2 (95% CI, −12.9 to −11.5) pounds for initial treatment with semaglutide, and −9.8 (95% CI, −10.6 to −8.9) pounds for initial treatment with dulaglutide (liraglutide vs dulaglutide: P = 0.86; liraglutide vs semaglutide: P < .001; dulaglutide vs semaglutide: P < .001) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Among 30 subgroups of interest, the risks for each outcome were similar among treatment groups (eFigure 5 in Supplement 1). Statistically significant interaction P values should be cautiously interpreted, given the numbers of treatment groups, outcomes, and subgroups without multiple-comparison adjustment.

Conclusion

In this post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10, nausea/vomiting contributed minimally to the significantly greater BW reductions with semaglutide versus exenatide ER, dulaglutide or liraglutide. These reductions were independent of the individual GI AEs of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia and constipation in a subset of GLP-1RA class comparators with which GI AEs are the most commonly observed AEs.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and tolerability of weekly NuSh agents — semaglutide and tirzepatide are dosed once weekly, and all agents require dose titration to minimize largely gastrointestinal adverse effects; slow titration mitigates intolerance, and for patients with adverse effects, decreasing the dose to a previously tolerated dose is recommended. In clinical trials, 4.3% to 7.1% of participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Among published clinical trials, the longest duration of treatment with a NuSh (liraglutide) was 3.8 years, and observational data across 5 years suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective; given that obesity is a chronic disease, weight regain after discontinuation of therapy is expected. Access and affordability challenges can lead to missed doses; should a patient miss doses due to lack of access, strategies exist to guide therapeutic interchanges, and if ≥ 3 missed dosages of once-weekly semaglutide or tirzepatide occur, a dose reduction may be considered.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction with once-weekly semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of gender, age, and baseline CV risk profile in the SUSTAIN 6 trial [^a390b03d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The SUSTAIN 6 trial demonstrated that once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE) vs placebo in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high CV risk. The effects of gender, age and baseline CV risk on outcomes are important considerations for further study.

Methods

Subjects were grouped according to gender, age (50–65 years and > 65 years), and CV risk profile at baseline (prior myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke vs no prior MI or stroke, and established CV disease [CVD] vs CV risk factors alone, including subjects with chronic kidney disease). Time to MACE and its individual components (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke), hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, and revascularization (coronary and peripheral) were analyzed for all subgroups. Additional analyses were performed for gender and age to investigate change from baseline in HbA 1c and body weight, as well as tolerability.

Results

A total of 3297 subjects were included. The majority of subjects (60.7%) were male; 43% were > 65 years of age; 41.5% had a history of MI or stroke; and 76.8% had established CVD. Compared with placebo, semaglutide reduced the risk of the first occurrence of MACE and each MACE component consistently across all subgroups (gender, age, and baseline CV risk profile). Revascularizations, HbA 1c and body weight were also reduced consistently across all subgroups compared with placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse events in all treatment groups were more common among women than men, but rates of premature treatment discontinuation were similar for both genders.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 6, once-weekly semaglutide vs placebo reduced the risk of MACE in all subjects included in the trial, regardless of gender, age, or baseline CV risk profile.

### Advances in GLP-1 treatment: focus on oral semaglutide [^3b1deb91]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is currently a large arsenal of antidiabetic drugs available to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, this is a serious chronic disease that affects millions of adults worldwide and is responsible for severe complications, comorbidities, and low quality of life when uncontrolled due mainly to delays in initiating treatment or inadequate therapy. This review article aims to clarify the therapeutic role of the oral formulation of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) semaglutide in treating typical T2D patients. The discussion focused on metabolic, glycemic, and weight alteration effects and the safety of the therapy with this drug.

Main Text

Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) promotes strategic changes in the pathophysiological pathway of T2D and improves the secretion of glucagon and insulin, which results in a reduction in blood glucose levels and the promotion of weight loss. Until recently, the only route for semaglutide administration was parenteral. However, an oral formulation of GLP-1 RA was recently developed and approved by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) program results. A sequence of 10 clinical studies compared oral semaglutide with placebo or active standard-of-care medications (empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or liraglutide 1.8 mg) in different T2D populations.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide effectively reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body weight in a broad spectrum of patients with T2D and shows cardiovascular safety. Oral semaglutide broadens therapy options and facilitates the adoption of earlier GLP-1 RA treatment once T2D patients present low rates of treatment discontinuation. The main adverse events reported were related to the gastrointestinal tract, common to GLP-1 RA class drugs.

### Tirzepatide after intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity: the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 trial [^211eb730]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The cumulative 24.3% reduction in body weight achieved with intensive lifestyle intervention, followed by tirzepatide, approximates the 1 year weight loss induced with sleeve gastrectomy. The overall BMI reduction of 10 kg/m 2 represents a downward shift of about two BMI categories. Participants treated with lifestyle interventions have long sought to achieve a similar magnitude of weight loss, principally to improve their health and quality of life. Tirzepatide enhanced the improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors that were achieved in the lead-in period. Systolic and diastolic BP improved by an additional −5.1 and −3.2 mmHg, respectively, lipids parameters improved by an additional −3% to −26% and fasting insulin further declined by 39%. Self-reported physical function improved by 3.3 points on the SF-36v2 physical functioning domain score and by 13.9 points on the IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function composite. These improvements underscore the additional benefits that patients may receive from treatment with tirzepatide after first losing weight with intensive lifestyle intervention, or potentially with their own self-directed diet and activity programs. By contrast, many of the cardiometabolic improvements achieved during the lead-in reverted toward baseline in the placebo group.

The safety profile of tirzepatide in this trial was consistent with findings from previous trials of tirzepatide when evaluated for the treatment of obesity, or type 2 diabetes, as well as with the safety profile of the GLP-1 receptor agonist class in patients with obesity or overweight. Mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events were the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, mostly transient and occurring during dose escalation. Compared with the tirzepatide 15 mg group in SURMOUNT-1, the tirzepatide group in this study had modestly higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Other trials that combined intensive lifestyle intervention with pharmacotherapy have also shown higher rates of gastrointestinal events compared with trials investigating pharmacotherapy without intensive lifestyle intervention (for example, STEP-3 compared with STEP-1 for semaglutide 2.4 mg and SCALE-MAINTENANCE compared with SCALE for liraglutide 3.0 mg). It has been speculated that caloric restriction could lead to a reduction in GLP-1 and other gastrointestinal satiety hormones. Whether this worsens initial gastrointestinal tolerability to incretin-based therapy and is a possible explanation for the observed findings requires further investigation.

Furthermore, in this analysis, there was no evidence of a temporal association between the incidence of GI AEs and weight loss at EOT. The prevalence of GI AEs with GLP-1RA treatment was previously found to peak within the initial 12 weeks of treatment and decline thereafter. However, subjects in all treatment arms experienced weight loss between baseline and week 12, and from baseline to EOT (SUSTAIN 3, week 56; SUSTAIN 7, week 40; SUSTAIN 10, week 30).

Excess weight is an important contributing factor in the complex etiology of T2D, and BW control is an important factor in the individualized management of T2D.GLP-1RAs are established and effective therapies for T2D and can be prescribed at all stages of T2D. In addition to managing glucose levels, GLP-1RAs also reduce BW, and this potential for weight loss has been reflected by the GLP-1RA liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily) gaining approval as a treatment for obesity. Because GI AEs including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea are the most common type of AE with GLP-1RAs, it is important to establish whether the weight loss difference between treatment is mediated through the occurrence of GI AEs.

### Adherence and persistence among patients with type 2 diabetes initiating dulaglutide compared with semaglutide and exenatide BCise: 6-month follow-up from US real-world data [^8a4be913]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Through the 6‐month follow‐up period, greater proportions of patients initiating semaglutide or exenatide BCise discontinued therapy than those who initiated dulaglutide. The observed proportions of patients who discontinued therapy for the dulaglutide cohorts were consistent with prior reports. Prior 6‐month US studies reported 26% to 37% of dulaglutide‐treated patients discontinued therapy, 17, 18 which is similar to the proportion of patients who discontinued dulaglutide in the present study (31% to 32%).

Analysis of treatment patterns among dulaglutide and semaglutide cohorts showed that patients who initiated the low dose and then switched to the high dose were more adherent across both cohorts compared to those with other dose patterns. Randomized controlled trials of dulaglutide and semaglutide have demonstrated dose‐dependent efficacy and gastrointestinal adverse events reporting, which in turn can potentially impact adherence and persistence. 28, 29 Given this, it is important to understand adherence and persistence outcomes by dosing pattern in real‐world settings. Across all dose patterns, the dulaglutide cohort had better adherence compared to the semaglutide cohort. Although the present study did not assess reasons for higher adherence rates observed in the dulaglutide cohorts, differences in patients' preference for the injection device, administration, and/or tolerability profiles for the GLP‐1RAs may have been factors. In a study evaluating patient preference for dulaglutide and semaglutide injection devices among injection‐naïve patients with T2D receiving OADs, a greater proportion of patients preferred the dulaglutide device than the semaglutide device (84.2% vs. 12.3%; P < 0.0001). 30 Patients perceived the dulaglutide device as having greater ease of use compared with the semaglutide device (86.8% vs. 6.8%; P < 0.0001). 30 Patients' preference for a device may contribute to better willingness to use a medication, which could result in improved medication adherence and patient outcomes. Better adherence with dulaglutide versus semaglutide may also have been attibutable to differences in adverse event profiles. In a head‐to‐head clinical trial of dulaglutide versus semaglutide, numerically higher proportions of patients discontinued semaglutide due to adverse events compared with dulaglutide‐treated patients for both low‐ (8% vs. 5%) and high‐ (10% vs. 7%) dose patient cohorts. 31 Additionally, numerically higher proportions of semaglutide‐treated patients reported gastrointestinal adverse events compared with dulaglutide‐treated patients in the low‐dose cohort; gastrointestinal adverse events also led to a greater proportion of treatment discontinuations for semaglutide‐treated patients. 31

2.4 Statistical analysis

No power calculations were performed to determine the sample size. All extension phase analyses were exploratory and performed in the extension analysis set (ExAS), which included all participants eligible for the extension who attended at least one visit on week 75, 80, 104 or 120.

Endpoints addressing the first exploratory objective were analysed descriptively using observed data from the in‐trial period (the time from randomization to last contact with a trial site) for the ExAS. No estimands were specified.

Endpoints addressing the second exploratory objective were analysed descriptively and statistically using data from the in‐trial period for the ExAS. Results for the ExAS were compared with results previously reported for the full analysis set (FAS), which included all participants randomized in the main phase according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. For the statistical analyses reported herein, the treatment policy estimand was used to quantify the 68‐week treatment effect of semaglutide (relative to placebo) in all participants, irrespective of treatment adherence or initiation of other obesity therapies. Week 68 responses were examined using an analysis of covariance model with randomized treatment as factor and baseline endpoint value as covariate. Missing observations were multiply (x 1000) imputed from participants within the same randomized treatment arm with available measurements at week 68. Results from statistical analyses were accompanied by two‐sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Percentage changes in body weight and selected cardiometabolic risk factors were calculated relative to the baseline value of the variable.

### Discontinuation and reinitiation of dual-labeled GLP-1 receptor agonists among US adults with overweight or obesity [^6cb63f2e]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Adherence to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) is important for their effectiveness. Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns are not well understood.

Objective

To describe rates of and factors associated with discontinuation and subsequent reinitiation of GLP-1 RAs among adults with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this retrospective cohort study, 125 474 adults with overweight or obesity newly initiated treatment with a dual-labeled GLP-1 RA (liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide) between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023, with a baseline body mass index of 27 or more, an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation were identified using electronic health record data from a collective of US health care systems. Patients were followed up for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

Exposure

Patients were stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes at baseline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportions of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations of sociodemographic characteristics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal adverse events with discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression models. All analyses were conducted separately for patients with and patients without type 2 diabetes.

Results

In this cohort study of 125 474 adults (mean [SD] age, 54.4 [13.1] years; 82 063 women [65.4%]), 76 524 (61.0%) had type 2 diabetes. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without type 2 diabetes (64.8% [95% CI, 64.4%-65.2%]) compared with those with type 2 diabetes (46.5% [95% CI, 46.2%-46.9%]). Higher weight loss (1% reduction in weight from baseline was associated with a 3.1% [95% CI, 2.9%-3.2%] lower hazard of discontinuation for patients with type 2 diabetes and a 3.3% [95% CI, 3.2%-3.5%] lower hazard of discontinuation for patients without type 2 diabetes) and higher income (type 2 diabetes only; > $80 000: hazard ratio [HR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.69–0.76]) were significantly associated with lower rates of discontinuation, while moderate or severe incident gastrointestinal adverse events were associated with a higher hazard of discontinuation (with type 2 diabetes: HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.31–1.45]; without type 2 diabetes: HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12–1.27]). Of 41 792 patients who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight measurement available, 1-year reinitiation was lower for those without type 2 diabetes (36.3% [95% CI, 35.6%-37.0%]) compared with those with type 2 diabetes (47.3% [95% CI, 46.6%-48.0%]). Weight regain of 1% from discontinuation was significantly associated with increased hazards of reinitiation of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.9%-2.8%) for patients with type 2 diabetes and 2.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-3.2%) for patients without type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, most patients with overweight or obesity discontinued GLP-1 RA therapy within 1 year, but those without type 2 diabetes had higher discontinuation rates and lower reinitiation rates. Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential to exacerbate disparities in obesity.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^666a72ea]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Consistent with the GLP-1RA class, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) were the most frequently reported AEs in the SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials: 42% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 33% with exenatide ER 2.0 mg in SUSTAIN 3; 43% with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs 33% with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and 44% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 48% with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in SUSTAIN 7; 44% with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 38% with liraglutide 1.2 mg in SUSTAIN 10. The five most commonly reported GI AEs in SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 were: nausea (23% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 21%–22% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 12%–20% with comparators); vomiting (10% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 7%–10% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 4%–10% with comparators); diarrhea (14% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 11%–16% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 8%–18% with comparators); dyspepsia (3% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 4%–7% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3%–5% with comparators) and constipation (5% with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 5%–6% with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3%–5% with comparators).

Potential limitations of this post hoc analysis include its inherent retrospective nature and that it was not sufficiently powered to detect the effects assessed. For example, the small number of subjects per treatment arm in the groups that experienced GI AE; therefore, results should be interpreted in this context. Another possible limitation is the different durations of follow-up for subjects with GI AE in all three trials. In addition, the results should be viewed in the context that SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 were open-label trials and nausea is a subjective symptom. Furthermore, in the mediation analysis, the effect of 'one unit' mediator was assumed to be the same in the treatment arms being compared. Mediation analyses rely on strong, unverifiable assumptions, and the results of the analysis may be biased in case of potential unknown confounders that affect the risk of experiencing GI AEs as well as change in BW.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^a861f213]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide by baseline age in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a subgroup analysis of the PIONEER 9 and 10 Japan trials [^18ee0497]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the PIONEER 9 and 10 trials evaluated the effect of baseline age (< 65 and ≥ 65years) on the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. In PIONEER 9 and 10, patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (3, 7 or 14mg) or a comparator (placebo or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 0.9 mg [PIONEER 9]; once-weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide 0.75mg [PIONEER 10]) for 52weeks, with 5weeks' follow-up. In total, 701 patients were included (PIONEER 9: N = 243; PIONEER 10: N = 458). Glycaemic efficacy of oral semaglutide was similar in Japanese patients aged < 65years compared with those ≥ 65years, and there did not appear to be a clear pattern between age subgroup and body weight changes. Across treatment arms, adverse events generally occurred in greater proportions of patients aged ≥ 65 versus < 65years. There was generally a higher rate of premature trial product discontinuation because of adverse events in the older age group. These results indicate that oral semaglutide is efficacious in Japanese patients irrespective of age.

### Efficacy and safety of efpeglenatide in key patient subgroups from the BALANCE randomized trial, stratified by pre-diabetes status, BMI, and age at baseline [^1bf42144]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Currently, there are two GLP-1 RAs approved for body weight management in patients with obesity and without diabetes: liraglutide, administered as a once-daily injection; and semaglutide, administered QW. In a trial in patients with obesity and without T2D, 20-week treatment with liraglutide 1.8–3.0 mg once daily led to an 84%–96% decrease in the prevalence of pre-diabetes (defined as FPG 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL) or glucose tolerance 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL) measured during an oral glucose tolerance test). Liraglutide was also shown to reduce the incidence of progression to T2D in a study of adults with pre-diabetes and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² (or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities). Of patients treated with liraglutide, 2% were diagnosed with diabetes after 3 years compared with 6% of the placebo group, and the time from randomization to diagnosis was 2.7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (p < 0.0001). The recent Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) phase III clinical trial program explored the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide in overweight adults without diabetes with a BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4)or in adults with T2D with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 (STEP 2). All trials showed that semaglutide was associated with significantly greater body weight reductions and a greater proportion of patients achieved weight loss of 5% or greater compared with placebo. The STEP 1 study also showed that, of patients with pre-diabetes, 84.1% of those in the once-weekly semaglutide group reverted to normoglycemia after 68 weeks of treatment, compared with 47.8% in the placebo group.

### Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) [^3dd3e427]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment with RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily for 26 weeks resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1ccompared to placebo. Treatment with RYBELSUS 14 mg once daily for 26 weeks resulted in non-inferior reductions in HbA1ccompared to liraglutide 1.8 mg (see Table 7).

Table 7. Results at Week 26 in a Trial of RYBELSUS Compared to Liraglutide and Placebo in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Combination with Metformin or Metformin with SGLT-2i

aThe intent-to-treat population includes all randomized patients. At week 26, the primary HbA1cendpoint was missing for 5.6%, 4.2% and 2.5% of patients randomized to placebo, liraglutide 1.8 mg and RYBELSUS 14 mg, respectively. Missing values were imputed by a pattern mixture model using multiple imputation (MI). Pattern was defined by randomized treatment and treatment status at week 26. During the trial, additional anti-diabetic medication was initiated as an add on to randomized treatment by 7.7%, 3.2% and 3.5% of patients randomized to placebo, liraglutide 1.8 mg and RYBELSUS 14 mg respectively.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^48e04515]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 RAs and the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo-controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from -0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20μg q.d.) to -1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from -0.75 ± 0.10kg to -9.65 ± 0.56kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose-lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

### Glucagon-like peptide agonists: a prospective review [^3c10a9c6]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A STEP 1 trial showed that the total weight loss from the liraglutide therapy was around 5.4%, with an estimated cost of the entire trial being $17,585. Similarly, in a SCALE study using semaglutide, 12.4% weight loss was observed, with an estimated trial cost of $22,878. This resulted in a conclusion that the cost per 1% of weight for semaglutide was $1845, significantly lower, and hence more efficient than liraglutide, which was $3256.

2.2 Exenatide

Exenatide and semaglutide are similar in homology, with 42.5% sequence identity and 52.5% sequence similarity. They have significantly improved glycemic control, reducing HbA1c levels in clinical trials. Semaglutide has shown superior HbA1c reduction compared to exenatide in some head‐to‐head studies, and both have shown cardiovascular benefits in specific clinical trials, with reductions in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) reported.

Phase 3a, open‐label, parallel‐group, randomized controlled trial, SUSTAIN 3study conducted in 2013 evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide once‐weekly versus exenatide extended‐release (ER). The study comprised 813 subjects and showed that after 56 weeks of treatment, Semaglutide 1.0 mg outperformed exenatide ER 2.0 mg in improving glycemic control and reducing body weight. Despite these differences in efficacy, both drugs had similar safety profiles. These findings suggest semaglutide is a highly effective treatment option for individuals with T2D who have inadequate control of oral antidiabetic medications.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^85799958]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the STEP trials presented in this article and the phase 2 trial of semaglutide (21). In comparison with the WM in T2D trial (STEP 2), the phase 2 trial had a numerically higher BMI (39.3 kg/m 2) and waist circumference (117.8 cm). This was due to STEP 2 having a lower threshold‐for‐BMI inclusion criterion (≥ 27 kg/m 2) than the phase 2 trial (≥ 30 kg/m 2). Overall, the phase 2 trial has a numerically lower HbA 1c level (5.5%) than the STEP trials, particularly for STEP 2 (21). However, cross‐trial comparisons should be interpreted cautiously.

At the time of initiation of the phase 2 trial, it was hypothesized that daily dosing of semaglutide would result in a more favorable tolerability profile compared with weekly administration, and, therefore, the once‐daily administration of semaglutide was investigated. The phase 2 WM trial of semaglutide daily resulted in dose‐dependent, clinically relevant WL over 52 weeks and associated with an acceptable tolerability profile with respect to gastrointestinal symptoms (21). However, based on comparisons with studies with weekly administration of semaglutide, it was reported that there was no difference in gastrointestinal adverse events with the daily versus weekly dosing regimen of semaglutide (33). Furthermore, using population pharmacokinetic modeling, it was estimated that a once‐weekly maintenance dose of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously would not exceed the maximum concentration at steady state as obtained by the once‐daily semaglutide 0.4‐mg subcutaneous dose. Hence, a decision was made to change dosing for semaglutide from daily to weekly to improve adherence and convenience for participants.

Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs — evidence summary: To date, no trials have studied the CV outcome effects of concomitant use of both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit. DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.

### Semaglutide once weekly in people with type 2 diabetes: real-world analysis of the Canadian LMC diabetes registry (SPARE study) [^21980b4a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present study, significant improvements were also observed in BMI, blood pressure and lipid profile following initiation of semaglutide. Therapies for diabetes that improve not only glycaemia but also weight, blood pressure and lipids may have additional benefit in the risk reduction of the cardiovascular and microvascular complications that are associated with diabetes. 1 Importantly, self‐reported hypoglycaemia did not significantly differ between baseline and follow‐up, even among those using SU or insulin therapy. Individuals using insulin experienced a significant reduction in insulin dose, particularly for those using a basal‐bolus insulin regimen. A reduction in insulin dose was also reported in participants adding semaglutide to basal insulin in the SUSTAIN 5 trial. 8

During the 3‐ to 6‐month follow‐up period, 17.3% of the cohort discontinued semaglutide therapy, which is higher than that reported in RCTs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Although this discontinuation rate is similar to a retrospective, real‐world study of a similar group of people initiating dulaglutide or liraglutide in the LMC Diabetes Registry, 17 the discontinuation rate is lower compared to other real‐world evaluations of dulaglutide, liraglutide, or exenatide. 18, 19, 20 Participants in this cohort were attending multidisciplinary specialist clinics operating in a well‐resourced public health system, which may have improved persistence.

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^ce8af4c6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

### Semaglutide as a therapeutic option for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes: pooled analysis of the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials [^1a49de5d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of semaglutide vs comparators in non-elderly (< 65 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials were evaluated. Patients were randomized to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg) vs placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide or insulin. The primary objective was change in HbA1c and secondary objectives were changes in body weight and safety. Mean HbA1c decreased from baseline by 1.2%-1.5% and 1.5%-1.9% vs 0%-0.9% (non-elderly, n = 3045) and by 1.3%-1.5% and 1.2%-1.8% vs 0.2%-1.0% (elderly, n = 854) with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs comparators. Similar reductions from baseline in mean body weight with semaglutide occurred in both age groups. Similar proportions of patients experienced adverse events; premature treatment discontinuations were higher in elderly vs non-elderly patients. No increased risk of severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycaemia was seen with semaglutide vs comparators between age groups. Semaglutide had a comparable efficacy and safety profile in non-elderly and elderly patients across the SUSTAIN 1–5 trials, making it an effective treatment option for elderly patients with T2D.

Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy in adults without diabetes and chronic coronary disease (CCD) representation — semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide — shows significant weight-loss effects and cardiovascular signals. In STEP 8 (N = 338, 3.3% with known CCD), once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 achieved greater weight loss than once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo (mean weight change, −15.8% [95% CI, −17.6 to −13.9] versus −6.4% [95% CI, −8.2 to −4.6], versus −1.9% [95% CI, −4.0 to 0.2]). Both semaglutide (0.5–1.0 mg weekly) and liraglutide (1.2–1.8 mg daily) were associated with reduced MACE in patients with type 2 diabetes and CCD. SURMOUNT-1 reported dose-dependent weight loss with tirzepatide (mean weight change up to −20.9% [95% CI, −21.8 to −19.9]) using once-weekly subcutaneous doses (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) in obese adults without diabetes (N = 2539, 3.1% with ASCVD) over 72 weeks.

### Real-world effectiveness analysis of switching from liraglutide or dulaglutide to semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the retrospective REALISE-DM study [^3fc35e90]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injectable semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that was previously shown to be superior to liraglutide and dulaglutide in head-to-head comparisons in GLP-1 RA-naïve individuals. It is hypothesized that semaglutide will cause further reductions in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients previously treated with liraglutide or dulaglutide. The REALISE-DM study provides the first real-world evidence of the effectiveness and tolerability of semaglutide in patients switching from another GLP-1 RA.

Methods

This retrospective real-world effectiveness analysis included T2DM adults who were on a stable dose of liraglutide or dulaglutide prior to switching to semaglutide. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were the changes in weight and body mass index (BMI), the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects (GSEs), and discontinuations. Linear mixed models were used to estimate changes in HbA1c, weight, and BMI, and logistic regression was employed to analyze GSEs and discontinuations.

Results

Six months after the 164 patients in this study had switched to semaglutide, their mean HbA1c had decreased by 0.65% (7.1 mmol/mol) (95% prediction interval [PI]: 0.48, 0.81% [5.2, 8.9 mmol/mol]) from a baseline of 7.9% (interquartile range [IQR]: 7.3, 8.8) (62.8 mmol/mol [IQR: 56.3, 72.7]), while their weight and BMI had reduced by 1.69 kg (95% PI: 1.01, 2.37) and 0.59 kg/m 2 (95% PI: 0.34, 0.84), respectively. Nineteen patients (11.6%) developed GSEs after switching.

Conclusions

This study supports switching T2DM patients on liraglutide or dulaglutide to injectable semaglutide to achieve further reductions in HbA1c and weight. Although a small number of GSEs occurred, semaglutide was well tolerated by the majority of the patients.

### GLP-1 agonist discontinuation among patients with obesity and… [^7eeaa529]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

One study found a 12-month discontinuation of 45. 2% among patients with T2D. 3 In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GLP-1 agonist discontinuation among new users with T2D or obesity and the patient characteristics associated with discontinuation. Data from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023, came from the Komodo Healthcare Map database. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board deemed this cohort study exempt from review and informed consent because it used deidentified data. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline. Baseline clinical characteristics were T2D, obesity, heart failure, other CVD conditions besides HF, and chronic kidney disease. Adverse effects included new gastrointestinal disease diagnosis at the 12-month follow-up. Out-of-pocket cost was calculated per 30-day supply of GLP-1 agonist at the 12-month follow-up. Overall PDC was 81. 1%,
72. 3%, and 64. 3% for the same 3 periods.

Patients with obesity only had a higher prevalence of discontinuation at 12 months vs those with T2D only and those with both. Patients had significantly higher odds of discontinuation at 12 months if they were Black or Hispanic, male, and Medicare or Medicaid enrollees; lived in areas with very high levels of social needs; had obesity only, HF, or other CVD conditions besides HF at baseline; and had new gastrointestinal adverse effects at follow-up. GLP-1 agonist discontinuation was higher among those with obesity only than those with T2D at baseline. Specific demographic, clinical, and financial characteristics were associated with discontinuation. Study limitations include the exclusion of tirzepatide and whether weight reduction or adverse effects could explain the higher prevalence of discontinuation among patients with obesity.

Discontinuation could have policy and medication coverage implications, especially if the weight reduction is not sustained after medications are discontinued.
