## Question

What is it called when predicting that someone will hurt another person because they are mad?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it's called to predict that someone will hurt another person because they are angry. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether medicine frames this as prediction versus risk assessment. Then, I should identify the standard psychiatric term used in clinical and forensic settings. Next, I will compare nearby terms that could be confused with it (threat assessment, interpersonal violence screening, psychosis-related constructs). Finally, I will verify the evidence base for the preferred term and provide a concise, clinically accurate answer with context [^1111tzqM].

> Let me first confirm the core construct. In clinical psychiatry, estimating the likelihood that a person will engage in future aggression toward others is termed a violence risk assessment (often phrased as assessing risk of violence to others), and contemporary best practice emphasizes structured approaches over unstructured clinician prediction, reflecting stronger empirical support for actuarial and structured professional judgment methods [^1111tzqM] [^111GApwx].

> Wait, let me verify that similar-sounding terms are not more accurate for this question. Threat assessment is largely a security or law-enforcement term and is not the standard medical phrasing; meanwhile, screening for interpersonal violence in healthcare typically identifies victims or safety concerns rather than predicts perpetration, so it does not match the ask here [^114hHjEN]. Hold on, I should also check psychosis-linked constructs such as threat/control-override; those describe a cognitive mechanism associated with aggression risk in psychosis-proneness, but they are not the umbrella term for the act of prediction itself [^114enU7J]. I need to ensure I note that clinicians do integrate specific cues (e.g., recent threats, past violence) when forming risk judgments, yet structured instruments are preferred given the limits of unaided opinion; moreover, making threats to kill can be a meaningful longitudinal risk signal, which is why such cues are folded into risk formulations [^111GApwx] [^115SA1be] [^1111tzqM].

> Let me consider the role of anger specifically, because the question highlights being "mad". The proximal motivational subtype here is reactive aggression (anger-driven, impulsive), which is a useful descriptor of the aggression phenotype; however, the clinical act of estimating future harm remains a violence risk assessment, with the reactive versus proactive distinction informing the risk formulation rather than changing the overarching term [^114xEgkK] [^1111tzqM].

> I should now state the answer succinctly. The medical terminology for predicting that someone will hurt another person because they are angry is violence risk assessment, also described as assessing risk of violence to others; in practice, this is conducted with structured or structured-professional judgment tools rather than relying solely on unstructured clinician prediction [^1111tzqM] [^111GApwx].

---

The term for predicting someone will hurt others because they are angry is **violence risk assessment** or **threat assessment**. These structured processes evaluate the likelihood of **future harm** based on anger, past behavior, and context, using **validated tools and clinical judgment** to guide prevention and intervention [^1111tzqM]. Anger-related aggression is often **reactive** and linked to threat perception, so assessments focus on anger intensity, triggers, and coping to inform **risk management** [^111GApwx] [^114xEgkK].

---

## Definitions and terminology

- **Violence risk assessment**: A structured process to estimate the likelihood of future violence, integrating static and dynamic risk factors, clinical judgment, and validated tools [^1111tzqM].

- **Threat assessment**: A related process that identifies, evaluates, and manages threats of harm, often used in workplaces, schools, and law enforcement.

- **Anger-related aggression**: Reactive aggression driven by anger or perceived provocation, distinct from premeditated aggression [^114xEgkK].

---

## Psychological and behavioral factors

Key factors considered when predicting **harm due to anger** include:

- **Anger intensity and frequency**: Higher intensity and frequent anger episodes increase risk of aggressive behavior [^114xEgkK].

- **Impulse control**: Poor impulse control or impulsivity is strongly associated with reactive aggression.

- **Past aggressive behavior**: History of aggression or violence is a significant predictor of future harm.

- **Cognitive distortions**: Hostile attribution bias and other distortions can amplify perceived threats and provoke aggression [^114enU7J].

- **Emotional regulation**: Difficulty regulating emotions, particularly anger, increases risk of harmful behavior [^114mzvh9].

---

## Clinical assessment tools and methods

Clinicians use various **tools and methods** to assess the risk of harm related to anger [^1111tzqM]:

| **Assessment tool/method** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Historical Clinical Risk Management-20 (HCR-20) | Structured professional judgment tool assessing historical, clinical, and risk management factors |
| Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG) | Actuarial tool predicting violent recidivism based on static risk factors |
| Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) | Tool specifically designed for assessing violence risk in adolescents |
| Clinical interviews | Semi-structured interviews exploring anger triggers, coping strategies, and past behavior |
| Self-report questionnaires | Tools like the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) assess anger expression and control |

---

## Accuracy and reliability of predictions

The accuracy and reliability of violence risk assessments vary; structured tools demonstrate **moderate predictive accuracy** (AUC approximately 0.70–0.75) [^1111tzqM]. **Clinical judgment** is generally less reliable than structured tools yet remains essential for contextualizing risk factors [^111GApwx]. Predictions are **probabilistic**, with both false positives and false negatives.

---

## Ethical considerations

Predicting harm due to anger requires **balancing patient confidentiality** with obligations to warn or protect potential victims, when applicable. Assessments should avoid bias and discrimination and use evidence-based, transparent methods. Ethical practice also requires offering appropriate interventions to reduce risk and support individuals.

---

## Interventions and preventive measures

Effective interventions to prevent **harm due to anger** include:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Addresses anger management, impulse control, and cognitive distortions [^114uvLa6].

- **Anger management programs**: Structured programs teaching coping strategies and emotional regulation.

- **Medication**: Pharmacological interventions for underlying psychiatric conditions contributing to anger.

- **Social support**: Enhancing social support networks to reduce stress and anger triggers.

- **Environmental modifications**: Reducing exposure to triggers and stressors.

---

## Legal implications

Legal implications include potential **duties to warn** identifiable victims or alert authorities when a credible risk is present. Incorrect predictions can expose clinicians and institutions to liability, while confidentiality laws generally apply unless there is a clear, imminent risk of harm. The scope of these obligations depends on jurisdiction.

---

## Cultural and contextual influences

Cultural norms shape anger expression and perceptions of aggression, influencing risk formulations. Socioeconomic status, environment, and the strength of social support also influence anger-related behavior. **Cultural competence** is therefore essential in both assessment and intervention.

---

## Limitations and challenges

Risk prediction is constrained by the complexity of human behavior and the probabilistic nature of forecasts, resulting in both **false positives and false negatives**. Ethical dilemmas arise when balancing confidentiality, accuracy, and timely intervention. Practical barriers include limited access to validated tools and adequately trained professionals.

---

Predicting harm due to anger is called **violence risk assessment** or **threat assessment**. These structured processes evaluate anger intensity, impulse control, and past behavior to guide prevention and intervention.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111tzqM]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

With the increasing recognition of the public health importance of violence, the prediction of violence, or violence risk assessment, has been the subject of considerable clinical and research interest. Since the late 1980s, such assessment has mostly been conducted by structured instruments after several studies found unstructured clinical opinion to have little evidence in support. Recent surveys have estimated that over 60% of general psychiatric patients are routinely assessed for violence risk, rising to above 80% in forensic psychiatric hospitals.

The widespread use of these tools has been partly driven by public concern about the safety of mentally ill patients, research evidence that severe mental illness is associated with violence, and clinical practice guidelines in some countries, including the United Kingdom and United States, recommending violence risk assessment for all patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, criminal justice systems in many countries have welcomed the use of risk assessment to assist sentencing and release decisions. Risk assessment has been used to inform indeterminate sentencing in the UK and has become a largely uncontested part of an expanded criminal justice process in the US. Furthermore, a 2004 survey reported that of the 32 US states where parole is an option, 23 had used such instruments as part of these decisions.

The group of risk assessment tools either provide a probabilistic estimate of violence risk in a specified time period (actuarial instruments) or allow for a professional judgment to be made on risk levels.

### Understanding brain mechanisms of reactive aggression [^114xEgkK]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Threat elicits fear of harm followed by avoidance tendencies, but can also provoke reactive aggression. In the animal model, so-called defensive, fear-driven, hyperarousal-associated aggression has been extensively studied. It occurs in situations challenging survival or defending limited supply in rivalry conditions and is related to increased activity in the medial amygdala. In rodents, this activity was positively related to aggression and associated automatic stress responses in a post-weaning social isolation model. This finding may point to a possible brain mechanism for human threat-related aggression in clinical groups with a history of childhood maltreatment.

In animals and humans, the likelihood of aggression in response to social threat depends on both situational and trait factors.

- **Situational factors**: Aggressive attack occurs in reaction to intense, inescapable social threats. While Blanchard claims a distinct "fear of harm" phenotype of human aggression associated with the emotion of fear, others suggest that fear-related escape behavior is likely to turn into anger-related approach, and thus aggressive behavior, in the face of inescapable threat. Whenever circumstances permit, individuals tend to calculate the value of response and gauge consequences of attack or escape in response to social threat.

- **Trait factors**: Approach-avoidance tendencies moderate decision-making. While aggressive approach may be adaptive in the context of inescapable threat, individuals with high fear reactivity or strong avoidance tendencies face challenges in these situations.

### A neural signature for the subjective experience of threat anticipation under uncertainty [^1148SY17]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Uncertainty refers to the inability to predict the outcome of a situation, or the likelihood, valence, intensity, time, or type of future events. It represents an essential part of our daily lives, ranging from uncertainty in the early stages of a romantic relationship to the likelihood of catching a COVID-19 infection or the magnitude of climate change. Uncertainty about potential threats in the future and the associated anticipatory processes are central to the feeling of anxiety. While anxiety serves an important adaptive function to avoid or cope with potential danger, excessive anticipatory anxiety in the face of uncertainty represents a key symptom of anxiety disorders. Contemporary neurobiological frameworks for mental disorders therefore consider 'potential threat' and 'uncertainty intolerance' as candidate mechanisms of anxiety (e.g. the Research Domain Criteria, RDoC). However, the neural pathways that underlie the actual subjective experience of uncertainty-induced threat anticipation remain unclear.

Uncertain threat anticipation represents a prototypical paradigm to evoke experimental anxiety. Rodent models have identified brain systems that mediate the behavioral and physiological responses to uncertain situations (e.g. shock-probe burying). The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), for instance, critically mediates defensive behaviors (e.g. freezing, flight, and avoidance) during uncertain threat anticipation and has also been proposed as a key anxiety system in the RDoC framework. Other core regions include the medial prefrontal cortex.

### Public health assessment of potential biological terrorism agents [^114VLHMW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Category A agents are prioritized highest for preparedness. For Category B, public health preparedness efforts focus on addressing deficiencies such as improving awareness and enhancing surveillance or laboratory diagnostic capabilities. Category C agents will undergo further assessment for their potential to threaten large populations as additional information becomes available on their epidemiology and pathogenicity. Special epidemiologic and laboratory surge capacity will be maintained to assist in the investigation of naturally occurring outbreaks due to Category C "emerging" agents. Linkages with established programs for food safety, emerging infectious diseases, and unexplained illnesses will augment the overall bioterrorism preparedness efforts for many Category B and C agents.

The above categories of agents should not be considered definitive. The prioritization of biological agents for preparedness efforts should continue, and agents in each category may change as new information emerges or new assessment methods are established. Disease elimination and eradication efforts may result in new agents being added as populations lose their natural or vaccine-induced immunity to these agents. Conversely, the priority status of certain agents may be reduced as public health and medical deficiencies related to these agents are addressed. For example, once adequate stores of smallpox vaccine and improved diagnostic capabilities are established, its rating within the special preparedness needs category could be adjusted.

### Emotions and individual differences shape human foraging under threat [^115ShnLt]. Nature. Mental health (2025). High credibility.

Compulsive checking, as measured by the OCI (revised) 'checking' subscale (OCI-RC), was linked with increased behavioral threat avoidance, such as returning later from hiding, and self-reported threat avoidance, like 'I hid longer than necessary because I was afraid to leave the hiding place'. This is in agreement with previous findings on harm avoidance, although previous studies have focused on active harm avoidance — engaging in actions to avoid harm — rather than the more passive avoidance observed here. Compulsive checking was also linked to increased self-reported disorganized checking, for instance, 'I sometimes checked again for a predator even though I had just finished checking'. However, behavioral evidence for this was weak, as the pre-registered overall statistical test did not replicate, even though some individual items did replicate. Self-reports of disorganized checking are consistent with the clinical picture of repeated checking. Studies have highlighted memory distrust or increased decision thresholds as possible reasons. However, given the lack of behavioral evidence for this, it might not be a general feature but rather dependent on task factors. It is noteworthy that both anxiety and compulsivity were associated with self-reports aligned with a 'folk theory' of the disease, which sometimes are not reflected in behavioral measures.

### Alcohol stress response dampening: Selective reduction of anxiety in the face of uncertain threat [^111Ej3FY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Problematic alcohol use and stress response dampening (SRD) are intimately interconnected. Recent evidence suggests that alcohol produces selective SRD during uncertain, but not certain, threat. We systematically varied shock probability in a novel task assessing alcohol SRD during low-probable, uncertain threat, while holding temporal precision of threat constant. Intoxicated (0.08% target blood alcohol concentration) and placebo participants completed a cued shock threat task in which the probability of shock administration at the offset of brief visual cues varied parametrically. High probability (100%) shock cues represented certain threat, as used in earlier research, while lower probability (20% and 60%) shock cues provided novel uncertain threat conditions. Startle potentiation during cues and inter-trial intervals (ITIs) served as the measure of affective response.

General linear model analysis indicated that alcohol SRD magnitude increased monotonically as threat uncertainty increased. Alcohol SRD was significantly greater during 20% and 60% shock threat relative to 100% shock threat. Alcohol also significantly reduced startle potentiation during distal threat in shock-free ITIs. Alcohol SRD magnitude during distal/uncertain threat was meaningfully moderated by individual differences in negative affectivity and weekly alcohol consumption. This work advances understanding of which properties of uncertainty are relevant to anxiety and the anxiolytic effects of alcohol.

### Emotions and individual differences shape human foraging under threat [^112VFWUu]. Nature (2025). High credibility.

To survive in natural environments, animals must balance their time between pursuing essential rewards, such as food, while being vigilant for potential threats, such as predators. Humans also rely on this type of decision-making in contemporary life; for example, care must be taken to avoid cars when entering the supermarket to buy food. Examining how people partition their time and switch flexibly between foraging and vigilance may help us understand not only a fundamental decision-making process that is ubiquitous across species but also how it is shaped by individual human traits and emotions.

The study of cognitive mechanisms underlying reward- and threat-oriented behavior has been advanced by paradigms in which single-event decisions are presented to participants at discrete intervals. Recently, a new framework, computational ethology, has emerged for studying and analyzing natural, everyday decision-making with ecological tasks. One key paradigm is the ecological foraging task. Previous studies have described cognitive and neural mechanisms associated with foraging in environments with fluctuating rewards. However, it is not well understood how decision-makers manage foraging in the context of predatory threat. Risk of predation is a constraint on animal foraging behavior, and survival requires foraging strategically to evade threat. Animal, human, and modeling studies have modeled the predatory risk versus foraging trade-off and characterized the effects of environmental conditions on evasive behavior and value-based decision-making.

### Unveiling the threat of Disease X: Preparing for the next global pandemic [^116X8Cuf]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

The term "Disease X", first introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, symbolizes the threat of an unknown pathogen capable of causing a global pandemic. Classified as a "priority pathogen", Disease X stands alongside well-known threats like SARS, Ebola, and ZIKV due to its potential for widespread outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 is considered the first "Disease X" to fulfill this prediction, demonstrating the devastating impact such pathogens can have. A future pathogen X could pose an even greater threat, with catastrophic consequences. This paper examines the potential origins of such pathogens, drawing lessons from outbreaks like SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2. It also highlights strategic approaches to detect, prevent, and respond effectively to mitigate the risk of future pandemics.

### Self-reported anticipated harm from drinking water across 141 countries [^112N5iDL]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Experienced and anticipated harm

Self-reported experienced harm was assessed by asking participants whether they had experienced or personally knew someone who "experienced serious harm from drinking water in the past two years" (dichotomous: yes or no). Self-reported anticipated harm was assessed with a question that asked participants how likely it was that they would experience "serious harm in the next two years" from their drinking water. Response options were "not at all likely", "somewhat likely", and "very likely". We created a binary variable of anticipated drinking water harm by combining "somewhat likely" and "very likely" because few individuals affirmed "very likely" in some countries (less than 5% in 21 countries). Further, collapsing categories can improve cross-country comparability given known cultural variations in the affirmation of extreme categories (e.g. "very likely") for questions with Likert-type response formats.

The term "serious harm" was kept intentionally broad to account for the diverse ways by which suboptimal drinking water can manifest and in turn differentially impact well-being. Subjective interpretation of "serious harm" is central to this analysis given that idiosyncratic perceptions of risk ultimately influence behavior. The phrase was not identified as being poorly or even differentially understood in cognitive interviews or the pilot tests conducted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.

Perceived anticipated harm from drinking water in the next two years was selected as the outcome of interest given…

### The role of threat-expectancy in acute pain: Effects on attentional bias, coping strategy effectiveness and response to pain [^114Kxv9g]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were threefold: firstly, to investigate the effect of increasing threat-expectancy on attentional biases towards pain-related words; secondly, to determine the interaction between threat-expectancy and the effectiveness of two coping strategies on pain threshold and tolerance; thirdly, to examine the relationship between fear of pain and the experimental manipulations.

One hundred undergraduate psychology students were randomly assigned to receive either threat-increasing or reassuring information about the cold pressor task. After reading the information, all participants completed the dot-probe task for four categories of pain-related words. Following the dot-probe task, participants were randomly allocated to one of two coping strategy conditions, focusing either on the affective or sensory aspects of pain. Participants then completed the cold pressor task while engaging in the relevant coping strategy.

There was a significant effect of threat on bias towards affective versus sensory pain words. Participants in the threat condition showed a stronger bias towards affective pain words, whereas the no-threat condition displayed a stronger bias towards sensory pain words. Significant interaction effects were observed between threat and coping strategy for threshold and tolerance. These results indicated that focusing on sensory pain sensations was helpful in the absence of threat; however, in the presence of threat, it was relatively unhelpful compared to focusing on the affective components of pain.

The present results provide support for the fear-avoidance model, suggesting differential effects of threat-expectancy on attentional bias and coping strategies.

### Screening for interpersonal violence: Missed opportunities and potential harms [^114hHjEN]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Screening for interpersonal violence is utilized in healthcare settings to identify patients experiencing violence. However, using unvalidated screening tools may lead to the misclassification of patients' experiences with violence. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation adapted a previously validated intimate partner violence screening tool for use in assessing interpersonal violence and retained the tool's original scoring rubric, despite the new tool's broader scope. This study evaluates the scoring system for detecting safety concerns.

- **Methods**: This study was a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of adult patients and caregivers of pediatric patients at seven primary care clinics and four emergency departments during 2018–2019. Surveys included the adapted 4-item Hurt, Insult, Threat, Scream (HITS) tool, with questions scored by frequency on a Likert scale (1 = never; 5 = frequently). Scores of 11–20 are considered positive for safety concerns. Two-sided Fisher's exact tests were used for descriptive analyses. Data analyses occurred in 2019–2020.

- **Results**: Of 1,014 participants, 66 (6.5%) reported any frequency of physical violence. Of these, 54 (81.8%) did not reach the threshold score of 11. Of the 1,014 participants, 93 (9.2%) reported any frequency of physical violence or being threatened with harm; 76 of the 93 participants (81.7%) scored below the threshold. Consequently, 80% of participants reporting physical violence did not screen positive for potential safety concerns. The scoring criteria did not reliably identify participants.

### Fears of compassion magnify the harmful effects of threat of COVID-19 on mental health and social safeness across 21 countries [^1129ViLX]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a massive global health crisis with damaging consequences to mental health and social relationships. Exploring factors that may heighten or buffer the risk of mental health problems in this context is thus critical. While compassion may be a protective factor, in contrast, fears of compassion increase vulnerability to psychosocial distress and may amplify the impact of the pandemic on mental health. This study explores the magnifying effects of fears of compassion on the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness.

- **Methods**: Adult participants from the general population (N = 4057) were recruited across 21 countries worldwide and completed self-report measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, fears of compassion (for self, from others, for others), depression, anxiety, stress, and social safeness.

- **Results**: Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased depression, anxiety, and stress. The three flows of fears of compassion predicted higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and lower social safeness. All fears of compassion moderated (heightened) the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Only fears of compassion from others moderated the effects of the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 on social safeness. These effects were consistent across all countries.

- **Conclusions**: Fears of compassion have a universal magnifying effect on the damaging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and social safeness. Compassion-focused interventions and communication strategies are essential in mitigating these impacts.

### Beyond the unknown: A broad framing for preparedness for emerging infectious threats [^115zhyup]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

There have been multiple instances of novel pathogen emergence that have affected the health and security of the global community. To highlight that these novel pathogens presented a clear danger to public health, the WHO included "Disease X" on their list of priority pathogens in 2018. Indeed, since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, Disease X has been pointed to as the looming threat of "the next big thing". However, developing surveillance and preparedness plans with Disease X as the linchpin is too narrow and ignores a large swath of potential threats from already identified, often neglected diseases.

We propose instead the idea of "Disease" as a preferred call to arms with which to prioritize research and programmatic development. The common mathematical notation represents the knowledge that outbreaks are a function of many variables that define the transmission trajectory of that pathogen. Disease exploits commonalities across pathogen groupings while recognizing that emergences and outbreaks are fluid and that responses need to be agile and progressively tailored to specific pathogens with cultural and regional context.

Adoption of this mindset across sectors, including biotechnology, disaster management, and epidemiology, will allow us to develop more efficient and effective responses to address the next major infectious threat.

### Perceived threat mediates the relationship between psychosis proneness and aggressive behavior [^114enU7J]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

Psychotic symptoms are associated with aggressive tendencies, but this relationship is both complex and imperfect. In contrast to psychotic disorders, little is known about aggressive behavior and sub-clinical psychotic symptoms, such as "psychosis proneness", which are relatively common in the general population. Threat/control-override (TCO) is the propensity to overestimate the likelihood that an outside agent will (1) inflict harm (threat) or (2) control one's behaviors (control-override). This has been associated with aggression in both psychiatric and community samples. The purpose of this study was to determine if psychosis proneness is related to aggression, and if one or both aspects of TCO mediate this relationship.

We hypothesized that the propensity to overestimate threat would mediate this relationship, but control-override would not. Sixty men and sixty women (mean age = 20.00 years, SD = 3.00) with no history of psychotic disorder completed measures assessing psychosis proneness, threat control/override, aggressive history, aggressive ideation, and aggressive behavior. Three structural equation models were tested:

- **Separate mediating variables**: Threat and control-override modeled as separate mediating variables.
- **Unitary mediating latent construct**: TCO as a unitary mediating latent construct.
- **Psychosis proneness latent variable**: TCO considered as part of a psychosis proneness latent variable.

Results indicated that psychosis proneness is positively related to aggression. The best model fit was obtained when threat and control-override were modeled as separate variables, with mediation through threat alone. The utility of TCO for explaining this relationship was confirmed.

### Self-reported anticipated harm from drinking water across 141 countries [^113tDK9A]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Gallup implemented numerous quality assurance strategies to measure perceived risks and related constructs in the most reliable, valid, and equivalent way. First, cognitive interviews and pilot tests were used to ensure that survey topics and wording made sense to and were understood equivalently among target participants. Second, consistency across languages was achieved through one of two translation strategies: two independent translations were harmonized by a third party, or the document was translated by one contractor, back-translated by another, and then edited by a third. Third, each survey included a definition of risk that was read aloud to participants for shared understanding: "Risk refers to something that may be dangerous or could cause harm or the loss of something. Risk could also result in a reward or something good". Fourth, Gallup used best data collection practices, including the development of standardized survey guides and multi-day training for interviewers, to ensure high implementation fidelity and comparability across applications. Fifth, to ensure that responses were reliably recorded, at least 30% of surveys conducted face-to-face (through accompanied interviews or re-contacts) and 15% of those conducted via telephone (by listening to live or recorded interviews) were assessed for accuracy. Sixth, to reduce the potential for psychological priming, individuals were first asked to report how worried they were about experiencing harm from each risk, then rated how likely they would experience harm from each factor in the next two years.

### Disentangling intolerance of uncertainty and threat appraisal in everyday situations [^112QfPjW]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Intolerance of Uncertainty is a transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factor in a range of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. However, the mechanism of action in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders is poorly understood, with the relationship between the constructs of uncertainty and threat appraisal remaining unclear. Most research at the time of writing has investigated intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in situations that are explicitly or implicitly threatening (i.e. where they have a negative outcome), which makes it difficult to establish whether it is the uncertainty or the prospect of a negative outcome (or threat) that people find aversive.

If the construct of IU is about uncertainty (and not threat), it should also be operating in situations where there are no negative outcomes possible. Participants (N = 224) completed a battery of online measures in tasks designed to evaluate the level of situational uncertainty and the perception of threat level. These tasks required responses to scenarios which displayed or implied varying levels of estimated threat.

Regression analyses indicated that IU was related to perceiving threat and uncertainty in both negative and positive situations, with the greatest contribution from uncertainty within the situations. This supports the conceptualization of IU as a response to uncertainty that is largely independent of threat, although it may contribute to perceptions of threat.

### The source model of group threat: Responding to internal and external threats [^1152iy36]. The American Psychologist (2018). Low credibility.

We introduce a model of group threat that articulates the opposing effects of intergroup (between-groups) and intragroup (within-group) threat on identity processes and group relations. The source model of group threat argues that the perceived source of a threat is critical in predicting its consequences, such that perceptions of intergroup threat will strengthen (in)group identity processes and relations, whereas perceptions of intragroup threat have the potential to undermine the same.

In addition to reviewing the extensive literature on intergroup threat and a smaller body of unsynthesized work on intragroup threat, we discuss how these processes are captured in representations of monsters (aliens, vampires, and zombies) in popular media and how these ideas can inform the interpretation of political debates, such as those around homegrown terrorism. This model provides a novel summary of the core effects of intergroup and intragroup threat, generating testable hypotheses about the psychological effects of different types of threat.

Applying this model will help to make sense of seemingly contradictory findings in the literature, illustrating how appraisal of a threat as originating from an intergroup or intragroup source has the capacity to change the group-based effects of that threat.

### Neurophysiology of threat processing bias in combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder [^116ksDPK]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Our results add additional support for cognitive models that posit facilitated or exaggerated activation of the threat network in individuals with PTSD. However, the mechanisms underlying this bias to threatening cues are not well understood. Recent studies have attempted to disentangle the mechanisms contributing to this generalized threat interference by merging behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging techniques. Fani, Tone, et al. (2012) measured physiological responses during a fear-startle paradigm and assessed threat bias using emotional faces. They found that participants with PTSD who exhibited a threat bias also showed an exaggerated startle response. When a similar task was implemented while acquiring functional neuroimaging, the threat bias found for the PTSD patients correlated with activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate.

In our study, there was reduced fronto-cortical theta activity, suggesting a reduced cortical capacity to regulate the threat network. This reduced capacity consequently allows the threatening cues to impede task-related activity and delay response time. This interpretation follows neurocircuitry models of PTSD; however, further study is needed to better understand the precise mechanisms involved in the general threat processing bias found in veterans with PTSD.

### Communicating about the risks of terrorism (or anything else) [^112u7Rvu]. The American Psychologist (2011). Low credibility.

Communication is essential to preventing terrorists from achieving their objectives. Effective communication can reduce terrorists' chances of mounting successful operations, creating threats that disrupt everyday life, and undermining the legitimacy of the societies that they attack. Psychological research plays essential roles in that communication, identifying the public's information needs, designing responsive communications, and evaluating their success. Fulfilling those roles requires policies that treat two-way communication with the public as central to ensuring that a society is strengthened, rather than weakened, by its struggle with terror. There are scientific, organizational, and political barriers to achieving those goals. Psychological research can help to overcome them and advance its science in the process.

### Medical mitigation model: Quantifying the benefits of the public health response to a chemical terrorism attack [^113vBnGu]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

The Chemical Terrorism Risk Assessment (CTRA) and Chemical Infrastructure Risk Assessment (CIRA) are programs that estimate the risk of chemical terrorism attacks to help inform and improve the U.S. defense posture against such events. One aspect of these programs is the development and advancement of a Medical Mitigation Model — a mathematical model that simulates the medical response to a chemical terrorism attack and estimates the resulting number of saved or benefited victims.

At the foundation of the CTRA/CIRA Medical Mitigation Model is the concept of stock-and-flow modeling. "Stocks" are states that individuals progress through during the event, while "flows" permit and govern movement from one stock to another. Using this approach, the model is able to simulate and track individual victims as they progress from exposure to an end state.

Some considerations in the model include chemical used, type of attack, route and severity of exposure, response-related delays, detailed treatment regimens with efficacy defined as a function of time, medical system capacity, the influx of worried well individuals, and medical countermeasure availability. As will be demonstrated, the output of the CTRA/CIRA Medical Mitigation Model makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of the existing public health response system and develop and examine potential improvement strategies. Such a modeling and analysis capability can be used to inform first-responder actions/training, guide policy decisions, justify resource allocation, and direct knowledge-gap studies.

### Fear and anxiety in the face of COVID-19: Negative dispositions towards risk and uncertainty as vulnerability factors [^112CaC5L]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to identify factors that make people particularly vulnerable to developing mental health issues to provide case-specific treatments. In this article, we examine the roles of two psychological constructs — originally put forth in the behavioral decision sciences — in predicting interindividual differences in fear responses: general risk aversion (GRA) and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). We first provide a review of these constructs and illustrate why they may play important roles in shaping anxiety-related disorders. Thereafter, we present an empirical study that collected survey data from 550 U.S. residents, comprising self-assessments of dispositions towards risk and uncertainty, anxiety and depression levels, as well as demographic variables, to thus test the extent to which these psychological constructs are predictive of strong fear responses related to COVID-19 (i.e. mortal fear, racing heart).

The results from Bayesian multi-model inference analyses showed that GRA and IU were more powerful predictors of fear responses than demographic variables. Moreover, the predictive power of these constructs was independent of general anxiety and depression levels. Subsequent mediation analyses showed that the effects of GRA and IU were both direct and indirect via anxiety. We conclude by discussing possible treatment options but also highlight that future research needs to further examine causal pathways and conceptual overlaps.

### Emotions and individual differences shape human foraging under threat [^111Xtcfv]. Nature (2025). Low credibility.

A common behavior in natural environments is foraging for rewards. However, this often occurs in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as with other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behavior and threat-motivated checking behavior.

To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed an ecologically inspired task and examined both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviors) in two large internet samples (n = 374 and n = 702) in a cross-sectional design.

For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behavior, such as increasing foraging and hiding. Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy-anhedonia and anxiety-compulsive checking), reliably mapped onto unique behaviors. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender (women checked excessively) and specific anxiety-related traits, such as somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking). While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking.

In summary, we provide a multifaceted paradigm for the assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task that is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool for…

### The need for adaptability in detection, characterization, and attribution of biosecurity threats [^1125JkdC]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Three major real-world challenges loom in the future of biosecurity that demand protocols be adaptable enough to avert disaster. First, biosecurity awareness has increased given recent events, but this also biases risk assessment towards human pathogens. An engineered pandemic is the most immediate threat given bioengineering capabilities. However, dangerous applications of genetic engineering in the future might include other forms of attack, such as an invasive and pesticide-resistant weed that aggressively populates and drains nutrients from agricultural fields. Therefore, methods should ideally be quickly translatable across different species and types of organisms.

Second, malicious actors can aim to specifically break biosecurity measures. The characterization problem already faces the risk of actors sneaking dangerous sequences past the primary screening focus, leading to developments like RAT screening. Anticipating biosecurity-conscious attacks and devising appropriate backup solutions to them is critical to staying ahead of potential threats. This further demands that biosecurity methods be continuously extendable.

Finally, the standardization of tougher biosecurity mechanisms may inconvenience customers and drive them towards less restrictive competitors, including foreign exporters in the absence of international conventions. This scenario has been observed in previous regulatory efforts, such as environmental regulations. To achieve compromises that satisfy economic and political spheres, biosecurity methods must again be appropriately adaptable.

### Threat-induced anxiety and selfishness in resource sharing: Behavioral and neural evidence [^117WsVm7]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Low credibility.

Generally, human beings are willing to share resources with others. But when facing uncertain threats, would an individual's anxiety response affect their sharing behavior? Anxiety is future-oriented because it is associated with the belief that one is facing a potential threat. Here, we use the term "threat" to describe physical stimuli and environments that are potentially harmful or dangerous to individuals, which may have evolutionary significance. Anxiety serves an adaptive function, as it has evolved to deal with threats for the goal of survival and reproduction. When detecting a signal of threat to one's physical safety or health, anxious individuals are prone to show hypervigilance, such as attentional bias, and behavioral avoidance to that signal. These behavioral manifestations, which have been well-researched, should be regarded as defensive reactions for individuals to locate and avoid the source of danger. In daily life, anxiety-provoking threats may not be solved by simply taking an avoidance strategy; in these situations, like social dilemmas, the behavioral consequence of anxiety remains largely unclear.

### Intergenerational transmission of anxious information processing biases: An updated conceptual model [^116xdLaq]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2022). Low credibility.

Fliek and colleagues investigated the cross-sectional links between child cognitive biases (i.e. threat interpretation and confirmation), anxiety, and fear-enhancing parenting behaviors of mothers and/or fathers in a community sample of 258 children aged 7 to 12 years. The researchers designed a questionnaire to measure fear-enhancing parenting behaviors, including modeling and threat information transmission, based on child and parent reports. Child threat interpretations were assessed with the ambiguous stories task, while child confirmation bias was gauged using an information search task where children could choose between a positive or negative question to gain information about hypothetical ambiguous situations.

Children with higher levels of anxiety demonstrated stronger threat interpretations and a more negative confirmation bias, reporting that their parents exhibited higher levels of fear-enhancing parenting behavior. Moreover, the association between parental threat information and child anxiety was fully mediated by child cognitive bias, specifically interpretation and confirmation bias. Notably, child interpretation (but not confirmation bias) partially mediated the relationship between modeling and child anxiety. These findings provide evidence of a direct link between fear-enhancing parental behaviors and child cognition at the levels of interpretation and confirmation biases, as well as a mediating role of child cognitions in the association between parental fear-enhancing behaviors and child anxiety.

### Brainstem networks construct threat probability and prediction error from neuronal building blocks [^1131nho9]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Sustained threat probability signaling depended more on the cue subnetwork, while sustained fear behavior signaling depended more on the cue supranetwork (Fig. 3c, d). Lesioning the subnetwork left sustained behavior signaling intact (Fig. 3c, PC1, middle) but reduced threat probability signaling, most apparent at cue onset (Fig. 3c, PC2, bottom). By contrast, lesioning the supranetwork diminished sustained behavior signaling (Fig. 3d, PC1, middle) and shifted sustained threat probability signaling to dynamic, probability-to-behavior signaling (Fig. 3d, PC2, bottom).

Neurons contributing to the subnetwork and supranetwork were distributed throughout the brainstem. Subtle anatomical biases were only apparent for the cue subnetwork (Fig. 3e), with the deep layer of the superior colliculus and the lateral subdivision of the periaqueductal gray (also sources of hub neurons) contributing more to the cue subnetwork. These findings reveal the brainstem is composed of diverse neuronal building blocks whose specific cue firing patterns (Fig. 2a) carry unique temporal information about threat probability and fear behavior (Fig. 3a). A sustained fear behavior signal is observed across all brainstem neurons (Fig. 3c, middle), while a sustained threat probability signal (Fig. 3d, bottom) is constructed by functional subnetwork.

### Associations among exaggerated threat perceptions, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal behaviors in U.S. firearm owners [^112YN66T]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Low credibility.

Firearm availability has traditionally been conceptualized as an environmental risk factor for suicide mortality. Firearm acquisition for the primary purpose of self-protection (i.e. protective gun ownership) is often motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies — a central component of anticipatory anxiety — but firearm acquisition may paradoxically reinforce or exacerbate threat expectancies and contribute to behavioral disinhibition. Firearm ownership may therefore confer increased risk for suicide mortality through biobehavioral mechanisms.

The present study conducted an initial test of this hypothesis by examining associations among firearm ownership, intentions to acquire additional firearms, threat expectancies, and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors using data collected from a national sample of 6,200 U.S. adults. Results indicated that threat expectancies and rates of suicide-related behaviors were significantly elevated among protective gun owners and participants who intended to acquire a firearm within the next year, as compared to non-gun owners and non-protective gun owners. Threat expectancies were associated with a significantly increased risk for past-month suicide-related behavior. Results suggest that threat expectancies in particular, and anticipatory anxiety more generally, may be biobehavioral processes associated with the correlation of firearm ownership and increased suicide risk.

### Association of social and life threats with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder [^111jAT2c]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This study examined psychological reactions to perceived threats, viewed within the context of human evolutionary history. We compared the relative weight of perceived threat to life or physical harm versus social threat, i.e. humiliation and/or rejection, in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD).

- **Methods**: Participants were 50 women with clinically significant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and 59 women with little or no PTSS (control group), selected from a large, population-based cohort of women in Iceland, the SAGA Cohort. Participants rated (1) life threat, (2) physical threat, (3) humiliation, and (4) rejection during their worst trauma or stressor.

- **Results**: Rates of both life and social threats were higher in the PTSS than control group. Among the PTSS participants, 4% (n = 2) reported primarily life threats (vs. 6.8%, n = 4 in controls), 36% (n = 18) reported primarily social threats (vs. 33.9%, n = 20 in controls), and 60% (n = 30) reported both types of threats (vs. 15.3%, n = 9 in controls). Those who reported dual life and social threats exhibited elevated PTSS compared to those who experienced a single type of threat. The highest levels of life or physical threat, along with humiliation, predicted PTSS severity, but rejection did not. Nearly half of the PTSS group (approximately 50%, n = 25) also met criteria for SAD compared to roughly 14% (n = 8) in the control group, and humiliation predicted SAD symptom severity. Notably, 18% of the PTSS group (n = 9) linked the onset of their SAD and subsequent development to these perceived humiliations and social threats.

### The psychology of ongoing threat: Relative risk appraisal, the September 11 attacks, and terrorism-related fears [^113g7NXV]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

There are now replicated findings that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms related to the September 11, 2001, attacks occurred in large numbers of persons who did not fit the traditional definition of exposure to a traumatic event. These data are not explained by traditional epidemiologic "bull's eye" disaster models, which assume the psychological effects are narrowly, geographically circumscribed, or by existing models of PTSD onset.

In this article, the authors develop a researchable model to explain these and other terrorism-related phenomena by synthesizing research and concepts from the cognitive science, risk appraisal, traumatic stress, and anxiety disorders literatures. They propose the new term relative risk appraisal to capture the psychological function that is the missing link between the event and subjective response in these and other terrorism-related studies at the time of writing. Relative risk appraisal highlights the core notion from cognitive science that human perception is an active, multidimensional process, such that, for unpredictable societal threats, proximity to the event is only one of several factors that influence behavioral responses. Addressing distortions in relative risk appraisal effectively could reduce individual and societal vulnerability to a wide range of adverse economic and ethnopolitical consequences to terrorist attacks. The authors present ways in which these concepts and related techniques can be helpful in treating persons with September 11- or terrorism-related distress or psychopathology.

### Negative interpretations of distress-related information: A novel assessment tool for distress tolerance [^116r8ir4]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Distress tolerance (DT), defined as the perceived and/or actual behavioral capacity to tolerate negative emotional states, is considered an important risk factor for various externalizing and internalizing disorders. Despite the importance of DT in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, few reliable and valid indicators of DT have been developed. One potentially useful way to assess DT is through interpretation bias (IB) paradigms.

The study sought to examine the convergent validity, reliability, and clinical utility of a DT-focused IB paradigm by directly measuring an individual's interpretations of distressing information. Participants completed a DT-IB task and self-report questionnaires. Results found an association between DTS self-report and an exaggerated DT-IB. Reliability analyses found the word pairings in our DT-IB task to display good internal consistency. In addition, an exaggerated DT-IB was associated with diagnostic status after covarying for negative affect and self-report DTS, and DT-IB was associated with increased levels of negative affect above and beyond self-report DTS.

This study is the first to identify specific interpretation biases for distress-related information. Given the transdiagnostic nature of DT and the efficacy and accessibility associated with CBM-I protocols for related constructs, the present findings add considerably to a growing body of literature.

### Brainstem networks construct threat probability and prediction error from neuronal building blocks [^11721e8E]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Faced with a potential threat, we must estimate its probability, determine an appropriate response, and — should we come away intact — adjust our estimates for future encounters. Historical descriptions of the brain's threat circuitry emphasize a division of labor in which forebrain regions estimate threat probability, while the brainstem elicits behavior. However, behavior signaling is not observed in expected brainstem neuronal populations, such as the periaqueductal gray, which instead signals threat probability. Unexpectedly, periaqueductal behavior signaling is observed in an unexpected, cue-inhibited population.

Furthermore, the brainstem periaqueductal gray is a source of prediction error, a learning signal to adjust threat estimates. These findings necessitate a more complex role for the brainstem in threat estimation. However, evidence of widespread brainstem threat probability signaling remains elusive, and more complete descriptions of brainstem behavior and prediction error signaling are needed. Recording a 21-region axis with Neuropixels during probabilistic fear discrimination, we report the brainstem constructs signals for threat probability, fear behavior, and prediction error from neuronal "building blocks" organized into functional networks. Remapping of neuronal function between cue and outcome periods revealed distinct brainstem network organization for threat probability, fear behavior, and prediction error signaling.

### Quantifying the impact of uncertainty on threat management for biodiversity [^113My1Kn]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

For the questions about the persistence of the species group with and without management, we used existing information to provide initial values. Species were assigned a preliminary probability of persistence under no management using expert-derived estimates from the SoS database. Persistence if the KTP is removed was estimated using the estimates of relative threat importance contained in an expert-derived OEH dataset, which scores threats to each species as either high, medium, or low. Where a threat was not included in the dataset, it was given a medium score. These scores were weighted using the threat impact scores contained in the IUCN Threat Classification Scheme (V3.2).

The weighted scores were used to calculate the relative threat importance by dividing the weight of the threat by the sum of threat weights across all threats affecting the species. The expected persistence if the threat was removed was computed using the formula: Pr(threat managed) = Pr(unmanaged) + (0.95 − Pr(unmanaged)) × relative importance of threat. This approach assumes that if all threats were removed, then persistence would be 95%, consistent with the SoS project used to calculate persistence with no management. In making this estimate, we have assumed that management completely removes the threat and made the simplifying assumption of ignoring the influence of interactions between threats. We made this assumption because it was not feasible for experts to parameterize joint distributions for all combinations of threat interactions during an elicitation.

### Unconditioned stimulus devaluation decreases the generalization of costly safety behaviors [^112a64Bb]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Safety behaviors are often maladaptive in clinical anxiety as they typically persist without realistic threat and cause various impairments. In the laboratory, safety behaviors are modeled by responses to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that reduce the occurrence of an expected aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). Preliminary evidence suggests that US devaluation, a procedure that decreases US aversiveness, devalues the threat value of the CS and thus diminishes safety behaviors to the CS.

This study (n = 78) aimed to extend this finding and examined whether US-devaluation can reduce the generalization of safety behaviors to various stimuli. After acquiring safety behaviors to CSs of different categories, the US predicted by one CS category was devalued. In test, participants showed a selective reduction in safety behaviors to novel stimuli of the devalued CS category, reflecting a decrease in generalization of safety behaviors. Trait anxiety was associated with persistent generalized safety behaviors to novel stimuli of the devalued category. We discuss how US devaluation may improve treatment outcomes but also the challenges of clinical translation.

### Ranking threats to biodiversity and why it doesn't matter [^115t5jtB]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

By over-synthesizing the relative prevalence of threats across juxtaposed contexts, taxa, times, and metrics, these macroecological analyses confuse messages to the public, the media, and policy makers regarding where and when biodiversity losses occur and which factors are responsible. Instead, global assessments in conservation should offer synthetic views on how threats operate in combination to threaten biodiversity. New developments in databases and tools could provide advances in conservation evaluation. For instance, network analyses or cumulative-impact approaches can consider multiple threats simultaneously. However, exposure to threats alone provides only partial information on conservation needs. New approaches assessing species' vulnerability to global changes by simultaneously considering exposure to the intensity of the threats, variable sensitivity, and different adaptive capacities are also a valuable paradigm shift.

The ultimate objective is to lessen the severity of the biodiversity crisis driven by the combination of major threats. Therefore, we might need to reconsider the actual usefulness of global threat ranks. Ranking the potential benefits of conservation actions would certainly have more impact than only ranking threats. Providing policy makers with a range of conservation scenarios, along with their predicted biodiversity outcomes that consider the multiple sources of stress, different metrics, and variation across taxa, could offer a more realistic description of the state of biodiversity and maximize conservation efforts.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy normalizes functional connectivity for social threat in psychosis [^114uvLa6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

There has been a growing interest in understanding the neural effects of psychological interventions to gain a better understanding of the maintaining mechanisms of disorders and to improve future therapies. There is now considerable evidence that interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy produce lasting neural activation changes in a range of disorders. However, few, at the time of writing, have examined changes in the widespread connections between distributed systems. This is surprising, given that cognitive behavioral therapy targets dysfunctional appraisals of distributed cognitive, affective, and physical inputs. Remediation of functional connectivity is likely to be of particular importance in psychosis, which has long been conceptualized as a disorder of network dysconnectivity. Yet, at the time of writing, none have examined changes in functional connectivity following psychological therapy in psychosis.

Psychological models of psychosis emphasize a hyper-vigilance for threat cues as well as a difficulty in disengaging threat-related affective content from conscious awareness. Neurobiological accounts are in accordance with this view, and there is convincing evidence of a bias to perceive facial expressions as threatening. This social threat network includes limbic (amygdala, putamen, thalamus), visual (fusiform gyrus), and prefrontal regions, in addition to the insula. In healthy participants, cognitive reappraisal strategies have been shown to modulate activity in this network through top-down connections with frontal areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

### The need for adaptability in detection, characterization, and attribution of biosecurity threats [^112pD81j]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Determining the purpose or function of engineered DNA detected in the environment, or any DNA being ordered for synthesis, is necessary to perform an accurate threat assessment. DNA screening methods focus on identifying hazardous or pathogenic sequences, the most immediate and dangerous threats. However, some engineered DNA may not immediately appear to encode any destructive or adversarial function. Characterization also involves a more advanced understanding of the genetic context in which the DNA operates.

These subtler aspects of characterization are crucial when considering biological threats, such as a pathogen with an asymptomatic phase, that could propagate without causing significant immediate impact. The simplest way to understand any whole is to understand each of its parts; this logic applies to engineered biology. Identifying specific genetic parts in an engineered sequence is an essential starting point. This aspect of characterization is evident in DNA screening; sequences submitted for synthesis must be rigorously examined to determine if they encode anything particularly dangerous.

Detecting the parts used in the construction of engineered DNA can critically highlight dangerous functions. This can be accomplished in several ways, the most basic being to run a full-scale best match search using algorithms such as BLAST against a list of pathogen genomes. However, it is important to have more precise and extendable methods, which can identify specific genetic parts associated with virulence.

### Impulsivity as a multifactorial construct and its relationship to PTSD severity and threat sensitivity [^112dXZbh]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Changes to the DSM-5's conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) highlight the importance of impulsivity within the context of PTSD-related arousal dysregulation. While the relationship between PTSD and threat sensitivity is well defined, the relationship of these factors to impulsivity remains understudied. We examined the relationship between PTSD symptom severity, threat sensitivity, and impulsivity. A total of 124 participants completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-C) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11th edition (BIS-11). BIS-11 items were separated to define cognitive and behavioral impulsivity subdomains.

A trauma-exposed subsample of 39 participants was also exposed to no, ambiguous, and high threat conditions in a threat-enhanced acoustic startle paradigm, with psychophysiological response as the outcome variable. PTSD severity was significantly associated with greater overall impulsivity and behavioral impulsivity. Greater overall impulsivity and both cognitive and behavioral impulsivity subdomains were significantly associated with psychophysiological magnitudes across threat conditions in the traumatized subsample. Our results suggest that PTSD severity may be linked to behavioral impulsivity and that both cognitive and behavioral impulsivity are associated with threat sensitivity and hyperarousal. Assessing impulsivity within the context of PTSD, particularly in terms of its cognitive and behavioral subdomains, may provide important clinically relevant information.

### Beyond the unknown: A broad framing for preparedness for emerging infectious threats [^114M2kFX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

There have been multiple instances of novel pathogen emergence that have affected the health and security of the global community. To highlight that these novel pathogens presented a clear danger to public health, the WHO included "Disease X" on their list of priority pathogens in 2018. Indeed, since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, Disease X has been pointed to as the looming threat of "the next big thing". However, developing surveillance and preparedness plans with Disease X as the linchpin is too narrow and ignores a large swath of potential threats from already identified, often neglected diseases.

We propose instead the idea of "Disease f(x)" as a preferred call to arms with which to prioritize research and programmatic development. The common mathematical notation f(x) represents the knowledge that outbreaks are a function of many variables that define the transmission trajectory of that pathogen. Disease f(x) exploits commonalities across pathogen groupings while recognizing that emergences and outbreaks are fluid and that responses need to be agile and progressively tailored to specific pathogens with cultural and regional context.

Adoption of this mindset across sectors, including biotechnology, disaster management, and epidemiology, will allow us to develop more efficient and effective responses to address the next major infectious threat.

### Public health assessment of potential biological terrorism agents [^115Gsy1u]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

As part of a Congressional initiative begun in 1999 to upgrade national public health capabilities for response to acts of biological terrorism, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was designated the lead agency for overall public health planning. A Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Office has been formed to help target several areas for initial preparedness activities, including planning, improved surveillance and epidemiologic capabilities, rapid laboratory diagnostics, enhanced communications, and medical therapeutics stockpiling. To focus these preparedness efforts, however, the biological agents towards which the efforts should be targeted had to first be formally identified and placed in priority order. Many biological agents can cause illness in humans, but not all are capable of affecting public health and medical infrastructures on a large scale.

The military has formally assessed multiple agents for their strategic usefulness on the battlefield. In addition, the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, using an expert panel consensus-based process, has identified several biological agents as potential high-impact agents against civilian populations. To guide national public health bioterrorism preparedness and response efforts, a method was sought for assessing potential biological threat agents that would provide a reviewable, reproducible means for standardized evaluations of these threats.

In June 1999, a meeting of national experts was convened to:

- **Review potential general criteria**: for selecting the biological agents that pose the greatest threat.

### Emotions and individual differences shape human foraging under threat [^112mWBYH]. Nature (2025). High credibility.

A common behavior in natural environments is foraging for rewards, often in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as for other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behavior and threat-motivated checking behavior. To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed an ecologically inspired task and examined both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviors) in two large internet samples (n = 374 and n = 702) in a cross-sectional design.

For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behavior, increasing foraging, and hiding. Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy–anhedonia and anxiety–compulsive checking), reliably mapped onto unique behaviors. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender, as women checked excessively, and specific anxiety-related traits, such as somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking).

While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking. In summary, we provide a multifaceted paradigm for assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task that is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool.

### Distributed neural representations of conditioned threat in the human brain [^117Jgfr2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In addition to the 'threat circuit', our data highlight the value of other nodes that are also important in conditioned threat processing. Importantly, numerically higher decoding performances were obtained when including neural patterns from systems beyond the 'threat circuit'. When we encounter a threat, we need to process all sensory information, pay attention to our surroundings, retrieve prior memories related to the encounter of this or similar threats, and decide how to respond. Indeed, our results suggest engagement of multiple sensory and cognitive systems during the encounter of threat and safety cues, which is likely needed for processing these complex representations. Our results provide compelling empirical evidence for conceptual frameworks that threat processing involves multiple processes encompassing multiple brain circuits.

We identified 14 representative regions spanning the primary sensory and motor cortex, frontal-parietal cortex, and cerebellum that significantly contributed to the decoding models across threat conditioning and extinction learning phases. The high decoding performances here suggest the important role of these regions in supporting implicit and explicit representations of threat and safety. While the OFC only significantly contributed to the early conditioning phase, we included it because it was reported to be involved in threat-related processing across studies. There might be other regions that are only transiently engaged at specific stages of conditioning and/or extinction (like the OFC here).

### Understanding clinicians' use of cues when assessing the future risk of violence: A clinical judgement analysis in the psychiatric setting [^111GApwx]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Research is sparse on how clinicians' judgment informs their violence risk assessments. Yet, determining preferences for which risk factors are used, and how they are weighted and combined, is important to understanding such assessments. This study investigated clinicians' use of static and dynamic cues when assessing risk in individual patients and for dynamic cues considered in the recent and distant past. Clinicians provided three violence risk assessments for 41 separate hypothetical cases of hospitalized patients, each defined by eight cues (e.g. psychopathy and past violence severity/frequency). A clinical judgement analysis, using regression analysis of judgements for multiple cases, created linear models reflecting the major influences on each individual clinician's judgement. Risk assessments could be successfully predicted by between one and four cues, and there was close agreement between different clinicians' models regarding which cues were relevant for a given assessment. However, which cues were used varied between assessments: history of recent violence predicted assessments of in-hospital risk, whereas violence in the distant past predicted the assessed risk in the community. Crucially, several factors included in actuarial/structured risk assessment tools had little influence on clinicians' assessments. Our findings point to the adaptivity in clinicians' violence risk assessments, with a preference for relying on information consistent with the setting for which the assessment applies. The implication is that clinicians are open to using different cues depending on the context of the assessment.

### Attention to threat in posttraumatic stress disorder as indexed by eye-tracking indices: A systematic review [^112XLQz6]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate threat-related attentional biases in the etiology and phenomenology of the disorder. However, extant attentional research using reaction time (RT)-based paradigms and measures has yielded mixed results. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged in recent years to overcome several inherent drawbacks of RT-based tasks, striving to better delineate attentional processes.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of experimental studies examining threat-related attention biases in PTSD, using eye-tracking methodology and group-comparison designs, was conducted conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected following a systematic search for publications between 1980 and December 2017 in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the National Center for PTSD Research's Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database. Additional records were identified by employing the Similar Articles feature in PubMed and the Cited Reference Search in ISI Web of Science. Reference sections of review articles, book chapters, and studies selected for inclusion were searched for further studies. Ongoing studies were also sought through Clinicaltrials.gov.

- **Results**: A total of 11 studies (n = 456 participants in total) were included in the final review. Results indicated little support for enhanced threat detection, hypervigilance, and attentional avoidance. However, consistent evidence emerged for sustained attention on threat (i.e. attention maintenance).

### A distributed fMRI-based signature for the subjective experience of fear [^116Wk99G]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Fear is probably the most studied emotion during the last decades, yet despite considerable advances in animal models and human neuroimaging research, vigorous debates on how to define and investigate fear and its facets continue. When we talk about fear in everyday life, we primarily refer to the subjective feeling of being afraid. However, in psychological and neuroscientific conceptualizations, fear also describes defensive behaviors such as freezing, and peripheral physiological changes that accompany such behaviors.

The neural basis of 'fear', or threat behaviors, has been extensively mapped in animal models using Pavlovian conditioning and predator exposure protocols. These models provide compelling evidence for a pivotal role of subcortical systems, particularly the central extended amygdala, as well as the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray (PAG), in mediating threat detection and defensive responses. However, the subjective emotional experience of fear remains ultimately inaccessible in animal models, and recent conceptual frameworks argue that the evolutionarily conserved defensive survival circuits that account for the behavioral and physiological responses to threats might be distinct from those underlying the subjective experience of fear. The differentiation between the defensive response and the subjective experience of fear has critical implications for translational research on pathological fear, given that animal models primarily evaluate novel treatments by means of effects on physiological and behavioral defensive threat reactions.

### Threats by artificial intelligence to human health and human existence [^114HguHj]. BMJ Global Health (2023). Low credibility.

Many of the threats described above arise from the deliberate, accidental, or careless misuse of AI by humans. Even the risk and threat posed by a form of AGI that exists and operates independently of human control is currently still in the hands of humans. However, there are differing opinions about the degree of risk posed by AI and about the relative trade-offs between risk and potential reward, and harms and benefits.

Nonetheless, with exponential growth in AI research and development, the window of opportunity to avoid serious and potentially existential harms is closing. The future outcomes of the development of AI and AGI will depend on policy decisions taken now and on the effectiveness of regulatory institutions designed to minimize risk and harm and maximize benefit. Crucially, preventing or minimizing the threats posed by AI will require international agreement and cooperation, as well as the avoidance of a mutually destructive AI "arms race". It will also require decision-making that is free of conflicts of interest and protected from the lobbying of powerful actors with a vested interest. Worryingly, large private corporations with vested financial interests and little in the way of democratic and public oversight are leading in the field of AGI research.

Different parts of the UN system are now engaged in a desperate effort to ensure that our international social, political, and legal institutions catch up with the rapid technological advancements being made with AI.

### Investigating the role of group-based morality in extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice [^115LbSqS]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

While Studies 2 and 3 are consistent with the moralized threat hypothesis, they both rely on observational designs and thus cannot directly address the question of whether perceptions of outgroup moral wrongdoing cause increases in the perceived justification of extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice (EBEPs) against the outgroup. We address this issue by directly manipulating participants' perceptions of a fictional social outgroup, 'Sandirians' (see Supplementary Information for the vignettes used).

To do so, we randomly assigned participants to one of two conditions — a 'high moral threat' condition and a 'low moral threat' condition — that manipulated the moral valence of a fictional outgroup. We focus on a fictional outgroup in order to limit the influence of participants' prior beliefs on their responses. As such, the goals of this study were to estimate the causal effect of an outgroup's ostensibly immoral behavior — the construct that we experimentally manipulate — on the degree to which EBEPs against the outgroup were seen as justified and, further, to investigate whether perceived moral wrongness (PMW) mediates this causal effect.

To test the hypothesis that PMW mediates the effect of outgroup moral behavior on EBEP justification, we first estimated a Bayesian linear regression (Model 1) in which z-scored PMW was regressed on experimental condition. Estimates from this model (see Table 15 in Supplementary Information for complete model estimates) show that participants in the high perceived moral threat condition reported substantially higher levels of PMW, b = 0.50.

### The three Rs of fear messaging in a global pandemic: Recommendations, ramifications and remediation [^113wDwY4]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2024). Low credibility.

We consider the UK Independent Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours' (SPI-B) support for fear messaging during the global COVID-19 pandemic, evaluate the consequences, and make recommendations for the future.

- **Analysis**: Using evidence from published documents, we show that SPI-B supported the use of fear messaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach is inconsistent with the extant psychological literature and contrary to the disaster planning literature. The recommendations regarding fear messaging may have had harmful ramifications and impacts, especially for young people.

- **Conclusion**: We recommend that a wider multidisciplinary expertise is employed to deal effectively, ethically, and holistically with future crises. Plans for future pandemics must include meaningful engagement with the public, particularly children and young people.

### Threats to kill: A follow-up study [^115SA1be]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Mental health clinicians are frequently asked to assess the risks presented by patients making threats to kill, but there are almost no data to guide such an evaluation.

- **Method**: This data linkage study examined serious violence following making threats to kill and the potential role of mental disorder. A total of 613 individuals convicted of threats to kill had their prior contact with public mental health services established at the time of the index offence. The group's subsequent criminal convictions were established 10 years later using the police database. Death from suicidal or homicidal violence was also established.

- **Results**: Within 10 years, 44% of threateners were convicted of further violent offending, including 19 (3%) homicides. Those with histories of psychiatric contact (40%) had a higher rate (58%) of subsequent violence. The highest risks were in substance misusers, mentally disordered, young, and those without prior criminal convictions. Homicidal violence was most frequent among threateners with a schizophrenic illness. Sixteen threateners (2.6%) killed themselves, and three were murdered.

- **Conclusions**: In contrast to the claims in the literature that threats are not predictive of subsequent violence, this study revealed high rates of assault and even homicide following threats to kill. The mentally disordered were over-represented among threat offenders and among those at high risk of subsequent violence. The mentally disordered threateners at highest risk of violence were young, substance abusing, but not necessarily with prior convictions.

### Threat credibility and weapons of mass destruction [^1118Nnbg]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

Individual or collective preparedness for an attack involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD) must be based on an analysis of the threat. In threat assessment, many factors must be taken into account, including the physical and psychological parameters of the attacker. Although the potential devastation caused by WMD is significant, there are many limitations to the effective use of such weapons. Casualty rates will likely be measured in the thousands rather than millions because of factors that will be discussed. It should be noted that the psychological ramifications, the permutations of which have not yet been defined, will be much longer lasting. In this paper, the author discusses these and other characteristics of the threat.

### An expanded conceptual framework for understanding irritability in childhood: The role of cognitive control processes [^114mzvh9]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2024). Low credibility.

Research on irritability has utilized a range of tasks to assess threat biases in youth. Biases in processing threat information have been further examined regarding neural processing changes in youth with heightened irritability, providing an index of how brain functioning under conditions of threat may impact behavior and cognitive processes. Although a number of studies have examined threat biases within irritable youth, these studies have varied widely in their approach to assessment. Specifically, studies include both community and clinical samples of irritability and have recruited based on diagnoses with irritability as a key symptom (i.e. DMDD, SMD) or as an associated feature (e.g. ADHD, anxiety) and have ranged in severity and age (i.e. infancy, middle childhood, adolescence).

Although a considerable number of studies have examined threat biases in youth with psychopathology, with irritability as a symptom or associated feature (e.g. ADHD, ODD), this review focuses on studies with direct measures of irritability or disorders with irritability as a key component (i.e. DMDD, SMD). Studies of threat biases among irritable youth compared to non-irritable youth suggest differences in the interpretation of threat, allocation of attention toward threat, interference of threat information, and sustained attention on threat information.

Within the context of the RDoC negative valence system, we draw upon the domains of acute threat (i.e. indexed via allocation of attention toward rewards and interference of threat information).
