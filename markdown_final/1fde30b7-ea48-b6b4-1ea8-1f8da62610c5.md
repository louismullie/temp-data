## Question

Differentiating status epilepticus from other seizures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate status epilepticus from other seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern operational definition of status epilepticus and its time thresholds. Then, I should verify the key clinical features that distinguish convulsive from non-convulsive forms. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including when to use EEG and what ancillary tests help. After that, I need to consider special populations and mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight pitfalls and controversies, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misapply thresholds. Status epilepticus is now defined operationally as continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity for at least 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without recovery to baseline between seizures, reflecting that most seizures end within 5 minutes and that neuronal injury risk rises with prolonged activity, which is why treatment should begin by 5 minutes rather than waiting for 30 minutes as in older definitions [^acb4668f] [^0888c6a0] [^8e94a723]. Hold on, I should verify the time points: the ILAE framework adds a second time point (t2) after which long-term consequences may occur, with t1 at 5 minutes for generalized convulsive status epilepticus and t2 around 30 minutes, acknowledging that these thresholds vary by seizure type and that evidence is stronger for convulsive forms than for non-convulsive forms [^26726783] [^51203748].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical phenotypes because misclassification leads to missed non-convulsive cases. Convulsive status epilepticus presents with generalized tonic-clonic movements, impaired consciousness, and often autonomic instability, whereas non-convulsive status epilepticus lacks overt convulsions and manifests with fluctuating consciousness, confusion, aphasia, subtle motor phenomena, or even behavioral changes, requiring EEG for confirmation and carrying substantial morbidity if unrecognized [^e5f88fdd] [^5f6cb660] [^9d22aedc]. I should double-check that NCSE often follows overt GCSE or occurs in critically ill patients with altered mental status, which is precisely where continuous EEG changes management by revealing ongoing electrographic seizures despite clinical quiescence [^e5f88fdd] [^5a45fd64].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and not jump to conclusions based on appearance alone. For convulsive presentations, clinical observation suffices to diagnose convulsive status epilepticus, but if the patient does not return to baseline within about 10–20 minutes, I need to suspect non-convulsive continuation and obtain EEG promptly, ideally continuous EEG, because routine EEG can miss ongoing seizures and cEEG increases detection several-fold in high-risk populations [^30fbdcd2] [^5a45fd64]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence: while cEEG detects more seizures and prompts more treatment changes, randomized data have not shown a mortality benefit versus repeated routine EEG, so resource availability and patient risk should guide modality selection in real-world care [^a921d6ca] [^659ce963].

> I will now examine ancillary tests that can support the diagnosis and help exclude mimics. Basic labs should include glucose, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, renal and hepatic function, and a toxicology screen, with targeted testing for suspected etiologies such as infection or autoimmune encephalitis, because identifying and treating the cause is a core principle of status epilepticus management and can alter prognosis [^0a42d752] [^20f454c1]. Let me consider prolactin cautiously: a serum prolactin drawn 10–20 minutes after a suspected generalized tonic-clonic or complex partial event can help distinguish epileptic from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, but it is not validated for status epilepticus or repetitive seizures and should not be overinterpreted in this context [^7ba85828]. Neuroimaging is not emergent in stable patients but should be obtained once seizures are controlled to evaluate for structural causes, particularly in first presentations or when the course is atypical [^a1a9a1b6].

> But wait, what if the patient is a neonate or a child; I need to ensure age-appropriate definitions and thresholds. In neonates, seizures are often electrographic only, and there is no universally accepted definition of neonatal status epilepticus, so many centers use a pragmatic threshold of continuous electrographic seizure activity for at least 30 minutes or recurrent seizures occupying more than 50% of a 1-hour epoch, with EEG mandatory for diagnosis and management [^174b0eeb] [^a5a56010]. In children, the operational definition aligns with adults at 5 minutes, and pediatric protocols emphasize rapid benzodiazepine administration and early escalation if seizures persist, given the high incidence and potential for morbidity in pediatric status epilepticus [^1599afd5] [^b549191b].

> I should confirm the differential and common mimics so I don't mislabel non-epileptic events. Prolonged psychogenic nonepileptic seizures can resemble convulsive status epilepticus but lack the typical evolution of tonic-clonic phases and may show preserved awareness or asynchronous movements; prolactin can be helpful if measured correctly, but video-EEG is the gold standard when available [^7ba85828]. Status dystonicus presents with sustained muscle contractions without epileptiform activity, and toxic-metabolic encephalopathies can produce fluctuating consciousness with diffuse slowing rather than ictal patterns on EEG, underscoring the need for EEG when the diagnosis is uncertain or the course is atypical [^b549191b] [^e5f88fdd].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check that it aligns with guidelines. If a seizure lasts 5 minutes or more, or if there are recurrent seizures without return to baseline, treat as status epilepticus and initiate benzodiazepines immediately while securing airway, breathing, and circulation and starting etiologic workup in parallel, because delays worsen outcomes [^acb4668f] [^b4e2c9e8]. If convulsions stop but the patient remains altered beyond about 10–20 minutes, obtain EEG to evaluate for non-convulsive status epilepticus and escalate therapy accordingly, using continuous EEG when available in high-risk settings such as post-cardiac arrest, CNS infection, or following overt GCSE [^30fbdcd2] [^5a45fd64]. If the presentation is atypical or there is diagnostic uncertainty, prioritize EEG and consider prolactin only to distinguish epileptic from psychogenic events, recognizing its limitations in status epilepticus and repetitive seizures [^7ba85828].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment thresholds without acknowledging controversies. Some experts argue that the 5-minute t1 for convulsive status epilepticus may be too aggressive for certain non-convulsive phenotypes, where t1 and t2 are less well defined and overtreatment risks from anesthesia must be balanced against uncertain benefit; emerging data suggest that seizure burden metrics and etiology-specific risk may better guide intensity, but this remains an area of active debate and local protocols should reflect current evidence and resources [^26726783] [^05d30870] [^79a5ac47]. I should also note that while cEEG increases detection, randomized trials have not demonstrated improved survival versus routine EEG strategies, so centers with limited cEEG access may reasonably use repeated routine EEG with clinical vigilance, especially when continuous monitoring is not feasible [^a921d6ca] [^659ce963].

> In summary, I need to ensure the differentiation hinges on three axes: time course with a 5-minute threshold for continuous or recurrent seizures without recovery, clinical semiology distinguishing convulsive from non-convulsive forms, and EEG confirmation when the presentation is subtle or consciousness fails to normalize, all while integrating etiologic evaluation and mimics to avoid misdiagnosis and to guide timely, staged therapy [^acb4668f] [^e5f88fdd] [^0a42d752].

Status epilepticus (SE) is best differentiated from other seizures by **duration ≥ 5 minutes** [^acb4668f] or **recurrent seizures without recovery** between them, whereas typical seizures last < 2 minutes and resolve spontaneously [^notfound]. SE also shows **persistent altered consciousness** or confusion lasting > 30 minutes after the event, unlike brief postictal confusion in ordinary seizures [^notfound]. Continuous EEG is **required to confirm nonconvulsive SE** or when consciousness does not return to baseline, as clinical features alone are insufficient [^79a5ac47] [^5f6cb660]. Prompt recognition and treatment are critical because SE carries higher morbidity and mortality than isolated seizures [^4f26a0a8] [^b9911812].

---

## Clinical definitions and diagnostic criteria

### Status epilepticus (SE)

- **Operational definition**: ≥ 5 minutes of continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity, or recurrent seizures without recovery between seizures [^acb4668f] [^0888c6a0].
- **ILAE 2015 definition**: Two time points — t1 (when a seizure is abnormally prolonged and unlikely to self-terminate) and t2 (when risk of long-term consequences, including neuronal injury, increases) [^26726783] [^51203748].
- **Convulsive SE**: Generalized tonic-clonic movements with impaired consciousness [^38c1320c].
- **Nonconvulsive SE**: Seizure activity on EEG without overt convulsions; often presents with altered mental status or subtle motor signs [^e5f88fdd] [^5f6cb660].

---

### Other seizures (non-SE)

Typical seizures are **brief, self-limited events** lasting < 2 minutes, with a short postictal period and full recovery of consciousness within 30 minutes [^notfound]. They may be generalized or focal, with or without impaired awareness, but they do not meet the duration or recurrence criteria for SE [^notfound].

---

## Key clinical features differentiating SE from other seizures

| **Feature** | **Status epilepticus (se)** | **Other seizures (non-se)** |
|-|-|-|
| Duration | ≥ 5 minutes or recurrent without recovery | < 2 minutes |
| Consciousness | Persistent impairment (> 30 minutes) | Brief impairment (< 30 minutes) |
| Motor activity | Continuous or recurrent convulsions | Brief, intermittent convulsions |
| EEG findings | Continuous epileptiform activity | Brief epileptiform activity |
| Postictal state | Prolonged confusion or coma | Brief confusion or fatigue |
| Response to treatment | Often requires aggressive therapy | Usually responds to standard therapy |

---

## Diagnostic tools and investigations

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

- **Gold standard**: Essential for diagnosing nonconvulsive SE and for confirming ongoing seizure activity when consciousness is impaired [^79a5ac47] [^5f6cb660].
- **Continuous EEG (cEEG)**: Recommended when SE is suspected or consciousness does not return to baseline; detects nonconvulsive seizures and guides therapy [^30fbdcd2] [^5a45fd64].
- **Routine EEG**: Useful when cEEG is unavailable, but may miss intermittent seizures [^a921d6ca].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Basic labs**: Glucose, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, renal and hepatic function, and toxicology screen [^notfound].
- **Prolactin levels**: Elevated 10–20 minutes after generalized tonic-clonic or complex partial seizures; not specific for SE or repetitive seizures [^7ba85828].
- **ABG**: Assess for metabolic derangements and respiratory compromise [^notfound].

---

### Neuroimaging

MRI is indicated when the etiology is unknown or when **focal deficits** are present; obtain after stabilization [^a1a9a1b6]. CT is used for acute settings to rapidly identify hemorrhage, mass effect, or trauma [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed recognition and treatment

Delayed recognition and treatment of SE increase the risk of **neuronal injury**, cognitive impairment, and death [^b9911812] [^9bc5aa7a]. Early, aggressive management reduces morbidity and mortality [^4f26a0a8] [^b9911812].

---

## Summary of key differences

- **Duration**: SE lasts ≥ 5 minutes or recurs without recovery; other seizures are brief and self-limited [^acb4668f].
- **Consciousness**: SE causes prolonged impairment; other seizures have brief postictal confusion [^notfound].
- **EEG**: SE shows continuous epileptiform activity; other seizures show brief discharges [^notfound].
- **Treatment**: SE requires aggressive, sequential therapy; other seizures respond to standard therapy [^d52d33d5].

---

Status epilepticus is distinguished from other seizures by **duration ≥ 5 minutes** or **recurrent seizures without recovery**, with prolonged altered consciousness and continuous EEG activity. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent neuronal injury and reduce mortality [^b9911812].

### Pathophysiology and definitions of seizures and status epilepticus [^2fbe7721]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of seizures is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Experimental work demonstrates that prolonged, abnormal, and excessive neuronal electrical activity in itself is injurious through several mechanisms independent of systemic acidosis and hypoxia. Population survival studies and laboratory investigations support the idea that brain injury and epileptogenesis result from status epilepticus. The basic distinction in seizure types is that of generalized and partial seizures. Correct classification of seizure types will aid in clinical communications and guide correct therapies. Revised definitions of generalized convulsive status epilepticus suggest making this diagnosis with as few as 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity.

### Outcome predictors for status epilepticus – what really counts [^76f02bf6]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

In adult patients with status epilepticus (SE)-a life-threatening state of ongoing or repetitive seizures — the current evidence regarding outcome prediction is based on clinical, biochemical and EEG determinants. These predictors of outcome involve clinical features such as age, history of prior seizures or epilepsy, SE aetiology, level of consciousness, and seizure type at SE onset. The clinical risk-benefit calculation between the danger of undertreated persistent seizure activity and, conversely, the potential damage from unwarranted aggressive treatments remains a constant challenge. Improved knowledge of outcome determinants, as well as increased availability of reliable outcome prediction models early in the course of SE, is paramount for optimization of treatment of patients who develop this disorder. In this Review, we discuss the major prognostic determinants of outcome in SE. Through consideration of studies that provide measures of association between predictors of SE outcome and death, we propose a detailed — but as yet unvalidated — paradigm for assessment of these predictors during the course of SE. Such an algorithm could guide the organization of results from existing trials and provide direction with regard to the parameters that should be monitored in future studies of SE.

Status epilepticus — operational definition and classification are specified as SE defined as 5 min or more of (i) continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity or (ii) recurrent seizure activity without recovery (returning to baseline) between seizures; rationale includes that most clinical and electrographic seizures last less than 5 min and that permanent neuronal injury and pharmacoresistance may occur before the traditional definition of 30 min of continuous seizure activity, and experts have suggested including seizures lasting for 5 min or longer; SE can be classified by semiology, duration, and underlying etiology, with these guidelines focusing on convulsive, non-convulsive, and refractory SE.

(1) Status epilepticus is a significant health problem that is under-recognized, yet is associated with major morbidity and mortality. (2) Mechanisms accounting for status epilepticus emergence from a single seizure, and for prolonged status epilepticus duration, remain unclear. (3) No randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses were found in any of the databases searched regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms of status epilepticus in humans. (4) Ongoing and future research is likely to more clearly define the pathogenetic mechanisms of status epilepticus. This, in turn, is likely to encourage better treatment 'targeting' for particular aspects of the condition.

### Status epilepticus: what's new? [^d7cc0f60]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The emergent evaluation and treatment of generalized convulsive status epilepticus presents challenges for emergency physicians. This disease is one of the few in which minutes can mean the difference between life and significant morbidity and mortality. It is imperative to use parallel processing and have multiple treatment options planned in advance, in case the current treatment is not successful. There is also benefit to exploring, or initiating, treatment algorithms to standardize the care for these critically ill patients.

### Status epilepticus and acute serial seizures in children [^dd84c58f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is defined as a seizure that persists for a sufficient length of time or is repeated frequently enough to produce a fixed and enduring epileptic condition of 30 minutes or longer. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition that often occurs in children. The degree of mortality and neurologic morbidity, as well as the risk for recurrence, is highly dependent on the etiology and duration of the seizures. Although much has been written about pediatric status epilepticus, many issues remain unresolved. A better understanding of the different types of seizures and their etiologies may help in the prevention and treatment of status epilepticus. The vast extent of status epilepticus in both children and adults mandates that new options for prevention and treatment be given a close scrutiny and high priority. This article will review the most current information on convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, including the potential for neurologic damage, changes in magnetic resonance imaging after status epilepticus, risk for recurrence, and current treatment options available for treating status epilepticus in children.

### Diagnosis and management of status epilepticus: improving the status quo [^b9911812]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency that is characterised by prolonged or recurrent seizures without recovery between episodes and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and targeted therapy can reduce the risk of complications and death associated with status epilepticus, thereby improving outcomes. The most recent International League Against Epilepsy definition considers two important timepoints in status epilepticus: first, when the seizure does not self-terminate; and second, when the seizure can have long-term consequences, including neuronal injury. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of status epilepticus indicate that changes in neurotransmission as status epilepticus progresses can increase excitatory seizure-facilitating and decrease inhibitory seizure-terminating mechanisms at a cellular level. Effective clinical management requires rapid initiation of supportive measures, assessment of the cause of the seizure, and first-line treatment with benzodiazepines. If status epilepticus continues, management should entail second-line and third-line treatment agents, supportive EEG monitoring, and admission to an intensive care unit. Future research to study early seizure detection, rescue protocols and medications, rapid treatment escalation, and integration of fundamental scientific and clinical evidence into clinical practice could shorten seizure duration and reduce associated complications. Furthermore, improved recognition, education, and treatment in patients who are at risk might help to prevent status epilepticus, particularly for patients living in low-income and middle-income countries.

### Management of status epilepticus: a narrative review [^79a5ac47]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus causes prolonged or repetitive seizures that, if left untreated, can lead to neuronal injury, severe disability, coma and death in paediatric and adult populations. While convulsive status epilepticus can be diagnosed using clinical features alone, non-convulsive status epilepticus requires confirmation by electroencephalogram. Early seizure control remains key in preventing the complications of status epilepticus. This is especially true for convulsive status epilepticus, which has stronger evidence supporting the benefit of treatment on outcomes. When status epilepticus becomes refractory, often due to gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulation, anaesthetic drugs are needed to suppress seizure activity, of which there is limited evidence regarding the selection, dose or duration of their use. Seizure monitoring with electroencephalogram is often needed when patients do not return to baseline or during anaesthetic wean; however, it is resource-intensive, costly, only available in highly specialised centres and has not been shown to improve functional outcomes. Thus, the treatment goals and aggressiveness of therapy remain under debate, especially for non-convulsive status epilepticus, where prolonged therapeutic coma can lead to severe complications. This review presents an evidence-based, clinically-oriented and comprehensive review of status epilepticus and its definitions, aetiologies, treatments, outcomes and prognosis at different stages of the patient's journey.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^fc3afd3f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This review was conducted following current methodological standards, including comprehensive literature searches of relevant sources and transparent methods throughout. In addition, we had access to the individual participant data for the largest trial. Limitations of the assessment include the identification of only a few published trials in the adult population, with small sample sizes and inadequate power to detect clinically important differences between active treatments. Differences across trials, in terms of the type of treatment administered and the choice and definition of outcome measures, hampered the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^b4e2c9e8]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — core treatment principles specify that the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus should occur rapidly and continue sequentially until clinical seizures are halted (strong recommendation, high quality), and the treatment of SE should occur rapidly and continue sequentially until electrographic seizures are halted (strong recommendation, moderate quality). Critical care treatment and monitoring should be started simultaneously with emergent initial therapy and continued until further therapy is consider successful or futile (strong recommendation, moderate quality).

### The electroencephalogram in the diagnosis and classification of status epilepticus: a practical guide [^db517cfb]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus is a serious neurological emergency requiring swift recognition and treatment. Presentations with prominent motor features are easily recognised but it can be challenging to diagnose those with subtle or no motor features. Electroencephalogram (EEG) remains indispensable in diagnosing, classifying, monitoring and prognosticating of status epilepticus. There are several separate classification systems for seizures, epilepsy and status epilepticus, incorporating clinical features, causes and EEG correlates. This review focuses on using EEG in status epilepticus and provides a practical approach to diagnosis and classification aligning with the current International League Against Epilepsy and American Clinical Neurophysiology Society definitions.

### Status epilepticus in the neonate [^62e4aab0]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Key messages

Neonatal status epilepticus is a neurological emergency and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Diagnosis of neonatal status epilepticus is challenging due to lack of a universally accepted definition and the need for EEG monitoring to accurately identify and quantify neonatal seizures.
Aetiology of neonatal status epilepticus includes a wide spectrum of disorders, some of which may not be identified early.
Treatment for neonatal status epilepticus must be timely and individualised to optimise efficacy of interventions and minimise adverse outcomes.
Harnessing advances through computer learning and artificial intelligence may facilitate early diagnosis, prognostication and better outcomes for infants with neonatal status epilepticus.

### Sex-related differences in adult patients with status epilepticus: a seven-year two-center observation [^f4a4e8fb]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus (SE) is a critical and life-threatening neurological condition with ongoing epileptic seizures that comes along with a high morbidity and mortality. This has triggered several studies to explore the impact of various demographic, clinical, epileptological, and treatment characteristics on the course and outcome of critically ill patients with SE. Several factors have been identified that may influence the development, management, course, and outcome of SE, including age, etiology, underlying comorbidities, type of seizures, duration of SE, and treatment modalities. In contrast, studies regarding the role of sex on the emergence of SE, its treatment, course, and outcome are scarce. Although some studies have suggested that female sex may be a risk factor for the development of SE in patients with epilepsy, and that women may receive less aggressive care than men regardless of illness severity, other studies have reported conflicting findings. For example, early studies suggested that the incidence of SE was lower in women than men, and other studies found no significant sex-related differences regarding the incidence of SE. Given these inconsistences and further conflicting data from population-based studies and systematic reviews regarding the influence of sex on course and outcome in patients suffering from SE, the precise role of sex in this regard remains unclear. Hence, further research is needed to elucidate the role of sex in the management of SE. In particular, there is a need for more comprehensive studies that examine sex-associated differences in SE patients, including their demographics, clinical characteristics, disease course, and outcome, as well as differences especially when it comes to the development and implementation of treatment strategies. This retrospective observational cohort study aimed to investigate sex-associated differences in adult patients with SE, including treatment, course of disease, complications, and outcomes.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^ba11592b]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus guideline methodology and GRADE approach — A PubMed/Medline search for English-language human studies published through August 2011 included clinical trials, meta-analyses, review articles, and practice guidelines, with additional literature for continual EEG and intensive care unit management drawn from committee recommendations and reference lists. Diagnosis and management recommendations were assigned using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which provides "strong" and "weak" recommendation grades and defines evidence quality categories. A strong recommendation can be made based on four factors: balance between desirable and undesirable effects, quality of evidence, values and preferences, and costs (resource allocation). All participants agreed with the recommendations, and because many management decisions lack prospective randomized controlled trials, the guideline also incorporates data from previously published surveys and a survey of an international expert panel, plus selected review articles recommended by external reviewers.

### Status epilepticus [^8f870f37]. Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency that requires rapid and vigorous treatment to prevent neuronal damage and systemic complications. Failure to diagnose and treat status epilepticus accurately and effectively results in significant morbidity and mortality. Cerebral metabolic decompensation occurs after approximately 30 min of uncontrolled convulsive activity, and the window for treatment is therefore limited. Therapy should proceed simultaneously on four fronts: termination of seizures; prevention of seizure recurrence once status is controlled; management of precipitating causes of status epilepticus; management of the complications. This article reviews current opinions about the classification, aetiology and pathophysiology of adult generalised convulsive status epilepticus and details practical management strategies for treatment of this life-threatening condition.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus in adults-insights into the invisible [^5f6cb660]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a state of continuous or repetitive seizures without convulsions. Owing to the nonspecific symptoms and considerable morbidity and mortality associated with NCSE, clinical research has focused on early diagnosis, risk stratification and seizure termination. The subtle symptoms and the necessity for electroencephalographic confirmation of seizures result in under-diagnosis with deleterious consequences. The introduction of continuous EEG to clinical practice, and the characterization of electrographic criteria have delineated a number of NCSE types that are associated with different prognoses in several clinical settings. Epidemiological studies have uncovered risk factors for NCSE; knowledge of these factors, together with particular clinical characteristics and EEG observations, enables tailored treatment. Despite these advances, NCSE can be refractory to antiepileptic drugs, necessitating further escalation of treatment. The presumptive escalation to anaesthetics, however, has recently been questioned owing to an association with increased mortality. This Review compiles epidemiological, clinical and diagnostic aspects of NCSE, and considers current treatment options and prognosis.

### Quality improvement in neurology: child neurology quality measure set: executive summary [^1599afd5]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus — Status epilepticus (SE) is characterized as "a neurologic emergency" of continuous or rapidly recurring seizures without baseline recovery, with an estimated "50,000 to 150,000" annual episodes in the United States. SE forms include convulsive and nonconvulsive types, and in children the most recent guideline defines SE as a seizure "lasting longer than 5 minutes", aiming to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### New ways of looking at an old disease: the reimagination of epilepsy [^8d2a847f]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

A definition and classification of status epilepticus — report of the ILAE Task Force on Classification of Status Epilepticus

A standardised definition of SE has long evaded medical terminology with previous definitions relying on ambiguous phrases including a seizure as a "fixed and enduring condition", or one persisting for a "sufficient length of time". The authors of this paper have sought to provide a new definition of SE, with a stated goal of providing a structured terminology, but one which could evolve as advances in neurobiology and pathophysiology became apparent. The suggested terms consist of a time point (t 1) after which time a given seizure is considered to be "an abnormally prolonged seizure", and a second time point (t 2) after which time neuronal injury is thought to occur. This second time point provides a degree of impetus about how aggressive one should be in treating an abnormally prolonged seizure. The values of these time points vary depending on underlying seizure type.

This new classification of SE involves four axes: the semiology of the seizure, aetiology, EEG correlate, and the age of the patient. The goals of reclassification are to improve communication between healthcare professionals, improve treatment of patients, permit epidemiological studies, and guide basic research.

Comment. This paper follows on from the natural success of the earlier redefinition and reclassification of the epilepsies from the ILAE. However, it is important to stress that the new definition, by their own admission, is based upon incomplete evidence, and "considerable variation". Whilst they have allowed for the advent of future knowledge in the decision to include two time points, it may have been simpler to adopt a new single approach with the lowest common denominator. Classifying a generalised tonic–clonic seizure 'abnormally prolonged' after 5 min, but a focal motor seizure 'prolonged' after 10 min might appear pedantic since clinicians may not make this distinction in clinical practice. Furthermore, there may be concerns in the suggested guidance that a treating clinician has greater than 60 min before the onset of neuronal injury since it may promote a delay in treatment as a result of a perceived lack of urgency. Furthermore, in spite of these specific time frames, the authors acknowledge that the likelihood of damage is dependent on the location of the epileptic focus the intensity of the status, and the age of the patient.

Status epilepticus definition and category framework — A 30-minute definition was adopted in subsequent studies of SE, and this definition also includes two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures. SE is classified by seizure type and etiology, and the seizure type is determined by the origin of the epileptic discharge (i.e., focal or generalized) or if insufficient information is available, indeterminate or unclassifiable. As defined in table 1, the etiologic classification of SE includes 1) acute symptomatic, 2) remote symptomatic, 3) remote symptomatic with an acute precipitant, 4) progressive encephalopathy, 5) febrile, and 6) cryptogenic (idiopathic). The category idiopathic is now reserved for the genetically determined epilepsies, and remote symptomatic with an acute precipitant refers to SE in a child with a prior known diagnosis of epilepsy.

### Basics of modern epilepsy classification and terminology [^e6753e10]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The terminology and classification of seizures and epilepsy has undergone multiple revisions in the last several decades, which can lead to confusion and miscommunication amongst physicians and researchers. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) revised the classification of both seizures and epilepsy types in an effort to use less ambiguous terminology. Over time, definitions for status epilepticus, febrile seizures, and neonatal seizures have also evolved, as has the delineation of various epilepsy syndromes by age.

Methods

Review of the literature for old and new terminology and various epilepsy syndromes was accomplished using the PubMed database system.

Results

In the following article, we review old terminology for classifying seizures and epilepsy as compared to the new (2017) ILAE guidelines. We discuss neonatal seizures, status epilepticus, febrile seizures, autoimmune epilepsy and various epilepsy syndromes by age of onset.

Conclusion

Adopting a classification system that uses plain language allows for more effective and efficient communication between individuals and across specialties. Definitions of various syndromes and seizure types have evolved over time and are reviewed.

### Less common etiologies of status epilepticus [^02fbefe3]. Epilepsy Currents (2010). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is treated as a neurologic emergency and only later are the potential etiologies assessed. While sometimes the cause for status epilepticus is apparent (e.g., antiepileptic drug withdrawal), all too often it is not identified, even after extensive diagnostic testing has been performed. With emphasis on the less-common etiologies, this review will cover various probable and known causes of status epilepticus among adults, children, and those patients with refractory epilepsy.

### Occurrence of status epilepticus in persons with epilepsy is determined by sex, epilepsy classification, and etiology: a single center cohort study [^f67d67ac]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Status epilepticus (SE) can lead to long-term neurological sequelae or death and is associated with increased rates of drug-refractory epilepsy with reduced quality of life. Most epidemiological studies focus on SE in the general population, a heterogeneous cohort consisting of > 50% of persons without preexisting epilepsy. These studies applied a cut-off of 30 min to define SE. The current ILAE operational definition of SE allows diagnosis of (convulsive) SE after 5 min. Beyond this point in time, rescue medication is often necessary to disrupt seizure activity. In an outpatient setting, the physician needs to estimate the patients' risk of SE and decide whether patients are supplied with rescue medication. Surprisingly, knowledge on factors associated with SE in persons with preexisting epilepsy is scarce. Prescription of rescue medication is often limited to those who already suffered an episode of SE. To address these gaps, this study aimed to answer the following questions: how many patients with epilepsy report a history of SE with a cut-off at 5 min? Which demographic or clinical characteristics are associated with a history of SE? What is the level of information about SE in a tertiary epilepsy clinic?

### Pharmacologic management… [^16d1ed50]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Definition, Classification, and Epidemiology DEFINITION A decade ago, the EFA convened a working group to define status epilepticus. 4 They described this condition as two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, or more than 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity. 4 This definition is generally accepted, although some investigators consider shorter durations of seizure activity to constitute status epilepticus. Practically speaking, any person who exhibits persistent seizure activity or who does not regain consciousness for five minutes or more after a witnessed seizure should be considered to have status epilepticus. CLASSIFICATION SCHEME Although there is no consensus over a classification system for status epilepticus, classification is necessary for appropriate management of the condition because effective management depends on the type of status epilepticus.

In general, the various systems characterize status epilepticus according to where the seizures arise — from a localized region of the cortex or from both hemispheres of the brain. The other major categorization hinges on the clinical observation of overt convulsions; thus, status epilepticus may be convulsive or nonconvulsive in nature. Various approaches to classifying status epilepticus have been suggested. 5–7 One version 5 classified status epilepticus into generalized and partial status epilepticus. Another version 6 divides the condition into generalized status epilepticus and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The third version 7 takes a different approach, classifying status epilepticus by life stage.

EPIDEMIOLOGY Status epilepticus of partial onset accounts for the majority of episodes. 20 used EEG to diagnose status epilepticus in 37 percent of patients with altered consciousness whose diagnosis was unclear on the basis of clinical criteria. A surprising number of patients had no clinical signs of status epilepticus, and EEG was necessary to establish the diagnosis. EEG also can help to confirm that an episode of status epilepticus has ended, particularly when questions arise about the possibility of recurrent episodes of more subtle seizures. In another study. Lorazepam Lorazepam has emerged as the preferred benzodiazepine for acute management of status epilepticus.

Table 4 — Prognosis: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — mortality at hospital discharge is 18–52% and at 30 days is 65%. Time to diagnosis and seizure control are strongly associated with outcome: for patients diagnosed within 30 min of seizure onset, mortality was 36% compared with 75% when diagnosed ≥ 24 h after onset, and patients with NCSE treated and resolved within 10 h had 10% mortality versus 85% mortality if seizures continued longer than 20 h. Etiology also influences outcome, with mortality at hospital discharge 27% versus 3% comparing patients with versus without a known acute medical cause.

### New onset refractory status epilepticus research: what is on the horizon? [^331d3d6e]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a clinical presentation, not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurologic disorder, with new onset of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) that does not resolve after 2 or more rescue medications, without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause. Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome is a subset of NORSE in which fever began at least 24 hours prior to the RSE. Both terms apply to all age groups. Until recently, NORSE was a poorly recognized entity without a consistent definition or approach to care. We review the current state of knowledge in NORSE and propose a roadmap for future collaborative research. Research investigating NORSE should prioritize the following 4 domains: (1) clinical features, etiology, and pathophysiology; (2) treatment; (3) adult and pediatric evaluation and management approaches; and (4) public advocacy, professional education, and family support. We consider international collaboration and multicenter research crucial in achieving these goals.

### Strategies to innovate emergency care of status epilepticus [^51203748]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Interest in status epilepticus (SE) has grown, evidenced by large-scale clinical studies and an improved understanding of its pathophysiology. The development of new definitions, classifications, early and preventive treatments, and diagnostic guidelines are expected to enhance patient outcomes. The definition of SE proposed by an ILAE task force provides an operational guideline for initiating therapy and a more traditional pathological definition. SE is a condition arising either from the failure of seizure-terminating mechanisms or from the initiation of mechanisms that lead to abnormally prolonged seizures (after time point t1, functional definition). SE is a condition that can have long-term consequences (after time point t2, pathological definition), including neuronal death, injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures.

Both the functional and pathological definitions of SE are evidence-based. The first part addresses when to intervene in treating seizures, recognizing that most seizures end quickly, but intervention is necessary when self-termination is unlikely. Studies from epilepsy monitoring units show that focal, focal dyscognitive (previously known as complex partial), and focal with bilateral spread seizures (formerly secondarily generalized) have different median durations, with focal seizures with bilateral spread lasting the longest. In adults with refractory epilepsy admitted to these units, these seizures typically last no more than 2 ​min. However, SE may be the first seizure a patient experiences. A study of 407 children with their first unprovoked seizure found that seizures lasting more than 5–10 ​min were unlikely to end on their own. The SE definition emphasizes the need to treat seizures if they are unusually prolonged.

### Understanding pediatric epilepsy: types of seizures-AAP… [^32a39ad1]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

Although all seizures are caused by abnormal electrical and chemical changes in the brain, there are different types of seizures. Children and youth with epilepsy may have one type of seizure or a combination. The specific type of seizure a person has depends on where in the brain the seizure starts, how the seizure spreads and how much/what part of the brain is involved. Physicians categorize seizures into two main categories based on how much of the brain is affected at the start of the seizure:

1. Generalized seizures – Involve the whole brain.
2. Focal seizures – Start in one area of the brain. Families/caregivers should consult with their child's physician to identify the seizure type as their behavior, risk of injury and treatment depend upon what kind of seizures they have. A seizure that lasts more than five minutes, or multiple seizures in a row without the person regaining consciousness between seizures is a condition referred to as status epilepticus.

While most seizures are short, stop on their own, and do not cause injury to the brain, if status epilepticus is suspected, emergency treatment is needed to stop the seizure. Focal Seizures Focal Aware Seizures These seizures begin in one part of the brain and symptoms will vary depending on the area of the brain involved. For example, these seizures can cause uncontrolled movement of parts of the body or sensory changes such as things smelling or tasting strange to the child or adolescent. During these seizures, the child is aware and alert but unable to respond to others or have control of their body movements. These seizures usually last between a few seconds to 2 minutes. Note: These seizures were previously called "simple partial" seizures, but that term is no longer used. Additional information about focal aware seizures can be found here.

Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures These seizures begin in one part of the brain, and symptoms will vary depending on the area of the brain involved. During these seizures the child or adolescent may be confused, consciousness is impaired and they likely are unaware of their surroundings. The child may have unusual behaviors like making repetitive movements, mumbling, running or screaming. These seizures can occur when the child is sleeping. This type of seizure can last one or two minutes, after which the child may be frightened or confused. Note: These seizures were previously called "complex partial" seizures, but that term is no longer used.

### Status epilepticus in adults [^05a247c6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency with considerable associated health-care costs, morbidity, and mortality. The definition of status epilepticus as a prolonged seizure or a series of seizures with incomplete return to baseline is under reconsideration in an effort to establish a more practical definition to guide management. Clinical research has focused on early seizure termination in the prehospital setting. The approach of early escalation to anaesthetic agents for refractory generalised convulsive status epilepticus, rather than additional trials of second-line anti-epileptic drugs, to avoid neuronal injury and pharmaco-resistance associated with prolonged seizures is gaining momentum. Status epilepticus is also increasingly identified in the inpatient setting as the use of extended electroencephalography monitoring becomes more commonplace. Substantial further research to enable early identification of status epilepticus and efficacy of anti-epileptic drugs will be important to improve outcomes.

### "T" times: revisiting the timing of neuronal injury in status epilepticus [^26726783]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The definition of status epilepticus (SE) has been evolving since it was first introduced in 1964 as "… a seizure [that] persists for a sufficient length of time or is repeated frequently enough to produce a fixed and enduring epileptic condition". The most recent update to the definition and classification of SE was in 2015 by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). In this update, SE is divided into those with prominent motor components and those without a prominent motor component. Status epilepticus with a prominent motor component includes convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) and focal motor SE. Status epilepticus without prominent motor component, also known as nonconvulsive SE (NCSE), includes the types of SE that may be seen in comatose and critically ill patients and also those in which the patient is not comatose, such as absence SE. This update also provided clarity in the duration of seizure activity beyond which it is diagnosed as SE. Time point t 1 is the time beyond which seizure activity should be regarded as "continuous" and unlikely to stop on its own. This is time at which intervention should be undertaken to stop the seizure. Additionally, time point t 2 is the time at which on-going seizure activity results in risk of long-term neurologic consequences. It is the risk of time point t 2 that drives the urgency to treat SE. Time points t 1 and t 2 are different for the different types of SE. For example, the t 1 for generalized CSE is 5 minutes and t 2 is 30 minutes, while the t 1 for focal SE is 10 minutes and the t 2 is likely greater than 60 minutes.

### AAN releases guidelines for the use of serum prolactin assays in… [^7ba85828]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The recent accessibility of video electroencephalography monitoring has reduced interest in the use of prolactin in distinguishing epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. However, a serum marker continues to be clinically useful when video EEG is not available. The American Academy of Neurology has released evidence-based recommendations for the use of serum prolactin tests in differentiating between epileptic and nonepileptic seizures. The report was published in the September 2005 issue of. Neurology. The AAN developed the following practice recommendations for physicians considering a laboratory blood test to diagnose epileptic seizures: When measured in appropriate clinical settings at 10 to 20 minutes after a suspected event, elevated serum prolactin levels are useful in distinguishing generalized tonic-clonic seizures or complex partial seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures in adults and older children.

Serum prolactin levels should be representative of the baseline prolactin level when measured more than six hours after a suspected episode. Serum prolactin assay is not useful in distinguishing seizure from syncope. Serum prolactin assay has not been established in the assessment of status epilepticus, repetitive seizures, or neonatal seizures. The AAN also made the following recommendations for future research on serum prolactin assays: Additional research should be done to provide a more accurate standardization of sex-specific prolactin threshold values. Studies should evaluate the usefulness of an out-patient prolactin kit that could be kept in the patient's home to document capillary prolactin changes shortly after seizure episodes. Studies should determine what prolactin changes occur after other seizure imitators that may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

Prospective studies of postictal prolactin measures in neonates and young children are needed. Additional data are needed to interpret prolactin values after status epilepticus and repetitive seizures.

### Continuous vs routine electroencephalogram in critically ill adults with altered consciousness and No recent seizure: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^a921d6ca]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with acute consciousness impairment and no recent seizures, does continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) correlate with reduced mortality compared with repeated routine EEG (rEEG)?

Findings

In this pragmatic, multicenter randomized clinical trial analyzing 364 adults, cEEG translated into a higher rate of seizures/status epilepticus detection and antiseizure treatment modifications but did not improve mortality compared with rEEG.

Meaning

Pending larger studies, rEEG may represent a valid alternative to cEEG in centers with limited resources.

Conclusion

This study has uncovered concerning sex-related disparities in the clinical characteristics, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes of adult patients experiencing SE, with women exhibiting a relative disadvantage. To what extent these results are explained by undetected and unexplored sex-specific differences in a systemic response to SE remains unclear. Nevertheless, this does not make them any less concerning. Until further studies provide more explanations in this context, these findings indicate that sex must be taken into account when formulating strategies for managing SE and forecasting specific outcomes.

### Overview: definitions and classifications of seizure emergencies [^955fd1c9]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure emergencies are potentially life-threatening events that are under-recognized. Status epilepticus is associated with considerable rates of morbidity and mortality. Experts currently believe that any episode of seizure activity lasting 5 minutes or longer should be considered status epilepticus. Treatment should be initiated as early as possible; evidence has shown that once seizures persist for 5 to 10 minutes, they are unlikely to stop on their own in the subsequent few minutes. Prehospital treatment with benzodiazepines has been shown to reduce seizure activity significantly compared with seizures that remain untreated until the patient reaches the emergency department. The consequences of delayed treatment of status epilepticus include a serious risk of subsequent prolonged seizure activity or epileptogenesis, memory deficits, and learning difficulties. The importance of timely intervention in generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus must be emphasized. Recent research has found that emergency department personnel fail to recognize the condition in children in 34% of cases.

We review physiological and subcellular changes that might play a part in the transition from single seizures to status epilepticus and in the development of time-dependent pharmacoresistance. We review the principles underlying the treatment of status epilepticus and suggest that prehospital treatment is beneficial, that therapeutic drugs should be used in rapid sequence according to a defined protocol, and that refractory status epilepticus should be treated with general anaesthesia. We comment on our preference for drugs with a short elimination half-life and discuss some therapeutic choices.

### Electroencephalographic seizure or electroencephalographic status epilepticus in the ICU? Is it time to focus just on electroencephalographic status epilepticus? [^1dc04ce8]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

At the authors' hospital, treating physicians used ASM once ES/ESE was identified on CEEG and yet outcomes in these treated ESE patients were unfavorable. Therefore, should one conclude that presence of ESE itself predicts unfavorable outcomes and hence aggressive treatment of ESE should be tempered? Alternatively, should one conclude that treating every single ES is not warranted because it does not affect outcome or mortality? Are there other biomarkers that we should target?

The takeaway message for my patient is that while I monitor the seizure frequency from one hour to the next, it may not be critical to hit every seizure hard. Clearly, more prospective studies that categorize ES exposure uniformly and have evidence-based management strategies will allow for uniform short- and long-term outcome assessments.

### Choosing wisely: who really benefits from critical care EEG monitoring? [^659ce963]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures and status epilepticus are a common complication of critical illness in neonates, children and adults with acute brain injury and, less frequently, in those with systemic illness. Most seizures occur without accompanying clinical manifestations, and thus require electroencephalogram (EEG) for their detection, motivating a widespread increase in the use of critical care continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG). However, access to cEEG remains limited — even in high-income countries — due to high capital equipment costs and a shortage of qualified EEG professionals, raising concerns about cost-effectiveness. Interestingly, two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating critically ill adults to cEEG vs. repeated routine EEG showed comparable outcomes across groups. Why might this be? In both RCTs, subjects who received cEEG had more seizures detected and received more anti-seizure treatment; however, these trials did not assess whether these interventions led to a reduction in seizure burden, which might have been important to be able to achieve improved outcomes.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is one of the great diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of modern neurology. Because the clinical features of this disorder may be very discrete and sometimes hard to differentiate from normal behaviour, NCSE is usually overlooked and consequently not treated properly. It is important to be familiar with the clinical subtypes such as absence, simple and complex partial, and subtle status epilepticus because each requires tailored management. In order to improve overall care of patients with NCSE, strict diagnostic criteria are needed that should be based on clinical alterations and ictal electroencephalographic changes. NCSE should be terminated rapidly to prevent patients from serious injuries, particularly if consciousness is impaired.

### Sex differences in status epilepticus; biological, statistical, or societal? [^6851025e]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The impact of sex and gender on medical treatment and outcomes has been understudied and underappreciated. Biological sex differences may affect the presentation of disease, severity of symptoms and sequelae, drug metabolism, and treatment response. At the same time, sociocultural factors related to sex or gender may also impact how a patient presents, communicates, or selects treatment. Finally, sex or gender-based biases and assumptions on the part of health care providers can also have a significant impact on identification of disease, as well as its management and outcomes. It is difficult to disentangle the effects of sex and gender in available epidemiological and clinical data, which cannot be blinded to these variables. Recently, more attention has been paid to sex-based differences in critical care medicine. In one metanalysis, compared to males, female patients were more likely to have higher illness severity scores at the time of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) as well as higher risk-adjusted mortality scores at 1 year postdischarge. However, when the analysis excluded studies that were at high risk of statistical bias, these findings were not reproduced. Another metanalysis found that female patients were less likely to be treated with invasive mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy. These findings raise concern that females may be treated less aggressively than males with similar illness severity. Few studies have investigated the effect of sex on the incidence and outcomes of status epilepticus (SE). The majority of, but not all, prior studies have demonstrated that SE is more common in males. Sex-specific mortality associated with SE has been shown to be higher in males in 2 studies, no different in 1 study, and higher in females in another. Differences in cultural setting, ascertainment, SE etiology, and other confounding variables certainly play a role in the heterogeneity of these findings necessitating further research.

### Status epilepticus [^41a6d3c3]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Status epilepticus is a serious medical emergency that requires prompt and appropriate intervention. Maintenance of adequate vital function with attention to airway, breathing, and circulation; prevention of systemic complications; and rapid termination of seizures must be coupled with investigating and treating any underlying cause. In most patients with SE, the use of adequate dosages of first-line antiepileptic agents allows for the successful and rapid termination of SE and avoidance of potential neurologic complications. Refractory SE requires more aggressive treatment, often the use of intravenous anesthetic agents and intense monitoring, and therefore must be managed in a pediatric intensive care unit with a multidisciplinary approach. Large, controlled, multicenter, comparative studies are needed urgently to clarify better the optimal management of these patients.

Participant characteristics

The mean age of participants in the four trials ranged from 48 years to 55.9 years in the active treatment arms and from 43.8 years to 53 years in the control groups. In all four trials, about half to three-quarters of the participants were male. In three of the included trials, the most common cause of convulsive status epilepticus was a sub-therapeutic level of antiepileptic drugs, while a brain lesion was reported as the most frequent cause in the fourth trial.

Table 2 presents a summary of the characteristics of participants in the four included trials.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^d52d33d5]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) management — treatment stages and timing — uses a staged approach with named phases and explicit timelines. The treatment of SE occurs in stages and is revised to emergent initial therapy, urgent control therapy, and refractory therapy. Definitive control of SE should be established within 60 min of onset. All patients presenting with SE will need emergent initial AED therapy (i.e., 1st line) and urgent control AED therapy (i.e., 2nd line) in addition to AED maintenance therapy, even if SE is immediately controlled. By definition, refractory SE therapy (i.e., 3rd and 4th line) is reserved for those failing the first 2 AEDs administered. If SE is caused by a metabolic disorder (e.g., hypoglycemia), the underlying metabolic disorder should be corrected, in which case maintenance therapy may or may not be necessary. SE patients refractory to initial therapy may be best treated in experienced, high volume centers.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^e0ced407]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus (SE) diagnostics and monitoring — CSD can recur for up to 2 weeks and often appears in status-like waves lasting hours to days, and electrographic seizures on electrocorticography (ECoG) mainly occur in patients with CSD with interactions before or after prolonged seizures, which argues in favor of more prolonged electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The current state-of-the-art diagnosis relies on visually inspecting the raw EEG, and Treiman described a five-stage progression of EEG changes in which SE lasted at least 1 h; however, in "SE EEG Stage III" differentiation from metabolic encephalopathy can be very difficult, there is not universal agreement that SE Stage V is truly ictal, and one study did not verify this sequence reliably in humans. Independent markers remain insufficient because serum prolactin and neuron-specific enolase lack sufficient specificity, while preliminary approaches such as non-linear dynamic analysis and high speed algorithms utilizing quantitative EEG analysis aim for rapid diagnosis with a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity and to allow earlier initiation of treatment even remotely. For coordinated progress and future trials, acceptance of standardized EEG terminology across a network of centers and an NIH-sponsored workshop on SE terminology and operational definitions are proposed.

Table 4 — Prognosis: Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) — mortality at hospital discharge is 23–61%, and at 3 months is 39% in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing propofol with barbiturate infusions; in children with RSE, mortality was reported up to 32%, and a meta-analysis found mortality 20% in symptomatic status epilepticus (SE) and 4% in idiopathic SE. Morbidity includes return to functional baseline seen in 39% of RSE patients at 3 months, and among 13 survivors at discharge, 23% were in a vegetative state, 62% were severely disabled, and 15% were independent but moderately disabled; post-SE epilepsy may be more frequent in long-term survivors with RSE than in those with non-refractory SE (88% vs. 22%), and no child with acute symptomatic RSE returned to baseline. Factors associated with poor outcome after RSE include underlying etiology, older age (e.g., > 50 years), long seizure duration, and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-2 (APACHE-2) scale scores, although one study reported that after correcting for underlying etiology, coma, and type of SE seizure, duration was not associated with outcome.

### Status epilepticus in the neonate [^174b0eeb]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Definition

There is significant variation in the definition of NSE across the world. Recent guidelines from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task force on classification of seizures and epilepsies in the neonateand treatment of seizures in the neonatedo not specifically address the question of what qualifies as NSE and how to manage it. A scoping reviewfrom the ILAE neonatal task force demonstrated a substantial variation in definition of NSE across the literature. The authors propose a neonatal task force to develop a standardised approach to assessing and describing seizure burden and defining NSE.

The ILAE task force on classification of status epilepticusproposed a new conceptual definition with two operational dimensions of time points: t1 indicating when treatment should be initiated and t2 when long-term consequences may appear. Both these time points are based mostly on animal and clinical research of convulsive status epilepticus and provide a basis to find a safe and practical guideline for clinical purposes. t1 and t2 vary by seizure type in this definition. We know that in neonates with seizures, longer seizure durations and greater seizure burden/ictal fraction are associated with lesser response to ASMS, longer hospital stays and adverse neurological consequences. With current knowledge, it is not possible to nominate a t1 and t2 for NSE and this classification with its four axesmay not be appropriate for NSE.

Lack of an accepted definition of a neonatal seizure and NSE creates uncertainty, and a consensus is essential for clinical care guidelines and protocols, epidemiological and clinical research studies, as well as for artificial intelligence (AI) and automated seizure prediction and detection algorithms. Due to the lack of clear guidelines, continued use of the conventional definition of NSE as continuous seizure activity for at least 30 minutes or recurrent seizures for 50% or more of a 1 hour epoch seems sensible.

Table 4 — Prognosis: Convulsive status epilepticus — mortality at hospital discharge is 9–21%, at 30 days 19–27%, and at 90 days 19%; the standardized 10-year mortality ratio is 2.8 in the general population, and in children mortality ranges from 3 to 11% in retrospective series with 3% in a prospective study. Morbidity includes severe neurological or cognitive sequelae 11–16% and deterioration in functional status 23–26%; at 90 days after status epilepticus, 39% had marked functional impairment (glasgow outcome scale score 2–4) and 43% had good recovery (glasgow outcome scale score 5). Factors associated with poor outcome after generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) include underlying etiology, de novo development of SE in hospitalized patients, older age, impairment of consciousness, duration of seizures, at onset focal neurological signs, and the presence of medical complications; mortality is higher (61%) when SE develops de novo in hospitalized patients, and with adequate therapy the mortality may be as low as 8% while it may be as high as 45% with insufficient therapy; adherence to a treatment protocol was associated with better seizure control and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.

### Recent advances in status epilepticus [^11c91029]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of status epilepticus and its current treatment approaches. Many of these have been topics at the 5th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on status epilepticus 2015.

Recent Findings

A new definition and classification of status epilepticus was proposed, which is expected to improve treatment and stimulate research. A better understanding of the failure of seizure suppressing mechanisms and the initiation of self-sustaining seizures begins to translate into the clinical arena. Drugs, such as allopregnanolone, cannabinoids, sec-butylpropylacetamide and valnoctamide, may better target these seizure-perpetuating mechanisms. The concept of combinatorial treatments has further developed, but yet trials in humans are lacking. A new prognostic outcome-score and electroencephalography-criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus are ready for clinical use. Alternative routes, such as intranasal or buccal, have been explored in a number of trials suggesting that intramuscular midazolam is at least as effective as intravenous lorazepam and buccal or intranasal midazolam is at least as effective as rectal diazepam.

Summary

Despite progress in basic science, translation into the clinical field remains difficult. There is hope, that the two large phase III studies in the established and refractory status that started recruitment in 2015 will better inform the clinicians in this emergency situation.

### "T" times: revisiting the timing of neuronal injury in status epilepticus [^05d30870]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

While this study addresses some pressing questions, it raises others. The authors suggest that seizure burden of 10% or greater should merit more aggressive treatment; however, several patients below this cutoff seemed to have neurologic deterioration. The lowest limit of "tolerable" EA remains to be defined. Epileptiform activity beyond simply its presence or absence needs further investigation. The spatial extent of the EA, involvement of specific brain regions, frequency (in Hz) of EEG activity in the EA, the interval between seizures, and other factors related to the EEG findings have not been evaluated in details. All of these may independently impact outcomes.

The 2015 ILAE definition and classification of SE notes that with accumulating research, the definition and classification may need revision. In the near 10 years since its publication, has that time come? The study by Parikh and colleagues is the latest to add to the growing body of evidence that increasing seizure burden leads to worse neurologic outcomes in patients in SE. Increasingly, seizure burden, as a measure EA per hour of cEEG, is being used to define the severity SE. Moreover, while the time point t 2 in NCSE was uncertain in 2015, growing evidence suggests that this may be around 10% to 20% (6–12 minutes per hour). The time point t 2 for other types of SE also bears re-evaluation. Additionally, should the concepts around time point t 1 evolve, especially as it relates to NCSE? Currently, time point t 1 of NCSE is commonly regarded to be between 5 and 10 minutes. This raises the possibility of whether time points t 1 and t 2 could be the same for a particular type of SE, such as NCSE? Finally, should the time points t 1 and t 2 not only depend on the semiology of the SE but also the etiology, with some like acute brain injury being more susceptible to the effects of EA?, The time is right for another reappraisal of our understanding of SE and how aggressively it should be treated.

Treatment benefits exceed risk"; Class IIb states "Strength of evidence/expert opinion about intervention usefulness/ effectiveness is less well established. More data are needed; however, using this treatment when warranted is not unreasonable"; and Class III states "Intervention is not useful or effective and may be harmful. Benefit does not exceed risk". Levels of evidence are defined as A "Adequate evidence is available from multiple, large, randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses", B "Limited evidence is available from less rigorous data, including fewer, smaller randomized trials, nonrandomized studies, and observational analyses", and C "Evidence relies on expert/consensus opinion, case reports, or standard of care".

### Recognizing and preventing epilepsy-related mortality: a call for action [^55f5a7d2]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Should we expand our concept of SUDEP?

Names and classification systems are critical to communicate but can constrain thought and science. SUDEP requires the diagnosis of epilepsy and excludes status epilepticus. We may be missing mild and severe ends of a spectrum that may provide insights into pathophysiology. Children with febrile seizures who die in bed, prone, during a mild illness are not categorized as SUDEP since a child with febrile seizures does not have epilepsy. Yet a 2-year-old child with Dravet syndrome due to an SCN1A mutation and fever-induced seizures has epilepsy. A person who dies immediately after a first seizure is not classified as SUDEP since a single seizure is not epilepsy. We exclude cases of status epilepticus (> 30 minutes duration) from SUDEP, yet ≥ 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity is the current practical definition for status epilepticus. There mechanisms of death from status epilepticus in the hospital (often iatrogenic) differ from those at home. Instead of viewing prolonged or repetitive seizures (status epilepticus) distinct from SUDEP, a careful study of the temporal pattern of physiologic changes during seizures that range in duration could provide clues to SUDEP mechanisms. Excluding febrile and first afebrile seizures and status epilepticus may honor an arbitrary definition but bury a mountain of data and clues. Seizure duration is a continuous variable. Prolonged seizures may be the most informative about SUDEP mechanisms. Excluding them from study will ensure we never find out. Among patients whose SUDEPs were recorded on video EEG, most had 2 or more convulsive seizures during the 24 hours before death, and several had multiple seizures in sleep without regaining consciousness between seizures. In Dravet syndrome, SUDEP and status epilepticus are the 2 leading causes of death. Since most SUDEPs occur in sleep and are unwitnessed, how many actually follow status epilepticus? Whether we define status as 5, 15, or 30 minutes, or how much awareness must be regained between seizures is not critical. The border between SUDEP and death due to status is fluid. We should study how seizure intensity, duration, and number interact with an individual's environmental, medical, neurologic, genetic, and epigenetic background to modify risk of death.

### Seizure-induced neuronal injury: animal data [^9bc5aa7a]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

One of the oldest questions in epilepsy is whether seizures are a cause or a result of brain damage. Animal data have provided us with insights into the relationship between seizures and subsequent brain damage. It is now recognized that seizures can be caused by brain injury and that, in certain conditions, can cause brain damage. Whether seizures result in brain damage depends on a number of variables, including age of the animal, seizure type and duration, etiology of the seizures, and genetic substrate on which the seizures occur. Seizures lasting for hours can cause injury to the brain regardless of whether they are generalized or focal in onset. The cell loss that occurs after the seizure is secondary to excessive excitability, with seizures causing massive depolarization of neurons leading to excessive glutamate release. This glutamate release results in increased intracellular calcium, causing a cascade of changes that ultimately result in cell death. Hypoxia and ischemia can exacerbate the injury. However, even in animals that are well ventilated and oxygenated, prolonged seizures can lead to cell loss and subsequent reorganization of synaptic networks. Although prolonged seizures at any age can result in cell loss, the immature brain fares much better than the mature brain with regard to cell loss after a prolonged seizure. Evidence that prolonged seizures result in neuronal loss is firmly established. It is less clear how detrimental recurrent seizures are. Although cell loss and synaptic reorganization have been reported in recurrent seizure models, such as kindling, it is generally modest compared to status epilepticus. When seizure-induced changes do occur, the pathologic patterns in the brain differ from those in status epilepticus.

### Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: clinical features and diagnostic challenges [^68010eb3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

NCSE, once thought to be a rare disorder, should be considered in any patient presenting with an alteration in mental status of indeterminate cause. The psychiatrist needs to be aware of the different clinical characteristics of this disorder as well as similarities and differences from psychiatric disorders. A history of seizure is not necessary for the diagnosis, nor is motor activity necessarily associated with NCSE. An EEG is required to confirm the diagnosis and should be performed when possible, because early recognition and treatment may improve outcome. There is usually a good response to an intravenous benzodiazepine; when response has been delayed, other anticonvulsants have been used as adjuncts. The EEG is necessary to distinguish AS from CPS so that, when indicated, the proper long-term antiepileptic drug therapy can be started. Although NCSE has been described in the literature for many years, there is still a great need for carefully designed prospective studies to help define clear guidelines to assist in clinical and management decision making and, ultimately, to improve outcomes.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^8040ca0c]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Two review authors (MC, MI) independently screened all citations identified by the search strategies, retrieved and assessed for eligibility all potentially relevant full-text articles. The same review authors extracted data on study design, participants characteristics (number of participants in each group, demographic information), characteristics of intervention (provider, dose, and route of administration), and comparator intervention. The risk of bias of included trials was assessed by the same review authors using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2). Each risk of bias domain was assessed separately for objective and subjective outcomes. For the risk-of-bias assessment, we categorised seizure cessation, recurrence of seizure, and respiratory depression (without ventilation) as subjective outcomes and mortality and respiratory depression (requiring ventilation) as objective outcomes.

At all stages of the study selection and data collection process, disagreement between reviewers was resolved by consensus or referred to a third review author (CC or MB).

Data synthesis

We planned to conduct random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses; however, due to the limited number of identified trials and their heterogeneity in terms of treatment comparisons and reported outcomes, this proved unfeasible. We also considered conducting a systematic review of economic evaluations but failed to identify sufficient evidence in the current literature. Results of each included study were tabulated and summarised narratively for each outcome.

### Guidelines for the evaluation and management of status epilepticus [^e5f88fdd]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Medium credibility.

Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) — definition, phenotypes, and manifestations are described as seizure activity seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) without clinical findings associated with GCSE; two distinct phenotypes include the "wandering confused" patient presenting to the emergency department with a relatively good prognosis or chronic epileptic syndromes, and the acutely ill patient with severely impaired mental status with or without subtle motor movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation in the setting of acute brain injury; for these guidelines the focus is on the acutely ill patient with impaired mental status, a type that frequently follows uncontrolled GCSE and is often encountered in the intensive care setting; the semiological spectrum is highly variable with negative symptoms including an increase in confusion, aphasia, lethargy, and staring, and positive symptoms including agitation/aggression, automatisms, blinking, crying, delirium, delusions, echolalia, facial twitching, laughter, nausea/vomiting, nystagmus/eye deviation, perseveration, psychosis, and tremulousness.

### How and whom to monitor for seizures in an ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5a45fd64]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To pool prevalence of nonconvulsive seizure, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and epileptiform activity detected by different electroencephalography types in critically ills and to compare detection rates among them.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (via PubMed) and SCOPUS (via Scopus) STUDY SELECTION:: Any type of study was eligible if studies were done in adult critically ill, applied any type of electroencephalography, and reported seizure rates. Case reports and case series were excluded.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted independently by two investigators. Separated pooling of prevalence of nonconvulsive seizure/nonconvulsive status epilepticus/epileptiform activity and odds ratio of detecting outcomes among different types of electroencephalography was performed using random-effect models. This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and also adhered to the Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Quality of evidence was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for observational studies and Cochrane methods for randomized controlled trial studies.

Data Synthesis

A total of 78 (16,707 patients) and eight studies (4,894 patients) were eligible for pooling prevalence and odds ratios. For patients with mixed cause of admission, the pooled prevalence of nonconvulsive seizure, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, either nonconvulsive seizure or nonconvulsive status epilepticus detected by routine electroencephalography was 3.1%, 6.2%, and 6.3%, respectively. The corresponding prevalence detected by continuous electroencephalography monitoring was 17.9%, 9.1%, and 15.6%, respectively. In addition, the corresponding prevalence was high in post convulsive status epilepticus (33.5%, 20.2%, and 32.9%), CNS infection (23.9%, 18.1%, and 23.9%), and post cardiac arrest (20.0%, 17.3%, and 22.6%). The pooled conditional log odds ratios of nonconvulsive seizure/nonconvulsive status epilepticus detected by continuous electroencephalography versus routine electroencephalography from studies with paired data 2.57 (95% CI, 1.11–5.96) and pooled odds ratios from studies with independent data was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.00–2.47).

Conclusions

Prevalence of seizures detected by continuous electroencephalography was significantly higher than with routine electroencephalography. Prevalence was particularly high in post convulsive status epilepticus, CNS infection, and post cardiac arrest.

### Status epilepticus in the neonate [^a5a56010]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Status epilepticus in the neonate (NSE) is a medical emergency that often results in dire consequences. Minimising injury from NSE is essential. The diagnosis of NSE can be challenging as neonates frequently have electrographic only seizures and an EEG is essential for recognition of seizures and seizure burden. The lack of a universally accepted definition of NSE, possible adverse effects from commonly used antiseizure medications, debate regarding the best treatment packages for NSE, limited access to EEG and investigations for aetiology of NSE add to the clinical conundrum. In this review, we aim to present what is known, highlight the importance of EEG monitoring for diagnosis and treatment, discuss what is not known and suggest a practical paradigm for the management of NSE.

### Inflammatory processes, febrile seizures, and subsequent epileptogenesis [^278f1829]. Epilepsy Currents (2014). Low credibility.

Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common type of seizures in infants and preschool children. Inflammatory mediators, which are known triggers of fever, have also been implicated as contributors to the onset of these seizures. Evidence that inflammation is present following FS and during established epilepsy suggests that it could also influence epileptogenesis. However, the potential involvement of inflammatory mediators to the epileptogenic process that may follow prolonged FS has yet to be fully determined. This article reviews the current state of our knowledge and major gaps that remain by focusing on four questions: Does inflammation contribute to the generation of FS? Does prolonged FS or febrile status epilepticus (SE) cause temporal lobe epilepsy in the absence of predisposing factors? Does inflammation contribute to the process by which febrile SE causes limbic epilepsy? And finally, can inflammation be a foundation for biomarkers and therapy for FS-induced epileptogenesis?

### Status epilepticus [^b549191b]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency defined as a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes. This is the most common neurologic emergency in children, and it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Initial seizure management focuses on stabilization of the patient, followed by medication to terminate the seizure. Benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, valproic acid and other antiseizure medications can effectively halt status epilepticus. There is a narrow but important differential diagnosis, including prolonged psychogenic nonepileptic seizure, status dystonicus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Focused laboratory testing, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography can be useful in the evaluation of status epilepticus. Sequelae include focal neurologic deficits, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems. Pediatricians play an important role in the early recognition and treatment of status epilepticus, thereby preventing the acute and chronic harm that can be associated with status epilepticus.
