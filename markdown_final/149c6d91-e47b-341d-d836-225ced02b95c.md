## Question

Of the students attending a school athletic event, 80% of the boys were dressed in the school colors, 60% of the girls were dressed in the school colors, and 45% of the students were girls. Find the percentage of students attending the event who were wearing the school colors.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of students attending a school athletic event were wearing the school colors, given that 80% of boys, 60% of girls, and 45% of the total students are girls. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to set up the problem with a concrete total number of students. Then, I should calculate the number of girls and boys from the overall percentage. Next, I will compute how many girls and how many boys are wearing school colors. After that, I should add those counts to get the total in school colors. Finally, I will divide by the total students and express the result as a percentage, making sure to double-check the arithmetic at each step.

> Let me first confirm the setup. Assuming a total of 100 students makes the percentages straightforward to work with, so I'll use 100 as the base and then verify that the final percentage is independent of this choice. With 45% girls, that means 45 girls and therefore 55 boys, since 100 − 45 = 55. Wait, let me verify that subtraction: yes, 55 boys is correct.

> Next, I should calculate how many girls are wearing school colors. 60% of 45 girls is 0.60 × 45 = 27 girls. Hold on, I should double-check that multiplication: 0.60 × 45 equals 27, which is correct.

> Now, I will calculate how many boys are wearing school colors. 80% of 55 boys is 0.80 × 55 = 44 boys. Let me verify: 0.80 × 55 is indeed 44, so that checks out.

> I will now examine the total number of students wearing school colors by adding the girls and boys in colors: 27 girls + 44 boys = 71 students. I should confirm the addition: 27 + 44 is 71, which is correct.

> Finally, I need to compute the overall percentage in school colors. Total in colors divided by total students is 71 ÷ 100 = 0.71, which is 71%. But wait, what if I had chosen a different total, say 1,000 students? Let me reconsider: 450 girls and 550 boys would yield 270 girls in colors and 440 boys in colors, totaling 710, and 710 ÷ 1,000 is still 71%, so the percentage is robust to the assumed total.

> The answer is 71% of students were wearing the school colors.

---

The percentage of students wearing school colors is **71%**. This is calculated by finding the weighted average of boys and girls in school colors: 80% of boys (who make up 55% of students) plus 60% of girls (who make up 45% of students) equals 0.80 × 0.55 + 0.60 × 0.45 = 0.44 + 0.27 = 0.71, or 71%.

---

## Step-by-step solution

Let the total number of students be **100** for simplicity.

- **Number of girls**: 45% of 100 = 45
- **Number of boys**: 100 − 45 = 55

Now, calculate how many students in each group are wearing school colors:

- **Girls wearing school colors**: 60% of 45 = 0.60 × 45 = 27
- **Boys wearing school colors**: 80% of 55 = 0.80 × 55 = 44

Total students wearing school colors = 27 + 44 = **71**.

Therefore, the percentage of students wearing school colors is **71%**.

---

## Verification using algebra

Let the total number of students be **N**.

- **Number of girls**: 0.45N
- **Number of boys**: 0.55N

Students wearing school colors:

- **Girls**: 0.60 × 0.45N = 0.27N
- **Boys**: 0.80 × 0.55N = 0.44N

Total wearing school colors = 0.27N + 0.44N = **0.71N**.

Thus, the percentage is **71%**, confirming the result.

---

The percentage of students wearing school colors is **71%**.

### Two years of school-based intervention program could improve the physical fitness among ecuadorian adolescents at health risk: subgroups analysis from a cluster-randomized trial [^841f1b4a]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The individual strategy included the delivery of educational package organized at classroom level to promote healthy diet and an active lifestyle. This strategy was implemented through classes for all students in the selected grades and was delivered by volunteering teachers of life sciences of the schools and research staff. The following key messages related to physical activity behavior were tackled in two out of 13 chapters of the educational package: i) be active for at least 60 min per day, ii) spend maximum 2 h per day on sedentary behavior and iii) ways to overcome the barriers for physical activity (Table 1). The other 11 chapters of the educational package focused on the promotion of a healthy diet.

The environmental strategy included three main activities: (i) Workshops for parents that were parallel to the classes with adolescents and covered similar topics (e.g. be active for at least 60 min per day, spend maximum 2 h per day on sedentary behavior and ways to overcome the barriers for physical activity). The parental workshop lasted one hour and consisted of a slide show presentation followed by a session of questions of parents. (ii) Organization of social events such an interactive pep talks with famous young sportsmen. During a one-hour session, an athlete shared her/his personal sport experiences and gave advice on healthy diet, active lifestyle and physical activity. One session per school was organized. (iii) Environmental modification that consistent of providing a walking trail in each school. Walking trails were drawn on the playground and three posters were suspended on the walls along the walking trails to encourage the adolescents to walk more during recess. Additionally, full color posters of young sportsmen, the ACTVITAL logo and key message regarding physical activity were suspended on the classroom walls and in the front of the food shops. In addition, regular meetings with schoolteachers, school management and students were held to assess progress and coordinate the intervention activities (Table 1).

Both the intervention and control schools received the standard school curriculum as determined by the Ecuadorian government, which allocates 80 min of physical education classes per week (2 school sessions). The mandatory physical education curriculum was mainly geared at increasing sports skills and was implemented in all schools by the schoolteachers.

### Children's moderate to vigorous physical activity attending summer day camps [^bca75277]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

National physical activity standards call for all children to accumulate 60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The contribution of summer day camps toward meeting this benchmark is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to provide estimates of children's MVPA during summer day camps.

Methods

Children (n = 1,061, 78% enrollment; mean age, 7.8 years; 46% female; 65% African American; 48% normal weight) from 20 summer day camps wore ActiGraph GT3x+ accelerometers on the wrist during camp hours for up to 4 non-consecutive days over the summer of 2015 (July). Accumulated MVPA at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the distribution was estimated using random-effects quantile regression. All models were estimated separately for boys and girls and controlled for wear time. Minutes of MVPA were dichotomized to ≥ 60 minutes/day of MVPA or < 60 minutes/day to estimate percentage of boys and girls meeting the 60 minutes/day guideline. All data were analyzed in spring 2016.

Results

Across the 20 summer day camps, boys (n = 569) and girls (n = 492) accumulated a median of 96 and 82 minutes/day of MVPA, respectively. The percentage of children meeting 60 minutes/day of MVPA was 80% (range, 41%-94%) for boys and 73% (range, 30%-97%) for girls.

Conclusions

Summer day camps are a setting where a large portion of boys and girls meet daily physical activity guidelines. Public health practitioners should focus efforts on making summer day camps accessible for children in the U.S.

### Sports contribute to total moderate to vigorous physical activity in school children [^bef45d7b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Table 1 describes PA levels in participants. At the baseline measurement, the mean age was 8.5 yr for primary schoolchildren and 13.6 yr for adolescents (Table 1). In both measurement periods, the mean valid wear time per day was longer than 12 h in both age-groups, and the number of measurement days were similar in boys and girls. Primary schoolchildren spent approximately 2 h less SB per day and almost about 50 and 20 min·d⁻¹ more LPA and MVPA, respectively, compared with adolescents. At baseline, 74% of children (6–10 yr) and 37% of adolescents (11–17 yr) met the recommendation of at least 60 min MVPA per day. In particular, adolescent girls spent the least time in MVPA at baseline and follow-up measurement. In both, baseline and follow-up, younger children engaged more frequently (1.1–1.9 d) and longer (120–155 min) in PE per week, compared with adolescents who engaged an average of 0.6 and 0.8 d and 115 and 117 min in PE per week. Although the number of OYS days per week was similar in both age-groups, the weekly duration of OYS was about 80 min longer among adolescents compared with children.

TABLE 1
Age, wear time, and PA values (mean and SD) in children and adolescents (N = 339).

Of all 3656 measured days, no sports activities were reported for 67% and 76% of the days in primary schoolchildren and adolescents, respectively. PE was reported on 17% of all days across both age-groups. The lowest proportion of active time (sum of LPA and MVPA) as well as the highest proportion of average daily SB occurred on days without any sports activities with the average daily SB proportion ranging from 67% in primary school boys to 81% in adolescent girls (Table 2). By contrast, proportions of SB were lower (59%–68%) on days with PE and OYS in boys and girls of both age-groups. Compared with days without sports activities, PE and OYS increased daily MVPA values to similar extents for boys and girls in both age-groups.

### 'Physical activity 4 everyone' school-based intervention to prevent decline in adolescent physical activity levels: 12 month (mid-intervention) report on a cluster randomised trial [^e13ccc3a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Changes in physical activity from baseline to follow-up across subgroups (sex, baseline weight status and baseline activity level)

The subgroup interaction term indicated time by intervention effects that differed by subgroup for each variable: sex (p ≤ 0.01), baseline weight status (p = ≤ 0.01) and baseline physical activity status (p = ≤ 0.01); therefore subgroup analyses were progressed for each. The 12-month physical activity analyses by subgroup are reported in table 3. A greater effect was observed in male students in the intervention group compared with the control group on mean minutes of MVPA per day (6.47 min (1.24 to 12.95), p = 0.02) and percentage of wear time spent in MVPA (0.9%, p = 0.02). No significant differences between groups for females were observed at 12-month follow-up. There were no detected differences between intervention and control based on weight status or activity level detected.

Table 3
Changes in physical activity from baseline to follow-up (12 months) by subgroup (gender, weight status at baseline and activity level at baseline) (Mean minutes of MVPA per day, % wear time in MVPA, % meeting physical activity guidelines)

Process measures

Table 4 outlines process evaluation data collected from teachers and students at 12-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 95.5% of teachers reported using pedometers to increase activity levels in PE, 70.3% reported incorporating student personal physical activity plans each term and providing feedback to students on these plans, and 75% reported the school offered organised physical activity at recess and/or lunchtimes, at least twice per week. The school change agent records showed that all schools had started use of the pedometers in PE classes, with four of the five schools (80%) using them with the desired frequency (figure 1). Similarly, while all schools had administered student physical activity plans at least once, three (60%) had administered these as per the desired termly standard (2 or 3 per student). All schools had implemented recess and/or lunch activities at least once per week, and four (80%) had these implemented at least twice per week. All schools had provided parents with additional information regarding physical activity via newsletters and the school website with the requested termly frequency.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^35f1e6bb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. The distribution of potential confounding variables was similar between groups. We minimised bias from seasonal effects and school events by making the observations over several weeks, and repeated measurements during lunch time minimised varied patterns of use across the lunch break between schools. Because two intervention schools did not receive a shade sail, the intention to treat analysis may have underestimated the effect if the intervention was implemented in all schools.

One limitation was that many study sites were under-used for at least part of the lunch time, which may reflect several factors. A major criterion for selecting study sites was that they were well used areas in the main activity centres of the schools. However, we selected the sites in winter and patterns of use may have been different in the warmer months. Further research is needed to establish what type of areas in schools are well used and attractive to students for passive recreation where shade sails might be built. The intervention sites included a range of features that might be more or less attractive to students and, for example, included seating or tables; grass, bitumen, or paving ground surfaces; and nearby garden beds and sports fields. That the effects were found despite this variation in features of sites was encouraging. The findings that students' use of the shaded sites at intervention schools increased whereas use of the alternative full sun sites was steady implies that at least some attraction of students from other areas in the schools to at least one study site occurred. We recruited schools with limited shade, so we expect that migration of students to these sites would mainly be from other unshaded areas in the schools. If migration occurred from pre-existing shaded areas it would highlight that the type of shade provided by shade sails was more attractive than other shade provided by trees and buildings.

Moreover, although the shade sails were relatively large (46–120 m²), on average only six students used them. Friendship groups might avoid encroaching on other students' space, limiting the optimal use of shade sails. Further research might examine whether factors such as seating arrangements, as well as size of sails, might maximise use. If friendship groups were limiting, building multiple shade sails within a school would be valuable.

### An intervention to increase students' physical activity: a 2-year pilot study [^7472431b]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Schools are called upon to provide children with 30 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Most school-based physical activity interventions have not targeted schools that serve children from low-income families. This study evaluated the effects of a pilot, competency-building professional development program on the school day MVPA and total activity (light- to vigorous-intensity activity) of students from schools that serve low-income families.

Study Design

Single group intervention with multiple follow-up repeated cross-sectional measures.

Setting/Participants

Students attending eight elementary schools in one low-income school district serving 3,719 students.

Intervention

Participatory-based, experiential, competency-building professional development workshop for physical education and classroom teachers. Baseline was fall 2015, and the intervention was delivered during spring 2016 through spring 2017.

Main Outcome Measures

Hip-placed accelerometers were used to derive the percentage of children accumulating 30 minutes of MVPA during the school day, minutes of MVPA, and time spent sedentary. Analyses were conducted during July 2017.

Results

A total of 1,570 first- and fourth-grade students (49.8% girls, 87.0% African American, 88% free and reduced-price lunch) were measured across the project. Primary analyses indicated that the percentage of girls and boys meeting the 30-minutes/day guideline increased by 9.3% (95% CI = 4.7%, 13.9%) and 10.4% (95% CI = 5.5%, 15.3%), respectively. A corresponding increase of 1.7 (95% CI = 0.5, 2.8) and 2.5 (95% CI = 1.1, 3.8) MVPA minutes accumulated during the school day were observed for both girls and boys, respectively. Primary analyses indicated that statistically significant increases in MVPA and total activity for boys and girls were observed across the school day, during classroom time, and during physical education.

Conclusions

Participatory-based, experiential, competency-building professional development is an effective strategy for increasing students' MVPA and total activity in low-income schools. However, data from this study indicate that targeting settings outside of the school day may be more appropriate given that schools were providing more than two thirds of the recommended 30 minutes/day of MVPA prior to intervention.

### School-based physical activity programs for promoting physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 [^326c8473]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Physical activity among children and adolescents is associated with lower adiposity, improved cardio-metabolic health, and improved fitness. Worldwide, fewer than 30% of children and adolescents meet global physical activity recommendations of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day. Schools may be ideal sites for interventions given that children and adolescents in most parts of the world spend a substantial amount of time in transit to and from school or attending school.

Objectives

The purpose of this review update is to summarise the evidence on effectiveness of school-based interventions in increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity and improving fitness among children and adolescents 6 to 18 years of age. Specific objectives are:

- to evaluate the effects of school-based interventions on increasing physical activity and improving fitness among children and adolescents;
- to evaluate the effects of school-based interventions on improving body composition; and
- to determine whether certain combinations or components (or both) of school-based interventions are more effective than others in promoting physical activity and fitness in this target population.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BIOSIS, SPORTDiscus, and Sociological Abstracts to 1 June 2020, without language restrictions. We screened reference lists of included articles and relevant systematic reviews. We contacted primary authors of studies to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Eligible interventions were relevant to public health practice (i.e. were not delivered by a clinician), were implemented in the school setting, and aimed to increase physical activity among all school-attending children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18) for at least 12 weeks. The review was limited to randomised controlled trials. For this update, we have added two new criteria: the primary aim of the study was to increase physical activity or fitness, and the study used an objective measure of physical activity or fitness. Primary outcomes included proportion of participants meeting physical activity guidelines and duration of moderate to vigorous physical activity and sedentary time (new to this update). Secondary outcomes included measured body mass index (BMI), physical fitness, health-related quality of life (new to this update), and adverse events (new to this update). Television viewing time, blood cholesterol, and blood pressure have been removed from this update. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors used standardised forms to assess each study for relevance, to extract data, and to assess risk of bias. When discrepancies existed, discussion occurred until consensus was reached. Certainty of evidence was assessed according to GRADE. A random-effects meta-analysis based on the inverse variance method was conducted with participants stratified by age (children versus adolescents) when sufficient data were reported. Subgroup analyses explored effects by intervention type.

Main Results

Based on the three new inclusion criteria, we excluded 16 of the 44 studies included in the previous version of this review. We screened an additional 9968 titles (search October 2011 to June 2020), of which 978 unique studies were potentially relevant and 61 met all criteria for this update. We included a total of 89 studies representing complete data for 66,752 study participants. Most studies included children only (n = 56), followed by adolescents only (n = 22), and both (n = 10); one study did not report student age. Multi-component interventions were most common (n = 40), followed by schooltime physical activity (n = 19), enhanced physical education (n = 15), and before and after school programmes (n = 14); one study explored both enhanced physical education and an after school programme. Lack of blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors and loss to follow-up were the most common sources of bias. Results show that school-based physical activity interventions probably result in little to no increase in time engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity (mean difference (MD) 0.73 minutes/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 1.30; 33 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and may lead to little to no decrease in sedentary time (MD -3.78 minutes/d, 95% CI -7.80 to 0.24; 16 studies; low-certainty evidence). School-based physical activity interventions may improve physical fitness reported as maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max) (MD 1.19 mL/kg/min, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.82; 13 studies; low-certainty evidence). School-based physical activity interventions may result in a very small decrease in BMI z-scores (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02; 21 studies; low-certainty evidence) and may not impact BMI expressed as kg/m² (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.01; 50 studies; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether school-based physical activity interventions impact health-related quality of life or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the variability of results and the overall small effects, school staff and public health professionals must give the matter considerable thought before implementing school-based physical activity interventions. Given the heterogeneity of effects, the risk of bias, and findings that the magnitude of effect is generally small, results should be interpreted cautiously.

### Missing school days following sport-related concussion in high school athletes [^da976cc8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Sport-related concussions (SRC) can significantly impact students' attendance and academic performance, highlighting the importance of gradual return-to-learn protocols for recovery. Understanding the association between missed school days and recovery, especially across genders, is vital for effective concussion management in high school athletes.

Objectives

To describe missed school days in high school athletes with SRC and to determine associations between missed school days and authorized clearance to return to competition; secondarily, to determine whether school days missed differed by gender.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cohort study among student athletes participating in athletics sponsored by the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) during academic years 2015 to 2023. SRC was a participant eligibility criterion and was defined as a head injury during participation in a MHSAA-sanctioned event. Data were analyzed from August 2015 to June 2023.

Exposures

Primary exposure was missed school days; additional exposures included gender, year of season, concussion history, event type, sport level, contact level, and athletic trainer involvement.

Main Outcome and Measure

The primary outcome was time to full unrestricted clearance following SRC.

Results

The analysis included a total of 20 934 individuals with SRC (13 869 boys [66.25%]). Gender (χ²₃ = 167.40; P < .001), season (χ²₂₁ = 57.41; P < .001), event type (χ²₃ = 99.29; P < .001), sport level (χ²₉ = 68.15; P < .001), contact level (χ²₆ = 56.73; P < .001), and initial evaluation (χ²₃ = 147.13; P < .001) were independently associated with missed school days. Athletes took a median (IQR) of 11 (7–16) days to return to full unrestricted clearance. Relative to no missed school days, there was a significant mean increase of 57% (incidence rate ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.52–1.62) in time to full unrestricted clearance for 3 or more missed school days. The estimated mean days to return to sport were 12.15 (95% CI, 12.00–12.30) for 0 missed school days, 12.68 (95% CI, 12.39–12.96) for 1 missed school day, 15.47 (95% CI, 15.06–15.87) for 2 missed school days, and 19.08 (95% CI, 18.55–19.62) for 3 or more missed school days.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that high school athletes typically missed 2 or fewer school days after SRC, suggesting that concussion management teams adhered to current recommendations of 24 to 48 hours of initial rest. The dose association, with more missed school days associated with slower return to play, suggests athletes' missing more school days (eg, ≥ 3) may be associated with severity of concussion and warrant additional support to return to school and/or sport.

### Rise in childhood obesity with persistently high rates of undernutrition among urban school-aged indo-Asian children [^7ff06847]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Physical activity in the Karachi survey

Data on physical activity were collected for 1669 children (table 3). The median daily amount of time when children were physically active in Karachi was just over half an hour, with boys being more than twice as active as girls (55 minutes (IQR 13, 120 minutes) versus 25 minutes (IQR 0,60 minutes) respectively). Over 20% of children (boys 16% (95% CI 13% to 20%) and girls 27% (95% CI 21% to 32%)) did no exercise either in or out of school.

Table 3
Total physical activity among children aged 5–14 years in Karachi

About 66% (95% CI 52% to 80%) of school-attending children reported participating in no organised sport within school, and for those that did, it was usually for 30 minutes or less per school day (33% (95% CI (20% to 47%) of children). Although 65% (95% CI 58% to 72%) of children reported other exercise in school, the majority (58% (95% CI 52% to 64%)) did less than 30 minutes of this type of activity.

Overall 29% (95% CI 25% to 36%) of children did no exercise out of school (boys 21% (95% CI 17% to 26%), girls 36% (95% CI 31% to 41%)), and only 24% (95% CI 20% to 28%) did more than 1 hour of out of school exercise (boys 30% (95% CI 25% to 36%), girls 17% (95% CI 14% to 20%)).

The amount of physical activity decreased with age, particularly after the age of 9 for girls and 11 for boys. The median time spent watching television was 120 minutes per day, interquartile range (60,180 minutes). There is little variation by age or gender, 5–6 year olds watched somewhat less television (median 60 minutes (IQR (30,120)), whereas girls aged 13 to 14 years watched somewhat more (median 150 minutes (IQR (90, 240 minutes)).

### Soccer injuries in children and adolescents [^27d1a7e9]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric soccer — dental injuries and mouth guards — incidence data indicate 0.06 and 0.11 dental injuries per 10 000 athlete exposures in boys' and girls' high school soccer, respectively, with reports also citing 0.2% of all high school athletic injuries; studies note that custom-made mouth guards confer better protection than "boil and bite" types and that simply wearing mouth guards can significantly decrease the frequency and severity of orofacial injuries in contact sports.

### Injury incidence among middle school students aged 13–15 years in 47 low-income and middle-income countries [^22734246]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

A total of 95811 students aged 13-15years participated in nationally representative Global School-based Student Health Surveys (GSHS) in 47 low-income and middle-income countries conducted between 2003 and 2012. On average, about 40% of the participants in each country reported at least one injury in the past year that was serious enough to cause the student to miss at least one full day of usual activities (such as school, sports and a job) or to require treatment by a healthcare professional. In 40 of the 47 countries, boys reported a significantly higher injury rate than girls. Based on these numbers, injuries likely cause approximately four million days of school absence by lower secondary school students annually. Most of these injuries are preventable.

### Addressing mental health needs of NCAA student-athletes of colour: foundational concepts from the NCAA summit on diverse student-athlete mental health and well-being [^7b2b18e7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We sought to identify concepts that may facilitate National Collegiate Athletic Association efforts to assist member institutions in addressing the mental health needs of student-athletes of colour. A two-step process was followed to generate and refine concepts, guided by Delphi methodology. First, a scoping review was conducted, including original peer-reviewed research articles that quantified or qualitatively described determinant(s) of racial or ethnic differences in athlete mental health or mental healthcare. Next, a multiday virtual meeting was facilitated to review the results of the scoping review, discuss lived experiences and generate potential concepts. Participants included a racially and ethnically diverse group of student-athletes, medical and mental health professionals, athletics administrators, diversity, equity and inclusion experts, health educators and representatives from leading organisations involved in athlete mental health. Through the consensus process, participants identified 42 concepts that member institutions might consider implementing on their campuses. Concepts were largely focused on organisational policies and practices such as staffing diversity and inclusion, expanded options for clinical support (ie, identity-relevant support groups) and within-organisation accountability. Concepts related to specific areas for stakeholder education were also identified. Institutions have the potential to play an important role in supporting the mental well being of student-athletes of colour, and the present concepts can help inform institutional action. While concepts proposed are believed to be broadly relevant across athletics settings, they would need to be further considered and tailored to reflect setting-specific organisational structures, resources and needs.

### Socioeconomic factors and outcomes from exercise-related sudden cardiac arrest in high school student-athletes in the USA [^22a5a88d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Resuscitation details

Resuscitation and defibrillation details are shown in online supplemental table 2. The SCA event was witnessed in 107 (96%) cases. The administration of bystander CPR was confirmed in 88 (79%) cases and unknown in 23 (21%) cases. In cases where bystander CPR was performed, 80% (70/88) of athletes survived. An AT was on-site at the time of SCA in 46 (41%) cases, not on-site in 5 (5%) cases, and the presence of an AT on-site was unknown in 60 (54%) cases. In cases where an AT was confirmed on-site at the time of SCA, 83% (38/46) of athletes survived.

An on-site AED was available at 65 (59%) schools where the SCA event occurred and used in 61 (55%) of the total cases. If an on-site AED was used in the resuscitation, 85% (52/61) of cases survived. Information on defibrillator use by the responding EMS was difficult to obtain. Defibrillator use by EMS was confirmed in 14 cases with 9/14 (64%) surviving, not used in 29 cases in which an on-site AED was already used and the athlete survived, and unknown in 68 cases.

### Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1. 6 million participants [^a241fb0b]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Results

We included 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas (appendix 3 pp 2–9), representing 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years (81·3% of the global population of adolescents of this age). Data availability rose with country income, from 8 (26%) of 31 low-income countries with data available to 56 (75%) of 75 high-income countries with data available. Regional data availability ranged from 16 (30%) of 53 countries with data in Sub-Saharan Africa to 6 (100%) of 6 countries in south Asia (table 1).

Table 1
Distribution of data sources across income groups and regions

73 (50%) of 146 countries, territories, and areas with data (ie, 31·6% of all 231 countries globally) had trend data, defined as data from at least 2 different years between 2001 and 2016. Trend-data availability increased with country income and ranged across regions from no countries with trend data in south Asia to 14 (70%) of 20 countries in central and eastern Europe (table 1). Data availability was relatively evenly distributed across time, with 91 (31%) of 298 surveys from 2006 or earlier, 104 (35%) from 2007–2011, and 103 (35%) from 2012 or later (appendix 3 pp 2–9).

More than four in five school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active in 2016 (81·0% [95% UI 77·8–87·7]). Between 2001 and 2016, prevalence decreased by 2·5 percentage points (significant change) for boys (from 80·1% [78·3–81·6] to 77·6% [76·1–80·4]), whereas there was no significant change for girls (from 85·1% [83·1–88·0] to 84·7% [83·0–88·2]; figure 1), leading to a significant global difference of 7·1 percentage points in insufficient activity between sexes in 2016. If these trends continue, the global target of a 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity will not be met by 2030.

### Sports specialization and intensive training in young athletes [^81ca8fcc]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Youth sports participation — epidemiology and background: According to a national report, 60 million youth aged 6 through 18 years participated in organized sports, an increase from 45 million in 1997. The sex ratio has remained constant, with 66% of young athletes being male and 34% being female. Of the 60 million young athletes reported, 27% participated in only 1 sport. Participation by children aged ≤ 6 years increased from 6% in 1997 to 12% in 2008. Unfortunately, 70% of children drop out of organized sports by 13 years of age. According to the 2013–2014 high school athletics participation survey, 7.8 million high school students participated in sports.

### Sexual harassment and abuse among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students: a prospective study [^ab0f3c18]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Gender differences

Without considering which setting the harassment took place, our finding that a higher percentage of girls reported SHA compared with boys supports hypothesis 1 and is comparable to other studies in young athletes and young nonathletes. Despite the historical point of view that girls report more SHA than boys, researchers have recently questioned if this gender difference mirrors the true situation, or whether it may be due to underreport and taboo of disclosure among boys, or different perceptions regarding what constitutes SHA and its consequences. Boys may perceive the situation as less harmful than girls and thereby not report it. Others have argued that girls may worry that sexual teasing and SH from boys can lead to more harmful behaviors like SA, and feel more threatened or affected by such behaviors, thereby reporting more SHA than boys. At the other side, the fact that no gender differences in SHA were found in the school and sport settings at T1, but girls had a higher prevalence of SHA in the free time setting at T1, supports Bendixen and Kennair's considerations that girls seem to have a positive effect of adults' presence and protectiveness. Adult appearance operates more in school and sports than during the adolescents' free time. Other studies in young athletes and young nonathletes did not find any difference in the prevalence of SHA between boys and girls.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^1863557f]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Return to learn after sports-related concussion — school reintegration and accommodations include actions to facilitate communication and transition back to school, notify school personnel after injury to prepare for return to school, designate a point person to monitor the student's status and communicate with the medical team, and adjust the schedule to accommodate reduced or modified attendance if needed; classroom adjustments include breaks as needed during the school day and allowing increased time for completion of assignments and testing; school environment adjustments include allowing the use of headphones/ear plugs to reduce noise sensitivity, limiting the use of electronic screens or adjusting screen settings, including font size, as needed, and avoiding busy, crowded, or noisy environments such as music room, hallways, lunch room, vocational classes, and assemblies. Clinicians should individualize adjustments based on patient-specific symptoms, symptom severity, academic demands, and pre-existing conditions, such as mood disorder, learning disability, or attention/concentration difficulties. Athletes with complicated or prolonged recovery may require a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise across the scope of concussion management.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^daab66ff]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Sample size and randomisation

We calculated the sample size on the basis of a sign test for comparison of matched pairs. Cohen's power tables suggested that we needed 30 matched pairs for 80% power to detect a large intervention effect (g = 0.25). Before randomisation, we revised the design and primary analysis. We considered randomisation without matching or stratification to be a better control of potential confounding, given the multiple features of study sites that might vary and the feasibility of matching schools by only a few features, and we chose an unpaired t test comparing mean change in students' use from pre-test to post-test at the school level for the primary analysis. The unmatched design increases the degrees of freedom from 29 (matched pairs design) to 58, and the comparison of means is more statistically powerful than a simple comparison of the number of schools that did or did not increase in students' usage.

Statistical methods

A preliminary analysis examined group differences in weather conditions, missing observation data, and school enrolment size. We excluded observation dates with only one of the three lunch time observations at the school recorded for a given date from further analyses. For dates with two or three lunch time observations we calculated the mean to represent students' use for the observation date. Missing observations occurred as a result of difficulties with filming or access, whole school events, and public holidays.

For both the primary and alternative study sites of each school, we aggregated observations of students' use by calculating the mean value. We did this separately for the pre-test (16 weeks of observation) and post-test (14 weeks) periods. We then calculated the difference to describe the mean change in students' use from pre-test to post-test for each school study site.

The primary analysis compared these school specific differences in students' use at the primary site between the intervention and control schools by using an unpaired t test and on an intention to treat basis. The secondary analysis included the school specific differences in students' use for both the primary and alternative study sites, resulting in two outcome measures per school. We fitted generalised estimating equations with robust standard errors to the data, allowing for an interaction between group and site. In addition, we fitted linear mixed models to the non-aggregated data to determine intra-school correlation coefficients. The statistician (KMJ) was blinded to group assignment. We used Stata version 8 for all analyses.

### Can school income and racial / ethnic composition explain the racial / ethnic disparity in adolescent physical activity participation? [^97e87fcd]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to determine if racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent boys' and girls' physical activity participation exist and persist once the school attended is considered.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 17,007 teens in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using multivariate linear regression, we examined the association between adolescent self-reported physical activity and individual race/ethnicity stratified by gender, controlling for a wide range of sociodemographic, attitudinal, behavioral, and health factors. We used multilevel analyses to determine if the relationship between race/ethnicity and physical activity varied by the school attended.

Results

Participants attended racially segregated schools; approximately 80% of Hispanic and black adolescent boys and girls attended schools with student populations that were < 66% white, whereas nearly 40% of the white adolescents attended schools that were > 94% white. Black and Hispanic adolescent girls reported lower levels of physical activity than white adolescent girls. There were more similar levels of physical activity reported in adolescent boys, with black boys reporting slightly more activities. Although black and Hispanic adolescent girls were more likely to attend poorer schools with overall lower levels of physical activity in girls; there was no difference within schools between black, white, and Hispanic adolescent girls' physical activity levels. Within the same schools, both black and Hispanic adolescent boys had higher rates of physical activity when compared with white adolescent boys.

Conclusions

In this nationally representative sample, lower physical activity levels in Hispanic and black adolescent girls were largely attributable to the schools they attended. In contrast, black and Hispanic males had higher activity levels than white males when attending the same schools. Future research is needed to determine the mechanisms through which school environments contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in adolescent physical activity and will need to consider gender differences in these racial/ethnic disparities.

### Incidence of sudden cardiac arrest in high school student athletes on school campus [^68b38523]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An accurate estimate of the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in high school student athletes is needed to guide prevention strategies.

Objective

To prospectively investigate SCA rates in high school student athletes vs student nonathletes.

Methods

A prospective observational study of 2149 US high schools participating in the National Registry for AED Use in Sports was conducted from August 2009 to July 2011. Schools were contacted quarterly to collect and review SCA cases occurring on school campus. Ninety-five percent (2045) of the schools confirmed participation for the entire 2-year period.

Results

The average numbers of total students and student athletes per school were 963 and 367, respectively, providing more than 4.1 million total student-years and more than 1.5 million student athlete-years of surveillance. Twenty-six cases of SCA occurred in students, including 18 cases in student athletes-all during exercise. The incidence of SCA in all students was 0.63 per 100,000; in student athletes, 1.14 per 100,000; and in student nonathletes, 0.31 per 100,000. The relative risk of SCA in student athletes vs nonathletes was 3.65 (95% confidence interval 1.6–8.4; P < .01). Sixteen of 18 (89%) student athletes with SCA were boys, resulting in an incidence of 1.73 per 100,000 in boys and 0.31 per 100,000 in girls and a relative risk in male compared with female student athletes of 5.65 (95% confidence interval 1.3–24.6; P < .01).

Conclusion

The incidence of SCA in high school student athletes is higher than previous estimates and may justify more advanced cardiac screening and improved emergency planning in schools.

### Heat injury in youth sport [^4922daa4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Heat injury is a potentially lethal condition that is considered to be completely preventable. Fatal heat injury is relatively rare (0.20 per 100 000 player-seasons in US high school football) and there are very limited data on non-fatal incidence. Expert recommendations for prevention include gradual acclimatisation of youth athletes to hot conditions, reductions in activity in hot and humid conditions, wearing light and light-coloured clothing, careful monitoring of athletes for signs of heat injury to facilitate immediate detection, having the resources to immediately and rapidly cool affected athletes, and education of athletes, care givers, and coaches about heat injury. Although a base of observational case data, physiological information, and expert opinion exists, the science surrounding this field is devoid of health communication and health behaviour research, and there is a pressing need for analytical studies to evaluate intervention programmes and/or identify new risk factors. There is also a need for ongoing data collection on heat injury incidence and on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards heat injury among youth athletes, their care givers and their coaches.

### Hidden talents in context: cognitive performance with abstract versus ecological stimuli among adversity-exposed youth [^18bdbba8]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

Procedures across the middle school and after‐school clubs were the same, with a few minor differences. First, participants in the clubs completed the tasks before the interview, but the opposite occurred in the middle school. The second was that, in the middle school, the questionnaire was completed in a separate session. Whereas the tasks and interview were completed in a small room, alone with the interviewer, the questionnaire was completed approximately 2 weeks later in a mass testing context (large computer room). This was done because the middle school was on a strict class schedule, which limited the length of individual sessions. In the clubs, sessions were conducted in the summer during flexible hours.

Measures

Attention shifting

We measured attention shifting with two versions of the color–shape task (Friedman et al; Mittal et al; Miyake & Friedman,), which involves categorizing stimuli according to one of two rules (see below). On each trial, the rule is displayed on the top of the screen. Using arrow keys, participants categorized the stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible. Response options appeared at the bottom of the screen (see Figure 1).

On the abstract (standard) attention‐shifting task, participants categorized colored (blue or yellow) shapes (squares or triangles) according to the "color" or "shape" rule (see Figure 1a). For example, if a blue triangle appeared on the screen and the rule was "color", participants categorized the blue triangle as blue. However, if the rule was "shape", participants instead categorized the blue triangle as a triangle.

### Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1. 6 million participants [^0ae45a8b]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Physical activity has many health benefits for young people. In 2018, WHO launched More Active People for a Healthier World, a new global action on physical activity, including new targets of a 15% relative reduction of global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2030 among adolescents and adults. We describe current prevalence and trends of insufficient physical activity among school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years by country, region, and globally.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of cross-sectional survey data that were collected through random sampling with a sample size of at least 100 individuals, were representative of a national or defined subnational population, and reported prevalence of of insufficient physical activity by sex in adolescents. Prevalence had to be reported for at least three of the years of age within the 10–19-year age range. We estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical activity in school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years (combined and by sex) for individual countries, for four World Bank income groups, nine regions, and globally for the years 2001–16. To derive a standard definition of insufficient physical activity and to adjust for urban-only survey coverage, we used regression models. We estimated time trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.

Findings

We used data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas including 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years. Globally, in 2016, 81·0% (95% uncertainty interval 77·8–87·7) of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active (77·6% [76·1–80·4] of boys and 84·7% [83·0–88·2] of girls). Although prevalence of insufficient physical activity significantly decreased between 2001 and 2016 for boys (from 80·1% [78·3–81·6] in 2001), there was no significant change for girls (from 85·1% [83·1–88·0] in 2001). There was no clear pattern according to country income group: insufficient activity prevalence in 2016 was 84·9% (82·6–88·2) in low-income countries, 79·3% (77·2–87·5) in lower–middle-income countries, 83·9% (79·5–89·2) in upper–middle-income countries, and 79·4% (74·0–86·2) in high-income countries. The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific for both boys (89·0%, 62·8–92·2) and girls (95·6%, 73·7–97·9). The regions with the lowest prevalence were high-income western countries for boys (72·1%, 71·1–73·6), and south Asia for girls (77·5%, 72·8–89·3). In 2016, 27 countries had a prevalence of insufficient activity of 90% or more for girls, whereas this was the case for two countries for boys.

Interpretation

The majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines. Urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents. Investment and leadership at all levels to intervene on the multiple causes and inequities that might perpetuate the low participation in physical activity and sex differences, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities. Such action will improve the health of this and future young generations and support achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

### Remembering our roots: eponyms in sports medicine [^bf0dcb8e]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

For as long as athletes have been competing, injuries from competition have resulted. Sports medicine has a rich and storied history with significant contributors from many different countries and civilizations. Over time, we have honored the contributions of important figures in sports medicine with the use of eponyms. However, the continued use of eponyms in medicine has been called into question by a number of authors. They cite inaccuracies in definition and context, lack of descriptive value, and the possible celebration of unsavory characters. However, eponyms are pervasive in the medical literature. They bring color and character and allow us to honor those who came before us. Furthermore, eponyms can hide some distressing aspects of a disease. This review of eponyms in sports medicine provides an opportunity to celebrate our predecessors, recognize the international flavor of sports medicine, and promote accurate use of eponyms for the future.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^a22d100d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep hygiene practices for adolescents — Recommended practices include a regular, dark, quiet sleep environment; adequate time for 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night; consistent bedtimes and wake times on weekdays and weekends; a regular bedtime routine to cue the body that sleep is imminent; and morning light exposure, and the use of sleep-disrupting electronic devices near bedtime or during the night should be avoided because blue light emitted from electronic devices, particularly blue wavelengths, can suppress the production of melatonin and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.

Table 2
Physical activity and sedentary minutes accumulated by gender

Physical activity data presented in this table is based on a total of 596 valid days for 133 students with a total of 467 "No PE" days 129 days with PE; Significant difference* (p < 0.05)

PE Physical education, LPA Light physical activity, MPA Moderate physical activity, VPA Vigorous physical activity, MVPA Moderate to vigorous physical activity

Figure 1 shows that. Overall, boys spent significantly higher proportion (p < 0.05) in MVPA across all school day segments in comparison to girls. Boys and girls spent the most parentage of time engaged in MVPA during lunch segment (13.8 and 8.4% respectively). Boys spent 10.5% of their PE time engaged MVPA where as girls spent 4.5% of their PE time engaged in MVPA (P < 0.05).

Fig. 1
Proportion of time in moderate to vigorous physical activity

Table 3 shows high active and low active for each gender across different school day segments. The largest differences in the amount of MVPA accumulated between high active and low active boys and girls were during PE (22 and 3.5 min difference for boys and girls respectively) and class time (5.8 and 5.3 min difference for boys and girls respectively). The boys in the high active group spent the highest percentage of their time in MVPA during PE, whereas, the girls in the high active group spent the highest percentage of their time in MVPA during lunch. The boys and girls in the low active groups spent the highest percentage of their time in MVPA during lunch. The largest difference in the percentage of time boys spent in MVPA was during PE (23.2 difference in percent points), followed by lunch (18.2 difference in percent points). For girls the largest difference in percent of time spent in MVPA was during lunch (6.4 difference in percent points) followed by class time (5.0 difference in percent points). For boys, the smallest difference in percent time spent in MVPA was during class time for boys (7.0 differences in percent points), and PE for girls (1.8 difference in percent points).

### Epidemiology of injuries in United States high school track and field: 2008–2009 through 2013–2014 [^a367ad4b]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Track and field is one of the most popular high school sports among boys and girls, but epidemiological research on the sport and its individual events has been limited.

Purpose

To describe injury rates and patterns in boys' and girls' high school track and field.

Study Design

Descriptive epidemiology study.

Methods

A retrospective epidemiological analysis of injury and exposure data from a longitudinal national high school sports injury surveillance system was conducted.

Results

From 2008–2009 through 2013–2014, 2485 track and field injuries occurred during 2,962,308 athlete exposures (0.84 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures). Injury rates were higher in competition versus practice for both sexes. Girls had higher injury rates than boys overall (rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27–1.48) and in practice (rate ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.46–1.76), but competition injury rates did not differ. Overuse/chronic injuries accounted for 27.5% and 36.2% of boys' and girls' track and field injuries, respectively. The majority of injuries were to the lower extremity. Sprints, distance running, and jumps accounted for over 65% of all track injuries. Boys sustained a greater proportion of injuries in relay events (injury proportion ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.69–2.36) but fewer in hurdle events (injury proportion ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.23–0.78).

Conclusion

Injury rates varied by event, sex, and competition versus practice exposure. To increase effectiveness, targeted strategies for injury prevention should be driven by an understanding of such differences. Because many track and field injuries are overuse/chronic across sexes and for both competitions and practices, coaches and athletic trainers should be adept at recognizing early injury symptoms, intervene to treat minor injuries in order to prevent severe injuries, and ensure the prompt diagnosis and management of all injuries.

### Youth athletes at Swedish sports high schools with an athletics specialism emphasise environmental support for injury risk management: a focus group study [^630cd73e]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Data collection

Data were collected from 12 focus groups, including 6 in each cohort of students (ie, first-year and third-year students). Attendance ranged from 5 to 15 participants, and all focus groups took place between October and December 2018 in an auditorium at each SSHS-A. The mix of girls and boys was fairly even in each focus group, whereby the total number of participants per group mainly depends on whether the school is located in a larger or smaller town. Participant information is presented in table 1. Two representatives from the research group were present at all focus groups; one moderated the discussions (JJ; medical coordinator for SA, physical therapist), while the other recorded the focus groups and acted as a facilitator for the discussions (DM, head of dual careers at SA). The researchers' collective knowledge and expertise were useful in building relationships and facilitating athletes who wanted to share their lived experiences. All focus groups followed the same standardised protocol based on a semistructured topic guide (see online supplemental material) and lasted for approximately 60 min. Each focus group began with a short introduction of all participants and was followed by a 5 min report of scientific findings from previous injury research conducted by SA and at SSHS-A. Each focus group was divided into two parts. First, the participants were asked to reflect on and discuss what could be the cause of the high incidence of injuries (ie, a health problem) at SSHS-A. In the second part, the athletes were asked to reflect on what needs to be done to reduce health problems and how a change can be achieved. Every focus group (including facilitator-participant interactions) was unique; different prompt questions were used to encourage in-depth responses. All focus groups were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim after the final focus group. Focus group transcripts were then circulated to four researchers in the team (JJ, DM, P-OH and UT), the latter two with experience in psychology, pedagogy and qualitative research. All audio files were permanently deleted after transcription.

### Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1. 6 million participants [^448503f0]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Physical activity has many health benefits for young people. In 2018, WHO launched More Active People for a Healthier World, a new global action on physical activity, including new targets of a 15% relative reduction of global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2030 among adolescents and adults. We describe current prevalence and trends of insufficient physical activity among school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years by country, region, and globally.

Methods

We did a pooled analysis of cross-sectional survey data that were collected through random sampling with a sample size of at least 100 individuals, were representative of a national or defined subnational population, and reported prevalence of of insufficient physical activity by sex in adolescents. Prevalence had to be reported for at least three of the years of age within the 10-19-year age range. We estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical activity in school-going adolescents aged 11–17 years (combined and by sex) for individual countries, for four World Bank income groups, nine regions, and globally for the years 2001–16. To derive a standard definition of insufficient physical activity and to adjust for urban-only survey coverage, we used regression models. We estimated time trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.

Findings

We used data from 298 school-based surveys from 146 countries, territories, and areas including 1·6 million students aged 11–17 years. Globally, in 2016, 81·0% (95% uncertainty interval 77·8–87·7) of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active (77·6% [76·1–80·4] of boys and 84·7% [83·0–88·2] of girls). Although prevalence of insufficient physical activity significantly decreased between 2001 and 2016 for boys (from 80·1% [78·3–81·6] in 2001), there was no significant change for girls (from 85·1% [83·1–88·0] in 2001). There was no clear pattern according to country income group: insufficient activity prevalence in 2016 was 84·9% (82·6–88·2) in low-income countries, 79·3% (77·2–87·5) in lower-middle-income countries, 83·9% (79·5–89·2) in upper-middle-income countries, and 79·4% (74·0–86·2) in high-income countries. The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific for both boys (89·0%, 62·8–92·2) and girls (95·6%, 73·7–97·9). The regions with the lowest prevalence were high-income western countries for boys (72·1%, 71·1–73·6), and south Asia for girls (77·5%, 72·8–89·3). In 2016, 27 countries had a prevalence of insufficient activity of 90% or more for girls, whereas this was the case for two countries for boys.

Interpretation

The majority of adolescents do not meet current physical activity guidelines. Urgent scaling up of implementation of known effective policies and programmes is needed to increase activity in adolescents. Investment and leadership at all levels to intervene on the multiple causes and inequities that might perpetuate the low participation in physical activity and sex differences, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities. Such action will improve the health of this and future young generations and support achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

### High school student athletes: associations between intensity of participation and health factors [^f26e6eb6]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

This paper addresses and compares the impact of organized, more intensive sports participation with lower intensity participation among high school student-athletes. Subjects included 770 high school students who reported being active in organized school sports. Mental health, physical health, and coping skills were assessed as indicated by factor scores derived from the Juvenile Wellness and Health Survey (JWHS-76). Results indicate that compared to students who were less active, competitive sports participation was associated with fewer mental health problems, fewer total risks, and fewer eating and dietary problems for both girls and boys. These results provide initial support for the association between youth participation in competitive sports and mental health.

### Sexual harassment and abuse among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students: a prospective study [^04c8a93b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Digital procedure during COVID-19

All Norwegian schools closed March 12, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for this reason, five schools attended T1 project meetings through Skype for Business (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) or Teams (Microsoft), yet with no change in the procedure for answering the questionnaire. This digital procedure continued throughout T2, except one school, which received a physical visit at T2.

Participants

In total, 1587 elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students in 12th grade, over 16 yr of age, were invited to T1, and 1666 were invited to T2. The participants who responded to both T1 and T2 were included in the analyses (n = 919; Fig. 1). The results for the nonbinary gender participants were described separately because there were few participants (n = 4). Unequal number of invited students at T1 and T2 was due to individuals who changed or quit school between T1 and T2, and one elite sport high school withdrew from T2. In addition, 150 reference students were invited to T2 only because of difficulties organizing the T1 data collection because of restrictions related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The response rates in percent at T1 were 83.8, 88.6, and 62.4 for the elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students, respectively. At T2, the response rates were 78.0%, 88.0%, and 80.5%, respectively.

FIGURE 1
Flowchart of the recruitment of schools and participants in the study. Note: A higher number of reference students were invited at T2 (n = 600) compared with T1 (n = 450) because of restrictions related to physical meetings and the sudden change to distance school at the end of T1, as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Instruments

Apart from self-generated questions about demographics, training, and sport performance, the questions regarding SHA were adapted from earlier research. Validated instruments measuring psychological health parameters were also included in the questionnaire battery, but not presented in this article. The questionnaire battery took 30–40 min to complete. The questions were formulated to fit the age of the participants and piloted in a sample of adolescents attending elite sport and ordinary high schools, not relevant for inclusion in the final study. Minor wording adjustments and exemplifications were done after the piloting, and response options were added to the items covering living situation and immigration status.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^43c6f0c7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We randomly selected secondary schools from outer metropolitan areas of Melbourne and sent principals a letter of invitation outlining the study's aims and requirements. Study eligibility required enrolment of 300 or more students with all year levels 7–12 on campus, identification of two potential shade development areas, and no plans for major changes to school grounds or buildings during the study period from the start of spring 2004 to the end of summer 2006.

We approached 127 schools for participation. Of these, 31 schools did not meet the study requirements, five schools declined owing to concern about potential vandalism of shade structures or the video observations, and 40 declined with limited reasons given (such as too busy). We set the following criteria for identifying potential shade development sites: a full sun area during spring and summer terms; a large enough space for students to congregate; used regularly by students and located in a main activity area of the school; avoided existing underground services, major paths, and roadways; and approved by the principal and contact teacher as suitable for building shade for the school.

Fifty one secondary schools that met the eligibility criteria participated in the study. After shade audits and consultations with school principals, we identified two full sun areas in each school to be observed over the study period. These two sites were selected as potentially suitable for a shade development (the intervention) and located in close proximity to each other, in either adjacent or nearby areas. We considered the schools' preferred site for the shade development as the "primary" study site and the adjacent or nearby area as the "alternative" study site. We defined the boundaries of these study sites by use of both still photographs of each site with a boundary overlaid and written notes describing the features on the perimeter of the sites that were to be included or excluded. In January 2005 the study statistician (JAS) randomly assigned schools to intervention (n = 25) and control (n = 26) groups; she had no information about the schools. Allocation was concealed from the other researchers and the schools until randomisation occurred. Thereafter, blinding of school principals, contact teachers, researchers, and content analysts to the intervention allocation was not possible. School principals agreed to participate by September 2004, well before the school contacts were informed of the group allocation in January 2005.

### Vitamin D status in Saudi school children based on knowledge [^f55ca3cf]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Vitamin D awareness

Table 1 highlights the demographics of boys and girls, as well as their knowledge on vitamin D and vitamin D-related diseases and sun exposure. There is a significant difference in skin color distribution among subjects, with girls having a higher prevalence of "fair-toned" skin than boys (p < 0.001). Housing-wise, the majority of the students lived in villas, with girls having a modestly higher prevalence of villa residency than boys (p < 0.001). With regards to vitamin D knowledge, there was a significantly higher percentage of boys answering "yes" than girls in 5 out of 12 questions, 4 of which was correct [30 minute sun exposure provides enough calcium and vitamin D, about breastfeeding, and vitamin D deficiency leads to rickets in children; p-values 0.002, 0.011 0.001, and 0.001 respectively]. On the other hand, while the majority of both boys and girls thought that fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin D, a significantly higher percentage of girls got it correct (24.7% girls versus 15.4% boys; p-value < 0.001 and 29.6% girls versus 20.9% boys; p-values < 0.001, not shown in table). Worthy to note is the low percentage of both boys and girls having heard of vitamin D sources in both schools and primary care centers, which means that knowledge on vitamin D and its sources were probably acquired elsewhere (e.g. parents, media). As for sun exposure, boys had a higher prevalence of sun exposure than girls as well as increased frequency (p-values 0.001, for both). Consequently and as expected, girls had a significantly higher percentage of sunscreen use and full covering during sun exposure (p-values 0.001 and 0.02, for both) (Table 1).

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^0d276c1b]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Bullying in athletics — prevalence, cyberbullying, and screening — has been reported to be less prevalent in sport than in school and to occur at a relatively low frequency overall. Cyberbullying reports include that 38% of students knew someone who had been cyberbullied and almost 9 percent reported cyberbullying someone else; in the 2017 NCAA Study of Student Athlete Social Environments, 12% of male and 4 percent of female student-athletes reported receiving a threat on social media, with 3 percent receiving a death threat, and Black student-athletes were reported to receive racist messages at twice the rate of white student-athletes. No screening tool specifically designed for assessing bullying in athletics exists; the Bully and Ostracism Screening Experience and School Climate (BOSS-E) short form is a 16-item self-report used to provide a quick indicator of school climate for boys and girls aged 10 to 14 years, and the 3-part California Bully Victimization Scale instrument is another option.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^953c1e10]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Rapid physical activity assessment in students — topics include the amount of daily physical activity participation (e.g., whether a student is physically active for ≥ 60 minutes per day through free play, time spent outside, physical education, and organized activities), the number of hours per day of television, movies, video games, and computer use (e.g., whether a student is viewing 1–2 hours of quality programming per day), the presence of a television or a computer in the student's bedroom, participation in physical education classes, and the amount of physically discretionary activities; staff members also should refer to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, the CDC Youth Physical Activity Guidelines Toolkit, and AAP policy guidance on screen time.

### Sexual harassment and abuse among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students: a prospective study [^31a873bc]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Twelve-month prevalence (%) of SHA victimization among elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students in different social settings (school, sports outside school, and free time).

The prevalence of SHA was lower among the elite athletes than among the recreational athletes in the school setting (T1: P = 0.002 and T2: P ≤ 0.001) and lower among the elite athletes compared with the recreational athletes and the reference students, respectively, in the free time setting (T1 and T2: P ≤ 0.001). In the sport setting, the prevalence of SHA was lower among the reference students compared with the elite and recreational athletes, respectively (T1 and T2: P ≤ 0.001; Table 2). The OR values for reporting SHA were 1.88 times higher in school compared with the sport setting (95% CI, 1.6–2.2), 2.56 times higher during free time compared with the sport setting (CI, 2.1–3.1), and 1.36 times higher in free time compared with the school setting (95% CI, 1.2–1.6). At T2, the OR values were 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.9), 3.8 (95% CI, 3.1–4.7), and 2.5 (95% CI, 2.1–2.9), respectively.

Among the nonbinary athletes, three out of four reported SHA at T1 in the school setting and two out of four in the free time setting. At T2, one nonbinary athlete reported SHA in all three settings.

In total, 6.1% of the participants (T1: 10.1% boys and 2.4% girls, P < 0.001) admitted having sexually harassed others in their lifetime. Of these, 60.7% reported experiences of SHA themselves.

Verbal SH was reported by 24.6% of the total sample, nonverbal SH by 27.0%, and physical SHA by 14.0%. The OR values for reporting verbal SH and nonverbal SH, respectively, at T1 were 2.0 (95% CI, 1.6–2.4) and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.9–2.7) times greater than reporting physical SHA. For more details, see Figure 2.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^7a78b2eb]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To examine whether students use or avoid newly shaded areas created by shade sails installed at schools.

Design

Cluster randomised controlled trial with secondary schools as the unit of randomisation.

Setting

51 secondary schools with limited available shade, in Australia, assessed over two spring and summer terms.

Participants

Students outside at lunch times.

Intervention

Purpose built shade sails were installed in winter 2005 at full sun study sites to increase available shade for students in the school grounds.

Main Outcome Measure

Mean number of students using the primary study sites during weekly observations at lunch time.

Results

Over the study period the mean change in students using the primary study site from pre-test to post-test was 2.63 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 4.39) students in intervention schools and -0.03 (-1.16 to 1.09) students in control schools. The difference in mean change between groups was 2.67 (0.65 to 4.68) students (P = 0.011).

Conclusions

Students used rather than avoided newly shaded areas provided by purpose built shade sails at secondary schools in this trial, suggesting a practical means of reducing adolescents' exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Trial Registration

Exempt.

### Removal from activity after sports-related concussion in sex-comparable sports from the Michigan high school athletic association [^7d4cfc06]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Research has demonstrated that female athletes are more likely to report their sports-related concussion (SRC) symptoms compared with male athletes; however, it is unknown if these reporting behaviors correspond to immediate removal from activity in sex-comparable sports.

Purpose

To compare the incidence of high school student-athletes removed and not removed from activity after SRC in sex-comparable sports in Michigan.

Study Design

Descriptive epidemiology study.

Methods

Participants included student-athletes diagnosed with SRC participating in Michigan High School Athletic Association-sponsored athletic activities (22 sex-comparable sports) between 2016 and 2019. All SRCs were recorded in the association's Head Injury Reporting System (HIRS) by certified athletic trainers, administrators, or coaches. Removal from activity indicated that the student-athlete was removed from play at the time of an injury event. If the student-athlete reported that his or her suspected injury event occurred earlier during activity or if symptom onset was delayed, "not removed from activity" was entered into the HIRS. Incidence proportions were calculated by dividing SRCs not removed by total SRCs in each sport. Risk ratios were calculated by dividing the incidence proportions of girls not removed by boys not removed in each sport.

Results

A total of 4418 (2773 female, 1645 male) SRCs were reported, with the most occurring in female soccer players (n = 1023). Overall, 515 girls and 243 boys were not removed from activity, resulting in incidences of 0.19 (95% CI, 0.17–0.20) and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.13–0.17), respectively. Across all sports, girls were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09–1.45) times as likely to not be removed from activity compared with boys. Of the sports with the most SRCs-soccer, basketball, baseball/softball, and lacrosse-girls had 1.37 (95% CI, 1.09–1.72), 1.15 (95% CI, 0.89–1.47), 1.19 (95% CI, 0.77–1.84), and 1.35 (95% CI, 0.94–1.95) times the risk of not being removed, respectively.

Conclusion

Girls were at greater risk of not being removed from activity compared with boys in sex-comparable sports. Results from this study should be incorporated into SRC education in Michigan and potentially elsewhere to inform affiliated personnel of potential sex differences and protect female student-athletes from further harm.

### The female athlete triad [^66cbfbba]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Female athlete triad — prevalence and clinician recognition indicate that the prevalence of individuals with all 3 components simultaneously is only 1% to 1.2% in high school girls and 0% to 16% in all female athletes, and in high school–aged female athletes the prevalence of 2 concurrent components is 4% to 18% and of any 1 component is as high as 16% to 54%. It is difficult to estimate the true prevalence of the triad because of the complexity of evaluation of each of the components. Knowledge gaps among clinicians are noted, with a 2009 study finding only 20% of pediatricians correctly identified all 3 components compared with 50% of family medicine physicians and 41% of orthopedic surgeons, and most physicians reported receiving no education in medical school or through continuing medical education on triad-related issues.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic [^163c61a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

More than 767 million coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 6.9 million deaths with COVID-19 have been recorded as of August 2023. Several public health and social measures were implemented in schools to contain the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and prevent onward transmission. We built upon methods from a previous Cochrane review to capture current empirical evidence relating to the effectiveness of school measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Objectives

To provide an updated assessment of the evidence on the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to keep schools open safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Educational Resources Information Center, World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease database, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence Synthesis Program COVID-19 Evidence Reviews on 18 February 2022.

Selection Criteria

Eligible studies focused on measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, among students (aged 4 to 18 years) or individuals relating to the school, or both. We categorized studies that reported quantitative measures of intervention effectiveness, and studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures as either 'main' or 'supporting' studies based on design and approach to handling key confounders. We were interested in transmission-related outcomes and intended or unintended consequences.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts. We extracted minimal data for supporting studies. For main studies, one review author extracted comprehensive data and assessed risk of bias, which a second author checked. We narratively synthesized findings for each intervention-comparator-outcome category (body of evidence). Two review authors assessed certainty of evidence.

Main Results

The 15 main studies consisted of measures to reduce contacts (4 studies), make contacts safer (7 studies), surveillance and response measures (6 studies; 1 assessed transmission outcomes, 5 assessed performance of surveillance measures), and multicomponent measures (1 study). These main studies assessed outcomes in the school population (12), general population (2), and adults living with a school-attending child (1). Settings included K-12 (kindergarten to grade 12; 9 studies), secondary (3 studies), and K-8 (kindergarten to grade 8; 1 study) schools. Two studies did not clearly report settings. Studies measured transmission-related outcomes (10), performance of surveillance measures (5), and intended and unintended consequences (4). The 15 main studies were based in the WHO Regions of the Americas (12), and the WHO European Region (3). Comparators were more versus less intense measures, single versus multicomponent measures, and measures versus no measures. We organized results into relevant bodies of evidence, or groups of studies relating to the same 'intervention-comparator-outcome' categories. Across all bodies of evidence, certainty of evidence ratings limit our confidence in findings. Where we describe an effect as 'beneficial', the direction of the point estimate of the eﬀect favours the intervention; a 'harmful' eﬀect does not favour the intervention and 'null' shows no effect either way. Measures to reduce contact (4 studies) We grouped studies into 21 bodies of evidence: moderate- (10 bodies), low- (3 bodies), or very low-certainty evidence (8 bodies). The evidence was very low to moderate certainty for beneficial effects of remote versus in-person or hybrid teaching on transmission in the general population. For students and staff, mostly harmful effects were observed when more students participated in remote teaching. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that in the general population there was probably no effect on deaths and a beneficial effect on hospitalizations for remote versus in-person teaching, but no effect for remote versus hybrid teaching. The effects of hybrid teaching, a combination of in-person and remote teaching, were mixed. Very low-certainty evidence showed that there may have been a harmful eﬀect on risk of infection among adults living with a school student for closing playgrounds and cafeterias, a null eﬀect for keeping the same teacher, and a beneficial eﬀect for cancelling extracurricular activities, keeping the same students together and restricting entry for parents and caregivers. Measures to make contact safer (7 studies) We grouped studies into eight bodies of evidence: moderate- (5 bodies), and low-certainty evidence (3 bodies). Low-certainty evidence showed that there may have been a beneficial effect of mask mandates on transmission-related outcomes. Moderate-certainty evidence showed full mandates were probably more beneficial than partial or no mandates. Evidence of a beneficial effect of physical distancing on risk of infection among staff and students was mixed. Moderate-certainty evidence showed that ventilation measures probably reduce cases among staﬀ and students. One study (very low-certainty evidence) found that there may be a beneficial eﬀect of not sharing supplies and increasing desk space on risk of infection for adults living with a school student, but showed there may be a harmful eﬀect of desk shields. Surveillance and response measures (6 studies) We grouped studies into seven bodies of evidence: moderate- (3 bodies), low- (1 body), and very low-certainty evidence (3 bodies). Daily testing strategies to replace or reduce quarantine probably helped to reduce missed school days and decrease the proportion of asymptomatic school contacts testing positive (moderate-certainty evidence). For studies that assessed the performance of surveillance measures, the proportion of cases detected by rapid antigen detection testing ranged from 28.6% to 95.8%, positive predictive value ranged from 24.0% to 100.0% (very low-certainty evidence). There was probably no onward transmission from contacts of a positive case (moderate-certainty evidence) and replacing or shortening quarantine with testing may have reduced missed school days (low-certainty evidence). Multicomponent measures (1 study) Combining multiple measures may have led to a reduction in risk of infection among adults living with a student (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

A range of measures can have a beneficial effect on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilization and school attendance. We rated the current findings at a higher level of certainty than the original review. Further high-quality research into school measures to control SARS-CoV-2 in a wider variety of contexts is needed to develop a more evidence-based understanding of how to keep schools open safely during COVID-19 or a similar public health emergency.

### Use of performance-enhancing substances [^fa3afe2a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Use of performance-enhancing substances (PES) — adolescent prevalence and correlates include that for many adolescents, use of PESs is an attempt to enhance appearance rather than performance, and many users are not actively involved in organized athletic activity. In an urban high school population, 38.8% of boys and 18.2% of girls reported a history of protein supplement use, and in middle school the rates for boys and girls were 29.7% and 24.7%, respectively. Students participating in team sports were more likely to use protein supplements (24.2%), with use still fairly high in students who were not involved in sports (18.2%). A 2012 meta-analysis revealed higher rates of steroid use in athletes than in nonathletes (odds ratio, 1.5). Other correlates of PES use include body dissatisfaction, higher BMI, training in a commercial gym, and exposure to appearance-focused media, and multiple studies have revealed correlations between PES use and alcohol and drug use, as well as other risk-taking behaviors.

### Inconsistency between overall and subgroup analyses [^50ad8f76]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Notations

We used the example in table 1 to develop our notation. However, our results apply to both continuous and categorical outcomes. Let Yᵢ denote the score of a randomly selected student from school i, and pᵢ denote the proportion of girls in school i, i = 1, 2. We define the following quantities: a₁₀ = average score of girls in school 1, a₁₁ = average score of boys in school 1, a₂₀ = average score of girls in school 2, a₂₁ = average score of boys in school 2.

Then the overall average scores of these two schools are a₁ = p₁ a₁₀ + (1−p₁) a₁₁, and a₂ = p₂ a₂₀ + (1−p₂) a₂₁, respectively. They are the weighted averages of the subgroup averages.

We also define some differences in the score:

(1) The differences between girls and boys within each school: d₁ = a₁₀ − a₁₁, d₂ = a₂₀ − a₂₁.

(2) The difference in girls (boys) between the two schools (subgroup differences):

Δ₀ = a₁₀ − a₂₀,

Δ₁ = a₁₁ − a₂₁.

(3) The overall difference between the two schools:

Δ = a₁ − a₂.

It is easy to prove that

Δ₀ − Δ₁ = d₁ − d₂.

### The collapsed athlete [^b6b19b9b]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Athletic collapse is rare, but personnel caring for athletes at sporting events must be prepared for it. Most cases are nonfatal and, with proper management, can have good outcomes. Medical personnel should expect the typical causes of athletic collapse that occur at the events they are covering, but rare causes should also be anticipated.

### How can we better engage female athletes? A novel approach to health and performance education in adolescent athletes [^be0be8cb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conclusion

This cluster randomised control trial found that both a five-part video series and online educational materials significantly improved Triad/REDs and female athlete science knowledge in high school runners. However, the five-part video series had higher ratings of interest and behavioural impact across all five modules. Future research should explore engaging and informative methods to deliver female athlete science content and should evaluate the impact of using compelling storytelling from a diverse range of athletes and experts.

### Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic [^6c995027]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.

Selection Criteria

We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials; RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases); (ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations); (iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health); and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings.

Main Results

We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts; (ii) measures making contacts safer; (iii) surveillance and response measures; and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s); 'negative' effects do not favour the intervention. We found 23 modelling studies assessing measures reducing the opportunity for contacts (i.e. alternating attendance, reduced class size). Most of these studies assessed transmission and healthcare utilisation outcomes, and all of these studies showed a reduction in transmission (e.g. a reduction in the number or proportion of cases, reproduction number) and healthcare utilisation (i.e. fewer hospitalisations) and mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 11 modelling studies and two observational studies assessing measures making contacts safer (i.e. mask wearing, cleaning, handwashing, ventilation). Five studies assessed the impact of combined measures to make contacts safer. They assessed transmission-related, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, and a reduction in hospitalisations; however, studies showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (i.e. fewer number of days spent in school). We identified 13 modelling studies and one observational study assessing surveillance and response measures, including testing and isolation, and symptomatic screening and isolation. Twelve studies focused on mass testing and isolation measures, while two looked specifically at symptom-based screening and isolation. Outcomes included transmission, healthcare utilisation, other health, and societal, economic and ecological outcomes. Most of these studies showed effects in favour of the intervention in terms of reductions in transmission and hospitalisations, however some showed mixed or negative effects on societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. fewer number of days spent in school). We found three studies that reported outcomes relating to multicomponent measures, where it was not possible to disaggregate the effects of each individual intervention, including one modelling, one observational and one quasi-experimental study. These studies employed interventions, such as physical distancing, modification of school activities, testing, and exemption of high-risk students, using measures such as hand hygiene and mask wearing. Most of these studies showed a reduction in transmission, however some showed mixed or no effects. As the majority of studies included in the review were modelling studies, there was a lack of empirical, real-world data, which meant that there were very little data on the actual implementation of interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review suggests that a broad range of measures implemented in the school setting can have positive impacts on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and on healthcare utilisation outcomes related to COVID-19. The certainty of the evidence for most intervention-outcome combinations is very low, and the true effects of these measures are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Measures implemented in the school setting may limit the number or proportion of cases and deaths, and may delay the progression of the pandemic. However, they may also lead to negative unintended consequences, such as fewer days spent in school (beyond those intended by the intervention). Further, most studies assessed the effects of a combination of interventions, which could not be disentangled to estimate their specific effects. Studies assessing measures to reduce contacts and to make contacts safer consistently predicted positive effects on transmission and healthcare utilisation, but may reduce the number of days students spent at school. Studies assessing surveillance and response measures predicted reductions in hospitalisations and school days missed due to infection or quarantine, however, there was mixed evidence on resources needed for surveillance. Evidence on multicomponent measures was mixed, mostly due to comparators. The magnitude of effects depends on multiple factors. New studies published since the original search date might heavily influence the overall conclusions and interpretation of findings for this review.

### Testing the effectiveness of the developing inclusive youth program: a multisite randomized control trial [^0ca00d85]. Child Development (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and procedure

Students used Chromebooks and headphones provided by the school district for the web‐based portion of the intervention. These laptops were used for schoolwork during the day and were familiar to all students. Pretest and posttest data collection efforts took place at Week 1 and Week 10 (Table S3) and were overseen by two trained research assistants who helped the teacher ensure each student successfully logged into the pretest/posttest assessment and answered clarification questions as needed. A research assistant also attended each session for the duration of the DIY program and helped students log in during the web‐based tool portion, then sat quietly in the back of the room during completion of the discussion session. Prior to the start of the program implementation, teachers participated in a workshop in which they received materials and training on how to promote discussion in the classroom, create a safe space for discussions, enable students to express their views, and encourage children to engage in conversations (Figures S1 and S2). Teachers were invited to be partners with the university‐affiliated research team as part of the program and provided feedback each week regarding comments, reflections, and questions which were discussed by the research team.

Intervention program: Developing inclusive youth

Following pretest data collection, students and teachers in the intervention condition began the DIY program. The eight weekly sessions for the DIY program occurred during a consistent time each week that was identified by the teacher and included two components: a web‐based curriculum tool and a teacher‐led classroom discussion. Classrooms participated in a lock‐step manner, indicating that for all classrooms within each year, data collection began at the end of September and ended the last week of December for a total of 10 weeks; there was one exception whereby one class had to skip a session due to a scheduling conflict.

Web‐based curriculum tool. The DIY tool included eight scenarios that students viewed in a fixed order, once a week over the course of 8 weeks (Figures 1 and 2; Table S4). The eight scenarios targeted the following social groups: Recess (new person at school), Science (gender: female), Park (race/ethnicity: Latinx), Bowling (immigrant status), Arcade (wealth status), Dance (race/ethnicity: Black), Party (race/ethnicity: White), and Movie (race/ethnicity: Arab American).

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^fbea3c40]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Historical perspectives — athletic performance of men and women has progressively improved over the last century owing to factors such as enhanced training strategies, equipment, nutrition, opportunity, access, and inclusion, with improvement observed in Olympic and World Championship competitions every 2–4 yr across aerobic, power, and skill-based events. The rate of performance improvement in women has exceeded that of men, and for many events the sex difference leveled off after 20–30 yr of catch-up as participation increased. Women did not compete in the first games of the modern Olympiad (Athens, Greece, 1896), were banned from numerous Olympic athletic events for many years including the marathon, and first inclusion of the women's Olympic marathon program was in 1984.

### Associations of changes in BMI and body fat percentage with demographic and socioeconomic factors: the ELANA middle school cohort [^d58251fc]. International Journal of Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Adolescent weight and fat gain is determined by multiple factors. This study examined the association between changes in body fat indicators, excessive weight and fat gain, and sociodemographic factors among Brazilian adolescents over a 4-year period.

Methods

Body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (BFP) of 809 middle school students (mean age: 11.8 ± 1.15 years) were evaluated annually, from 2010 to 2013. Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the trajectories of BMI and BFP in both boys and girls according to the type of school attended (public or private) and skin colour. General estimating equations logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic variables and the development of overweight or high BFP.

Results

Girls from private schools (p = 0.003) and white boys (p = 0.041) experienced bigger increases in BMI, as compared to girls from public schools and black/brown boys, respectively. White boys also had an increased chance of presenting excessive weight (OR = 3.28; CI 95%: 1.13–9.52) and BFP (OR = 3.32; CI 95%: 1.38–8.01) gain than black/brown boys. Conversely, white girls were less likely to present excessive body fat gain when compared to black/brown girls (OR = 0.42; CI 95%: 0.18–0.96).

Conclusions

Adolescents who experienced better socioeconomic conditions, especially boys, were more likely to have greater increases in body fat indicators. Our findings contribute to the better understanding of BMI trajectories and body composition changes during puberty, as well as demonstrates the relationship between socioeconomic variables and adiposity indicators among adolescents in middle-income countries.

### Physical activity patterns of inner-city elementary schoolchildren [^687a0643]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to objectively measure the physical activity (PA) characteristics of a racially and ethnically diverse sample of inner-city elementary schoolchildren and to examine the influence of sex, race/ethnicity, grade level, and weight status on PA.

Methods

A total of 470 students in grades 4–6 from six inner-city schools in Philadelphia wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) for up to 7 d. The resultant data were uploaded to a customized Visual Basic EXCEL macro to determine the time spent in sedentary (SED), light-intensity PA (LPA), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA).

Results

On average, students accumulated 48 min of MVPA daily. Expressed as a percentage of monitoring time, students were sedentary for 63% of the time, in LPA 31% of the time, and in MVPA 6% of the time. Across all race/ethnicity and grade level groups, boys exhibited significantly higher levels of MVPA than girls did; fifth-grade boys exhibited significantly lower MVPA levels than fourth- and sixth-grade boys did, and sixth-grade girls exhibited significantly lower MVPA levels than fourth- and fifth-grade girls did. Hispanic children exhibited lower levels of MVPA than children from other racial/ethnic groups did, and overweight and obese children exhibited significantly lower MVPA levels than children in the healthy weight range did. Across the entire sample, only 24.3% met the current public health guidelines for PA. Physical inactivity was significantly greater among females, Hispanics, and overweight and obese students.

Conclusions

Fewer than one in four inner-city schoolchildren accumulated the recommended 60 min of MVPA daily. These findings highlight the need for effective and sustainable programs to promote PA in inner-city youth.

### Sexual harassment and abuse among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students: a prospective study [^d292e6c7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Purpose

This study aimed to examine the 12-month prevalence and 12-month prospective change in reported sexual harassment and abuse (SHA) victimization among young elite athletes, recreational athletes, and reference students in three different social settings and to identify the perpetrators.

Methods

In total, 919 adolescents responded to an online questionnaire in 12th grade (T1) and 13th grade (T2). The sample consisted of elite athletes (n = 482) and recreational athletes (n = 233) attending Norwegian elite sport high schools (n = 26), and reference students (n = 200) attending ordinary high schools with no sport specialization (n = 6). Data were analyzed using independent-sample t -test, Pearson χ² for independence/Fisher's exact test, McNemar test, and logistic regression analysis.

Results

The total 12-month prevalence of SHA was 38.6% at T1 and 35.1% at T2. Most of the participants (74.6%–85.0%) reported no change in SHA from T1 to T2. The prevalence of SHA was higher for girls compared with boys, and elite athletes reported less SHA than recreational athletes and reference students, respectively. SHA occurred most often in a free time setting. Verbal sexual harassment, nonverbal sexual harassment, and physical SHA were reported by 24.6%, 27.0%, and 14.0%, respectively. Peers were reported as perpetrators by 83.1%, trainer/teacher/health personnel by 20.1%, and "other" perpetrators by 56.4%.

Conclusions

Because one in three elite athletes and nearly one in two recreational athletes and reference students, respectively, reported SHA victimization within a 12-month period, well-targeted preventive measures are needed for both young athletes and nonathletes.

### Evaluating the impact of physical activity cards (PACs) on motor proficiency and enjoyment of physical activities among primary school students in Turkey [^36b76085]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The study employed a single-group pre-test-post-test design, an example of a quasi-experimental quantitative research method. The research represented groups (G), pre-test (T1), intervention (X), and post-test (T2). In this research design, the same variable is measured in participants before and after the intervention. Then, the difference between the pre-test and post-test scores is compared.

Study setting and participants

A state school in a more limited rural area was selected for the study. The purposive sampling method, one of the non-probability-based sampling approaches, was used to determine the study group. To ensure the statistical power and reliability of the study, a sample size calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1.9.7 software. For an independent samples t-test, assuming a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.50), an alpha level of 0.05, and a desired power of 0.80, the minimum required sample size was determined to be 84 participants. Our study included a total of 92 third-grade students, which exceeds this calculated minimum, thus ensuring sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful effects. This sample size is considered adequate for the study's objectives and the planned statistical analyses. Initially, face-to-face interviews were conducted with classroom teachers in the selected primary school to determine the use of PACs in physical education and play lessons. After the interviews, which 13 classroom teachers voluntarily attended, it was found that 11 teachers never used PACs (84.6%), and two teachers used them partially (15.4%). Considering that one of the teachers who partially used PACs was a second-grade teacher and the other was a fourth-grade teacher and that first-graders might have difficulty answering scale questions, the researchers decided to include all third-grade sections in the study, and all students were invited to participate. Two students who were actively licensed athletes were not included in the study. A total of 92 students (age = 8.48 ± 0.50), 49 girls (age = 8.44 ± 0.50) and 43 boys(age = 8.53 ± 0.50), studying in the third grade of a primary school in the Ula district of Mugla province, voluntarily participated in the study.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^b1f8d0f7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

The figureshows the flow of schools through each stage of the study. The shade sails were not built at two intervention schools where unforeseen demands required different use of the areas. Two control schools built shade sails near or on the study sites before the end of the study. One intervention school used portable shade umbrellas at pre-test, and one control school built a wheelchair ramp on the alternative study site, which probably disturbed observations.

Flow of school clusters through study

Group differences in potential confounders

Temperature, cloud cover, school enrolments, and the numbers of missed observations were similar for the two groups at both pre-test and post-test (table 1).

Students' use of primary study sites at pre-test

Use of the primary study site varied widely across schools and observation days. Many observations of the primary sites had no students present during the two minute observation periods. However, although the minimum use of the primary site was zero students, a maximum of 59 students at control schools and 30 students at intervention schools were observed to use the primary site at pre-test in a given two minute period. Table 2shows that the aggregated mean students' use of the primary site over the 16 weeks of pre-test was similar for control and intervention schools.

Results

Study population

Forty-five high school female runners were randomised to the intervention group and 39 were randomised to the control group. Seven participants in the intervention group (16%) and six participants in the control group (15%) completed the baseline survey but failed to complete all the modules. The remaining participants in the control group (n = 33) and the intervention group (n = 38) completed all the modules and assessments with the exception of three participants who missed ≤ two total questions across all knowledge quizzes (figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the progress through the two-group cluster randomised control trial.

The average age in the intervention group (mean = 16.0, SD = 1.4) and the control group (mean = 15.7, SD = 1.0) was similar. The majority of participants in the intervention (88.9%) and control groups (64.1%) were white, though the control group had more racial diversity (table 1). The percentage of participants with a history of diagnosed eating disorder and BMD was similar in the control and intervention groups, while the control group had more participants (24.4%) with a diagnosed bone stress injury than the intervention group (10.3%). Most participants in the intervention (68.9%) and control (59.0%) groups reported regular periods, and around 20% in both groups were unsure what constituted regular periods (table 1).

### Physical activity during school in urban minority kindergarten and first-grade students [^89866078]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine if physical activity (PA) during the school day varied by school, grade level, gender, weight status, and physical education (PE) and recess participation among urban kindergarten and first-grade students.

Methods

Cross-sectional study at 4 Bronx, NY, schools. Student PA was measured by a Yamax Digi-Walker pedometer, an objective and validated measure of PA in children. Each student wore a sealed pedometer during school for 5 consecutive days. Hierarchical models were fit to identify variables predictive of PA.

Results

A total of 916 had valid pedometer data (53% male, 70% Hispanic, mean age 5.98 years [SD 0.66], 45% overweight). PA varied by school (P < .0001). First-grade students took a significantly greater mean number of steps during school than kindergarten students. Overall, students took an average of 2479.7 (SD 961.8) steps/school day. PA did not differ by BMI status. Students took on average 724 more steps on PE days than on non-PE days and 490 more steps on days with outdoor recess than nonrecess days (P < .05 for both). Fewer than 1% of all students achieved lower cut points for previously published mean range of steps/school day for boys and girls. Multivariable analysis revealed higher grade level, participation in PE class, and outdoor recess as independent predictors of PA.

Conclusions

PA levels were low in kindergarten and first-grade students. Future interventions incorporating classroom-based PA and outdoor recess may increase PA in resource-poor urban schools with limited PE facilities.

### Neighborhood disadvantage and clinical outcome following concussion in adolescents [^80e0e5a7]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2024). Medium credibility.

Whether social determinants of health are associated with clinical outcome following concussion among adolescents is not well established. The present study examined whether neighborhood-level determinants are associated with clinical recovery time following concussion in adolescents. Participants included adolescent student athletes (n = 130; mean age = 16.6, standard deviation = 1.2; 60.8% boys, 39.2% girls) who attended one of nine selected high schools in Maine, USA. The Area of Deprivation Index (ADI), an indicator of neighborhood disadvantage was used to group high schools as either high or low in neighborhood disadvantage. Athletic trainers entered injury and recovery dates into an online surveillance application between September 2014 and January 2020. Chi-squared analyses and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare the groups on two clinical outcomes: days to return to school and days to return to sports. Results of chi-squared tests did not reveal between-group differences in return to school at 21 or 28 days. However, groups differed in the percentage of adolescents who had returned to sports by 21 days (greater neighborhood disadvantage, 62.5%, lesser neighborhood disadvantage 82.0%, χ² = 4.96, p = 0.03, odds ratio [OR] = 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–6.74) and 28 days (greater neighborhood disadvantage, 78.6%, lesser neighborhood disadvantage 94.0%, χ² = 5.18, p = 0.02, OR = 4.27, 95% CI, 1.13–16.16) following concussion. A larger proportion of adolescents attending schools located in areas of greater neighborhood disadvantage took more than 21 and 28 days to return to sports. These results indicate an association between a multi-faceted proxy indicator of neighborhood disadvantage and clinical outcome following concussion. Further research is needed to better characterize factors underlying group differences in time to return to sports and the interactions between neighborhood disadvantage and other correlates of clinical recovery following concussion.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^fc25c424]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### Organized sports for children, preadolescents, and adolescents [^f6e663c4]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Organized sports for children, preadolescents, and adolescents — benefits extend to suicidality-related outcomes, as team sports protect against feelings of hopelessness and suicidality after controlling for physical activity and organized sports participation is associated with a lower likelihood of suicidal behavior. Lower rates of suicidal ideation during high school have been observed in athletes compared with those who never played sports, and high school athletic involvement reduces the odds of contemplating suicide in both boys and girls while adolescent athletic participation is associated with a lower tendency to attempt suicide. These findings may relate to team sports fostering feelings of social support and integration.

Results

Response and baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics of all students are shown in table 1. A total of 137 students were enrolled in the educational programmes, 134 students gave consent to participate and finally 130 students were included in the analyses. The four excluded students all dropped out of the educational programme within 4 months due to personal reasons (no injuries), resulting in a response lower than 30%. In total, 1279 questionnaires were sent to the students and 1020 were completed, resulting in a response rate of 79.7%.
