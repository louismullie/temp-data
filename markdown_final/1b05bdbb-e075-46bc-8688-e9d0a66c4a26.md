## Question

Pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a specific diastolic blood pressure threshold related to pacemakers, what that threshold might be, and how it should be interpreted in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold" could mean in different contexts. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or consensus defines such a threshold. Next, I will examine device-based blood pressure therapies that might create a diastolic target. After that, I should review pacemaker syndrome and its hemodynamic criteria. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically grounded answer and clarify what clinicians should monitor instead of a nonexistent "diastolic threshold".

> Let me first confirm the terminology ambiguity, because I need to ensure we are not conflating distinct concepts. "Pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold" could refer to a device-programmed target for blood pressure control, a hemodynamic definition of pacemaker syndrome using diastolic pressure, a lower diastolic safety threshold during pacing, or simply the general hypertension thresholds applied to patients who happen to have pacemakers; none of these are interchangeable, so I should keep them analytically separate while I check the literature for each.

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative guideline or consensus statement actually defines a pacemaker-specific diastolic blood pressure threshold. I should double-check the ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia and device guidance, the HRS/ACCF mode-selection consensus, and contemporary hypertension guidelines; I find no document that specifies a pacemaker-specific diastolic threshold, which strongly suggests there is no such endorsed metric in pacing science or device therapy algorithms [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine device-based blood pressure control therapies, because I need to check whether they implicitly create a diastolic target. Programmable hypertension control (PHC), also called atrioventricular interval modulation (AVIM), reduces systolic blood pressure by alternating short and longer AV delays to modulate preload and baroreflexes; importantly, the pivotal studies show robust reductions in systolic pressure with no significant change in diastolic pressure, indicating there is no diastolic target embedded in these algorithms and that diastolic pressure is not a therapy endpoint in this context [^113neHRG] [^115dsg6p] [^115KgSFy].

> Hold on, I should verify the hemodynamic criteria for pacemaker syndrome, because sometimes clinicians colloquially refer to a "threshold" in that setting. Pacemaker syndrome is typically defined by symptoms plus a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg during ventricular pacing; MOST and related analyses operationalize this using systolic pressure, not diastolic, and they emphasize that no baseline parameter reliably predicts who will develop clinically significant pacemaker syndrome, reinforcing that there is no validated diastolic threshold for diagnosis or management decisions here [^1151EKKY] [^112Y6wnC].

> I need to ensure I consider general hypertension thresholds that apply to patients with pacemakers, because clinicians often conflate device care with BP targets. Contemporary guidelines define hypertension and treatment thresholds using standard office and out-of-office cut points (for example, office DBP ≥ 90 mmHg; ambulatory awake DBP ≥ 85 mmHg; 24-hour DBP ≥ 80 mmHg), and they apply these uniformly unless there are patient-specific modifiers; they do not introduce pacemaker-specific diastolic thresholds, so management should follow guideline-directed therapy rather than any device-centric DBP target [^112rLqkS] [^116du5uT] [^111Yszre].

> But wait, what if the question is really about safety — does pacing push diastolic pressure too low and, if so, is there a lower DBP threshold to avoid? Observational and physiologic data describe a diastolic J-curve phenomenon where very low diastolic pressures, particularly below about 60 mmHg in some populations, associate with worse outcomes; however, these are not pacemaker-specific thresholds and should be interpreted as general hemodynamic risk markers rather than device-programmed limits, so I should caution against overinterpreting them as pacing targets [^11215ePY] [^116wtt7v] [^111qRWU6].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit. There is no pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold endorsed by guidelines or device consensus. PHC/AVIM therapies target systolic pressure without a diastolic endpoint, pacemaker syndrome criteria hinge on systolic pressure change with symptoms, and general hypertension thresholds remain the same in patients with pacemakers. Therefore, clinicians should manage blood pressure per standard hypertension guidance and monitor for pacing-related hemodynamic effects using established clinical and echocardiographic assessments rather than chasing a nonexistent diastolic threshold [^116QRMNT] [^112rLqkS] [^116du5uT] [^113neHRG] [^115dsg6p].

> I should double-check practical implications so the recommendation is actionable. In patients with pacemakers who have persistent hypertension, consider evidence-based device-based BP control (PHC/AVIM) for systolic lowering where available, while continuing guideline-directed pharmacologic therapy and ambulatory BP monitoring; if symptoms suggest pacemaker syndrome, evaluate for a systolic BP drop during ventricular pacing and consider reprogramming to atrial-based pacing rather than focusing on diastolic metrics, which aligns with trial-derived practice patterns and guideline direction [^113neHRG] [^115KgSFy] [^1151EKKY].

There is **no established pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold** for device programming or clinical decision-making. Pacemaker therapy is guided by bradycardia indications, not diastolic BP targets [^112y9Cit]. Diastolic BP is monitored for general cardiovascular risk, but **no guideline defines a pacemaker-specific diastolic threshold**. Pacemaker syndrome may present with hypotension, but it is defined by symptoms and hemodynamics, not a specific diastolic value [^1151EKKY]. Clinicians should manage hypertension per standard guidelines and adjust pacing only for bradyarrhythmic indications or documented pacemaker syndrome [^112rLqkS].

---

## Clinical indications for pacemaker implantation

Pacemaker implantation is indicated primarily for **bradyarrhythmias and conduction disorders**, including:

- **Symptomatic bradycardia**: Sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) block causing syncope, presyncope, or fatigue [^111egJ7J].
- **Asymptomatic bradycardia**: Certain high-grade AV blocks or conduction disorders [^111egJ7J].
- **Heart failure**: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for select patients with reduced ejection fraction and electrical dyssynchrony [^notfound].

These indications are based on **heart rate, rhythm, and symptoms**, not diastolic blood pressure thresholds [^notfound].

---

## Pacemaker syndrome and blood pressure considerations

Pacemaker syndrome is characterized by **hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, and chest discomfort** due to loss of AV synchrony or inappropriate pacing parameters [^112Y6wnC]. It is diagnosed clinically based on symptoms and hemodynamic changes, not a specific diastolic blood pressure threshold [^1151EKKY]. Although hypotension may occur, **no standardized diastolic threshold** is used to define or manage pacemaker syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) provide **no specific diastolic blood pressure thresholds** for pacemaker implantation, programming, or follow-up [^notfound]. Pacemaker therapy is guided by bradyarrhythmic indications, symptom burden, and hemodynamic response — not diastolic blood pressure targets [^111egJ7J].

---

## Clinical implications of diastolic blood pressure in pacemaker patients

While diastolic blood pressure is important for cardiovascular risk stratification and management, **no specific diastolic threshold** guides pacemaker therapy. Clinicians should:

- **Monitor blood pressure**: Regularly assess and manage hypertension or hypotension per standard guidelines [^112rLqkS].
- **Adjust pacing parameters**: Modify AV delay, pacing mode, or rate response based on symptoms and hemodynamics, not diastolic thresholds [^115TDtNv].
- **Evaluate for pacemaker syndrome**: If suspected, assess and adjust pacing parameters to restore AV synchrony and improve hemodynamics [^1151EKKY].

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Relevance of diastolic blood pressure** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pacemaker implantation | Not used as a criterion | Implantation based on bradyarrhythmic indications and symptoms [^111egJ7J] |
| Pacemaker syndrome | Hypotension may occur, but no specific diastolic threshold defined | Diagnosis and management based on symptoms and hemodynamics [^1151EKKY] |
| Pacemaker programming | No specific diastolic threshold recommended | Programming based on symptoms, hemodynamics, and patient-specific factors [^114ZGDKa] |

---

## Conclusion

There is **no established pacemaker diastolic blood pressure threshold** for clinical decision-making. Pacemaker therapy is guided by bradyarrhythmic indications, symptoms, and hemodynamic response, not diastolic blood pressure targets. Clinicians should manage blood pressure per standard guidelines and adjust pacing parameters based on symptoms and hemodynamics, not specific diastolic thresholds [^112rLqkS].

More generally, the differences in the time constants of blood pressure changes observed with onset and cessation of short atrioventricular delay pacing (Figure 2 A) suggested that the optimal sequence of short and long atrioventricular delay pacing consists of 8‐to‐13 beats with short atrioventricular delay (in the range of 20–80 ms) followed by 1‐to‐3 beats with longer atrioventricular delay (in the range of 100–180 ms). A specific, effective combination of atrioventricular delay and number of beats for each phase can be easily identified for each patient by directly observing blood pressure responses in a short optimization procedure.

Changes in Medical Therapies During Study Period

Over the 3‐month study period, 1 patient had an increase in calcium channel blocker dose, 3 had an increase in loop diuretic dose, and 1 had an increase in potassium‐sparing diuretic dose. In contrast, 2 patients had a decrease in calcium channel blocker dose, 2 had a decrease in angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor dose, 2 had a decrease in loop diuretic dose, 1 had a decrease in alpha adrenergic inhibitor dose, 2 had decreases in angiotensin receptor blocker dose, and 1 had a reduction in imidazoline I 1 receptor blocker dose. Thus, on balance, there were more instances in which drug doses were decreased than increased during the study period.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^113YXRbt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

After all inclusion criteria and the absence of exclusion criteria were confirmed, patients underwent Moderato IPG implantation. The pacemaker parameters were programmed as per the normal clinical needs of the patient; the PHC algorithm was not activated at this time. The patients were followed for 1 month in a Run‐In phase with standard pacemaker programming during which blood pressure stability was assessed; patients who met the blood pressure inclusion criteria (oSBP > 140 mm Hg at 2 and 4 weeks) during the Run‐In phase were enrolled into the 3‐month therapy phase during which PHC therapy was active. The day on which PHC therapy was activated served as the study start date (time = 0).

During the Run‐In phase, patients were seen in the office 2 weeks after device implantation (corresponding with time point −2 weeks relative to the study start date) for a blood pressure check, device interrogation, and a 24‐hour Holter monitor to confirm proper functioning of the pacemaker and provide a baseline level of arrhythmic events. Approximately halfway through enrollment into the study, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was added at this visit to enable assessment of changes in ambulatory blood pressure attributable to participation in the study (ie, Hawthorne effect 6); this was added after the results of the Renal Denervation in Patients with Uncontrolled Hypertension – SYMPLICITY HTN‐3 study 7 unexpectedly showed that in addition to office blood pressure, even the more objective ambulatory blood pressure measurements decreased significantly in the control group. Patients were seen again 4 weeks after device implantation for a final office BP check, before PHC therapy activation. Patients in whom oSBPs remained > 140 mm Hg on both the week 2 and week 4 visits were eligible for continuation to the PHC Hypertension Therapy phase of the study. These patients also underwent an echocardiogram and repeat blood tests. Patients not eligible for continuation were withdrawn from the treatment phase of the study.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) — principles of treatment: In the absence of other controlled clinical trials, management is based on control of physiological factors (blood pressure, heart rate, blood volume, and myocardial ischemia) that affect ventricular relaxation. Physicians should make every effort to control both systolic and diastolic hypertension with effective antihypertensive therapy, with consideration at least to achieving blood pressure targets lower than those for uncomplicated hypertension, e.g., less than 130 mm Hg systolic and less than 80 mm Hg diastolic. Because myocardial ischemia can impair ventricular relaxation, coronary revascularization should be considered when ischemia is exerting a deleterious effect on cardiac function. Because tachycardia shortens filling and perfusion time, drugs that slow the heart rate or the ventricular response to atrial arrhythmias (beta-blockers, digoxin, and some calcium channel blockers) can provide symptomatic relief in HF with normal LVEF. Circulating blood volume is a major determinant of ventricular filling pressure, and the use of diuretics may improve breathlessness in HF with normal or reduced LVEF; other possible agents to reduce diastolic filling pressures are nitrates or agents that block neurohumoral activation, but hypotension may be a significant problem in this population, especially in the very elderly. Recommendations regarding anticoagulation and antiarrhythmic agents apply to all patients with HF, irrespective of LVEF.

### Diastolic hypotension due to intensive blood pressure therapy: is it harmful? [^111qRWU6]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Reducing the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below a certain threshold may lead to inadequate organ perfusion. This raises some concerns, because pharmacotherapy reduces both systolic and diastolic pressure. We aimed to investigate whether a pathway from intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment influences cardiovascular outcomes by inducing too low DBP.

Methods

We had access to data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) including 9361 patients with a SBP of 130 mmHg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk. In a formal mediation analysis, we investigated whether the effect of intense (target SBP: 120 mm Hg) vs. standard (target SBP: 140 mmHg) intervention on a composite endpoint would be mediated through an indirect, potentially harmful, effect through low DBP (< 60 mmHg).

Results

Adjusting for treatment, we find that low DBP per se is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes (HR 1.90 (95% CI [1.46, 2.47]). However, in a formal mediation analyses, we observed that the unadjusted indirect effect of intensive blood pressure treatment going through low DBP of HR 1.12 (95% CI [1.06, 1.18]) attenuates to a statistically non-significant effect of HR 1.04 (95% CI [0.98, 1.10]) after adjustment for important covariates, suggesting that the mere association is considerably confounded.

Conclusions

The increased risk in subjects with diastolic pressure below 60 cannot fully be explained by the intensive treatment itself, but may be due to other measured factors. More generally, this analysis shows that adjusting for mediator-outcome confounding is essential, even in RCTs.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Adults without clinical CVD at increased CVD risk — diastolic threshold and evidence: Among higher-risk adults without clinical CVD, initiation of antihypertensive therapy at an average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) threshold of ≥ 80 mm Hg reduces CVD events. Although elevated DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg was used as an entry criterion in the ABCD trial, trials have not exclusively enrolled individuals with DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg. A meta-analysis reported a prerandomization average DBP of 89 mm Hg across 48 RCTs among 186988 patients without previous CVD who benefited from initiating antihypertensive therapy for BP lowering.

Pacemaker implantation risks and discussions — Pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients; nevertheless, because pacemaker implantation or revision is frequently performed in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, frailty, and competing risks of mortality, adverse events such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure. A thorough discussion should take place with the patient before the procedure outlining the potential individualized, patient-specific benefits and risks, including the implications of living with an implantable electrophysiology device that includes a discussion of a patient's health goals, preferences, and values. Patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL, and in those with terminal progressive illness the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome; although the risks of pacemaker implantation are relatively low, the benefit-risk ratio is not so favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low, and these pros and cons can be discussed with the patient and include family with patient permission, or the patient's family or surrogate if the patient does not have capacity.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^113neHRG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients requiring a pacemaker have persistent hypertension with systolic blood pressures above recommended levels. We evaluated a pacemaker-based Programmable Hypertension Control (PHC) therapy that uses a sequence of variably timed shorter and longer atrioventricular intervals.

Methods and Results

Patients indicated for dual-chamber pacing with office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) > 150 mm Hg despite stable medical therapy were implanted with a Moderato™ pulse generator that delivers PHC therapy. Patients were followed for 1 month (Run-In period) with conventional pacing; those with persistent oSBP > 140 mm Hg were included in the study and had PHC therapy activated. The co-primary efficacy end points were changes in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure and oSBP between baseline and 3 months. Safety was assessed by tracking adverse events. Thirty-five patients met the initial inclusion criteria and underwent Moderato implantation. At 1 month, oSBP was < 140 mm Hg in 7 patients who were excluded. PHC was activated in the remaining 27 patients with baseline office blood pressure 166 ± 11/80 ± 10 mm Hg despite an average of 3.2 antihypertensive medications. During the Run-In period, oSBP and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure decreased by 8 ± 13 and 5 ± 12 mm Hg (P < 0.002), respectively. Compared with pre-PHC activation measurements, oSBP decreased by another 16 ± 15 mm Hg and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure decreased by an additional 10 ± 13 mm Hg (both P < 0.01) at 3 months. No device-related serious adverse effects were noted.

Conclusions

In pacemaker patients with persistent hypertension despite medical therapy, oSBP and 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure are decreased by PHC therapy. Initial indications are that this therapy is a safe and promising therapy for such patients.

### The diastolic J curve: alive and threatening [^11215ePY]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The occurrence of additional cardiovascular events when the diastolic blood pressure is lowered below a critical level is referred to as "the diastolic J curve". Although the critical level of diastolic blood pressure where the J curve begins is not certain, increasingly strong evidence from prospective, controlled studies has confirmed the existence of such a J curve. With the likely addition of more patients who will be treated more vigorously, in particular, elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension, the potential for an increase in the number of adverse cardiovascular events must be considered and caution used to avoid too low a diastolic blood pressure.

### Heart rate reduction decreases central blood pressure in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker [^111atkLK]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Increased resting heart rate (HR) contributes to higher cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the healthy as well as in people with cardiovascular diseases, possibly due to elevated blood pressure (BP) among other mechanisms. Data on the relationship between HR and central (aortic) BP remains controversial, however, and concerning β-blockers, it has been proposed that pharmacological HR lowering is associated with augmentation of central BP. We aimed to study the role of pharmacologically unaffected HR on central BP indices in sick sinus syndrome patients with a permanent cardiac pacemaker in the HR range from 40 to 90 bpm. We included 27 subjects (mean age 65.8 ± 9.5 years, 12 men) with a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted due to sick sinus syndrome. We determined central hemodynamic indices noninvasively during an atrial pacing mode at low (40 bpm), middle (60 bpm), and high (90 bpm) HR levels with an oscillometric cuff-based device (Sphygmocor XCEL). There was no difference in central systolic BP at the middle versus the high HR level (mean 121.2 ± 13.0 and 121.2 ± 12.1mmHg, respectively, P = 0.9), but at the low HR level, it was significantly lower than at the middle HR level (mean 117.2 ± 13.1 and 121.2 ± 13.0mmHg, P < 0.01). Our acute study provides evidence to suggest that at a HR of < 60 bpm, sick sinus syndrome patients may have a lower central BP than at a higher HR, despite the proposed augmenting effects of low HR on central BP.

PHC Parameters Optimization

An example of noninvasively acquired beat‐by‐beat SBP values (using Finapres) from a patient undergoing PHC therapy optimization (Figure 2) illustrates both of the proposed mechanisms of action defined above. First, consider the effects of simple, sustained short atrioventricular delay pacing (Figure 2 A). The first 30 s shown on this graph serve as baseline blood pressure measurements. Note the slow periodic fluctuations in blood pressure (on the order of ≈10 mm Hg) that are because of respiration. At time 0.5 minutes (green arrow), pacing was initiated with an atrioventricular delay of 40 ms and an immediate ≈40 mm Hg drop in blood pressure was observed. However, this was followed by a relatively rapid, beat‐by‐beat exponential rise of blood pressure that reached a new steady level after ≈35 s that was only ≈5 mm Hg below the initial baseline value. This secondary increase of pressure represents baroreflex‐mediated sympathetic activation that increases peripheral vascular resistance. This interpretation is supported by the fact that when atrioventricular delay was returned to its original longer value after ≈1 minute (red arrow), SBP jumped immediately, overshooting the initial baseline value. The degree of pressure overshoot provides an index of the degree to which vascular resistance was increased during the period of short atrioventricular pacing. In response to this increase of pressure, reflex‐mediated vasodilation was next observed, evidenced by the fast beat‐by‐beat blood pressure decline back to the initial baseline value. In contrast to the ≈35 s it took for pressure to stabilize with the initiation of short atrioventricular delay pacing, it is important to note that the time course of blood pressure decline during this phase is relatively fast, returning to baseline values in < 10 s. These differential responses of blood pressure kinetics to increases versus decreases in blood pressure, which was observed in all patients, suggested an asymmetric response of the baroreflex to increases and decreases in blood pressure. Specifically, the response to an increase of pressure is faster than a decrease in pressure.

### Atomoxetine [^115vSsxK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Atomoxetine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate [see Contraindications (4.5)]. Pulse and blood pressure should be measured at baseline, following atomoxetine hydrochloride dose increases, and periodically while on therapy to detect possible clinically important increases.

The following table provides short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trial data for the proportions of patients having an increase in: diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg; systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg; heart rate greater than or equal to 20 bpm, in both the pediatric and adult populations (see Table 1).

Table 1a

aAbbreviations: bpm = beats per minute; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; HR = heart rate; mm Hg = millimeters mercury; SBP = systolic blood pressure.

bProportion of patients meeting threshold at any one time during clinical trial.

In placebo-controlled registration studies involving pediatric patients, tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 0.3% (5/1,597) of these atomoxetine hydrochloride patients compared with 0% (0/934) of placebo patients. The mean heart rate increase in extensive metabolizer (EM) patients was 5 beats/minute, and in poor metabolizer (PM) patients 9.4 beats/minute.

### Blood pressure and heart rate immediately after termination of short-term ventricular fibrillation [^111E4eAu]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) can detect ventricular fibrillation (VF) and terminate it. For determining the optimal defibrillation threshold, ventricular fibrillation is repetitively induced and terminated with DC shocks. Depending on the protocol, several fibrillation/defibrillation sequences are mandatory before the final implantation of an ICD. This procedure provides an elegant human model of circulatory arrest and resuscitation.

Patients and Methods

In anesthetized 73 patients (15 females) of on the average 60 ± 11 years, the end-expiratory pressure was set to zero. Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was monitored with a microtip-catheter, central venous pressure (CVP) through a cannula which was advanced into the superior V. cava. ECG was recorded. After testing, a monoexponential function was found to best fit the time courses of LVP, CVP and heart rate. Data are mean ± S.D.

Results

After termination of circulatory arrest, peak LVP increased with a time constant tau of 9.2 ± 4.2 beats, CVP decreased with tau = 2.8 ± 1.5 beats, and RR-intervals decreased with tau = 4.3 ± 3.5 beats. Correlations between prefibrillatory values and steady-state values after termination of fibrillation were high: peak LVP: r = 0.78; CVP: r = 0.95; RRI: r = 0.82.

Summary

After DC termination of VF, the heart 'finds' relatively quickly a steady-state rhythm at the prefibrillatory level (22 beats), thereby normalizing CVP almost in parallel (14 beats). Peak LVP plateaus only after about 40 beats, although reasonable arterial pressures are reached within the first beats. Our data are limited to periods of ventricular fibrillation of no longer than 60s, which limits the generalisability to the setting of clinical cardiac arrest.

### Programmable hypertension control: another possible indication for implanted pacemakers [^114ghYd7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Many potential concerns about the safety and quality of life effects of the PHC algorithm also remain unanswered, some of which cannot be answered by a small pilot study, and some not addressed by the study protocol. Though the authors did not find any significant change in LV systolic function, much larger studies have demonstrated that chronic RV pacing, which the PHC algorithm utilizes, can increase the risk of heart failure, particularly in patients with preexisting cardiomyopathies. 14, 15 The use of short AV delays can also potentially cause a pacemaker syndrome and increased risk of atrial fibrillation and result in sympathoexcitation. 16 Indeed pacing the heart results in a neural signature of sympathoexcitation as recorded directly from cardiac neurons. 17 Exercise capacity was also not addressed in this study: the putative antihypertensive mechanism of the PHC algorithm, via decreasing cardiac preload and output, could increase fatigue or dyspnea with exertion in physically active patients. This algorithm would also not be effective during atrial fibrillation when mode switching is necessary, so remote or frequent office monitoring of AT/AF burden would be necessary to confirm ongoing effectiveness. It is also not clear what predicts response to the PHC algorithm: while some patients did not have any decrease in blood pressure, others responded remarkably raising the question of how we might be able to better identify the subgroup of patients who have the best chance of response.

If proven effective and safe, however, the potential benefit of the PHC algorithm would be significant. Many patients with indications for dual chamber pacemakers have comorbid hypertension 18 and this algorithm could serve to replace one or more antihypertensive medications, which could lead to cost savings and improvement in quality of life, particularly in this more elderly population where polypharmacy is a major concern.

For now, though, we must await the results of the investigators' randomized controlled study and continued basic and translational work on cardiac neurobiology to better guide and interpret these studies.

### Thresholds for conventional and home blood pressure by sex and age in 5018 participants from 5 populations [^111JuQ4F]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Whether blood pressure thresholds for hypertension should differ according to sex or age remains debated. We did a subject-level meta-analysis of 5018 people untreated for hypertension and randomly recruited from 5 populations (women, 56.7%; ≥ 60 years, 42.3%). We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression and a bootstrap procedure to determine home blood pressure (HBP) levels yielding 10-year cardiovascular risks similar to those associated with established systolic/diastolic thresholds (140–160/80–100 mm Hg) for the conventional blood pressure (CBP). Conversely, we estimated CBP thresholds providing 10-year cardiovascular risks similar to those associated established HBP levels (125–135/80–85 mm Hg). All analyses were stratified for sex and age (< 60 versus ≥ 60 years). During 8.3 years (median), 414 participants experienced a cardiovascular event. The sex differences between HBP thresholds derived from CBP and between CBP thresholds derived from HBP were all nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.24), ranging from -4.6 to 3.6 mm Hg systolic and from -4.3 to 2.1 mm Hg diastolic. The age differences between HBP thresholds derived from CBP and between CBP thresholds derived from HBP ranged from -6.7 to 8.4 mm Hg systolic and from -1.9 to 1.7 mm Hg diastolic and were nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.08), except for HBP thresholds derived from CBP levels of 140 mm Hg systolic and 80 mm Hg diastolic (P ≤ 0.04). Sensitivity analyses based on cardiac or cerebrovascular complications were confirmatory. In conclusion, our findings based on outcome-driven criteria support contemporary guidelines that propose single blood pressure thresholds that can be indiscriminately applied in both sexes and across the age range.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^111QSWPL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This first‐in‐human study provides initial evidence that hypertension treatment with a pacemaker‐based device that paces the heart with variably timed shorter and longer atrioventricular intervals appears safe and effective at intermediate‐term follow‐up. The current study included patients already having or requiring implantation of a pacemaker. This approach markedly improves the safety profile of the therapy since these patients would have been exposed to the risks associated with pacemaker implantation or replacement regardless of their participation in this study or use of PHC pacing therapy. Another advantage of this therapy compared with other device‐based therapies is the ability to adjust and "tune" the PHC therapy when needed, enabling tailored control of blood pressure. The evidence available thus far indicates that this therapy results in intermediate‐term reductions in blood pressure without evidence of sympathetic activation. Factors requiring further clarification in longer‐term randomized studies include assessments of safety (impact on LV size and function, atrial size and arrhythmias), and the impact on sympathetic nervous activation and efficacy. With further proof of safety and efficacy, such a therapy could potentially be expanded to include patients not requiring a pacemaker.

### Programmable hypertension control: another possible indication for implanted pacemakers [^114EkCgY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic analysis showed a slight decrease in LV end diastolic volume (median decrease 6 mL, IQR 23) with no significant change LV end systolic volume, LV ejection fraction, or left atrial dimension. No significant rhythm changes were noted, though the authors did find an initial small increase in average heart rate from 68.9 ± 9.4 to 73.5 ± 10.1 bpm, which returned to pre‐PHC activation levels by 3 month follow‐up, potentially signifying that transient reflex sympathetic activation does still occur. Safety outcomes were deemed acceptable by the data safety monitoring board, with adverse outcomes as expected for pacemaker implantations and patients with similar comorbidities.

These results are compelling and indeed encouraging, but in the context of prior attempts at device‐based therapies for hypertension, the results of this non‐randomized pilot study should be considered with cautious optimism while we await the findings of their double‐blinded randomized controlled trial (NCT02837445). The authors should be congratulated for incorporating the lessons learned from the prior studies and addressing them appropriately, such as using a run‐in period with ambulatory monitoring before PHC initiation. Medication changes, though left to the discretion of managing clinicians, were also decreased more frequently than they were increased. However, the biases inherent in a single‐arm, non‐randomized study persist.

### The acute effects of changes to AV delay on BP and stroke volume: potential implications for design of pacemaker optimization protocols [^115TDtNv]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The AV delay optimization of biventricular pacemakers (cardiac resynchronization therapy) may maximize hemodynamic benefit but consumes specialist time to conduct echocardiographically. Noninvasive BP monitoring is a potentially automatable alternative, but it is unknown whether it gives the same information and similar precision (signal/noise ratio). Moreover, the immediate BP increment on optimization has been reported to decay away: it is unclear whether this is the result of an (undesirable) decrease in stroke volume or a (desirable) compensatory relief of peripheral vasoconstriction.

Methods and Results

To discriminate between these alternative mechanisms, we measured simultaneous beat-to-beat stroke volume (flow) using Doppler echocardiography, and BP using finger photoplethysmography, during and after AV delay changes from 40 to 120 ms in 19 subjects with cardiac pacemakers. BP and stroke volume both increased immediately (P < 0.001, within 1 heartbeat). BP showed a clear decline a few seconds later (average rate, -0.65 mm Hg/beat; r = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]); in contrast, stroke volume did not decline (P = 0.87). The immediate BP increment correlated strongly with the stroke volume increment (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). The signal/noise ratio was 3-fold better for BP than stroke volume (6.8 ± 3.5 versus 2.3 ± 1.4; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Improving AV delay immediately increases BP, but the effect begins to decay within a few seconds. Reassuringly, this is because of compensatory vasodilatation rather than reduction in cardiac function. Pacemaker optimization will never be reliable unless there is an adequate signal/noise ratio. Using BP rather than Doppler minimizes noise. The early phase (before vascular compensation) has the richest signal lode.

### Changes in inferior vena cava area represent a more sensitive metric than changes in filling pressures during experimental manipulation of intravascular volume and tone [^116383MJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Experimental protocol

Nitroglycerin infusion

The purpose of the nitroglycerin experiment was to acutely manipulate vascular (venous) tone in the setting of stable intravascular volume. Nitroglycerin was infused at a rate of 1000 µg/min as a vasodilatory stimulus. IVC area measured by the sensor, as well as right atrial pressure (RAP), and PAPs were monitored throughout the experiment.

Volume experiment

First, blood was extracted from the animal to bring the animals to an initial starting RAP of approximately 2 mmHg. All extracted blood was stored in standard citrate phosphate dextrose adenine blood collection bags to maintain the blood stable for re‐infusion. After an approximate 30‐min period of equilibration allowing plasma refill, the extracted blood and hydroxyethyl starch (1:1 mixture) was injected in progressively larger boluses (50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml, etc.) with 2 min of equilibration after each bolus. Volume loading was continued until a goal RAP of 15 mmHg or clinical instability (e.g. progressive hypoxia) occurred. When the removed blood was exhausted, hydroxyethyl starch was infused alone. IVC area measured by the implanted sensor, as well as RAP and PAPs were monitored throughout the infusion period.

Rapid cardiac pacing

The purpose of the cardiac pacing experiment was to manipulate cardiac function in the setting of a stable intravascular volume. Rapid cardiac pacing can induce acute systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction; in addition, it is a stimulus for vasoconstriction with subsequent redistribution of fluid from unstressed to stressed compartments. In a subset of animals, rapid right ventricular pacing was performed via transvenous pacing at 170 bpm. The threshold of 170 bpm was chosen because preliminary experiments showed that at this rate, mean arterial pressure decreased to < 70 mmHg and cardiac index decreased to < 3.0 L/min.

### Long term monitoring in patients receiving treatment to lower blood pressure: analysis of data from placebo controlled randomised controlled trial [^117N6fp5]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Observed long term changes in blood pressure will incorporate the "true" average change in the blood pressure, twice the short term variability (once for the initial measurement and once for the subsequent measurement), and the "long term variability" — that is,

[observed change in blood pressure from baseline] = [true average change in blood pressure] + 2 × (short term variability) + (long term variability)].

The long term variability is the "between person" variability caused by individuals' long term changes in blood pressure deviating above or below the average change of the group. The long term variance can be estimated from the total observed variance of the difference in blood pressure measurements from the baseline to each subsequent time point. The above equation shows that subtracting twice the short term variance from the total observed variance of the change will give an estimate of the long term variance (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

Using the calculated change in variance at each time point, we estimated the proportion of patients whose assumed true baseline systolic blood pressure of 130 or 120 mm Hg would truly increase by 10 or 20 mm Hg (called true positives) to a threshold of 140 mm Hg or above while receiving treatment. We also estimated the proportion of patients who would be observed to be above the thresholds but who actually had true blood pressure levels below the threshold (that is, false positives). We repeated this for an assumed true baseline diastolic blood pressure of 85 or 80 mm Hg and used changes in blood pressure of 5 or 10 mm Hg to reach a threshold of 90 mm Hg or above. For both systolic and diastolic blood pressure we estimated these assuming no change in mean blood pressure over the three year period. In sensitivity analyses we also estimated the true and false positive probabilities assuming an average 1.0 mm Hg per year increase in systolic blood pressure and a 0.5 mm Hg per year increase in diastolic blood pressure. The calculations assume that the baseline value and the true change with time are normally distributed and are independent of each other. See appendix 1 on bmj.com for full details of the methods.

Pacemaker implantation care — In patients with bradycardia who have indications for pacemaker implantation, shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized, and treatment decisions are based on the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences. Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide, and any decision is complex, should involve all stakeholders, and will always be patient specific.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^115jM2zo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

There is growing appreciation for the relatively high incidence and socioeconomic impact of persistent hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy. This has motivated the investigation of nonpharmacologic approaches. 7, 10, 11, 12 The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of a pacemaker‐based therapy that takes advantage of the fact that ventricular pressure generation is preload dependent and that preload can be manipulated by altering atrioventricular pacing delay. With this approach, it was demonstrated that average SBP assessed by 24‐hour ambulatory monitoring was decreased by a clinically meaningful and statistically significant 14 mm Hg from baseline following 3 months of pacemaker‐based treatment using the PHC therapy, a sequence of pacing signals with variably timed shorter and longer atrioventricular intervals. In the subset of patients in whom ambulatory blood pressure was also measured during the 1‐month Run‐In phase, there was an initial 5.3 mm Hg decline in SBP (possibly Hawthorne effect 6) followed by an additional, statistically significant 10 mm Hg reduction after 3 months of therapy. These findings were paralleled by changes in office‐based blood pressure measurements; mean SBP decreased by 7.8 mm Hg from baseline during the Run‐In phase. SBP further decreased by 16.1 mm Hg from preactivation to +3 months of therapy, which corresponded to a 23.8 mm Hg drop from baseline values. The reductions in blood pressure were maintained throughout the 3‐month study period. These results have extended to longer follow‐up, which has reached 2 years in some patients. The individual results demonstrated a high response rate compared with other device therapies.

Methods

Study design and cohort

From 9831 exercise tests performed at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System in Palo Alto, California between 1987 and 2007, we considered the 9079 (92.3%) tests performed by males on a treadmill. We excluded 758 subjects with missing data in terms of SBP at rest and/or peak exercise, exercise capacity (in metabolic equivalents (METs)), birth date, test date or date of death. We also excluded 422 subjects with any of the following pre-existing comorbidities: (1) heart failure; (2) congenital heart disease; (3) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; (4) implanted pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator; (5) heart transplant or cardiac support device and (6) severe valvular heart disease. We also excluded the following subjects: (1) those with a follow-up time < 26 weeks (n = 102); (2) subjects with an SBP standing at rest < 80 mm Hg or > 250 mm Hg (n = 19); (3) subjects reaching a peak MET value < 3 (n = 157) or a peak Borg rating of perceived exertion < 15 in combination with < 70% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (n = 79); (4) those with a drop or no increase (0 mm Hg) in SBP from rest to peak exercise (n = 244) and (5) subjects ≥ 80 years, as the age span for the reference standards used in the current study was 20–79 years (n = 134).

From each subject's computerised medical record, demographic, clinical and medication information was obtained prior to the exercise test. We ascertained vital status of the participants as of 20 July 2018. Date of death was verified using the VA Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator System File. Follow-up time was defined as the time from the exercise test to either date of death or the date when a subject was last verified to be alive.

### Inverse relationship of blood pressure levels to sudden cardiac mortality and benefit of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction [^113JrTCx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to evaluate the relationship among blood pressure (BP) levels, risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and benefit of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

Background

Low BP has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in patients with LV dysfunction and heart failure. We hypothesized that increasing BP levels are associated with a reduction in the risk of SCD in this population, thereby limiting ICD efficacy in a lower-risk subset.

Methods

The independent contribution of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to outcome was analyzed in 1,231 patients enrolled in the prospective MADIT-II (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II).

Results

Multivariate analysis showed that in the conventional therapy arm of the trial, 10-mm Hg increments in systolic BP were independently associated with a respective 14% (p = 0.01) and 16% (p = 0.04) reduction in the risk of cardiac mortality and SCD; similar trends were shown for DBP. Defibrillator therapy provided the least survival benefit to patients in the lower-risk, upper SBP (> 130 mm Hg) and DBP (≥ 80 mm Hg) quartiles (hazard ratio 1.04 [p = 0.89] and 1.05 [p = 0.88], respectively), whereas a respective 39% and 38% (p = 0.002) reduction in the risk of death with ICD therapy was observed among patients with lower BP values.

Conclusions

In patients with ischemic LV dysfunction, SBP and DBP levels show an inverse correlation with sudden cardiac mortality. These noninvasive hemodynamic parameters may be useful for identifying lower-risk patients, in whom the benefit of primary defibrillator implantation is more limited.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age. In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life.

In the general population younger than 60 years, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. The target systolic pressure in this population is less than 140 mm Hg, and the target diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, the treatment threshold and target blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years.

If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^113nEiLB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Patients eligible for continuation had the Moderato PHC therapy activated and were followed for an additional 3 months for the primary safety and efficacy analysis. On the day of activation (which was designated time 0 for the study), the parameters of the PHC pacing algorithm were optimized. For this optimization, blood pressure was measured using a noninvasive continuous blood pressure measurement system (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the changes in pressure in response to PHC stimulation were recorded and analyzed. The PHC therapy parameters, specifically the values for the shorter and the longer atrioventricular intervals and the number of beats with each atrioventricular interval, were adjusted until a significant and sustained reduction in SBP of at least 5 mm Hg was achieved. Immediately following the optimization procedure, a 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring test was initiated. The patients were then seen at 1, 2, and 3 months of PHC therapy (designated as time points +1, +2, and +3 months, respectively). Assessments included office BP measurements at all visits, 24‐hour Holter monitor at +1 month, and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography, and blood tests at +3 months. Echocardiographic images were obtained simultaneously with an ECG. During follow‐up, at each echocardiographic evaluation, echocardiograms were obtained both with PHC off and with PHC active. When PHC therapy was in active mode, measurements were taken from echocardiographic images obtained during the shorter atrioventricular paced beats.

Approximately halfway through enrollment into the study, ambulatory blood pressure measurements and blood tests were added to the +1‐month visit, and blood tests were added to the +2‐month visit. These, and the extra ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 2 weeks following implantation described above, were added in order to provide better definition of the time course of changes in these parameters.

At the end of the +3‐month follow‐up period, PHC therapy could be continued and, if so, patients were followed at 6‐month intervals for safety, device functionality (by pacemaker interrogation), office blood pressure measurements, blood tests, and echocardiography through 24 months.

The study was monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board that adjudicated all serious adverse events and reviewed aggregate safety data throughout the study.

Pacemaker follow-up scheduling and clinic assessments — After implantation of a pacemaker, careful follow-up and continuity of care are required. Programming undertaken at implantation should be reviewed before discharge and changed accordingly at subsequent follow-up visits as indicated by interrogation, testing, and patient needs, and with careful attention to programming pacing amplitude, pulse width, and diagnostic functions, battery life can be enhanced significantly without compromising patient safety. The frequency and method of follow-up are dictated by multiple factors, and a more extensive clinic follow-up usually includes assessment of clinical status, battery status, pacing threshold and pulse width, sensing function, lead integrity, sensor-driven rate response optimization, and evaluation of recorded events. The schedule for clinic follow-up should be at the discretion of caregivers, and as a guideline the 1984 Health Care Financing Administration document suggests: for single-chamber pacemakers, twice in the first 6 months after implantation and then once every 12 months; for dual-chamber pacemakers, twice in the first 6 months, then once every 6 months.

Dual versus single chamber ventricular pacing — comparative outcomes and when single chamber is reasonable: Trials found no mortality or atrial fibrillation (AF) or heart failure benefit for dual chamber pacing, and procedural complications were higher with dual versus single chamber systems (7.8% versus 3.5%; P < 0.001). In patients who do not need chronotropic support and have substantial comorbidity or limited mobility, it is reasonable to implant a single chamber ventricular pacing system, and for those who will only require intermittent support, single chamber ventricular pacing can be a reasonable option; such patients are less likely to develop pacemaker syndrome symptoms (exertional intolerance, hypotension).

### Chronic ambulatory intracardiac pressures and future heart failure events [^113rQ7PH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Intracardiac pressures in heart failure (HF) have been measured in patients while supine in the hospital but change at home with posture and activity. The optimal level of chronic ambulatory pressure is unknown. This analysis compared chronic intracardiac pressures to later HF events and sought a threshold above which higher pressures conferred worse outcomes.

Methods and Results

Median pressures were measured every 24 hours from continuous 8-minute segments for 6 months after implantation of hemodynamic monitors in 261 patients with New York Heart Association class III-IV HF in the Chronicle Offers Management to Patients with Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure Study. Baseline and chronic daily medians of estimated pulmonary artery diastolic, right ventricular systolic, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressures were compared with HF event rate. The group median for chronic 24-hour estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (excluding 7 days before and after events). Despite weight-guided management, events occurred in 100 of 261 (38%) patients. Event risk increased progressively with higher chronic 24-hour estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, from 20% at 18 mm Hg to 34% at 25 mm Hg and 56% at 30 mm Hg, with similar relations for right ventricular pressures. Among patients with baseline day median estimated pulmonary artery diastolic pressures of ≥ 25 mm Hg, event risk was 1.10/6 mo when they remained chronically ≥ 25 mm Hg, but risk fell to 0.47 when 24-hour pressures declined to < 25 mm Hg for more than half of the days.

Conclusions

Despite current management, many patients with advanced HF live on a plateau of high filling pressures from which later events occur. This risk is progressively higher with higher chronic ambulatory pressures. It is not known whether more targeted intervention could maintain lower chronic ambulatory pressures and better outcomes.

### Effects of haemodynamically atrio-ventricular optimized his bundle pacing on heart failure symptoms and exercise capacity: the his optimized pacing evaluated for heart failure (HOPE-HF) randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial [^114ZL7Yp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient flow and follow‐up

After lead and generator implantation, pacing was programmed off (apart from back‐up pacing at 30 bpm that did not use the His lead). Participants then attended the core exercise laboratory at the Hammersmith Hospital (London) for baseline assessments prior to randomization. All participants underwent haemodynamic optimization of AV delay, using the His lead, with beat‐to‐beat, non‐invasive blood pressure measurements. We have previously describedwhy large numbers of repeated alternations are needed for a precise optimization and demonstrated how this process and analysis can be automated. In brief, each paced and sensed AV delay is compared against a fixed reference state; in this study the reference state was intrinsic conduction. We tested a range of AV delays from 40 ms to intrinsic conduction in 40 ms intervals, both during atrial sensing and atrial pacing and thereby a curve of haemodynamic response is thereby constructed for both atrial pacing and atrial sensing. From this curve, the peak is derived. This reveals the pacing configuration that causes the greatest generation of systolic blood pressure. Participants were then randomized 1:1 to pacing programmed on (using the AV delay optimum derived as above) or off. At the end of the first 6‐month period, participants returned to the central trial hub for reassessment, including reassessment of the optimal pacing configuration. Participants then crossed over to the opposite treatment. During the His pacing on period devices had rate adaptive AV delay modification disabled and patients were programmed to DDD programming as opposed to rate adaptive programming.

Acute studies – gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography

Diastolic filling studies were performed using equilibrium R‐wave gated blood pool scintigraphy (camera Olivetti Modulo‐M‐200ESL). Red blood cells were labelled by a modified in vivo technique. 19 In brief, 10 min after intravenous injection of stannous pyrophosphate, 5 mL of blood was drawn into a heparinized syringe and incubated for 20 min with 750 MBq of technetium‐99m pertechnetate before reinjection. Lower body negative pressure was applied by asking patients to lie in a specially constructed lower body suction bed as previously described by us. 20 Internal device pressure was measured via a transducer to achieve suction at 30 mmHg. Suction was turned off during the 0 mmHg negative pressure studies. The protocol was performed with the pacemaker programmed to VVI 30 for the sham pacing arm of the study. For BiV pacing, DDD mode was used, with an atrioventricular (AV) delay of 90 ms to ensure capture of the ventricles, with the left ventricle paced slightly earlier than the right ventricle [interventricular (VV) delay 40 ms]. AV and VV delays were not altered. The order of pacing modes (sham or BiV) was randomized. DVI at rest was inferred if LVEDV paradoxically increased with the application of lower body negative pressure, due to relief of the constraint on the left ventricle caused by the RV diastolic volume, as we have previously described. 21

Pacing check

A complete pacing check may be safely undertaken only if a patient is not pacing dependent, which might be the case if regular pacing spikes are seen on the rhythm strip. Slowly reducing the pacing rate until no pacing spikes are seen reveals both the underlying heart rate and rhythm. Caution should be exercised in patients who become haemodynamically unstable which, for patients in the ward whose blood pressure is not invasively monitored, may only manifest itself symptomatically. It is also not prudent to reduce the pacing rate below 30 bpm because doing so typically indicates that sinus node dysfunction or a high degree atrioventricular block exists, and electrophysiology review should be considered.

In patients who are not pacing dependent, a pacing check may commence with an assessment of the pacing wire sensing thresholds. Sensitivity, which is measured in millivolts, refers to the ability of the pacemaker to sense the current created by the underlying cardiac electrical activity. A pacemaker that is unable to sense the underlying rhythm is said to be undersensing and has a high sensitivity value. An undersensing pacemaker means that the pacemaker is unable to discern where in the cardiac rhythm a pacing spike should be delivered, which risks delivery of random pacing signals. For ventricular pacing wires, an undersensing pacemaker increases the chances of pacing on a T wave in a so-called R on T phenomenon, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Conversely, an oversensing pacemaker means that the pacemaker 'over-reads' the cardiac rhythm such that low voltage deflections are interpreted by the device as P waves or QRS complexes when they are not. In this setting, the opposite is true. The pacemaker will not discharge a pacing spike when in fact it should. Thus, pacing up will not occur for patients with an underlying heart rate below the set pacing rate. The minimum current that the pacemaker can sense is termed the sensing threshold and the sensitivity is often set to half this value to allow for detection of abnormally small signals and for the possibility that peri-lead fibrosis over the course of the day will reduce the current transmitted to the pacemaker. A common issue faced on the ward is of a low sensitivity threshold. It becomes unsafe to set the sensitivity of the device to half the sensing threshold, or even the lowest possible sensitivity setting, because of the risk of undersensing, and R-on-T.

Limitations

The main limitations of the present first‐in‐human study are the nonrandomized study design, the small number of included patients, and the relatively short duration of follow‐up. The acceptable safety profile and strong efficacy signal observed in the present study support further investigation of the technology to address these limitations. Such a study is has been initiated (NCT02837445). In addition, the potential impact of PHC pacing on exercise tolerance has not been evaluated but should also be considered in future studies.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Transcutaneous pacing — availability, evidence, and practical use: Transcutaneous pacing was reported in 1952 and became commercially available in the early 1980s, and it is now universally available in combination with external defibrillators. Numerous trials have not shown an improvement in survival to hospital discharge when used in the prehospital phase of bradysystolic cardiac arrest, and there are no controlled trials of transcutaneous pacing outside the setting of prehospital cardiac arrest; use appears to be greater when applied to patients with a perfusing rhythm or early in the course of cardiac arrest. Use of transcutaneous pacing may be limited by high capture thresholds and patient discomfort, which may require sedation, and assessment of myocardial capture by electrocardiogram (ECG) alone may be difficult and should be confirmed by assessment of pulse or intra-arterial pressure. Because prolonged use of transcutaneous pacing may be unreliable and poorly tolerated, it should generally serve as a short-term bridge to temporary or permanent transvenous pacing or resolution of bradycardia, and prophylactic placement of pads for rapid institution of temporary pacing, if necessary, is reasonable in patients who are thought to be at future risk for significant bradycardia.

Pacemaker syndrome — crossovers, reprogramming, and predictability — In the PASE trial, 26% of patients randomized to VVIR pacing needed crossover to dual-chamber pacing due to severe pacemaker syndrome; in MOST, 38% of patients in the ventricular pacing group had their pacemakers reprogrammed to the dual-chamber mode for symptoms believed due to pacemaker syndrome; of the 996 patients randomized to VVIR pacing, 182 (18.3%) developed severe pacemaker syndrome during follow-up that improved with reprogramming to DDDR pacing; no baseline parameter or data at pacemaker implantation can reliably predict clinically significant pacemaker syndrome, and although a blood pressure drop of ≥ 20 mm Hg associated with symptoms has been used as a definition, a drop in systolic blood pressure during ventricular pacing at implantation did not predict development during follow-up in MOST.

### Long term monitoring in patients receiving treatment to lower blood pressure: analysis of data from placebo controlled randomised controlled trial [^115VDjx1]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Probability of observed increases in blood pressure reflecting true treatment failures

Tables 4and 5show the probabilities that a threshold systolic of 140 mm Hg or diastolic of 90 mm Hg in a treated patient actually represents a true failure of treatment. Findings are shown for monitoring intervals of between three and 33 months after the start of treatment.

Table 4
Estimated number of true positive and false positive measurements of systolic blood pressure over threshold of 140 mm Hg from on treatment baseline "true" measurement of 120 mm Hg or 130 mm Hg

"Positive" test is increase in blood pressure above threshold.

Table 5
Estimated number of true positive and false positive measurements of diastolic blood pressure over threshold of 90 mm Hg from baseline measurement of 80 or 85 mm Hg

"Positive" test is increase in blood pressure above threshold.

We estimated the probabilities in table 4 using the natural log of measurements of systolic blood pressure to normalise the data, assuming no change in the underlying mean blood pressure of the group and a true blood pressure of either 120 or 130 mm Hg at baseline. As such they are the probabilities that an observed increase of 10 or 20 mm Hg from a true baseline systolic blood pressure is in fact a true increase of 10 or 20 mm Hg. For example, suppose that an increase of 20 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure is considered as a "signal" for altering treatment. A patient with a baseline measurement of 120 mm Hg monitored at six months has a 0.02% probability of the measurement truly reaching 140 mm Hg or above. However, 3.4% of individuals would record blood pressure levels of 140 mm Hg or above at six months, meaning that for every one true positive result (that is, a true increase of 20 mm Hg) there would be more than 200 other individuals who had an apparent 20 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure that was caused solely by measurement error.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management thresholds: Unless the patient is eligible for acute reperfusion intervention, systolic blood pressure is usually treated only if it is > 220 mm Hg and diastolic pressure only if it is > 120 mm Hg; in patients who receive rtPA, systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure > 105 mm Hg should be treated with antihypertensive drugs such as labetolol or nicardipine. Hypotension during a stroke can also significantly worsen outcomes, and mortality risk may follow a U-shaped pattern with changes from a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, and physiological derangements contributing to hypotension should be corrected as soon as possible.

Shared decision-making for pacemaker implantation — In patients with symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disorder, clinicians and patients should engage in a shared decision-making approach in which treatment decisions are based not only on the best available evidence, but also on the patient's goals of care, preferences, and values (COR I; LOE C-LD). Patients considering implantation of a pacemaker or with a pacemaker that requires lead revision or generator change should be informed of procedural benefits and risks, including the potential short- and long-term complications and possible alternative therapy, if any, in light of their goals of care, preferences, and values (COR I; LOE C-LD). In patients with indications for permanent pacing but also with significant comorbidities such that pacing therapy is unlikely to provide meaningful clinical benefit, or if patient goals of care strongly preclude pacemaker therapy, implantation or replacement of a pacemaker should not be performed (COR III: No Benefit; LOE C-LD).

### Programmable hypertension control: another possible indication for implanted pacemakers [^111Boypv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

It is in this context that Neuzil and colleagues present the findings of the Moderato‐HTN study 13 in this issue of JAHA. This was a non‐randomized, single‐arm open label proof of concept study for a novel method of device‐based blood pressure control, using a pacing algorithm called programmable hypertension control (PHC) which paces continuously in the RV and alternates between 8 and 13 beats with short (20–80 ms) AV delay and 1 to 3 beats with longer (100–180 ms) AV delays. The short AV delays function to decrease blood pressure by reducing cardiac preload and output. Normally, this would be accompanied by a reflex increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and vasoconstriction, but as the authors elegantly demonstrate, this is mitigated, if not completely suppressed, by the alternation with several beats with a longer AV delay. This pacing algorithm is programmed in a dual‐chamber, rate‐responsive pacemaker generator which interfaces with standard IS‐1 bipolar endocardial leads.

The authors enrolled 57 patients with hypertension, defined as an office SBP greater than 140 mm Hg on 2 separate days, with average ≥ 150 mm Hg, who had indications for new implant of a dual‐chamber pacemaker, generator exchange, or upgrade from a single chamber pacemaker. Thirty‐five patients fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria and underwent device implantation with the PHC algorithm turned off. A run‐in phase was then carried out for 4 weeks, where office and 24‐h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (added partway through the study after the negative results of SYMPLICITY HTN‐3 were released) had to continue showing SBP > 140 mm Hg to continue in the trial. Seven patients no longer met criteria of hypertension in this run‐in phase, all of whom were undergoing a new implant and likely had reflex hypertension related to the presenting bradycardia. Twenty‐seven patients met these criteria, at which time the PHC algorithm was turned on and optimized. These patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months with office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to assess their response. Echocardiography was also performed at enrollment and after 6 months.

Recommendations for research

It remains poorly understood what constitutes clinically important hypotension for individual patients, both during and after surgery. As a corollary, optimal strategies to avoid or treat intraoperative and postoperative hypotension remain to be investigated and rigorously tested. We consider the following questions important to be addressed in future research (Fig. 1).

Fig 1
Open research questions in the field of perioperative arterial pressure management. MAP, mean arterial pressure.

Are there organ-specific hypotensive harm thresholds for the kidney, heart, intestines, liver, and brain? Are hypotensive harm thresholds altered by perioperative factors? What arterial pressure threshold minimises risk to all organs?

For a given organ, the lower limit of blood flow autoregulation (i.e. the perfusion pressure below which organ blood flow becomes pressure dependent) defines clinically important hypotension. Despite the physiological importance of blood flow autoregulation, little is known about intraoperative lower limits of autoregulation of different organs, or how perioperative factors modify such thresholds. Although there is compelling evidence from observational research that intraoperative hypotension harm thresholds for acute kidney injury and myocardial injury are similar at mean arterial pressures of ∼65 mm Hg, harm thresholds for stroke, delirium, mesenteric ischaemia, or liver failure remain largely unknown. Harm thresholds presumably differ for various organs and vary among individuals based on overall health, age, specific medical conditions, and their treatments. Consequently, there is no universal arterial pressure threshold that ensures minimal risk to all organs. How general anaesthesia and surgical trauma with inflammation influence organ-specific hypotension harm thresholds is poorly investigated. It is thus currently unclear what the organ-specific hypotension harm thresholds are, and further research is needed.

Do various causes of hypotension (vasodilation, hypovolaemia, bradycardia, or low cardiac output) affect the association between hypotension and organ injury?

Multiple factors contribute to intraoperative hypotension including anaesthetic drugs (which induce vasodilation, myocardial depression, or bradycardia), bleeding (resulting in intravascular hypovolaemia), mechanical ventilation (causing high intrathoracic pressure impairing venous return), and patient positioning. Consequently, there are various endotypes of intraoperative hypotension characterised by different underlying haemodynamic alterations. Identified endotypes include myocardial depression, bradycardia, vasodilation, and hypovolaemia. It remains unknown whether various causes of hypotension affect the association between hypotension and organ injury, although it seems likely that the degree of hypotension is more important than its cause. In contrast, treatment of hypotension should be directed to the presumed cause(s) because cause-specific treatments are more likely to be effective than generic treatments.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of… [^115izHe7]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

In further support for a DBP goal of lower than 90 mm Hg, the panel found evidence that there is no benefit in treating patients to a goal of either 80 mm Hg or lower or 85 mm Hg or lower compared with 90 mm Hg or lower based on the HOT trial, in which patients were randomized to these 3 goals without statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the primary or secondary outcomes.
19. Blood pressure goals differed across the trials, with 2 trials using mean arterial pressure and different targets by age, and 1 trial using only DBP goals. 20–22 None of the trials showed that treatment to a lower BP goal significantly lowered kidney or cardiovascular disease end points compared with a goal of lower than 140/90 mm Hg.

There is moderate-quality evidence from 3 trials that treatment to an SBP goal of lower than 150 mm Hg improves cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health outcomes and lowers mortality in adults with diabetes and hypertension. 23–25 No RCTs addressed whether treatment to an SBP goal of lower than 140 mm Hg compared with a higher goal improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

### A prospective evaluation of a protocol for magnetic resonance imaging of patients with implanted cardiac devices [^112G2yTh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is avoided in most patients with implanted cardiac devices because of safety concerns.

Objective

To define the safety of a protocol for MRI at the commonly used magnetic strength of 1.5 T in patients with implanted cardiac devices.

Design

Prospective nonrandomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01130896) SETTING: One center in the United States (94% of examinations) and one in Israel.

Patients

438 patients with devices (54% with pacemakers and 46% with defibrillators) who underwent 555 MRI studies.

Intervention

Pacing mode was changed to asynchronous for pacemaker-dependent patients and to demand for others. Tachyarrhythmia functions were disabled. Blood pressure, electrocardiography, oximetry, and symptoms were monitored by a nurse with experience in cardiac life support and device programming who had immediate backup from an electrophysiologist.

Measurements

Activation or inhibition of pacing, symptoms, and device variables.

Results

In 3 patients (0.7% [95% CI, 0% to 1.5%]), the device reverted to a transient back-up programming mode without long-term effects. Right ventricular (RV) sensing (median change, 0 mV [interquartile range {IQR}, -0.7 to 0 V]) and atrial and right and left ventricular lead impedances (median change, -2 Ω [IQR, -13 to 0 Ω], -4 Ω [IQR, -16 to 0 Ω], and -11 Ω [IQR, -40 to 0 Ω], respectively) were reduced immediately after MRI. At long-term follow-up (61% of patients), decreased RV sensing (median, 0 mV, [IQR, -1.1 to 0.3 mV]), decreased RV lead impedance (median, -3 Ω, [IQR, -29 to 15 Ω]), increased RV capture threshold (median, 0 V, IQR, [0 to 0.2 Ω]), and decreased battery voltage (median, -0.01 V, IQR, -0.04 to 0 V) were noted. The observed changes did not require device revision or reprogramming.

Limitations

Not all available cardiac devices have been tested. Long-term in-person or telephone follow-up was unavailable in 43 patients (10%), and some data were missing. Those with missing long-term capture threshold data had higher baseline right atrial and right ventricular capture thresholds and were more likely to have undergone thoracic imaging. Defibrillation threshold testing and random assignment to a control group were not performed.

Conclusion

With appropriate precautions, MRI can be done safely in patients with selected cardiac devices. Because changes in device variables and programming may occur, electrophysiologic monitoring during MRI is essential.

### High incidence of pacemaker syndrome in patients with sinus node dysfunction treated with ventricular-based pacing in the mode selection trial (MOST) [^112Y6wnC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the incidence, predictors, and treatment of pacemaker syndrome in patients with sinus node dysfunction treated with ventricular-based (VVIR) pacing in the Mode Selection Trial (MOST).

Background

Pacemaker syndrome, or intolerance to VVIR pacing, consists of cardiovascular signs and symptoms induced by VVIR pacing.

Methods

The definition of pacemaker syndrome required that a patient with single-chamber VVIR pacing develop either congestive signs and symptoms associated with retrograde conduction during VVIR pacing or a ≥ 20 mm Hg reduction of systolic blood pressure during VVIR pacing, associated with reproducible symptoms of weakness, lightheadedness, or syncope.

Results

Of 996 patients randomized to VVIR pacing, 182 (18.3%) met criteria for pacemaker syndrome in follow-up. Pacemaker syndrome occurred early in most patients (13.8% at 6 months, 16.0% at 1 year, increasing to 19.7% at 4 years). Baseline univariate predictors of pacemaker syndrome included a lower sinus rate and higher programmed pacemaker rate. Previous heart failure, ejection fraction, and drop in systolic blood pressure with VVIR pacing at implantation did not predict the development of pacemaker syndrome. Post-implantation predictors of pacemaker syndrome were a higher percentage of paced beats, higher programmed low rate, and slower underlying spontaneous sinus rate. Quality of life decreased at the time of diagnosis of pacemaker syndrome and improved with reprogramming to atrial-based pacing.

Conclusions

Severe pacemaker syndrome developed in nearly 20% of VVIR-paced patients and improved with reprogramming to the dual-chamber pacing mode. Because prediction of pacemaker syndrome is difficult, the only way to prevent pacemaker syndrome is to implant atrial-based pacemakers in all patients.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^112sWsdG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There are several potential advantages of PHC therapy compared with other device‐based therapies for hypertension. First is the ability to adjust and "tune" the PHC therapy when needed, enabling tailored control of blood pressure. The ability to immediately observe the acute blood pressure responses (including the presence or absence of a blood pressure overshoot when PHC pacing is suspended) provides a powerful tool for adjusting the magnitude of blood pressure reduction and for gauging the impact on sympathetic activation (at least in the acute setting). This contrasts with other therapies where the treatment is "all or none" and, in some instances, the effects may not be evident for some time. Second, the mechanism involves modulation of both ventricular filling and the baroreflexes, suggesting that PHC therapy mimics the effect of multiple classes of drugs and has the potential to treat patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

One potential consequence of long‐term right ventricular pacing may be the development of heart failure. Clinical symptoms of heart failure have been observed in up to 26% of patients who have a normal or reduced LVEF and who subsequently underwent pacemaker implantation with a high percentage of right ventricular pacing. 27, 28, 29 However, most of those studies did not have a control group matched for age and cardiovascular comorbid conditions. One study that did have an appropriate control group showed no significant impact of right ventricular pacing on the occurrence of heart failure or other cardiovascular adverse effects. 30 It is therefore noteworthy that during the 3‐month PHC treatment phase of the current study, there was a reduction in LV end‐diastolic volume and no significant change in LVEF. While there was no suggestion of LV structural or functional changes observed in the present study, the short duration of follow‐up and small number of patients require that this potential effect be studied further.

One potential consequence of short atrioventricular interval pacing is increased left and right atrial stress (because of atrial contraction against a partially closed mitral valve). This could result in left and right atrial enlargement and an increase in the occurrence of atrial tachycardias. Thus far there has been no evidence of either effect. Echocardiographic data from the patients followed for up to 2 years are similar to those reported at 3 months, with no significant changes in LVEF. However, it is recognized that longer follow‐up of more patients will be required in order to demonstrate the safety of this therapy.

### Preparation for pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator implants in patients with high risk of thrombo-embolic events: oral anticoagulation or bridging with intravenous heparin? A prospective randomized trial [^112tArYg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Definitions

Pocket haematoma was defined as palpable mass that protruded > 2 cm anterior to pulse generator. Pocket haematoma was evacuated if it caused tense swelling with poor capillary perfusion, progressive enlargement, or severe pain to the patient.

Any thrombo-embolic event that took place between OAC dosage modification and 45 days after the procedure was recorded. Arterial thrombo-embolic events were defined as ischaemic stroke, TIAs, or peripheral arterial thrombo-embolism. Venous thrombo-embolic events were defined as acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism or acute symptomatic deep venous thrombosis. Prosthetic valve thrombosis was only ruled out based on clinical symptoms. Echocardiograms were not systematically obtained before and after the implant.

Surgical techniques

All procedures were performed in our centre by two experienced electrophysiologists and one fellow in electrophysiology (L.M. A.B. and J.M.T.). More than 500 devices are implanted each year, and each of the three physicians implants approximately one-third of them. The number of years of experience in implanting devices when the study started was as follows: L.M. 10 years; A.B. 6 years; and J.M.T. 1 year.

New implant

Implants were done according to our institutional protocol. After administration of prophylactic antibiotic and local anaesthesia, leads were implanted through subclavian vein (one puncture per lead) under fluoroscopic guidance. Most ventricular leads had passive fixation except in the cases of severe tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary hypertension. Atrial leads on pacemakers had passive fixation except in patients with previous cardiac surgery. In patients treated with cardiac resynchronization (CRT), all left ventricular leads were inserted though the coronary sinus. As a general rule, in our department, we follow the recommendation of current guidelines and abandon the implant of the CRT after 4 h or 60 min of X-ray, if the procedure is unsuccessful. Devices were placed in a subcutaneous pocket localized in the pre-pectoral region. After the procedure, a pressure dressing was applied to the wound for 6 h.

Replacement

After administration of the prophylactic antibiotic, an incision was made, the generator was exteriorized and disconnected, and then the leads were tested to confirm the correct sensing, pacing thresholds, and impedance parameters. The new generator was connected and inserted into the existing pocket, the wound was closed in layers, and a pressure dressing was applied for at least 6 h, or until bleeding stopped.

### Atomoxetine hydrochloride [^1175GbYC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate [see Contraindications (4.5)]. Pulse and blood pressure should be measured at baseline, following atomoxetine dose increases, and periodically while on therapy to detect possible clinically important increases.

The following table provides short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trial data for the proportions of patients having an increase in: diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg; systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg; heart rate greater than or equal to 20 bpm, in both the pediatric and adult populations (see Table 1).

Table 1

aAbbreviations: bpm = beats per minute; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; HR = heart rate; mm Hg = millimeters mercury; SBP = systolic blood pressure.

bProportion of patients meeting threshold at any one time during clinical trial.

In placebo-controlled registration studies involving pediatric patients, tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 0.3% (5/1597) of these atomoxetine patients compared with 0% (0/934) of placebo patients. The mean heart rate increase in extensive metabolizer (EM) patients was 5.0 beats/minute, and in poor metabolizer (PM) patients 9.4 beats/minute.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^112SPAhh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The group average 24hASBP of the 27 patients treated with PHC is shown in Figure 3 B. 24hASBP dropped from an average of 136.7 ± 9.2 mm Hg at baseline to 119.8 ± 9.1 mm Hg the day following activation of the therapy, a reduction of 16.9 ± 10.6 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Average 24hASBP remained reduced at 122.5 ± 11.3 mm Hg +3 months after activation of PHC therapy, a reduction of 14.2 ± 9.8 mm Hg (P < 0.001) compared with baseline. There was no significant difference between the average systolic pressure immediately after the activation and +3‐months postactivation (120 ± 9 versus 123 ± 11, P = 0.19). In patients who were followed according to the modified protocol with 2 measurements made before PHC therapy activation and 3 made after PHC therapy activation (Figure 3 C, blue), average 24hASBP dropped by 5.3 ± 11.7 mm Hg from the first to the second measurement (P = 0.09); this change indicates the impact of the patients' participation in the study. There was an additional, immediate 11.6 ± 10.1 mm Hg drop (P < 0.001 versus the −2 weeks average) detected in 24hASBP recorded on the day of PHC therapy activation. This reduction stayed relatively constant during the Hypertension Therapy phase of the study such that by the +3‐month follow‐up, average 24hASBP had dropped by 10.1 ± 13.0 mm Hg to 122.5 ± 11.3 mm Hg (P = 0.007 versus −2 week measurement, and P < 0.001 versus baseline). For 11 patients who were followed according to the original protocol with readings at baseline, immediately postimplantation and at +3 months (Figure 3 C, red) the data at common time points were not different from those of the rest of the subgroup (Figure 3 C, blue).

### Association between intraoperative hypotension and hypertension and 30-day postoperative mortality in noncardiac surgery [^117URckr]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although deviations in intraoperative blood pressure are assumed to be associated with postoperative mortality, critical blood pressure thresholds remain undefined. Therefore, the authors estimated the intraoperative thresholds of systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MAP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with increased risk-adjusted 30-day mortality.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study combined intraoperative blood pressure data from six Veterans Affairs medical centers with 30-day outcomes to determine the risk-adjusted associations between intraoperative blood pressure and 30-day mortality. Deviations in blood pressure were assessed using three methods: (1) population thresholds (individual patient sum of area under threshold [AUT] or area over threshold 2 SDs from the mean of the population intraoperative blood pressure values), (2). absolute thresholds, and (3) percent change from baseline blood pressure.

Results

Thirty-day mortality was associated with (1) population threshold: systolic AUT (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.2 to 4.8), mean AUT (2.8; 1.9 to 4.3), and diastolic AUT (2.4; 1.6 to 3.8). Approximate conversions of AUT into its separate components of pressure and time were SBP < 67 mmHg for more than 8.2min, MAP < 49 mmHg for more than 3.9min, DBP < 33 mmHg for more than 4.4min. (2) Absolute threshold: SBP < 70 mmHg for more than or equal to 5min (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.9), MAP < 49 mmHg for more than or equal to 5min (2.4; 1.3 to 4.6), and DBP < 30 mmHg for more than or equal to 5min (3.2; 1.8 to 5.5). (3) Percent change: MAP decreases to more than 50% from baseline for more than or equal to 5min (2.7; 1.5 to 5.0). Intraoperative hypertension was not associated with 30-day mortality with any of these techniques.

Conclusion

Intraoperative hypotension, but not hypertension, is associated with increased 30-day operative mortality.

### Effects of atrioventricular interval modulation therapy in subjects with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction [^115KgSFy]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-standing hypertension leads to cardiac structural and functional changes that frequently result in left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD). The progression of DD is directly linked to the development of heart failure (HF) even in the presence of preserved ejection fraction. Globally, more than one million patients are implanted with pacemakers annually, with over 70% of these patients suffering from hypertension. The high prevalence of hypertension is primarily attributable to the advanced age of pacemaker recipients along with the elevated incidence of other significant cardiovascular diseases. Atrioventricular interval modulation (AVIM) therapy, also called cardiac neuromodulation therapy, employs a sequence of variably timed short and longer atrioventricular intervals during dual-chamber pacing to yield sustained reductions of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with hypertension. Clinical studies have demonstrated that AVIM therapy immediately, substantially, and persistently reduces blood pressure (BP) in patients indicated for a dual-chamber pacemaker who also have uncontrolled hypertension. LV pressure-volume analyses establish that AVIM therapy reduces ventricular filling (preload) and decreases total peripheral resistance (afterload) while modulating the autonomic nervous system and therefore has the potential to improve diastolic function. Accordingly, we evaluated whether the presence of DD impacts the efficacy of AVIM therapy to reduce BP and if AVIM therapy improves DD.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Is AVIM therapy delivered during dual-chamber pacing associated with favorable changes in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction?

What is the main finding?

These data demonstrate that AVIM therapy is associated with a comparable reduction in systolic blood pressure in patients with and without diastolic dysfunction. In addition, in patients with diastolic dysfunction, AVIM therapy leads to favorable echocardiographic changes consistent with improved myocardial relaxation and diastolic compliance.

### Hemodynamic response and safety of vasodilator stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance in patients with permanent pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^114EFBGL]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

These efforts are to be applauded for creating a highly individualized reprogramming plan for each patient upon entering the stress CMR environment. However, widespread implementation of this pretesting approach would add to patient discomfort with an additional exposure to adenosine, impair workflow, prolong the duration of the patient encounter, and in doing so reduce availability of an imaging resource that already faces challenges in providing patient access. A more universal device reprogramming protocol would have appeal in streamlining tests for this patient population. To this end, Pavon et al recently described a more universal approach of asynchronous pacing in all individuals with > 1% pacing on device interrogation, set to 10 bpm above the resting heart rate. The group reported safety of this approach with good image quality in CMR‐conditional devices and high correlation with subsequent coronary angiography in cases of perfusion defects identified. They further reported no changes in heart rate or systolic blood pressure and a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure.

Indeed, while our case‐by‐case approach to temporary device settings varied during stress CMR, our data further supports the notion that high rates of asynchronous pacing during stress CMR may be effective and safe, as we also did not observe any instances of competitive pacing in our cohort. The patients who were programmed to asynchronous pacing were set to rates approximately 10 bpm above baseline rates during stress CMR, and despite observing accelerations of > 10 bpm above baseline in the SPECT cohort, competitive pacing events were nonetheless absent in this experience. One downside to a high rate of asynchronous pacing includes a limitation on assessment of hyperemic response, which can be overcome with assessing the splenic "switch off" sign only if the patients receive adenosine. Diastolic blood pressure decrease might be another manner in which hyperemic response is assessed given our experience as well as that of Pavon et al. Some of the factors to consider when choosing between stress SPECT versus CMR are summarized in Table 4.

### Programmable hypertension control: another possible indication for implanted pacemakers [^115dsg6p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The authors found that, as previously shown in other studies, the office blood pressure in those 27 patients who remained hypertensive throughout the run‐in period indeed dropped (mean 7.8 ± 13.5 mm Hg, from an average of 165 ± 10.2 to 157.4 ± 14.2 mm Hg). Following 3 months of PHC therapy, the average blood pressure further dropped to an SBP of 141.5 ± 14.2 mm Hg. No significant change in DBP was noted at any time point, as would be expected.

An analysis of individual patients showed that 24/27 (85%) patients experienced a greater than 5 mm Hg drop in ambulatory SBP. For the 16/27 patients who had 24 hours ambulatory monitoring performed immediately before PHC activation, 14/16 (87.5%) had a greater than 5 mm Hg drop in ambulatory SBP. Similar rates were found in office blood pressure response. It is notable, however, that actual blood pressure reduction varied widely between patients, even amongst these responders. Some patients experienced a drop of 20 to 30 mm Hg in ambulatory SBP, though most experienced between 10 and 20 mm Hg drop. As an open‐label study, medication changes were left to the discretion of treating clinicians: more instances of decreases in medication dose were reported than increases.

Blood pressure control and monitoring in the early postoperative period after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant — Class I states that arterial line monitoring is recommended early after LVAD implant to allow for accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Class IIa indicates it is reasonable to target a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of stroke in hospitalized patients. Class III notes there are no data to support aggressive afterload reduction after LVAD implant and that excessive pharmacologic hypotension (MAP < 75 mm Hg) should be avoided. When automated cuffs are used, the mean arterial pressure, rather than systolic or diastolic pressures, should be followed.

Blood pressure measurement with a cuff in patients with stiff arteries can be misleading, with false elevation of the diastolic pressure. Coronary flow, and most of the cerebral blood flow occur during diastole. There is a marked diastolic J curve in patients with diastolic pressure < 60 mmHg and pulse pressure > 60 mmHg. Aiming for a systolic target of 120 mmHg is not safe in some frail older patients.

### Indications and recommendations for pacemaker therapy… [^111egJ7J]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The decision to implant a pacemaker usually is based on symptoms of a bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia in the setting of heart disease. Symptomatic bradycardia is the most common indication. It has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for the development of the clinical manifestations of frank syncope or near syncope, transient dizziness or light-headedness, and confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion and attributable to low heart rates". 2–5 Therefore, symptomatic third-degree AV block is a class I indication for permanent pacing, whereas asymptomatic third-degree AV block is a class IIa indication. More recently, it has been recognized that type II second-degree AV block may be a precursor to complete AV block. 6, 7 Type II second-degree AV block should be treated with a permanent pacemaker even in an asymptomatic patient, particularly if it is associated with fascicular block, which also is a class IIa recommendation.

Marked first-degree AV block can produce symptoms even in the absence of higher degrees of block. In this situation, symptoms are caused by hemodynamic impairment resulting from the inappropriate timing of atrial systole, which may produce symptoms similar to those of the "pacemaker syndrome". Trained athletes often manifest physiologic sinus bradycardia with resting heart rates as low as 40 to 50 beats per minute. During sleep, these athletes may have a heart rate as low as 30 beats per minute with associated pauses or type I second-degree AV block resulting in asystole as long as 2. 8 seconds.

This pacing technique has been shown in several prospective randomized trials to reduce heart failure symptoms, and improve hemodynamics and left ventricular indices of systolic function. 37–39 However, there is no convincing evidence that biventricular pacing improves survival. Many patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who meet criteria for biventricular pacing currently are receiving devices that combine pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator modalities. It is fair to say that the indications for biventricular pacing are still evolving. Current pacing recommendations for dilated cardiomyopathy are listed in Table 8. 1.

### Should we test for diastolic dysfunction? How and how often? [^114wFxxb]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of heart failure (HF) are due in large part to elevation of left and/or right ventricular filling pressures. Although abnormal diastolic function is difficult to define, it contributes to the elevation of filling pressures. Tests that characterize aspects of diastolic function or structural changes associated with diastolic dysfunction, may help in establishing a diagnosis of HF, assessing prognosis, and guiding treatments. Individual echocardiographic parameters correlate weakly with LV (LV) filling pressures measured directly. However, a combination of multiple parameters improves accuracy for detection of elevated filling pressures. Serum natriuretic peptide levels are related to ventricular filling pressures and, when elevated, are a key diagnostic criterion for HF. Currently available evidence is not adequate to recommend serial echocardiographic studies or natriuretic peptide level measurements to assess changes in filling pressures or to guide HF therapy. Measurements of inferior vena cava size and dynamics have potential for identifying inadequate decongestion during episodes of acute decompensated HF but have not yet demonstrated utility in improving HF outcomes. Direct measurement of LV filling pressures using implanted pressure sensors is the only "diastolic assessment" thus far that has proven efficacy in reducing HF hospitalization rates.

### Pacemaker-mediated programmable hypertension control therapy [^114FnDiv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Recent efforts to address the problem of persistent hypertension despite prescription of appropriate multidrug regimens have included the development and investigation of device‐based therapies. Factors contributing to the inability to achieve guideline‐recommended blood pressures through pharmacologic means, which include ineffectiveness of medical therapies in some patients and/or inability to maintain long‐term compliance, have the potential to be overcome by device‐based therapies.

Pressure generation by the heart, which is a primary factor in determining arterial blood pressure, is highly dependent on left ventricular (LV) preload according to the well‐known Frank‐Starling Law of the Heart. 1 For patients in normal sinus rhythm, up to 15% of ventricular filling is determined by atrial contraction. 2 For patients with normal sinus rhythm, variations in atrioventricular delay are known to modulate LV filling. 3, 4 We therefore hypothesized that regulation of LV preload by reducing the atrioventricular interval may be an effective means of reducing blood pressure as a therapy for hypertension.

One important consideration for this as a long‐term approach to reducing blood pressure is the response of the autonomic reflexes. 5 Reductions in blood pressure mediated by a reduced atrioventricular interval may invoke baroreflex‐mediated neuronal and hormonal responses aimed at restoring blood pressure to what the system deems as "normal" by increasing sympathetic activity with potential increases in heart rate, peripheral resistance, and myocardial contractility. Accordingly, it is important to be able to modulate such baroreflex responses in order to achieve long‐term blood pressure reductions. Preliminary preclinical studies and acute clinical studies have shown that by alternating between a shorter and a longer atrioventricular delay, blood pressure can be reduced chronically without sympathetic activation or habituation to the therapy.

Here, we report the results of the first multicenter study of this pacemaker‐based therapy for hypertension. Changes in 24‐hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) and office‐based measurements of SBP were the co‐primary efficacy end points. Device functionality and safety were also assessed.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^113m5o7P]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Definition — Asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: JNC 7 classified stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, although many clinical studies use thresholds of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg. This policy considers markedly elevated blood pressure to be consistent with the JNC 7 definition of stage 2 hypertension, and the term asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure is used where asymptomatic hypertension had previously been used in the published literature.

### Association between intensive vs standard blood pressure control and incident left ventricular conduction disease: a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT randomized clinical trial [^115scMYs]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Left ventricular conduction disease predicts heart failure and death, and the only strategies to mitigate its effects involve implantation of a permanent pacemaker. There are currently no proven preventive strategies for this common condition.

Objective

To determine the association between targeting intensive blood pressure (BP) control and the risk of developing left ventricular conduction disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a post hoc analysis of the 2-arm multicenter Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which recruited participants from 102 sites in the US and Puerto Rico and was conducted from November 2010 until August 2015. Adults 50 years and older with hypertension and at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor were included. Participants with baseline left ventricular conduction disease, ventricular pacing, or ventricular pre-excitation were excluded for the current analysis. Data were analyzed from November 2021 to November 2022.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to a systolic BP target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group) or less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group).

Main Outcome

The primary outcome was incident left ventricular conduction disease, including any fascicular or left bundle-branch block, assessed by serial electrocardiography. Incident right bundle-branch block was examined as a negative control.

Results

Among 3918 participants randomized to standard treatment and 3956 to intensive treatment (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [9.2] years; 2815 [36%] female) monitored for a median [IQR] 3.5 (0.02–5.2) years, 203 developed left ventricular conduction disease. Older age (hazard ratio per 10-year increase [HR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.21–1.67; P < .001), male sex (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.63–3.32; P < .001), and cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.06–2.00; p = 0.02) were associated with a higher risk of left ventricular conduction disease. Assignment to intensive treatment was associated with a 26% lower risk of left ventricular conduction disease (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; p = 0.04). These results persisted when incident ventricular pacing was included in the outcome and when considering all-cause death as a competing risk. In contrast, no association between randomization assignment and right bundle-branch block was observed (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.71–1.27; p = 0.75).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, targeting intensive BP control was associated with lower risk of left ventricular conduction disease in a randomized clinical trial, suggesting that clinically relevant conduction disease may be preventable.

### Risk factors and a 3-month risk score for predicting pacemaker implantation in patients with atrial fibrillations [^112sMft2]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This observational study has some important limitations: the non-availability of frequency of AF episodes and AF type (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent), time of AF diagnosis and pacemaker-dependency. We were unable to distinguish between AF and atrial flutter; however, it is estimated that around 95% of the diagnosis I48 is AF and not atrial flutter. Too few patients had CHD at baseline to make subtypes based on surgical repair. No data were available on individual PPM indication. PPM implantations were rare and the high-risk patients found are relative to those with low risk. We mainly present results for the 3-months outcome as the information used to define the risk points are not informative enough to make clinically relevant 5-year risk predictions, as suggested by the low AUC of the ROC curve at 5 years and the competing risk of death was high during the 5-year follow-up. The risk score should be used with caution before external validation has been performed. It is likely that the sensitivity of the diagnosis for bradycardia may not be very high, that is, patients with bradycardia do not always get the diagnosis registered. Therefore, we did not include it in the models. Our use of the date of newly diagnosed AF only did not allow us to assess for the potential bradycardia risk of rate-lowering or antiarrhythmic drugs prescribed after the AF diagnosis, aside from betablockers and calcium channel blockers which was categorised in the predictor 'hypertension'. Being a registry study, there are no clinical data on blood pressure, laboratory findings, smoking status, weight or ECG characteristics such as information on conduction abnormality.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114PXFfq]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Adults without clinical CVD at lower predicted risk (< 7.5%) — diastolic management: In this lower-risk group, there are limited data about the net benefit of initiating antihypertensive therapy at a lower threshold with an average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg; therefore, lifestyle interventions should be encouraged first to lower BP, although lifestyle interventions may not be successful at lowering DBP and sustaining optimal DBP levels.

### Predicting vasovagal syncope from heart rate and blood pressure: a prospective study in 140 subjects [^115CY2aW]. Heart Rhythm (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We developed a vasovagal syncope (VVS) prediction algorithm for use during head-up tilt with simultaneous analysis of heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). We previously tested this algorithm retrospectively in 1155 subjects, showing sensitivity 95%, specificity 93%, and median prediction time 59 seconds.

Objective

The purpose of this prospective, single-center study of 140 subjects was to evaluate this VVS prediction algorithm and to assess whether retrospective results were reproduced and clinically relevant. The primary endpoint was VVS prediction: sensitivity and specificity > 80%.

Methods

In subjects referred for 60° head-up tilt (Italian protocol), noninvasive HR and SBP were supplied to the VVS prediction algorithm: simultaneous analysis of RR intervals, SBP trends, and their variability represented by low-frequency power-generated cumulative risk, which was compared with a predetermined VVS risk threshold. When cumulative risk exceeded threshold, an alert was generated. Prediction time was duration between first alert and syncope.

Results

Of the 140 subjects enrolled, data were usable for 134. Of 83 tilt-positive subjects (61.9%), 81 VVS events were correctly predicted by the algorithm, and of 51 tilt-negative subjects (38.1%), 45 were correctly identified as negative by the algorithm. Resulting algorithm performance was sensitivity 97.6% and specificity 88.2%, meeting the primary endpoint. Mean VVS prediction time was 2 minutes 26 seconds ± 3 minutes 16 seconds (median 1 minute 25 seconds). Using only HR and HR variability (without SBP), mean prediction time reduced to 1 minute 34 seconds ± 1 minute 45 seconds (median 1 minute 13 seconds).

Conclusion

The VVS prediction algorithm is a clinically relevant tool and could offer applications, including providing a patient alarm, shortening tilt-test time, and triggering pacing intervention in implantable devices.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study participants

We recruited patients older than 18 years old with dual chamber PPM (MEDTRONIC or BIOTRONIK) treated in the Cardiology Department of National Cheng Kung University Hospital, from January 2015 to August 2019. The protocol for this cohort study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (B‐ER‐108‐278), and was conducted according to the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice. We ensure that we have specified whether all data were fully anonymized before we accessed them and the ethics committee waived the requirement for informed consent.

2.2 Data collection and definitions

Patients' medical history, comorbidities, and echocardiographic parameters were collected from chart records for retrospective evaluation. Diabetes mellitus was defined by the presence of symptoms and a random plasma glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl, fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 h plasma glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dlL, from a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, or taking medication for diabetes mellitus. 9 Hypertension was defined as in‐office systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg or taking antihypertensive medication. 10 Dyslipidemia was defined as low‐density lipoprotein ≥ 140 mg/dl, high‐density lipoprotein < 40 mg/dl, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl, or taking medication for dyslipidemia. 11 Chronic kidney disease was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. 12 Neurological events were defined as either ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), definitively diagnosed by an experienced neurologist. A TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. 13 Ischemic stroke was defined as acute focal or global disturbance of cerebral function due to vascular dysfunction, which lasted longer than 24 h or resulted in death. 14 AHRE were extracted from the devices via telemetry at each office visit every 3–6 months. AHRE electrograms were reviewed by at least one experienced electrophysiologist, who carefully considered the possibility that AHRE included lead noise or artifact, far‐field R‐waves, or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and visually confirmed AF in the detected AHRE (Supplement Figure 1). Atrial sensitivity was programmed to 0.3 mV with bipolar sensing of MEDTRONIC and 0.2 mV with bipolar sensing of BIOTRONIK.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Minimum frequency of cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) in-person or remote monitoring (Table 4a) is: within 72 h of CIED implantation (in person), 2–12 wk postimplantation (in person), every 3–12 mo for pacemaker/CRT-Pacemaker (in person or remote), every 3–6 mo for ICD/CRT-D (in person or remote), annually until battery depletion (in person), and every 1–3 mo at signs of battery depletion (in person or remote); implantable loop recorder follow-up is every 1–6 mo depending on patient symptoms and indication (in person or remote); implantable hemodynamic monitor follow-up is every 1–6 mo depending on indication with more frequent assessment as clinically indicated (in person or remote). More frequent in-person or remote monitoring may be required for all devices as clinically indicated.

### Systolic blood pressure and risk for ventricular arrhythmia in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator [^1126QRP6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) was previously suggested to be a marker for heart failure and mortality in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction. We aimed to explore the association of SBP on risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) and atrial arrhythmias as well as appropriate and inappropriate Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) therapy. The study population comprised 1,481 of 1,500 (99%) patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial - Reduce Inappropriate Therapy trial. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to identify the association of baseline SBP (recorded prior to ICD implantation) with the risk of VTA > 170 beats/min during follow-up (primary end point) and atrial arrhythmia, appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapy, hospitalization and death (secondary end points). SBP was dichotomized at 120 mm Hg (approximate mean and median) and was also assessed as a continuous measure. Multivariate analysis showed that each 10 mm Hg decrement in SBP was associated with corresponding 11% increased risk for VTA (p = 0.008). Low SBP (≤ 120 mm Hg) was associated with a significant 58% (p = 0.002) increased risk for VTA ≥ 170 beats/min; 53% (p = 0.019) increased risk for VTA ≥ 200 beats/min; and 65% (p = 0.001) increased risk for appropriate ICD therapy, as compared with SBP > 120 mm Hg. Low SBP was not associated with increased risk of atrial arrhythmias, and inappropriate ICD therapy. In conclusion, in MADIT-RIT, SBP (≤ 120 mm Hg) predicted higher rates of VTA. These findings suggest that SBP may be utilized for VTA risk stratification in candidates for primary ICD therapy.

Blood Pressure During Run‐In Phase

Office blood pressure at the time of screening (just before IPG implantation) averaged 165.6 ± 11.6/78.8 ± 10.3 mm Hg. The IPG was a first‐time implant in 25 patients and a replacement (9 patients) or upgrade from a VVI device (1 patient) in the other 10 patients.

At the end of the Run‐In phase (before PHC therapy activation), oSBP averaged 152.3 ± 15.9/79.8 ± 9.3 mm Hg, dropping by an average of 12.0 ± 15.6 mm Hg from preimplantation screening values. However, in 7 patients, oSBP was < 140 mm Hg on the 2‐ and/or 4‐week visit. SBP had dropped in these patients by 28.4 ± 12.5 mm Hg to an average of 136.4 ± 10.9/74.3 ± 2.9 mm Hg. These patients did not progress to the PHC phase of the study. In contrast, blood pressure averaged 156.4 ± 14.4/81.3 ± 10.0 mm Hg in the 27 patients in whom oSBP remained ≥ 140 mm Hg at both the 2‐ and 4‐week visit, with an average drop in blood pressure of only 7.8 ± 13.5 mm Hg (P = 0.005). As summarized in the Table, other than blood pressure, there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between patients who did and those who did not qualify to progress to the PHC phase of the study.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114bm65g]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Major bleeding classification — hemodynamic instability: An increased heart rate may be the first sign of hemodynamic instability due to blood loss; thresholds that can indicate instability include a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 40 mm Hg, and orthostatic changes with systolic blood pressure drop ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure drop ≥ 10 mm Hg upon standing; continuous invasive measurement of mean arterial pressure is considered superior for assessment, with a value < 65 mm Hg serving as a cut-off, and surrogate markers such as urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/h can be used; if ≥ 1 of these factors applies, the bleed is classified as major.

Shared decision-making for pacemaker implantation — clinicians and patients should engage in a shared decision-making approach in which treatment decisions are based not only on the best available evidence, but also on the patient's goals of care, preferences, and values (COR I, LOE C-LD), and patients considering implantation of a pacemaker or with a pacemaker that requires lead revision or generator change should be informed of procedural benefits and risks, including the potential short- and long-term complications and possible alternative therapy, if any, in light of their goals of care, preferences, and values (COR I, LOE C-LD); in patients with indications for permanent pacing but also with significant comorbidities such that pacing therapy is unlikely to provide meaningful clinical benefit, or if patient goals of care strongly preclude pacemaker therapy, implantation or replacement of a pacemaker should not be performed (COR III: No Benefit, LOE C-LD).
