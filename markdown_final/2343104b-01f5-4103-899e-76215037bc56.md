## Question

Management of respiratory failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing respiratory failure, with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and oxygenation. Then, I should classify the type of respiratory failure and identify the underlying cause. Next, I will select noninvasive versus invasive support, implement lung-protective ventilation if intubated, and apply ARDS-specific adjuncts. After that, I need to consider special populations and rescue therapies, monitor for complications, and plan for liberation and long-term outcomes, while continuously checking for evidence strength and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first hour: secure the airway, establish oxygenation, and obtain a rapid diagnostic foundation. I need to ensure adequate oxygen delivery with a target SpO2 around 90–94% in most adults, recognizing that conservative oxygen targets are debated in sepsis and that evidence is insufficient to mandate a specific conservative target in sepsis-induced hypoxemia, so I should individualize and avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia while I stabilize the patient [^111rSEYd] [^1173BPBz]. I should double-check for immediate intubation triggers such as severe hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen, altered mental status, hemodynamic instability, or inability to protect the airway, and I should obtain an ABG, chest imaging, and basic labs to classify hypoxemic versus hypercapnic failure and begin identifying the precipitant [^114M5y1T] [^1131LJcx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify the failure pattern. Hypoxemic respiratory failure typically reflects V/Q mismatch or shunt and is common in pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema, or ILD, whereas hypercapnic failure reflects ventilatory pump failure from COPD, neuromuscular disease, or sedative overdose; mixed patterns are frequent in sepsis and decompensated heart failure, so I need to check for overlapping contributors and not anchor prematurely on a single cause [^115vRXwx] [^115eDCzp]. I should confirm ARDS using the Berlin framework when bilateral infiltrates are present and cardiac failure is not the primary explanation, and I must actively search for reversible drivers such as infection, pulmonary embolism, fluid overload, or medication effects to guide targeted therapy [^115vRXwx].

> Next, I should review noninvasive options for hypoxemic respiratory failure and be careful with the evidence. High-flow nasal oxygen is reasonable early for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is suggested over conventional oxygen in postextubation settings, but I need to remember these are conditional recommendations with low certainty and that patient selection and close monitoring are key [^114jwiAB] [^113tMToN]. Wait, let me verify the role of NIV in de novo hypoxemic failure: guidelines suggest NIV may be tried only with experienced teams, strict contraindication screening, and early reassessment, because failure of NIV in this context is associated with worse outcomes, so I should have a low threshold to escalate if there is no rapid improvement [^112wEXr4] [^114EtNAE]. I need to ensure continuous reassessment for signs of NIV failure such as rising respiratory rate, worsening dyspnea, mental status decline, or hemodynamic instability, and proceed to intubation without delay if these emerge [^113GYteG] [^113FYAsY].

> For hypercapnic failure, I should confirm that NIV is first-line in COPD exacerbations and cardiogenic pulmonary edema because it reduces intubation and mortality, and I must set up an integrated pathway with clear response criteria and rapid escalation plans to avoid delays in intubation when NIV fails [^112g3wve] [^114FAujT]. Let me consider adjuncts: treat the precipitant, correct acidosis, and avoid fluid overload; in patients with known LV dysfunction, a BNP-guided fluid strategy may help, but I should confirm that this is a consideration rather than a mandate and tailor to the clinical picture [^112XA9Ur] [^113uch14].

> Now, if the patient progresses to invasive mechanical ventilation, I need to implement lung-protective ventilation immediately. I should target tidal volumes of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight and keep plateau pressure below 30 cm H2O, using PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation while avoiding both atelectrauma and overdistension; this is a strong recommendation with robust evidence in ARDS and is reasonable to extend to other forms of hypoxemic failure when feasible [^114y1A28] [^115eDCzp]. Wait, I should verify the PEEP strategy: in moderate to severe ARDS, higher PEEP without prolonged recruitment maneuvers is suggested, whereas prolonged recruitment maneuvers are recommended against due to potential harm, so I will titrate PEEP to oxygenation and driving pressure while avoiding sustained high-pressure recruitment holds [^1116v4vi] [^113krQRy].

> I will now examine ARDS-specific adjuncts that change outcomes. Prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day in severe ARDS reduces mortality and is a strong recommendation; I should initiate it early when hypoxemia is severe and contraindications are absent, and I must ensure staffing and safety protocols are in place [^114y1A28] [^113krQRy]. Neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium is conditionally suggested in early severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia or patient–ventilator dyssynchrony, but I need to balance risks such as ICU-acquired weakness and use it selectively with daily reassessment [^1116v4vi] [^113krQRy]. A conservative fluid strategy is reasonable to reduce extravascular lung water and improve oxygenation, though I should individualize in the context of perfusion needs and shock [^112Cjh4a] [^115vRXwx]. Corticosteroids probably reduce mortality and shorten ventilation in ARDS and are now suggested in guidelines, so I should consider them once infection is addressed and monitor for hyperglycemia and other adverse effects [^116w6byw] [^113krQRy].

> But wait, what if hypoxemia remains refractory despite optimized conventional support? I should consider rescue therapies: inhaled pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide can transiently improve oxygenation but do not improve mortality, so I will reserve them for salvage and not expect outcome benefits; venovenous ECMO is conditionally suggested for severe ARDS without improvement, ideally in experienced centers with appropriate selection criteria, and I should involve early consultation if the trajectory is deteriorating [^115mVfm2] [^1116v4vi] [^113krQRy]. Alternative modes like APRV or HFOV lack consistent mortality benefit and should not be used routinely; if considered, they should be framed as rescue within a lung-protective philosophy and with careful monitoring for harm [^114y1A28] [^115eDCzp].

> I need to ensure I tailor management to special populations. In immunocompromised patients, I should prioritize rapid, minimally invasive diagnostics and consider NIV only with extreme caution given high failure rates and mortality once intubated, so early ICU involvement and a low threshold for definitive airway may be warranted [^111fAaqA]. In ILD with acute worsening, prognosis is poor and both NIV and IMV rarely change outcomes; I should reserve escalation for transplant candidates or clearly reversible causes and otherwise focus on comfort and goals-of-care discussions [^112wuDFu]. In neuromuscular respiratory failure, I should confirm that NIV is often first-line to unload the respiratory muscles, with close monitoring of vital capacity and MIP, and escalate to invasive ventilation if there is rapid progression or bulbar compromise; long-term planning and airway clearance are essential [^115hCMqE] [^112gzkWj]. In pediatrics, I should follow age-appropriate lung-protective targets and recognize that evidence for many adjuncts is extrapolated; early involvement of pediatric critical care is prudent [^115uhzxF].

> Next, I should review monitoring and prevention of complications. Ventilator-induced lung injury remains a constant threat, so I must minimize driving pressure, avoid high tidal volumes, and prevent both cyclic and static strain; I should double-check that my plateau and driving pressures remain within protective ranges daily [^115eDCzp]. I need to implement VAP prevention bundles, early mobility when feasible, and delirium minimization strategies to reduce ICU-acquired weakness and length of stay, aligning with general critical care best practices. Let me reconsider oxygen targets once more: while awaiting stronger evidence, I should avoid both hypoxemia and excessive hyperoxia and titrate FiO2 to the lowest effective level that maintains adequate SpO2 and PaO2 for the clinical context [^111rSEYd] [^1173BPBz].

> I will now examine liberation from mechanical ventilation, since prolonged ventilation worsens outcomes. Daily spontaneous breathing trials paired with readiness screening reduce ventilator days and complications, and I should avoid unnecessary sedation that suppresses ventilatory drive; I need to ensure a protocolized approach and reassess daily for extubation readiness [^116cmNBk]. Post-extubation, high-flow nasal oxygen reduces reintubation risk in selected patients, so I should consider it proactively in those at higher risk of failure, while remaining vigilant for recurrent respiratory distress [^114jwiAB] [^113tMToN].

> Finally, I should confirm plans for long-term sequelae and follow-up. ARDS survivors commonly have persistent physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments, so I must arrange outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation, neurocognitive screening, and mental health support, and I should discuss these potential sequelae early with patients and families to set expectations and goals [^115vRXwx]. Hold on, I should verify that my documentation captures severity stratification, ventilator parameters, adjuncts used, and timing of interventions, as this supports quality improvement and aligns with guideline emphasis on closing the evidence-to-practice gap in ARDS care [^112dDD7E].

Respiratory failure management centers on **rapid recognition** of hypoxemic or hypercapnic failure and **early, targeted oxygenation and ventilation** to stabilize gas exchange while treating the cause [^115eDCzp]. Start with **supplemental oxygen** and escalate to high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation when indicated; intubate for severe distress, altered mental status, or failure of noninvasive support [^114jwiAB] [^112wEXr4]. Use **lung-protective ventilation** (tidal volume 4–8 mL/kg PBW, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O) and apply prone positioning for severe ARDS; consider neuromuscular blockade and conservative fluid management as adjuncts [^114y1A28] [^1116v4vi]. Address the underlying cause (e.g. infection, COPD exacerbation, heart failure), monitor for complications, and wean early using daily spontaneous breathing trials to minimize ventilator-associated harm [^116cmNBk].

---

## Classification and pathophysiology

Respiratory failure is classified as **hypoxemic (type I)** — characterized by PaO2 < 60 mmHg with normal or low PaCO2 — or **hypercapnic (type II)** — defined by PaCO2 > 50 mmHg with hypoxemia. Hypoxemia arises from ventilation-perfusion mismatch, shunt, or impaired diffusion, whereas hypercapnia reflects alveolar hypoventilation or increased dead space [^115mVfm2].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Immediate assessment should evaluate **airway, breathing, and circulation**, with continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Obtain arterial blood gases to define the severity and guide therapy. Stabilization entails securing the airway, providing supplemental oxygen, and supporting ventilation as needed [^1131LJcx].

---

## Oxygenation strategies

### Supplemental oxygen therapy

Begin with **nasal cannula or Venturi masks** to target SpO2 ≥ 90% (88–92% in COPD). Titrate to the lowest effective FiO2 to avoid hyperoxia-related injury [^1137ocL1].

---

### High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO)

Use HFNO for **acute hypoxemic respiratory failure** as an alternative to conventional oxygen or noninvasive ventilation; it improves oxygenation, reduces work of breathing, and may lower intubation rates in selected patients [^114SRsaM] [^113FYAsY].

---

### Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)

NIV is indicated for **hypercapnic respiratory failure** due to COPD exacerbations or cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and may be considered in immunocompromised patients with hypoxemic failure. Contraindications include respiratory arrest, severe facial trauma, hemodynamic instability, or inability to protect the airway [^112wEXr4] [^114gkJcR].

---

## Indications for invasive mechanical ventilation

Invasive mechanical ventilation is indicated for:

- Severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg) refractory to noninvasive support
- Hypercapnic acidosis (pH < 7.25) with altered mental status
- Respiratory arrest or severe respiratory distress
- Failure of noninvasive ventilation
- Hemodynamic instability or multi-organ failure [^112wEXr4]

---

## Ventilatory strategies and lung-protective ventilation

### Lung-protective ventilation

Use **low tidal volumes** of 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O to limit ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [^114y1A28]. Maintain adequate PEEP to prevent atelectasis and improve oxygenation, and titrate FiO2 to the lowest effective level to avoid hyperoxia [^1116v4vi].

---

### Prone positioning

Apply **prone positioning** for severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg) to improve oxygenation and reduce mortality [^114p8sEa].

---

### Neuromuscular blockade

Consider **short-term neuromuscular blockade** in early severe ARDS to improve ventilator synchrony and reduce VILI [^113krQRy].

---

### Conservative fluid management

Use a **conservative fluid strategy** to reduce pulmonary edema and improve oxygenation in ARDS [^112Cjh4a].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Corticosteroids**: Consider in moderate-to-severe ARDS to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes [^116w6byw].
- **Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**: For refractory hypoxemia despite optimal conventional therapy [^113YgyL2].
- **Inhaled vasodilators**: Consider inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol for refractory hypoxemia, though evidence is limited [^114PBuhc].

---

## Management of specific underlying conditions

| **Condition** | **Management considerations** |
|-|-|
| COPD exacerbation | - Noninvasive ventilation <br/> - Bronchodilators <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Antibiotics if infection suspected [^114UbfqK] |
| Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema | - Noninvasive ventilation <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Vasodilators <br/> - Inotropes if indicated [^114UbfqK] |
| ARDS | - Lung-protective ventilation <br/> - Prone positioning <br/> - Conservative fluid management <br/> - Corticosteroids [^114y1A28] |
| Neuromuscular disorders | - Noninvasive ventilation <br/> - Frequent monitoring <br/> - Early intubation if progression [^112gzkWj] |

---

## Monitoring and complications

Continuously monitor **oxygenation, ventilation, hemodynamics, and respiratory mechanics**. Watch for ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, and ICU-acquired weakness. Early mobilization, infection prevention, and sedation minimization reduce complications [^notfound].

---

## Weaning and liberation from mechanical ventilation

Conduct **daily spontaneous breathing trials** to assess readiness for extubation, and use protocolized weaning to reduce ventilator duration and complications [^113YgyL2].

---

## Long-term outcomes and follow-up

Survivors of respiratory failure often have long-term sequelae, including pulmonary function impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and psychological morbidity. Structured follow-up, pulmonary rehabilitation, and mental health support are essential [^notfound].

---

Effective management of respiratory failure requires **rapid stabilization**, targeted oxygenation and ventilation, and treatment of the underlying cause, with careful monitoring and early weaning to minimize complications and improve outcomes.

Despite significant advances in our understanding and management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the morbidity and mortality from ARDS remains high. Given the limited number of effective treatments for established ARDS, the strategic focus of ARDS research has shifted toward identifying patients with or at high risk of ARDS early in the course of the underlying illness, when strategies to reduce the development and progression of ARDS and associated organ failures can be systematically evaluated. In this review, we summarize the rationale, current evidence, and future directions in ARDS prevention.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this Series paper the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition and evidence that could inform future revisions are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

Data Synthesis

Our understanding of lung pathophysiology and the role of ventilator-induced lung injury through basic science investigation has led to advances in lung protective strategies for the mechanical ventilation support of patients with severe respiratory failure. Specific modalities reviewed include low-tidal volume ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, the open lung approach, recruitment maneuvers, airway pressure release ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, prone positioning, and extracorporeal life support. The pharmacologic strategies (including corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide) investigated for the treatment of severe respiratory failure are also reviewed.

Conclusion

In patients with severe respiratory failure, an incremental approach to the management of severe hypoxemia requires implementation of the strategies reviewed, with knowledge of the evidence base to support these strategies.

### Can we predict the future of respiratory failure prediction? [^111dHtf2]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Prediction of respiratory failure progression is a critical topic that may benefit from the integration of ML models into clinical practice. ML offers powerful tools for predicting respiratory failure by integrating multimodal data to elucidate complex patterns that clinicians cannot always recognize. These models are particularly well-suited to the area of respiratory failure given the high number of data streams (compared to other areas of the hospital) and its resource intensive management. Additionally, current management of acute respiratory failure is often reactive. Enhancing predictive capabilities through ML could facilitate a more proactive approach to patient care, potentially improving outcomes. However, many challenges must be addressed to achieve meaningful integration into clinical care. These challenges include ensuring data consistency and quality, defining important outcomes, prospective implementation and validation of ML models, conducting clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness, and ensuring equitable model performance across socioeconomic groups. Despite the challenges, ML offers a promising avenue to advance critical care and improve patient outcomes.

### Beyond the guidelines for non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: implications for practice [^1154cnW7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use and when and how it should be used has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this Series paper, we look beyond the guidelines to what is happening in everyday clinical practice in the real world, how patient selection can be refined to maximise the chances of a successful outcome, and emerging alternative therapies. Real-world application of non-invasive ventilation diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly with regard to patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes education programmes need to stress these issues and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation that is delivered needs to be monitored by regular audit.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^117KyKpF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic, resulting in unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems globally. Although most patients present with mild symptoms including fever and malaise, 8–32% of patients presenting to hospital may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), depending on the admission criteria and available resources, with an ICU mortality of 34–50%.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) who are admitted to the ICU with hypoxaemia typically require some form of respiratory support. COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may differ from other causes of ARDS, since patients may present with profound hypoxaemia accompanied by a wide range of respiratory compliance. However, whether ARDS due to COVID-19 is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS remains a matter of debate. Consequently, there is no uniform agreement on the optimal management of respiratory failure, including the most appropriate oxygenation and ventilation strategies that limit or prevent additional lung injury or other complications in these patients.

There are few published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) related to the respiratory management of C-ARF. As a result, clinical practice variations in the management of C-ARF exist, making the optimal therapeutic management unclear. Given the dearth of evidence, we aimed to achieve agreement on the respiratory management of C-ARF using a Delphi process, defined by at least 70% agreement among experts who met pre-specified qualification criteria.

### Advances in the support of respiratory failure: putting all the evidence together [^115KA2t9]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In recent years physicians have learned to care better for their patients with acute respiratory failure. For no condition has this improvement become more evident than in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a signature problem of intensive care. Over time, we have learned important lessons. We know from research and experience that despite well-intentioned attempts at revision, our clinical definition for ARDS still needs work. We are now also aware that many factors — mechanical and nonmechanical — contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Timing has proven key to the efficacy of several important ventilation-related therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the stage and severity of disease determine an intervention's potential value or harm. A collective implication of the growing evidence base related to respiratory failure is that reducing oxygen consumption and ventilator demands is a rational point of focus and high priority when attempting to optimize respiratory support for the individual patient.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^115hCMqE]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Guideline overview and limitations — neuromuscular disease (NMD) respiratory management: Respiratory failure is common and often the final cause of death in patients with NMD; the guideline examined management literature to provide evidence-based and expert guidance, offering recommendations where evidence allowed and consensus-based and best practice statements when high-quality evidence was lacking. The document highlights heterogeneity across NMDs, limited randomized controlled trials, reliance on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) evidence, the need to individualize elements by rate of progression, and that the guideline focuses on diagnosis and therapy initiation rather than details of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV). The panel recommends shared decision-making that respects patient preferences, treatment goals, and quality-of-life considerations, acknowledges access may depend on local resources and may require referral to a specialist center, and frames the guideline as an advocacy opportunity to ensure equal access given potential for increased health inequities; future randomized controlled trials are noted as needed to establish a higher level of evidence.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^111fh2eW]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Study Design and Methods

An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations.

Results

Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement.

Interpretation

Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.

### Respiratory management of the patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^1144Cnk9]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In 2010, Care Considerations for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was published in Lancet Neurology, and in 2018, these guidelines were updated. Since the publication of the first set of guidelines, survival of individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has increased. With contemporary medical management, survival often extends into the fourth decade of life and beyond. Effective transition of respiratory care from pediatric to adult medicine is vital to optimize patient safety, prognosis, and quality of life. With genetic and other emerging drug therapies in development, standardization of care is necessary to accurately assess treatment effects in clinical trials. This revision of respiratory recommendations preserves a fundamental strength of the original guidelines: namely, reliance on a limited number of respiratory tests to guide patient assessment and management. A progressive therapeutic strategy is presented that includes lung volume recruitment, assisted coughing, and assisted ventilation (initially nocturnally, with the subsequent addition of daytime ventilation for progressive respiratory failure). This revision also stresses the need for serial monitoring of respiratory muscle strength to characterize an individual's respiratory phenotype of severity as well as provide baseline assessments for clinical trials. Clinical controversies and emerging areas are included.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

### Acute respiratory failure in immunocompromised adults [^111fAaqA]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute respiratory failure occurs in up to half of patients with haematological malignancies and 15% of those with solid tumours or solid organ transplantation. Mortality remains high. Factors associated with mortality include a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, older age, frailty or poor performance status, delayed intensive care unit admission, and acute respiratory failure due to an invasive fungal infection or unknown cause. In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undetermined cause, a standardised diagnostic investigation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments. Collaborative and multidisciplinary clinical and research networks are crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and causation and to develop less invasive diagnostic strategies and more targeted treatment options.

### Year in review 2012: critical care – respirology [^112ygKr8]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory failure is a dominant feature of critical illness. In this review, we discuss 17 studies published last year in Critical Care. The discussion focuses on articles on several topics: respiratory monitoring, acute respiratory distress syndrome, noninvasive ventilation, airway management, secretion management and weaning.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113GYteG]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Non-invasive respiratory support has consistently shown variable efficacy across different scenarios in preventing the harmful effects of invasive ventilation and improving outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure. A thorough assessment of the patients' initial characteristics, combined with close physiological monitoring to adjust settings is essential to tailor a personalized approach and minimize the risk of harm and failure. Importantly, applying non-invasive respiratory support in critically ill patients, particularly those with de novo acute respiratory failure, demands a delicate balance between avoiding invasive ventilation and ensuring timely intubation when clinically indicated.

### Ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome: a consensus of two [^114FjMdE]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesize the emerging body of experimental, observational, and clinical trial data into a practical guideline for safe and effective ventilatory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Data Sources

Relevant, peer-reviewed, scientific literature and personal observations from clinical practice.

Study Selection

Relevant experimental studies and high-impact observational and clinical trials of acute respiratory distress syndrome management.

Data Extraction

Detailed review of information contained in published scientific work.

Data Synthesis

Interactive discussions between the authors that culminated in our consensus view of appropriate management.

Conclusions

Prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury while accomplishing the essential life-supporting roles of mechanical ventilation is a complex undertaking that requires application of principles founded on a broad experimental and clinical database and on the results of well-executed clinical trials. At the bedside, execution of an effective lung-protective ventilation strategy remains an empirical process best guided by integrated physiology and a readiness to revise the management approach depending on the individual's response.

### Identification and management of acute neuromuscular respiratory failure in the ICU [^1166AgGk]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory failure is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of neuromuscular diseases. Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis of new or worsening chronic neuromuscular disease have important clinical management and prognostic implications. In this article, we present an approach to the acute presentation of undifferentiated neuromuscular respiratory failure in the ICU and guidance for determination and respiratory management of the underlying disorder.

### Advances in the support of respiratory failure: putting all the evidence together [^116qh3Fy]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Considerable progress has been made recently in the understanding of how best to accomplish safe and effective ventilation of patients with acute lung injury. Mechanical and nonmechanical factors contribute to causation of ventilator-associated lung injury. Intervention timing helps determine the therapeutic efficacy and outcome, and the stage and severity of the disease process may determine the patient's vulnerability as well as an intervention's value. Reducing oxygen consumption and ventilatory demands are key to a successful strategy for respiratory support of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Results from major clinical trials can be understood against the background of the complex physiology of ventilator-induced lung injury.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1156rEKg]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory condition characterized by progressive decline in lung function. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare services and society that is likely to increase in the future. It is, therefore, important to ensure that this disease is managed as effectively as possible. In many therapeutic areas, management guidelines have been developed in an attempt to ensure that physicians are aware of optimal disease management and cost-effective use of healthcare resources. Such guidelines are usually prepared by consensus among clinical experts or following a systematic review of the evidence. However, there are a number of barriers to the implementation of treatment guidelines, including the sheer weight of guidelines in all therapeutic areas, a focus on scientific knowledge rather than on clinical practice, lack of trust in the recommendations, practical considerations (e.g. time, resources, budget) and failure to include the perspective of patients. The management guidelines most likely to be implemented are those that are quick and easy to use, relevant to the user's practice and from a credible source. In COPD, over 40 guidelines have been developed, mainly by local respiratory societies as a result of local expert consensus. The guidelines developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are evidence-based and have the backing of international experts. Local implementation plans have been developed to help ensure that GOLD recommendations are implemented in practice. In all COPD guidelines, however, lung function measures feature prominently with limited reference to outcome measures of interest to patients and healthcare payers (e.g. frequency of exacerbations requiring hospitalization). Low expectations among physicians and patients may also impair implementation. In conclusion, guidelines may improve the management of COPD, but the main challenge is to ensure implementation.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1165S9xh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to 10% of patients with respiratory failure admitted through the emergency department. Use of noninvasive respiratory support has proliferated in recent years; clinicians must understand the relative merits and risks of these technologies and know how to recognize signs of failure. The cornerstone of ARDS care of the mechanically ventilated patient is low-tidal volume ventilation based on ideal body weight. Adjunctive therapies, such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may have a role in the emergency department management of ARDS depending on patient and department characteristics.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1143Lex9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Aims

The purpose of this guideline is to provide an evidence-based framework for the management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that will inform both key decisions in the care of individual patients and broader policy. Our recommendations are neither dictates nor standards of care. We cannot take into account all of the features of individual patients and complex local factors; all we can do is to synthesise relevant evidence and to put it into the context of current critical care medicine. Similarly, our recommendations are not comprehensive: these guidelines have relevance to a fraction of the total number of decisions that are required of carers for these complex patients. Indeed, the current state of the art for the management of ARDS has been recently reviewedand comparable guidelines have been produced by national and international stakeholders.

Scope

The topics considered were chosen by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in the light of results from a survey carried out for the Intensive Care Society (ICS), including 556 responses from 3200 members. Popular topics were excluded by the GDG if it was felt that there was a dearth of evidence (eg, appropriate diagnostic investigations and the role of specialist centres), when the evidence was not specific to ARDS (weaning from mechanical ventilation, nutrition and the timing of tracheostomy) and if there was overlap with existing guidelines (post-ICU (intensive care unit) care and rehabilitation).

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114jwiAB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-flow nasal oxygen — key questions and systematic review methods are summarized as follows: The guideline's questions addressed comparative effectiveness and harms of HFNO versus NIV or COT in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory failure, including whether effects vary by patient characteristics, disease or diagnosis, protocol or device settings, or location of administration. Reviewers searched English-language literature from January 2000 to July 2020 with a bridge search through February 2021, assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane approach for randomized controlled trials, analyzed initial management and postextubation acute respiratory failure separately, and conducted subgroup analyses by clinical setting, disease indication, treatment duration, and type of acute respiratory failure. Certainty of evidence was rated using a modification of GRADE (high, moderate, low, or insufficient), and GRADE guidance was adapted to narratively describe findings by effect size and certainty.

### Emergency department management of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in adults with COVID-19 [^115mVfm2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

While emergency physicians are familiar with the management of hypoxemic respiratory failure, management of mechanical ventilation and advanced therapies for oxygenation in the emergency department have become essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Objective

We review the current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID-19 and place it in the context of known evidence-based management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the emergency department.

Discussion

COVID-19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion. Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma.

Conclusions

High flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have a more limited role in COVID-19 because of the risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases, but can be considered. Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in a prone position while awake. Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lung-protective volumes and low pressures. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure can be beneficial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia. Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation. Finally, patients with refractory severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 should be considered for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113tMToN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in hospitalized adults — ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than noninvasive ventilation in hospitalized adults for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than conventional oxygen therapy for hospitalized adults with postextubation acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adult patients with acute respiratory failure treated in a hospital setting (including emergency departments, hospital wards, intermediate or step-down units, and ICUs).

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112Cjh4a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Grade recommendation justification

Despite the low quality of evidence for the majority of outcomes, and the results being driven largely by a single trial, conservative fluid management may be beneficial without evidence of harm. We therefore suggest that in adult patients with ARDS, clinicians consider the use of a conservative fluid strategy which uses fluid restriction, diuretics and possibly hyperoncotic albumin to avoid a positive fluid balance in preference to a liberal fluid strategy.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1116v4vi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This document updates previously published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), incorporating new evidence addressing the use of corticosteroids, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

Methods

We summarized evidence addressing four "PICO questions" (patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome). A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in ARDS used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

We suggest the use of: 1) corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), 2) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in selected patients with severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), 3) neuromuscular blockers in patients with early severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), and 4) higher PEEP without lung recruitment maneuvers as opposed to lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty), and 5) we recommend against using prolonged lung recruitment maneuvers in patients with moderate to severe ARDS (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).

Conclusions

We provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the management of ARDS. Individual patient and illness characteristics should be factored into clinical decision making and implementation of these recommendations while additional evidence is generated from much-needed clinical trials.

### Management of acute respiratory failure in interstitial lung diseases: overview and clinical insights [^112PXurR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes more than 200 entities characterized by widespread fibrotic and/or inflammatory abnormalities of the lung parenchyma, Fig. 1. Respiratory failure is a common complication in advanced stages or following acute worsening of ILDs and can be classified on the basis of different parameters, including time of onset (acute or chronic), severity (mild to severe), and causes (reversible or irreversible).

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure [^114gkJcR]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in the management of respiratory failure in critical care units, but it must be used selectively depending on the patient's diagnosis and clinical characteristics.

Data

We review the strong evidence supporting the use of noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure to prevent intubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in immunocompromised patients, as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require initial intubation. Weaker evidence supports consideration of noninvasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with postoperative or postextubation respiratory failure; patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome; during bronchoscopy; or as a means of preoxygenation before intubation in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia.

Conclusion

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in managing patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of noninvasive ventilation failure and promptly intubated before a crisis develops. The application of noninvasive ventilation by a trained and experienced intensive care unit team, with careful patient selection, should optimize patient outcomes.

### Sepsis, the administration of IV fluids, and respiratory failure: a retrospective analysis-SAIFR study [^11215eq2]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although resuscitation with IV fluids is the cornerstone of sepsis management, consensus regarding their association with improvement in clinical outcomes is lacking.

Research Question

Is there a difference in the incidence of respiratory failure in patients with sepsis who received guideline-recommended initial IV fluid bolus of 30 mL/kg or more conservative resuscitation of less than 30 mL/kg?

Study Design and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data conducted at an academic medical center in Omaha, Nebraska. We abstracted data from 214 patients with sepsis admitted to a single academic medical center between June 2017 and June 2018. Patients were stratified by receipt of guideline-recommended fluid bolus. The primary outcome was respiratory failure defined as an increase in oxygen flow rate or more intense oxygenation and ventilation support; oxygen requirement and volume were measured at admission, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and at discharge. Subgroup analyses were conducted in high-risk patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Results

A total of 62 patients (29.0%) received appropriate bolus treatment. The overall rate of respiratory failure was not statistically different between patients who received appropriate bolus or did not (40.3% vs 36.8%; p = 0.634). Likewise, no differences were observed in time to respiratory failure (P = 0.645) or risk of respiratory failure (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7–1.7]; p = 0.774). Results were similar within the high-risk CHF and CKD subgroups.

Interpretation

In this single-center retrospective study, we found that by broadly defining respiratory failure as an increase in oxygen requirements, a conservative initial IV fluid resuscitation strategy did not correlate with decreased rates of hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Respiratory failure [^111wqwX4]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

On the basis of research evidence, (1)(2) numerous diseases and conditions can impair gas exchange, resulting in failure to meet the body's metabolic demands and leading to respiratory failure. On the basis of consensus, (1)(2)(7)(8)(9)(10) the clinical presentations of respiratory failure depend on the underlying cause and the level of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Early diagnosis, close monitoring, and timely intervention are of utmost importance. On the basis of research evidence, (5)(14)(25) interventions range from noninvasive methods, such as close monitoring and supplemental oxygen, to full respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and in extreme cases even the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Noninvasive respiratory support in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [^114eYaTc]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

For more than 40 years, noninvasive ventilation has been the first-line preferred therapy for acute-on-chronic conditions, such as COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The use of noninvasive ventilation in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure, however, has been met with mixed results associated with higher risks of intubation (failure of therapy) and with higher risks of mortality. The purpose of this review was to describe the current evidence and important considerations when patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure are managed with noninvasive ventilation.

### Management of acute respiratory failure in interstitial lung diseases: overview and clinical insights [^112wuDFu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by widespread fibrotic and inflammatory abnormalities of the lung. Respiratory failure is a common complication in advanced stages or following acute worsening of the underlying disease. Aim of this review is to evaluate the current evidence in determining the best management of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in ILDs.

Methods

A literature search was performed in the Medline/PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies that investigated the management of ARF in ILDs (the last search was conducted on November 2017).

Results

In managing ARF, it is important to establish an adequate diagnostic and therapeutic management depending on whether the patient has an underlying known chronic ILD or ARF is presenting in an unknown or de novo ILD. In the first case both primary causes, such as acute exacerbations of the disease, and secondary causes, including concomitant pulmonary infections, fluid overload and pulmonary embolism need to be investigated. In the second case, a diagnostic work-up that includes investigations in regards to ILD etiology, such as autoimmune screening and bronchoalveolar lavage, should be performed, and possible concomitant causes of ARF have to be ruled out.

Oxygen supplementation and ventilatory support need to be titrated according to the severity of ARF and patients' therapeutic options. High-Flow Nasal oxygen might potentially be an alternative to conventional oxygen therapy in patients requiring both high flows and high oxygen concentrations to correct hypoxemia and control dyspnea, however the evidence is still scarce. Neither Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) nor Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) seem to change the poor outcomes associated to advanced stages of ILDs. However, in selected patients, such as those with less severe ARF, a NIV trial might help in the early recognition of NIV-responder patients, who may present a better short-term prognosis. More invasive techniques, including IMV and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, should be limited to patients listed for lung transplant or with reversible causes of ARF.

Conclusions

Despite the overall poor prognosis of ARF in ILDs, a personalized approach may positively influence patients' management, possibly leading to improved outcomes. However, further studies are warranted.

### Mechanical ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: a review of new strategies for the practicing hospitalist [^113YgyL2]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of mechanical ventilation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is to support adequate gas exchange without harming the lungs. How patients are mechanically ventilated can significantly impact their ultimate outcomes.

Methods

This review focuses on emerging evidence regarding strategies for mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure including: low tidal volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), novel ventilator modes as alternatives to low tidal volume ventilation, adjunctive strategies that may enhance recovery in ARDS, the use of lung-protective strategies in patients without ARDS, rescue therapies in refractory hypoxemia, and an evidence-based approach to weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Results

Once a patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, low tidal volume ventilation remains the best strategy in ARDS. Adjunctive therapies in ARDS include a conservative fluid management strategy, as well as neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning in moderate-to-severe disease. There is also emerging evidence that a lung-protective strategy may benefit non-ARDS patients. For patients with refractory hypoxemia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered. Once the patient demonstrates signs of recovery, the best approach to liberation from mechanical ventilation involves daily spontaneous breathing trials and protocolized assessment of readiness for extubation.

Conclusions

Prompt recognition of ARDS and use of lung-protective ventilation, as well as evidence-based adjunctive therapies, remain the cornerstones of caring for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to consider lung-protective ventilation in non-ARDS patients as well, though the evidence supporting this practice is less conclusive.

### When to intubate in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure? Options and opportunities for evidence-informed decision making in the intensive care unit [^114M5y1T]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The optimal timing of intubation in acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure is uncertain and became a point of controversy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Invasive mechanical ventilation is a potentially life-saving intervention but carries substantial risks, including injury to the lungs and diaphragm, pneumonia, intensive care unit-acquired muscle weakness, and haemodynamic impairment. In deciding when to intubate, clinicians must balance premature exposure to the risks of ventilation with the potential harms of unassisted breathing, including disease progression and worsening multiorgan failure. Currently, the optimal timing of intubation is unclear. In this Personal View, we examine a range of parameters that could serve as triggers to initiate invasive mechanical ventilation. The utility of a parameter (eg, the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen) to predict the likelihood of a patient undergoing intubation does not necessarily mean that basing the timing of intubation on that parameter will improve therapeutic outcomes. We examine options for clinical investigation to make progress on establishing the optimal timing of intubation.

### Current evidence for the effectiveness of heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula supportive therapy in adult patients with respiratory failure [^111G7EPh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Delivery of heated and humidified oxygen at high flow rates through nasal cannula is now widely used in adult patients. Its mechanisms of action and potential clinical benefits can help to improve the management of patients with either acute or chronic respiratory failure. With the evidence currently available, several questions still remain unanswered; in the absence of any general recommendations, decisions on HFNC treatment should be individualized in each particular situation. However, HFNC therapy is an innovative and powerful technique that is currently changing the management of patients with respiratory failure.

### Clinical review: liberation from mechanical ventilation [^116cmNBk]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is the defining event of intensive care unit (ICU) management. Although it is a life saving intervention in patients with acute respiratory failure and other disease entities, a major goal of critical care clinicians should be to liberate patients from mechanical ventilation as early as possible to avoid the multitude of complications and risks associated with prolonged unnecessary mechanical ventilation, including ventilator induced lung injury, ventilator associated pneumonia, increased length of ICU and hospital stay, and increased cost of care delivery. This review highlights the recent developments in assessing and testing for readiness of liberation from mechanical ventilation, the etiology of weaning failure, the value of weaning protocols, and a simple practical approach for liberation from mechanical ventilation.

Methodology

Clinical questions were gathered in the PICOT (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Time) format to define the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search. Systematic electronic database searches were conducted in order to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each clinical question the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), Ovid EMBASE, EMSCO CINAHL, Ovid PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). An initial search was carried out in November 2010 using a combination of indexed and free-text terms defining the clinical questions that had been agreed by the guideline group as important in formulating guidelines in AHRF. It was limited to studies after 1990, in adults, in journals published in English and where at least an abstract was available. The searches identified a total of 582 potential papers which were subsequently supplemented by publications known to members or resulting from additional searches undertaken by the writing groups after 2010. The literature search was run again for relevant publications between 2010 and 2013 in September 2013, yielding a further 308 potentially relevant references. Additional references were subsequently included from personal collections.

Appraisal was performed using the criteria stipulated by the AGREE collaboration. Each paper was appraised by at least two reviewers. The writing lead for each section read the title and abstract of papers identified and agreed with at least one member of each writing group whether such a paper was definitely, possibly relevant or not relevant to the section. The criteria used were whether the paper addressed a clinical question, whether the study method used was satisfactory and that it was available in English. Full papers were obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts. Two members for each section independently appraised each paper using the SIGN critical appraisal checklists. An evidence level was assigned to each study using SIGN methodology (table 1) and recommendations formulated according to this evidence base (table 2).

### Efficacy of non-invasive and invasive respiratory management strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114EtNAE]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) is the most common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission among adult patients, with a hospital mortality rate of approximately 30%. Non-invasive respiratory management has been investigated widely among patients with AHRF. Non-invasive ventilation is recommended to reduce the risk of endotracheal intubation and mortality in patients with AHRF, especially due to cardiopulmonary oedema. Compared with standard oxygen therapy (SOT), high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is also a preferable option for patients with AHRF.

While non-invasive ventilation has been reported to be used in 15% of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it may be associated with higher ICU mortality, especially in patients with severe hypoxaemia. A definite diagnosis of ARDS may be difficult or impossible before the implementation of respiratory management strategies, because the precise measurement of the actual inspired fraction of oxygen may be unavailable and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) not used. Furthermore, when implementing non-invasive respiratory management strategies in patients with AHRF, we need to consider the cause of the respiratory failure, especially whether it was an established disease for efficacy of non-invasive ventilation including cardiopulmonary oedema or not. De novo AHRF refers to AHRF that occurs without any prior chronic respiratory diseases. Most patients in this category have pneumonia or ARDS with neither heart failure nor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended in patients with de novo AHRF, and the efficacy of the HFNO has not been consistent among these patients.

This review documents important progress made in 2013 in the field of critical care respirology, in particular with regard to acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Twenty-five original articles published in the respirology and critical care sections of Critical Care are discussed in the following categories: pre-clinical studies, protective lung ventilation – how low can we go, non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure, diagnosis and prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, and promising interventions for acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113YoKhb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) for acute respiratory failure — scope and methods — address the use of HFNO in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure, targeting adult patients treated in hospital settings and clinicians as the audience, and base recommendations on a systematic review with searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published in English from January 2000 through July 2020 with an updated bridge search through February 2021 that compared HFNO with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or conventional oxygen therapy (COT). The CGC and a technical expert panel suggested stratifying the primary analysis by indication (initial management of acute respiratory failure and postextubation respiratory failure), committee and CGC Public Panel members were asked a priori to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes, members agreed a priori on thresholds to categorize effect sizes for specified outcomes, and GRADE guidance was adopted to narratively describe findings; ACP staff also searched additional databases through October 2020 to identify evidence on patient values and preferences.

### Moving from the epidemiology to the treatment of respiratory failure in patients with cardiogenic shock [^114p1eD5]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations and potentially center-specific nuances, the authors should be congratulated for an incredibly well-phenotyped patient population and important study. As the authors state, this study is not intended or powered to compare specific therapies but to detail current practice patterns of an understudied but critical aspect of cardiogenic shock management. Their work will provide an important reference for further studies on respiratory failure in patients with cardiogenic shock and likely inspire future research.

Numerous questions are easily generated from their study. What induction agent should we use for patients with cardiogenic shock? What is the best sedation strategy for this patient population? Does it matter depending on the etiology of shock? There is some recently published hypothesis-generating data for both induction agents and sedation in patients with acute myocardial infarction, but both require validation and more research before changing practice. How do we develop CICU-specific SAT/SBT criteria? Are we delaying extubation by waiting for removal of femoral access MCS? While heart failure is a known risk factor for extubation failure, should all patients be extubated to respiratory support? Would certain patients benefit from noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula? Other important questions involve the differences in practice patterns and outcomes among different subpopulations included in this study, most notably acute myocardial infarction vs heart failure patients and cardiac arrest vs noncardiac arrest patients. Furthermore, additional variability in IMV management is expected in isolated left ventricular vs isolated right ventricular vs biventricular shock.

Finally, it is expected that institution-specific factors introduce a great deal of variability in overall practice patterns, as has been demonstrated repeatedly in CCCTN literature. Therefore, for many of these questions, the next steps should include characterization across multiple centers, potentially through the creation of registries specific to respiratory failure in the CICU. Embedding modules specific to respiratory status/IMV in established registries such as CCCTN or the Cardiogenic Shock Working Group would offer a valuable opportunity for multicenter analysis but may lack the granular insights from a respiratory failure-specific registry. To be sure, dedicated CICU research is sorely needed to move the management of respiratory failure in the acute cardiac patient from an art toward more of a science.

Pediatric acute heart failure — respiratory support: Children with acute HF often require respiratory support to improve oxygenation and reduce respiratory distress. Invasive ventilation is recommended for children with acute HF and respiratory failure (Class I, Level of Evidence C). Noninvasive ventilation is reasonable for the treatment of children with acute HF, pulmonary edema, and significantly increased work of breathing (in the presence or absence of pulmonary edema) as an adjunct to other medical therapies (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C).

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114SRsaM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure. It is based on the best available evidence on the benefits and harms of HFNO, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of HFNO. The patient-centered health outcomes evaluated included all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay, 30-day hospital readmissions, hospital-acquired pneumonia, days of intubation or reintubation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU transfers, patient comfort, dyspnea, delirium, barotrauma, compromised nutrition, gastric dysfunction, functional independence at discharge, discharge disposition, and skin breakdown. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adult patients with acute respiratory failure treated in a hospital setting (including emergency departments, hospital wards, intermediate or step-down units, and ICUs).

Recommendation 1a

ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than noninvasive ventilation in hospitalized adults for the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 1b

ACP suggests that clinicians use high-flow nasal oxygen rather than conventional oxygen therapy for hospitalized adults with postextubation acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome: is a different approach to management warranted? [^1142FyTw]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units across the globe. As experience of managing patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS has grown, so too have efforts to classify patients according to respiratory system mechanics, with a view to optimising ventilatory management. Personalised lung-protective mechanical ventilation reduces mortality and has become the mainstay of treatment in ARDS. In this Viewpoint, we address ventilatory strategies in the context of recent discussions on phenotypic heterogeneity in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Although early reports suggested that COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features that set it apart from historical ARDS, emerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with ARDS, with or without COVID-19, are broadly similar. In the absence of evidence to support a shift away from the current paradigm of ventilatory management, we strongly recommend adherence to evidence-based management, informed by bedside physiology, as resources permit.

### Clinical challenges in mechanical ventilation [^115eDCzp]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Mechanical ventilation supports gas exchange and alleviates the work of breathing when the respiratory muscles are overwhelmed by an acute pulmonary or systemic insult. Although mechanical ventilation is not generally considered a treatment for acute respiratory failure per se, ventilator management warrants close attention because inappropriate ventilation can result in injury to the lungs or respiratory muscles and worsen morbidity and mortality. Key clinical challenges include averting intubation in patients with respiratory failure with non-invasive techniques for respiratory support; delivering lung-protective ventilation to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury; maintaining adequate gas exchange in severely hypoxaemic patients; avoiding the development of ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction; and diagnosing and treating the many pathophysiological mechanisms that impair liberation from mechanical ventilation. Personalisation of mechanical ventilation based on individual physiological characteristics and responses to therapy can further improve outcomes.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^112gzkWj]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness — CHEST clinical practice guideline reports that an expert panel conducted a systematic review using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach and a modified Delphi technique to reach consensus, and based on 128 studies generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. Evidence of best practices is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated, and that an individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to neuromuscular disease (NMD). When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies, and emphasized that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group with differing rates of decline in lung function, with the clinician's role including bedside evaluation and shared decision-making that respects patient preferences, quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources.

### COVID-19 infection: implications for perioperative and critical care physicians [^116jcrer]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Patients with COVID-19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management. Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep themselves safe while doing so. Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

### Management of oxygenation in pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [^115uhzxF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

The prognosis for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults and children has improved since its formal acceptance as a clinical entity in 1967. Because acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the hallmark of acute lung injury and ARDS, the management of oxygenation is crucial. Physicians managing pediatric patients with acute lung injury or ARDS are faced with a complex array of options influencing oxygenation. Certain treatment strategies can influence clinical outcomes, such as a lung-protective ventilation strategy that specifies a low tidal volume (6 mL/kg) and a plateau pressure limit (30 cm H(2)O) (Acute Respiratory Distress Network, N Engl J Med 2000;342:1301–1308). Other lung-protective strategies such as different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, altered inspiratory:expiratory ratios, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and extraneous gases or drugs may impact clinical outcomes but require further clinical study. This paper reviews state-of-the-art strategies on the management of oxygenation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and attempts to guide pediatric pulmonologists in managing children with respiratory failure.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114UbfqK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

### The patient experience during noninvasive respiratory support [^114NmvCE]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive respiratory support has been a proven intervention for patients with acute respiratory failure. CPAP, noninvasive ventilation, and high-flow nasal cannula have been effectively used to support the respiratory needs of this patient population. Even with the application of these devices over many years, however, some patients are not successfully managed on noninvasive support modalities. Many factors can lead to failure of these interventions, several of which impact patient-ventilator synchrony. This paper reviews these factors, along with other issues that may impact tolerance of these devices. By addressing these factors and tailoring the intervention to the needs of the individual patient, the clinician can improve the likelihood of successful management of the respiratory condition in the patient with acute respiratory failure who receives noninvasive respiratory support.

### Promises and challenges of personalized medicine to guide ARDS therapy [^113L75rK]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The mainstay of ARDS treatment remains optimal supportive therapy with lung protective ventilation, proning, and a fluid conservative strategy, but the prospect of personalized therapies offers promise for further advances in treating ARDS. Although the heterogeneity of ARDS in some ways presents a challenge for personalization, it also provides a rich landscape with many opportunities for further investigation. By identifying clinical and biological characteristics that may differentially respond to existing and investigational treatments, clinical trials can be enriched in an adaptive manner. Pharmacologic and supportive interventions can be targeted by the stage of the syndrome of respiratory failure (such as early vs. late ARDS), ARDS risk factor, emerging biologic phenotypes, and individual pulmonary mechanics. These investigations must take into account variable resources as the study of ARDS and other critical illness syndromes expands globally to ensure that new discoveries carry maximal impact across diverse populations.

### COVID-19 respiratory support in the emergency department setting [^112MM1Lt]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in severe complications, multiorgan dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and places healthcare workers at significant risk, especially during aerosol-generating procedures, including airway management.

Objective

This narrative review outlines the underlying respiratory pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to airway management in the emergency department (ED) based on current literature.

Discussion

Patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at high risk for acute respiratory failure requiring airway management. Among hospitalized patients, 10–20% require intensive care unit admission, and 3–10% require intubation and mechanical ventilation. While providing respiratory support for these patients, proper infection control measures, including adherence to personal protective equipment policies, are necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. A structured approach to respiratory failure in these patients includes the use of exogenous oxygen via nasal cannula or non-rebreather, as well as titrated high-flow nasal cannula and non-invasive ventilation. This review offers several guiding principles and resources designed to be adapted in conjunction with local workplace policies for patients requiring respiratory support.

Conclusions

While the fundamental principles of acute respiratory failure management are similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, there are some notable differences, including a focus on provider safety. This review provides an approach to airway management and respiratory support in the patient with COVID-19.

Recommendations for Specific Treatment Questions

Question 1: Should Patients with ARDS Receive Systemic Corticosteroids?

Recommendation

We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence).

Background

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that inhibit the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators present in ARDS. They are widely administered to patients with ARDS for the management of ARDS specifically and for concurrent conditions such as septic shock or pneumonia. More recently, corticosteroids have been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19–related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe community-acquired pneumonia. Corticosteroids were not addressed in the 2017 guidelines. Since that time, several multicenter RCTs evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on patients with ARDS have been published, prompting a recommendation for this intervention.

Evidence summary

Corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that corticosteroids probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (n = 9 studies; mean difference (MD), 4 d less; 95% CI, −5.5 to −2.5; low certainty) and the length of hospital stay (n = 4 studies; MD, 8 d shorter; 95% CI, −13 to −3; low certainty), although the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain (n = 4 studies; MD, 0.8 d shorter; 95% CI, −4.1 to +5.7; very low certainty). With regard to safety outcomes, corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^112P29t6]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

The understanding of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has evolved greatly since it was first described in a 1967 case series, with several subsequent updates to the definition of the syndrome. Basic science advances and clinical trials have provided insight into the mechanisms of lung injury in ARDS and led to reduced mortality through comprehensive critical care interventions. This review summarizes the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of ARDS. Key highlights include a recommended new global definition of ARDS and updated guidelines for managing ARDS on a backbone of established interventions such as low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and a conservative fluid strategy. Future priorities for investigation of ARDS are also highlighted.

### Prone positioning for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS: a review [^114p8sEa]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning is an immediately accessible, readily implementable intervention that was proposed initially as a method for improvement in gas exchange > 50 years ago. Initially implemented clinically as an empiric therapy for refractory hypoxemia, multiple clinical trials were performed on the use of prone positioning in various respiratory conditions, cumulating in the landmark Proning Severe ARDS Patients trial, which demonstrated mortality benefit in patients with severe ARDS. After this trial and the corresponding meta-analysis, expert consensus and societal guidelines recommended the use of prone positioning for the management of severe ARDS. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought prone positioning to the forefront of medicine, including widespread implementation of prone positioning in awake, spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Multiple clinical trials now have been performed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of prone positioning in these patients and have enhanced our understanding of the effects of the prone position in respiratory failure. In this review, we discuss the physiologic features, clinical outcome data, practical considerations, and lingering questions of prone positioning.

Acute respiratory failure categories in COPD exacerbations — criteria are specified as follows: No respiratory failure includes respiratory rate ≤ 24 breaths per minute, heart rate < 95 beats per minute, no use of accessory respiratory muscles, no changes in mental status, hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask 24–35% inspired oxygen (FiO2), and no increase in PaCO2. Acute respiratory failure – non-life-threatening includes respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute with use of accessory respiratory muscles, no change in mental status, hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask > 35% FiO2, and hypercarbia with PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated 50–60 mmHg. Acute respiratory failure – life-threatening includes respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute with use of accessory respiratory muscles, acute changes in mental status, hypoxemia not improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask or requiring FiO2 > 40%, and hypercarbia with PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated > 60 mmHg or the presence of acidosis with pH ≤ 7.25.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113FYAsY]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS), including high flow nasal oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation, is a cornerstone in the management of critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory failure (ARF). Overall, NRS reduces the work of breathing and relieves dyspnea in many patients with ARF, sometimes avoiding the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation with variable efficacy across diverse clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure to NRS in the presence of sustained high respiratory drive and effort can result in respiratory muscle fatigue, cardiovascular collapse, and impaired oxygen delivery to vital organs, leading to poor outcomes in patients who ultimately fail NRS and require intubation. Assessment of patients' baseline characteristics before starting NRS, close physiological monitoring to evaluate patients' response to respiratory support, adjustment of device settings and interface, and, most importantly, early identification of failure or of paramount importance to avoid the negative consequences of delayed intubation. This review highlights the role of respiratory monitoring across various modalities of NRS in patients with ARF including dyspnea, general respiratory parameters, measures of drive and effort, and lung imaging. It includes technical specificities related to the target population and emphasizes the importance of clinicians' physiological understanding and tailoring clinical decisions to individual patients' needs.

### High pressure versus high flow: what should we target in acute respiratory failure? [^113oCRk3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Grieco and colleagues (pp.) compare high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygenation versus noninvasive ventilation (NIV) delivering high levels of pressure using a helmet. In this physiological study, 15 patients with acute respiratory failure (Pa O 2 /F O 2 < 200 mm Hg) were treated in a randomized crossover fashion by HFNC with a flow of 50 L/min or by NIV using a helmet with a high pressure-support level (10–15 cm H 2 O) and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 10 cm H 2 O, with each phase lasting 60 minutes. Compared with HFNC, NIV with a helmet markedly improved oxygenation and significantly reduced dyspnea, respiratory rate, and patient effort, whereas comfort and P 2 did not differ between the two techniques.

The management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ICU is challenging. In the most recent clinical practice guidelines, the use of NIV with a face mask was discussed, but the experts were unable to offer a recommendation. Patients with acute respiratory failure who have failed NIV are now known to have a vigorous respiratory drive, and such patients have a particularly poor prognosis. Therefore, management to protect the already injured lung from the patient's vigorous spontaneous efforts (i.e. self-inflicted lung injury) is needed in this particular setting. Furthermore, synchronization between the patient's intense respiratory drive to breath and the pressure support delivered by NIV may result in high Vs that may worsen lung injury. Thus, controlling spontaneous efforts and Vs could be of key importance in the management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### British thoracic society / intensive care society guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^114FAujT]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A central theme of the guideline is to promote integration in the planning and delivery of NIV and IMV in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Despite evidence demonstrating the value of non-invasive ventilation, its introduction into routine clinical practice has not delivered the expected patient benefit and it is likely that NIV provision has, inadvertently, reduced access to IMV in AECOPD and the other causes of AHRF in the UK. The widespread introduction of an adequately resourced and integrated AHRF patient pathway in our hospitals is strongly recommended. It is expected that this will lead to improved clinical outcomes and patient experience.

### Update on the management of acute respiratory failure using non-invasive ventilation and pulse oximetry [^111KGq8c]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Current knowledge of NIV for respiratory failure in the ICU

In respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, NPPV or HFNC probably reduce the risk of death or intubation compared to conventional oxygen therapy. In particular, NPPV has a well-established effect on acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Additionally, the European Respiratory Society recommends using HFNC for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in its recent clinical practice guideline. NPPV can be effective if it manages to prevent increases in inspiratory effort and tidal volume while ensuring tolerance. When managing acute hypoxemic respira- tory failure with NPPV, the ventilation mode may need attention to minimize the risk of p-SILI.

However, more information is required to inform clinical practice on how to manage acute hypoxemic respiratory failure using NIV. First, it is unclear how differences in the NPPV interface may affect clinical outcomes. For example, helmet NPPV might be more comfortable, and air leaks may be minimized. However, the most recent systematic review, which included 16 RCTs and 8 observational studies, found that the mortality benefit of helmet NPPV over face mask NPPV was of low certainty despite the statistically significant effect estimates (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.33–0.95]). Furthermore, the effect of helmet NPPV compared to HFNC was uncertain. Therefore, further well-designed and adequately powered clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal intervention with NIV. Second, preservation of spontaneous breathing may worsen existing lung injury and lead to p-SILI. However, there is not sufficient evidence on its clinical significance.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113wERZK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

The following outcomes were chosen by the writing group as either of critical or high importance using the GRADE methodology:

Mortality (28 day, hospital and 6 month): Critically important.

Mortality (1 year): Critically important.

Length of stay (ICU and hospital): Important.

Quality of life (at 3 months): Critically important.

Quality of life (at 6 months and 1 year): Important.

Harms (at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year): Important.

GRADE has a transparent methodology and guides recommendations based on the evidence collected. In reality, treatment recommendations are a graduation. However, in order to aid clinical decision-making, GRADE converts the continuum into five mutually exclusive categories. Recommendations are therefore categorised as strongly in favour, weakly in favour (or conditional), strongly against or weakly against (conditional). Finally, a research recommendation can be made where the estimate of the magnitude of effect and its boundaries were so imprecise and wide that further research is likely to make a fundamental change to a recommendation. Recommendations were made by the whole writing group. The lead author would present the data and suggest a recommendation, using GRADE methodology, based on the balance of benefits and harms as detailed in the GRADE tables and evidence. The group would then debate the topic and reach a consensus, based on the opinion of the majority.

### Respiratory physiology of COVID-19-induced respiratory failure compared to ARDS of other etiologies [^1163QwYA]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early after establishment of mechanical ventilation, patients with COVID-19 show a conventional ARDS phenotype, with heterogeneity in respiratory mechanics, aeration loss related to the degree of hypoxemia, and inter-individually variable recruitability. Physiological differences between COVID-19 patients and ARDS from other etiologies appear clinically negligible. Until other data emerge, clinicians treating COVID-19 patients should adhere to most recent guidelines regarding ARDS management.

### British thoracic society / intensive care society guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^115MbN4o]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Conventionally, a pH < 7.35 and a PCO2 > 6.5 kPa defines acute respiratory failure and, when persisting after initial medical therapy, have been used as threshold values for considering the use of NIV. More severe degrees of acidosis, such as pH < 7.25, have been used as a threshold for considering provision of IMV. AHRF results from an inability of the respiratory pump, in concert with the lungs, to provide sufficient alveolar ventilation to maintain a normal arterial PCO2. Coexistent hypoxaemia is usually mild and easily corrected.

AHRF complicates around 20% of acute exacerbations of COPD. It signals advanced disease, a high risk of future hospitalisations and limited long-term prognosis. The median survival following recovery from AHRF was 1 year in a large case series. Around 12% of hypercapnic COPD patients died during the index admission and this increased to 33% if the respiratory acidosis developed after hospitalisation. In asthma, acute hypercapnia also signals an increased risk of death and an increased likelihood of future life-threatening attacks. The same risks apply to AHRF complicating cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis although this has not been formally reported. In the neuromuscular and CWD, including morbid obesity, respiratory pump failure is often insidious in its onset but AHRF may be acute and unexpected. Acute on chronic 'decompensated' episodes of AHRF are more common and normally indicate the future need for domiciliary NIV.

The guideline is targetted at medical, nursing and physiotherapy staff working in emergency receiving rooms, medical assessment units, admission wards, respiratory wards and in high dependency and critical care units. The Guideline applies to adults and does not cover the management of AHRF due to cardiac failure, trauma or acute brain injury. It refers to domiciliary NIV but does not aim to provide guidance on this. The use of non-invasive ventilation is intentionally more extensively covered than IMV because the evidence and the clinical experience of NIV is more recent and because the technical aspects of IMV are covered by standard texts.

### What links ventilator driving pressure with survival in the acute respiratory distress syndrome? A computational study [^116ra5sa]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute heterogeneous inflammation of the lungs leading to deterioration in effective gas exchange, worsening of lung compliance, increasing pulmonary shunt, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema caused by increased pulmonary vascular permeability. Almost 1 in 10 intensive care admissions meet the ARDS criteria, 70% of which are categorized as 'moderate' or 'severe' ARDS, with mortality rates exceeding 40%. The most common means of reinstating adequate oxygenation in patients with ARDS is through mechanical ventilation (MV), with the aim of meeting patients' oxygenation and CO 2 removal requirements while the underlying pathology is treated. However, the lungs of patients suffering from ARDS are highly susceptible to damage introduced by mechanical ventilation, commonly known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Minimizing lung injury, while maintaining adequate gas exchange ("protective ventilation"), is thus a crucial requirement in the effective clinical management of ARDS. Currently, there is widespread confusion regarding how best to achieve protective ventilation in ARDS, with multiple debates ongoing regarding the problem. Many strategies have been proposed, and are in use; each with its own rationale, advocates and evidence of effectiveness. Evaluating the relative benefits of different strategies using only traditional approaches (e.g. randomized trials) is challenging and costly, due to the number of potential strategies and disease states, and to the difficulty of recruiting critically ill patients to clinical trials.

### Use of B-type natriuretic peptide in the management of hypoxaemic respiratory failure [^1111GrZD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy.

Methods and Results

This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups.

Conclusion

Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

Red Cross Guidelines — For adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, it is reasonable to use high-flow nasal oxygen, when tolerated, and "Consider the use of noninvasive ventilation based on clinical judgment". For mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and for sepsis-induced respiratory failure without ARDS, use a low-tidal volume strategy over a high-tidal volume strategy. For mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis-induced severe ARDS, target an upper limit goal of 30 mmHg for plateau pressure. For adults with moderate to severe sepsis-induced ARDS, use a prone position for greater than 12 hours per day.

### Initial emergency department mechanical ventilation strategies for COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS [^113MfLmG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging viral pathogen that causes the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and may result in hypoxemic respiratory failure necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation in the most severe cases.

Objective

This narrative review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Discussion

In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H 2 O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause.

Conclusions

This review provides evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Special article: rescue therapies for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [^114PBuhc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

The recent H1N1 epidemic has resulted in a large number of deaths, primarily from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We reviewed the current strategies to rescue patients with severe hypoxemia. Included in these strategies are high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation, inhaled vasodilators, and the use of extracorporeal life support. All of these strategies are targeted at improving oxygenation, but improved oxygenation alone has yet to be demonstrated to correlate with improved survival. The risks and benefits of these strategies, including cost-effectiveness data, are discussed.

### Noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure [^115xT9HC]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for acute respiratory failure has gained much academic and clinical interest. Despite this, NIV is underutilized. The evidence strongly supports its use in patients presenting with an exacerbation of COPD and in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As reviewed in this paper, there is now evidence supporting or not supporting the use of NIV in various other presentations of acute respiratory failure. It is important not only to know when to initiate NIV, but also when this therapy is failing. Whether NIV in the setting of acute respiratory failure can be managed appropriately outside the ICU setting is controversial. Although a variety of interfaces are available, the oronasal mask is the best initial interface in terms of leak prevention and patient comfort. Some critical care ventilators have NIV modes that compensate well for leaks, but as a group the ventilators that are designed specifically for NIV have better leak compensation. NIV should be part of the armamentarium of all clinicians caring from patients with acute respiratory failure.

Management of ARDS in practice

Management

The essence of management of ARDS consists of optimising the diagnosis and treatment of underlying conditions, and the deployment of supportive measures that minimise iatrogenic injury and the consequences of severe critical illness (ie, secondary and tertiary prevention). We have combined these strategies with the outcome of the analysis of evidence relating to the topics selected in figure 3.

### Acute respiratory failure in interstitial lung disease complicated by pulmonary hypertension [^112zkMki]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Interstitial lung disease represents a group of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases with overwhelming morbidity and mortality when complicated by acute respiratory failure. Recently, trials investigating outcomes and their determinants have provided insight into these high mortality rates. Pulmonary hypertension is a known complication of interstitial lung disease and there is high prevalence in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue disease, and sarcoidosis subtypes. Interstitial lung disease associated pulmonary hypertension has further increased mortality with acute respiratory failure, and there is limited evidence to guide management. This review describes investigations and management of interstitial lung disease associated acute respiratory failure complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Despite the emerging attention on interstitial lung disease associated acute respiratory failure and the influence of pulmonary hypertension, critical care management remains a clinical and ethical challenge.

### Update on the management of acute respiratory failure using non-invasive ventilation and pulse oximetry [^1139oFV5]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the biggest challenge to intensive care providers globally since the invention of ventilators in the 1930s to support patients with polio. The huge number of patients with COVID-19 urged us to investigate better and safer strategies for managing respiratory failure. Given the limited resources for the large number of patients presenting with acute respiratory failure, we used non-invasive devices, i.e. pulse oximeters and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), to monitor and manage patients outside the ICU. This raised attention regarding the uncertainties of using such devices in the management of critically ill patients.

NIV emerged as a respiratory support system to reduce the need for endotracheal intubation and the risk of death. More patients than ever received respiratory support with NIV during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part also because of the limited availability of invasive mechanical ventilation. Clinicians and researchers have attempted to determine the optimal management of respiratory failure using NIV. In this review, we summarize recent clinical research findings on the management of acute respiratory failure using NIV and pulse oximetry. For the purposes of this article, NIV includes non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC).

### Infectious acute respiratory failure in patients under 5 years of age: a retrospective cohort study [^111aXqnX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Optimal management of paediatric patients under 5 years old admitted to PICU for respiratory infections complicated by acute respiratory failure is a major diagnostic, therapeutic and public health challenge. In France, there is no precise description of this population and of the severity of factors likely to lead to the death of these children.

The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of infectious acute respiratory failure in this population, PICU management and outcomes in order to better identify the needs of these patients.

Our secondary aim was to compare the characteristics and PICU management of this population (1) depending on their age (less or more than 6 months old) and (2) depending on the pulmonary imaging (absence or presence of an alveolar condensation on the chest X-ray or lung ultrasound).
