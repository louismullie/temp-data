Cardiovascular demand during sec

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiovascular demand during seconds-long exercise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "seconds-long" exercise implies for energy systems and oxygen delivery. Then, I should verify the immediate hemodynamic responses that occur within seconds. Next, I will examine the central command and autonomic mechanisms that drive these responses. After that, I need to consider how disease states alter these responses. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications and safety considerations, including screening and monitoring recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the exercise context. Seconds-long efforts are typically powered by the phosphagen (ATP-PCr) system and early glycolysis, with minimal contribution from aerobic metabolism, so oxygen delivery is not the primary determinant of performance in the first 5–10 seconds, though cardiovascular responses still begin immediately to support emerging metabolic needs and buffer acid-base changes [^6c7579c1] [^2bf1a373] [^a087f1fb].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate hemodynamic changes. Within seconds of muscle contraction, heart rate rises via central command and mechanoreceptor feedback, stroke volume increases from venous return augmentation, and cardiac output rises; blood pressure increases due to higher cardiac output and sympathetic vasoconstriction in nonworking tissues, while local metabolites begin to override sympathetic vasoconstriction in active muscle to secure perfusion [^d6fe2c54] [^0aada2ef] [^a087f1fb].

> I need to check the neural control mechanisms. Central command from the motor cortex and subcortical locomotor centers projects to autonomic nuclei, producing parallel activation of somatic and sympathetic outflow; a recently identified brainstem monosynaptic pathway from mesencephalic locomotor neurons to the rostral ventrolateral medulla provides a direct feedforward drive for both locomotion and sympathetic cardiovascular responses, explaining the rapidity of the hemodynamic response even before metabolic accumulation [^a087f1fb] [^a0cc0594].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oxygen supply. Myocardial oxygen extraction is already near-maximal at rest, so any increase in myocardial oxygen demand during exertion must be met by increased coronary flow driven by local metabolic vasodilation; in healthy coronaries, flow can increase several-fold, but in coronary artery disease, flow reserve may be limited, creating a supply–demand mismatch even during brief, intense efforts [^e9278a47] [^333a5851].

> I should confirm how disease modifies these seconds-long responses. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronotropic incompetence and blunted stroke volume reserve blunt cardiac output, forcing greater oxygen extraction and earlier metabolic acidosis; in coronary artery disease, brief surges in heart rate and blood pressure can outstrip coronary supply, precipitating ischemia; in COPD, dynamic hyperinflation and respiratory muscle competition for blood flow can compromise limb muscle perfusion and oxygen delivery even during short bouts [^1cc4d71b] [^7d4a5d68] [^08b6da82].

> Let me consider sex-specific differences. Females generally have smaller stroke volume and higher heart rate at the same absolute workload, so for a given seconds-long task, the chronotropic burden may be relatively higher; estrogen-related effects on contractility and vascular tone can further modulate the hemodynamic response, though these differences are more pronounced with sustained exercise than with ultra-short bursts [^e8d668a4] [^5e6ccfb6].

> Next, I should review clinical implications. Even seconds-long exertion can trigger adverse events in vulnerable patients via plaque disruption, arrhythmias, or ischemia; pre-participation screening is warranted in those with symptoms, known disease, or high risk, and exercise testing can unmask abnormal cardiovascular responses that are not evident at rest, guiding safe prescription and risk stratification [^4b468301] [^3b51cb38] [^8d30e2dd].

> I will now examine practical prescribing principles. For low-risk individuals, brief, high-intensity intervals can be safe and effective when progressed gradually, with warm-up and cool-down to mitigate abrupt hemodynamic swings; for patients with limited tolerance, eccentric or low-cadence modalities can deliver meaningful load with lower cardiopulmonary demand, and continuous monitoring of symptoms, heart rate, and blood pressure is prudent during early training phases [^ec3398c8] [^c60759cb] [^6359a84b].

> But wait, what if the patient is at altitude or in heat. Hypoxia and heat independently increase cardiovascular strain; at altitude, hypoxia lowers the ischemic threshold and exaggerates sympathetic responses, so even short bursts may provoke symptoms in CAD, whereas heat stress increases skin blood flow and can precipitate hypotension or heat illness if cardiac output cannot meet dual demands of thermoregulation and muscle perfusion [^c595e990] [^0c38b726].

> Let me reconsider the overall message. During seconds-long exercise, cardiovascular demand rises immediately via central command and autonomic reflexes, with increases in heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure; oxygen supply is generally adequate in health but can be limiting in disease, so individualized risk assessment, careful progression, and attentive monitoring are essential to balance benefit and safety [^d6fe2c54] [^e9278a47] [^6359a84b].

Cardiovascular demand during exercise rises within seconds as **heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output increase** to meet oxygen and nutrient needs of working muscles [^d6fe2c54]. This is driven by central command and autonomic activation, with sympathetic outflow increasing heart rate and contractility, and parasympathetic withdrawal aiding the chronotropic response [^a087f1fb]. Blood pressure rises due to increased cardiac output and vasoconstriction in non-active tissues, while active muscles vasodilate via local metabolic signals to secure flow [^0aada2ef]. In healthy individuals, these responses are tightly coordinated; in patients with cardiovascular disease, blunted or exaggerated responses can unmask ischemia or arrhythmias, so monitoring and individualized prescription are essential [^8d30e2dd] [^2bce3d4b].

---

## Immediate cardiovascular responses to exercise

Within seconds of exercise onset, the cardiovascular system mounts a **rapid, coordinated response** to meet increased metabolic demand:

- **Heart rate (HR)**: Increases immediately via central command and autonomic activation, with parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic stimulation [^a087f1fb].
- **Stroke volume (SV)**: Rises due to increased venous return (muscle pump, respiratory pump) and enhanced contractility, augmenting cardiac output [^d6fe2c54].
- **Cardiac output (CO)**: Increases 4–6 fold during maximal exercise, primarily from HR and SV augmentation [^f436c3d1].
- **Blood pressure (BP)**: Systolic BP rises with CO; diastolic BP changes little due to balanced vasodilation in active muscle and vasoconstriction elsewhere [^d6fe2c54].

---

## Autonomic regulation of cardiovascular demand

The autonomic nervous system **finely tunes cardiovascular responses** to exercise:

- **Sympathetic activation**: Increases HR, contractility, and vasoconstriction in non-active tissues, redirecting blood flow to active muscle [^0aada2ef].
- **Parasympathetic withdrawal**: Facilitates rapid HR rise at exercise onset [^a54253d3].
- **Baroreflex modulation**: Adjusts vascular tone and HR to maintain BP during dynamic shifts in CO and peripheral resistance [^0aada2ef].

---

## Regional blood flow distribution

Exercise redistributes blood flow: active skeletal muscle receives a **large increase** via local metabolic vasodilation (NO, prostaglandins, adenosine), while splanchnic, renal, and cutaneous beds vasoconstrict to preserve BP and prioritize oxygen delivery to working tissues [^0aada2ef] [^0c38b726].

---

## Determinants of cardiovascular demand

Key factors shape the magnitude of **cardiovascular demand**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on cardiovascular demand** |
|-|-|
| Exercise intensity | Higher intensity increases HR, SV, CO, and BP [^d6fe2c54] |
| Exercise duration | Sustained activity elevates total cardiovascular load |
| Individual fitness | Trained individuals have lower HR at rest/submaximal loads and higher SV, reducing relative demand [^c23fdf6e] |
| Age | Blunted HR and SV responses; higher relative demand at same workload |
| Environmental conditions | Heat, humidity, and altitude increase demand via thermoregulatory and hypoxic stress [^0c38b726] [^c595e990] |

---

## Cardiovascular demand in different exercise modalities

- **Aerobic exercise**: Sustained increases in CO with modest BP rise; endurance training enhances SV and lowers resting HR [^f436c3d1].
- **Resistance exercise**: Marked BP spikes from increased afterload; CO rises modestly; eccentric training lowers cardiopulmonary demand at a given load [^ec3398c8].
- **Interval training**: Repeated surges in HR, CO, and BP with brief recoveries, increasing cumulative cardiovascular load [^6c7579c1].

---

## Clinical implications and considerations

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Exercise can unmask ischemia or arrhythmias; pre-participation screening and individualized prescription are critical [^7d4a5d68].
- **Medications**: Beta-blockers blunt HR and contractility responses, altering perceived exertion and requiring adjusted targets [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: HR, BP, and symptom tracking guide safe progression and detect abnormal responses [^3b51cb38].

---

## Summary of cardiovascular demand during exercise

Cardiovascular demand during exercise is a **dynamic interplay** of increased HR, SV, and CO, with redistributed blood flow and autonomic regulation, all scaled to intensity, duration, fitness, and environment. In health, these responses are efficient and adaptive; in disease, they can reveal pathology, underscoring the need for tailored assessment and prescription [^5f6944f1].

### Using exercise to measure and modify cardiac function [^f73787e3]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Exercise is the archetype of physiologic demands placed on the cardiovascular system. Acute responses provide an informative assessment of cardiovascular function and fitness, while repeated exercise promotes cardiovascular health and evokes important molecular, structural, and functional changes contributing to its effects in primary and secondary prevention. Here we examine the use of exercise in murine models, both as a phenotypic assay and as a provocative intervention. We first review the advantages and limitations of exercise testing for assessing cardiac function, then highlight the cardiac structural and cellular changes elicited by chronic exercise and key molecular pathways that mediate these effects.

### Physical activity and the prevention of cardiovascular disease: from evolution to epidemiology [^ecc45276]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

For most of human history, the environmental demands of survival necessitated prodigious amounts of physical exertion. The avoidance of predators, hunting, gathering, and the literal "chopping wood and carrying water" of daily existence provided a wholesome dose of physical activity that obviated the need for deliberate exercise. Nevertheless, 21st century humans are now immersed within an environment explicitly designed to eliminate physical labor. Over the past century and especially the past 50 years, an accrual of epidemiological evidence has established that the unintended consequence of humankind's predilection for labor-saving contrivances is an epidemic of hypokinetically induced cardiovascular disease, morbidity, and mortality. This review surveys data from observational studies supporting the premise that physical activity, exercise training, and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness are essential elements in the prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular diseases induced by an environment in which survival no longer obligates physical exertion.

Cardiovascular Stress Response to Exercise

One of the most well-known stressors of the cardiovascular system is physical exercise, which leads to multiple adaptations in the cardiovascular system. An overview of the cardiovascular stress response is given in Fig. 1. During exercise, muscle activity increases the demand for oxygen. The response of the circulatory system is designed to match these higher oxygen requirements and thus higher blood flow in the exercising muscles. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a rise in heart rate, heart contractility and blood pressure. Due to the mechanical skeletal muscle pump and exaggerated movement of the respiratory pump, exercise leads to a higher venous return, which will subsequently lead to an increased stroke volume. Both increases in heart rate and stroke volume lead to a higher cardiac output (CO). Because of the increase in CO and increasing vascular resistance in the abdominal viscera and non-active skeletal muscles, blood pressure will increase. There are several underlying autonomic mechanisms responsible for the sympathetic activation that causes the cardiovascular response on exercise, including corticohypothalamic pathways and peripheral reflexes. To enable these extensive physical adaptations to exercise, a healthy cardiovascular system is needed. Adaptations to physical exercise may not only be impaired in clinical populations with known cardiovascular or cardiac disease. Already, when subtle subclinical differences in cardiovascular health are present, this may lead to suboptimal adaptions of the cardiovascular system to the increased demands induced by exercise. Thus, measurement of the cardiovascular stress response to physical exercise may reveal subtle pathology that would have been undetectable at rest in research settings with presumably healthy pediatric populations.

### Impact of cycling cadence on physiological response during a cardiopulmonary exercise test [^c60759cb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, in a population of healthy adults, we have shown that conducting CPETs with a pedalling cadence ranging from 60 to 90 rpm has limited impact on estimates of cardiorespiratory fitness. We would, however, suggest that in healthy populations, whatever cycling cadence is chosen for any individual remains constant throughout the exercise test to prevent variances in physiological slope progression. Higher cadences do cause an increase in ventilatory demand at peak exercise and the gradient of the cardiovascular slope during the exercise test, which could be important in those with underlying lung or cardiac disease. Given the higher ventilatory demand at higher cycling cadences, it may be beneficial to continue to exercise clinical patients at lower cadences, especially those with respiratory conditions, as this population is at risk of terminating the test prematurely due to early ventilatory limitation. Future studies should replicate our results in different age groups and patient populations.

### Sports and exercise cardiology in the United States: cardiovascular specialists as members of the athlete healthcare team [^f98c8ace]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, athletic participation has more than doubled in all major demographic groups, while simultaneously, children and adults with established heart disease desire participation in sports and exercise. Despite conferring favorable long-term effects on well-being and survival, exercise can be associated with risk of adverse events in the short term. Complex individual cardiovascular (CV) demands and adaptations imposed by exercise present distinct challenges to the cardiologist asked to evaluate athletes. Here, we describe the evolution of sports and exercise cardiology as a unique discipline within the continuum of CV specialties, provide the rationale for tailoring of CV care to athletes and exercising individuals, define the role of the CV specialist within the athlete care team, and lay the foundation for the development of Sports and Exercise Cardiology in the United States. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology launched the Section of Sports and Exercise Cardiology. Membership has grown from 150 to over 4,000 members in just 2 short years, indicating marked interest from the CV community to advance the integration of sports and exercise cardiology into mainstream CV care. Although the current athlete CV care model has distinct limitations, here, we have outlined a new paradigm of care for the American athlete and exercising individual. By practicing and promoting this new paradigm, we believe we will enhance the CV care of athletes of all ages, and serve the greater athletic community and our nation as a whole, by allowing safest participation in sports and physical activity for all individuals who seek this lifestyle.

### The limits of cardiac performance: can too much exercise damage the heart? [^162f039f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Routine moderate-intensity physical activity confers numerous cardiovascular benefits and reduces all-cause mortality. However, the health impact of exercise doses that exceed contemporary physical activity guidelines remains incompletely understood, and an emerging body of literature suggests that high levels of exercise may have the capacity to damage the cardiovascular system. This review focuses on the contemporary controversies regarding high-dose exercise and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We discuss the limitations of available studies, explore potential mechanisms that may mediate exercise-related cardiac injury, and highlight the gaps in knowledge for future research.

### Exercise induces tissue-specific adaptations to enhance cardiometabolic health [^4b44eadc]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The risk associated with multiple cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and all-cause mortality is decreased in individuals who meet the current recommendations for physical activity. Therefore, regular exercise remains a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases. An acute bout of exercise results in the coordinated interaction between multiple tissues to meet the increased energy demand of exercise. Over time, the associated metabolic stress of each individual exercise bout provides the basis for long-term adaptations across tissues, including the cardiovascular system, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, pancreas, gut, and brain. Therefore, regular exercise is associated with a plethora of benefits throughout the whole body, including improved cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and glycemic control. Overall, we summarize the exercise-induced adaptations that occur within multiple tissues and how they converge to ultimately improve cardiometabolic health.

Physiological cardiovascular responses to exercise

In health, the cardiovascular system adapts and modifies its parameters in response to increased demand such as physical exertion, with the aim to facilitate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. At the microcirculatory level, perfusion pressure equates to mean arterial pressure which is regulated by interaction between cardiac output (a combination of heart rate and stroke volume) and systemic vascular resistance. During exercise, a positive chronotropic response and increased stroke volume (through re-direction of splanchnic and renal blood flow, increasing preload) result in increased cardiac output. The systemic vascular resistance in exercise-critical tissues such as the myocardium falls through local release of nitric oxide mediators and activity of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The net result is a controlled change in mean arterial pressure, with improved perfusion of the exercise-critical muscle groups, such as the myocardium and skeletal muscle. The inability of one or more of these physiological parameters to adjust on exercise will result in failure of the cardiovascular system to meet tissue oxygen demands, leading to diminished exercise capacity.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing offers an assessment of individuals' functional capacity through evaluation of gas exchange during exercise and thus an assessment of systems involved in both oxygen transport and utilization. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows for measurement of the volume of tissue oxygen uptake, which is a key parameter that offers insights into cardiac and pulmonary function, as expressed by Fick's principle, according to which VO₂ equates to cardiac output multiplied by the arteriovenous gradient [C(a−v)O₂]. During ramp-like exercise, VO₂ increases exponentially up to a steady state corresponding to peak exercise, and will adopt different patterns in patients with different aetiologies of HF. Any number of perturbations in T2D can interfere with the body's normal physical responses to increased work, and thus affect the VO₂peak.

### Clinical implications for exercise at altitude among individuals with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^a01f5407]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of individuals travel to mountainous environments for work and pleasure. However, oxygen availability declines at altitude, and hypoxic environments place unique stressors on the cardiovascular system. These stressors may be exacerbated by exercise at altitude, because exercise increases oxygen demand in an environment that is already relatively oxygen deplete compared with sea-level conditions. Furthermore, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, as well as diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, and lung disease, is high among individuals living in the United States. As such, patients who are at risk of or who have established cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of adverse events when sojourning to these mountainous locations. However, these risks may be minimized by appropriate pretravel assessments and planning through shared decision-making between patients and their managing clinicians. This American Heart Association scientific statement provides a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the physiologic responses to exercise in hypoxic locations, as well as important considerations for minimizing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events during mountainous excursions.

### Testing in intermittent sports-importance for training and performance optimization in adult athletes [^6c7579c1]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). High credibility.

Brief overview of physiological demands and energy system interactions in intermittent sports — demands vary from brief (∼ 2 to 6 s) explosive efforts to more prolonged intermittent exercise sequences that challenge peak cardiovascular capacity, with interactions between aerobic and anaerobic energy systems and fatigue resistance mechanisms as prime determinants of exercise tolerance. Intense match scenarios, including repeated maximal actions or longer-lasting intermittent sequences, may induce in-game "transient fatigue" that is short lasting and reversible if proceeded by a break or low-intense period, and the repeated nature and duration of some intermittent codes additionally result in accumulated "end-game" fatigue with heterogeneous origins that typically requires more prolonged recovery. In this context, the concept of "durability" — the ability to sustain performance following prolonged/demanding prior exercise — has attracted significant recent interest in endurance sports and may similarly apply as an important asset in intermittent sports.

### Autoregulation of coronary blood supply in response to demand: JACC review topic of the week [^333a5851]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although our coronary circulation evolved to meet demands during marked physical exertion for "fight or flight" survival, complex and multilayered control mechanisms reduce flow during other periods. Understanding homeostasis of resting flow provides essential insights into clinical pathophysiology. Several homeostatic mechanisms (myogenic, metabolic, endothelial, and neural) maintain sufficient baseline flow regardless of driving pressure (in aggregate, "autoregulation"). As a result, ventricular dysfunction does not arise until coronary perfusion pressure decreases to ∼40 mm Hg. Straightforward clinical parameters explain approximately one-half of observed absolute resting perfusion but with wide imprecision. Resting perfusion does not associate with clinical outcomes and remains unaffected by revascularization, recovery after myocardial infarction, and treating severe aortic stenosis, thereby supporting the notion that the heart was designed for peak performance.

### Fueling the failing heart: the key may Be ketones [^8ea96174]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

A primary goal of cardiovascular medicine is ultimately to ensure that myocardial perfusion meets the oxygen demands of the heart. This is because oxygen facilitates production of nearly all the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required to sustain cardiac function through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, without which contractile failure would ensue in seconds. Advances in atherosclerotic disease prevention and interventional cardiology have substantially reduced mortality from acute coronary syndromes in recent decades, but this has inevitably increased the burden of heart failure in our aging population. The pathogenesis of heart failure is complex and multifactorial, but is increasingly recognized to involve metabolic perturbations that may limit myocardial performance even with adequate myocardial perfusion.

The human heart is a metabolic omnivore, capable of using a variety of fuels for oxidative metabolism to meet its constant energy demands. A defining feature of the healthy myocardium is its "metabolic flexibility", that is, being able to shift its reliance on substrates for energy metabolism based on their availability in the circulation under resting and stressed conditions. At rest, circulating fatty acids provide 60% to 90% of the fuel for oxidative phosphorylation, with the remainder coming largely from carbohydrates as pyruvate oxidation and, to a lesser extent, glycolysis. During strenuous exercise, the heart becomes a major consumer of lactate, increasing its oxidation linearly as circulating levels rise > 10-fold above resting conditions. Contributions of glucose oxidation also increase with greater cardiac work or when fatty acid availability is low, perhaps facilitating increased contractile performance under acute stress.

### Vital signs: prevalence of key cardiovascular disease risk factors… [^2784f08b]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

What is added by this report. During 2015–2016, adult sodium intake averaged 3, 535 mg/day and the prevalences of blood pressure control, combustible tobacco use, and physical inactivity were 48. 5%,
22. 3% and 29. 1%, respectively. Compared with 2011–2012, significant improvements were observed in combustible tobacco use and physical inactivity, but the prevalence of aspirin use to prevent CVD declined. What are the implications for public health practice. A concerted effort to implement evidence-based strategies is needed to achieve the Million Hearts 2022 goal. Abstract Introduction: Despite decades-long reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality, CVD mortality rates have recently plateaued and even increased in some subgroups, and the prevalence of CVD risk factors remains high. Million Hearts 2022, a 5-year initiative, was launched in 2017 to address this burden.

This report establishes a baseline for the CVD risk factors targeted for reduction by the initiative during 2017–2021 and highlights recent changes over time. Results: During 2013–2014, the prevalences of aspirin use for primary and secondary CVD prevention were 27. 4% and
74. 9%, respectively, and of statin use for cholesterol management was 54. 5%. During 2015–2016, the average daily sodium intake was 3, 535 mg/day and the prevalences of blood pressure control, combustible tobacco use, and physical inactivity were 48. 5%,
22. 3%, and 29. 1%, respectively. Introduction Despite steady declines in CVD mortality rates over approximately the last 40 years, heart disease and stroke remain the first and fifth leading causes of death in the United States, respectively, and their associated mortality rates have recently begun to plateau in the general population and even increase among some subpopulations. Furthermore, CVD annually accounts for approximately $330 billion in direct and indirect costs in the United States: approximately one in seven health care dollars is spent on CVD. To address this burden, in 2012, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services launched Million Hearts, a national initiative co-led by CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with the goal of preventing one million acute cardiovascular events over 5 years.

### Molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac adaptation to exercise [^8367d29c]. Cell Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Exercise elicits coordinated multi-organ responses including skeletal muscle, vasculature, heart, and lung. In the short term, the output of the heart increases to meet the demand of strenuous exercise. Long-term exercise instigates remodeling of the heart including growth and adaptive molecular and cellular re-programming. Signaling pathways such as the insulin-like growth factor 1/PI3K/Akt pathway mediate many of these responses. Exercise-induced, or physiologic, cardiac growth contrasts with growth elicited by pathological stimuli such as hypertension. Comparing the molecular and cellular underpinnings of physiologic and pathologic cardiac growth has unveiled phenotype-specific signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs. Studies suggest that exercise pathways likely antagonize pathological pathways, and exercise training is often recommended for patients with chronic stable heart failure or following myocardial infarction. Herein, we summarize the current understanding of the structural and functional cardiac responses to exercise as well as signaling pathways and downstream effector molecules responsible for these adaptations.

### A brainstem monosynaptic excitatory pathway that drives locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses [^a087f1fb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Exercise including locomotion, which is part of fundamental behavior in vertebrates including humans, is accompanied by autonomic cardiovascular adjustments that provide the metabolic resources, such as fuel and oxygen, demanded by contracting skeletal muscles and thereby boost physical performance. The contribution of a feedforward descending motor signal from the forebrain to the cardiovascular control has been suggested for more than a century. Currently, this feedforward signal has been called central command and postulated as parallel activation of the somatic and autonomic motor systems in the brain to simultaneously increase muscle activity along with arterial pressure and cardiac contractility. This concept first came from a human study showing that the magnitude of cardiovascular responses during voluntary isometric exercise at constant muscle tension positively correlated with the amount of central command activation that was changed by reflexive contractions due to tendon vibration on either agonist or antagonist muscle. Central command is coupled to activation of the sympathetic nervous system independently of movement feedback as shown by increases in cardiovascular variables during fictive locomotion in decorticate, paralyzed catsand by exaggerated cardiovascular responses to voluntary muscle contraction in human subjects after paralysis.

The precise location of the source of central command remains unclear because the central circuit mechanism by which central command signals elicit autonomic cardiovascular adjustments during exercise has yet to be fully elucidated. Autonomic brain regions activated in response to voluntary exercise – or regions of which stimulation elicits either autonomic or somatomotor responses – may be involved in the central command control of circulation. For example, human studies using neurosurgical techniques suggested that mesencephalic circuits including the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and periaqueductal gray (PAG), whose neuronal activities are elevated during volitional exercise, configure subcortical circuitry to relay central command signalsas evidenced by the pressor effect of electrical stimulation of the STNor dorsal/lateral PAGin awake patients with Parkinson's disease or chronic pain. Nonetheless, causal roles of these brain regions in autonomic changes during exercise as well as functional connections with other regions have not been demonstrated. The brain substrate of central command has also gained clinical importance. Abnormal cardiovascular regulation during exercise in pathological conditions, such as heart failure, increases exercise intolerance and the risk of fatal cardiac events such as arrhythmia. This is at least partly caused by central command dysfunction, whereas therapeutic exercise programs for patients improve their functional status and outcome.

Aerobic exercise

Testing and prescription

According to the WHO 2020 guidelines, aerobic PA performed at moderate and vigorous intensities refers to any bodily movement involving large muscles performed at an intensity between 3 to < 6 and ≥ 6 times the resting energy equivalent expended (metabolic equivalent of tasks; METs), respectively. This categorisation is useful for providing overall recommendations; however, it has some limitations when categorising PA at relative intensities based on fixed METs, as it does not account for individual differences in fitness level, body mass, age and sex, among other factors. Further, exercising at a fixed MET or relative percentage of maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O₂max) is not optimal because, in some cases (ie, poor fitness levels), performing moderate to vigorous-intensity exercises (ie, ~6 METs) represents intensities close to V̇O₂max, generating different levels of cardiac and metabolic demandsthat could lead to discomfort and higher unplanned stress. Therefore, it is advocated to associate moderate and vigorous-intensity exercises with individualised homeostatic disturbances, such as ventilatory or lactate thresholds 1 and 2 (VT1, VT2, LT1 and LT2, respectively), and thus we suggest including these definitions in future guidelines for aerobic exercise prescription at the individual level in populations with different health conditions. However, we recognise that these fitness assessments are usually not available or easy to understand for the general population, so it is essential to provide tools that are accessible to everyone. Nonetheless, we emphasise the importance of educating the general population about their fitness level, PE testing and prescription, as well as having access to assessments in healthcare or training centres.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic contributors to the cardiac benefits of exercise [^3843a29c]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of exercise in cardiovascular disease prevention and mitigation has long been recognized. While evidence of the cardiovascular benefits of exercise has come primarily from observational studies, it is further supported by some randomized trials, meta-analyses, and animal studies. As a result, physical activity guidelines codified by American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association suggest moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for at least 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week for healthy adults. In addition to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, exercise improves functional capacity and quality of life in populations with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and may improve clinical outcomes, although the latter has been difficult to establish unequivocally.

Despite widespread acceptance of the cardiovascular benefits of exercise, many questions remain. In part, these reflect inherent limitations of studying lifestyle interventions. Bias and confounding limit observational studies and variability in adherence can undermine interventional trials. The optimal type, intensity, and duration of physical activity and how to optimize benefits for individuals remain unclear. In this context, animal studies can be particularly helpful. Not only can confounders be rigorously excluded, but also relevant tissues not available clinically can be accessed. Such studies can enhance understanding and identify new therapeutic targets. Although it is unlikely that any medicine will recapitulate all the benefits of exercise, it may be possible to manipulate specific downstream mediators to mimic some of the salutary effects. While those who can exercise should, exercise-mimetic therapeutics may be particularly helpful for patients who cannot exercise adequately. Another important practical goal is to identify biomarkers that correlate with exercise's benefits to guide individualized exercise recommendations. If exercise can be considered medicine, we currently have no way to judge appropriate dosage or to know that we have moved the needle toward clinical benefit. Here, too, mechanistic understanding and animal models are important supplements to clinical studies.

### Cardiopulmonary responses to eccentric and concentric resistance exercise in older adults [^ec3398c8]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In older ambulatory persons, exercise strategies that are expected to generate beneficial muscle adaptations with low cardiopulmonary demands are needed.

Objective

We hypothesised that eccentric resistance exercise would be less demanding on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems than bouts of concentric resistance exercise.

Design

The effects of eccentric and concentric resistance exercise were compared during leg squats at a submaximal intensity known to increase muscle mass.

Subjects

19 Older persons (15 women/four men, age 65 ± 4 years) and 19 young reference controls (10 women/nine men; age 25 ± 2 years) were enrolled.

Methods

Participants completed eccentric-only and concentric-only exercise bouts 5–7 days apart.

Results

Cardiovascular and pulmonary measures were collected from subjects during bouts consisting of three sequential sets of 10 repetitions at 65% of their voluntary concentric 1-repetition maximum force (68 ± 16 kg for older participants and 94 ± 36 kg for young participants). Peak heart rate (119 ± 10 versus 155 ± 16 b.p.m.), systolic blood pressure (129 ± 18 versus 167 ± 14 mmHg), cardiac index (7.8 ± 2.0 versus 9.2 ± 1.5 l/min/m2) and expired ventilation (20.5 ± 5.7 versus 29.8 ± 9.1 l/min) were significantly lower during eccentric than during concentric bouts in the older subjects, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Similarly, peak heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac index and expired ventilation were significantly lower during eccentric bouts in the young control subjects.

Conclusions

Eccentric resistance exercise produced less cardiopulmonary demands and may be better suited for older persons with low exercise tolerance and at risk of adverse cardiopulmonary events.

### Aerobic training and cardiovascular responses at rest and during exercise in older men and women [^d00c7914]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The effects of an intense 8-wk aerobic training program on cardiovascular responses at rest and during exercise, including heart rate variability (HRV) as an expression of autonomic modulation, were evaluated in subjects over 70 yr (mean: 73.9 ± 3.5 yr).

Methods

Before and after training in 7 men and 8 women: a) heart rate (HR), blood pressures (BPs), pulse pressure (PP), and oxygen uptake were measured at rest, during, and after exhausting incremental exercise; b) HRV power spectra were calculated at rest in supine and sitting, and during and after two submaximal constant loads (5 min). Power in low-frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, > 0.15 Hz) bands were expressed as a percent of total power minus power < 0.04 Hz.

Results

After training: a) at rest HR and HRV parameters (in both body positions) were unchanged, whereas BPs decreased; b) peak cycle resistance and oxygen consumption increased by 25% and 18%, respectively, but no change in maximal HR and BPs were found; c) during submaximal loads HR was unchanged at the same metabolic demand, whereas SBP and DBP were lower than before at low loads whereas PP was unchanged. LF power decreased and HF increased at oxygen uptakes above about 0.7 L.min-1 similarly before and after training; and d) recovery of all parameters was similar to pretraining and complete after 10 min

Conclusions

The increase in exercise capacity without changes in cardiovascular parameters suggests that 8 wk of aerobic training augmented peripheral gas exchange but not delivery to muscle. The lack of effect on HRV indicates that the improvements in aerobic power and cardiac autonomic modulation, at least in subjects over 70 yr, are dissociated. Moreover, the metabolic demand seems to be the main factor for the changes in HRV power spectra that occur during exercise.

### Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease [^e8d67aa8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As a result of a series of epidemiological studies, it can be concluded that leisure‐time physical activity is effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, with a dose‐response relationship that leads to an ≈20% reduction in cardiovascular events and an increase in life expectancy of ≈5 years. In this respect, high cardiovascular fitness as a result of vigorous activity levels seems to be more important than total activity time. Vascular remodeling in the healthy heart in response to exercise training is composed of increases in the size of conduit and resistance arteries and arterioles and more capillaries, which improves the arterial blood supply.

In secondary prevention, exercise training improves endothelial function and halts the progression of coronary stenosis, partially via antiatherosclerotic effects on platelets and leukocytes. Vasculogenesis at the capillary level, which is induced by CPCs, and the formation of collaterals at the small‐artery level might further improve myocardial perfusion in response to exercise training. In conjunction with a bradycardia‐related reduction in myocardial oxygen demand, improved myocardial perfusion raises the threshold of angina‐free activity levels, making exercise training a potent symptomatic therapeutic approach. Moreover, interventional studies have convincingly shown that exercise training reduces cardiovascular event rates in patients with CAD and reduces mortality.

Therefore, current scientific insights on the primary preventive effects of exercise training should have an impact on public and political decisions to create an environment that supports everyday physical activity. On the other hand, additional research is needed to better understand the effects of exercise training in detail to establish optimized training programs as an inherent component of CAD therapy.

### A brainstem monosynaptic excitatory pathway that drives locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses [^a0cc0594]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Exercise including locomotion requires appropriate autonomic cardiovascular adjustments to meet the metabolic demands of contracting muscles, yet the functional brain architecture underlying these adjustments remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate brainstem circuitry that plays an essential role in relaying volitional motor signals, i.e., central command, to drive locomotor activities and sympathetic cardiovascular responses. Mesencephalic locomotor neurons in rats transmit central command-driven excitatory signals onto the rostral ventrolateral medulla at least partially via glutamatergic processes, to activate both somatomotor and sympathetic nervous systems. Optogenetic excitation of this monosynaptic pathway elicits locomotor and cardiovascular responses as seen during running exercise, whereas pathway inhibition suppresses the locomotor activities and blood pressure elevation during voluntary running without affecting basal cardiovascular homeostasis. These results demonstrate an important subcortical pathway that transmits central command signals, providing a key insight into the central circuit mechanism required for the physiological conditioning essential to maximize exercise performance.

### Cardiac adaptation to acute and chronic participation in endurance sports [^51d5487c]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

The pervasive public health message is that moderate amounts of endurance exercise help maintain optimal health and reduce cardiovascular risk. While not enough people meet national physical activity guidelines, there are some at the opposite end of the activity spectrum who far exceed the recommended 'dose' of exercise. The cardiovascular health consequences of single and/or multiple (lifelong) 'doses' of high-volume endurance exercise are currently being debated. Recent commentaries, case reports and case series data have posed the question whether you can 'overdose on exercise', and that is the focus of this brief review.

### Exercise at the extremes: the amount of exercise to reduce cardiovascular events [^bf76a68a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Habitual physical activity and regular exercise training improve cardiovascular health and longevity. A physically active lifestyle is, therefore, a key aspect of primary and secondary prevention strategies. An appropriate volume and intensity are essential to maximally benefit from exercise interventions. This document summarizes available evidence on the relationship between the exercise volume and risk reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the risks and benefits of moderate- versus high-intensity exercise interventions are compared. Findings are presented for the general population and cardiac patients eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Finally, the controversy of excessive volumes of exercise in the athletic population is discussed.

### Abstract… [^201587ba]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease refers to a reversible supply/demand mismatch related to ischemia, a history of myocardial infarction, or the presence of plaque documented by catheterization or computed tomography angiography. Patients are considered stable if they are asymptomatic or if their symptoms are controlled by medications or revascularization. 1, 2 In the United States, approximately 25% of men and 16% of women 60 to 79 years of age have diagnosed or undiagnosed CAD, or a cardiovascular disease equivalent such as stroke or peripheral arterial disease. 3 CAD is one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States, accounting for 31% of all deaths in 2013. In a large RCT, older adults with no diabetes mellitus who had cardiovascular disease or at least a 15% 10-year risk of cardiovascular events were randomized to a systolic blood pressure target of 120 or 140 mm Hg.

After three years, the group with the lower blood pressure target had less all-cause mortality and heart failure, but more hypotension, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte abnormalities. 23 However, they do not address targets for adults with stable CAD. The 2012 ACC/AHA/European Society of Cardiology practice guideline for the management of stable CAD recommends treating hypertension to a target BP of less than 140/80 mm Hg. 1, 2 Although not endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the 2017 guideline on high BP from the ACC/AHA recommends a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg for persons with CAD. 24 In a large 2015 RCT, older adults with CVD and no diabetes or with at least a 15% 10-year risk of cardiovascular events were randomized to a systolic BP target of 120 or 140 mm Hg. 25 After 3. 3 years, all-cause mortality was lower in the aggressive therapy group (3. 3% vs.

RANOLAZINE Ranolazine inhibits the late inward sodium current, indirectly reducing the calcium current, which decreases ventricular diastolic tension and myocardial oxygen demand. These sodium channels typically remain active in cardiac disease states, causing a substantial increase in calcium concentration and a corollary increase in ventricular diastolic tension. It is important to note that PCI does not improve mortality in patients with stable CAD, but it may improve symptoms.

### Influences of body composition upon the relative metabolic and cardiovascular demands of load-carriage [^441e8dec]. Occupational Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To test the hypothesis that measures of aerobic fitness, body mass and indices of body composition will influence the metabolic and cardiovascular demands of simulated load-carriage tasks.

Method

Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers, following assessment of maximal oxygen uptake (O(2)max) and body composition, walked on a treadmill at 4 kph (1.11 m/s) for 60 min on gradients of 0, 3, 6 and 9% whilst carrying backpack loads of 0, 20 and 40 kg. During the final 3 min of each 5-min exercise bout, indirect respiratory calorimetry and heart rate data were collected and the 'steady-state' metabolic O(2) and cardiovascular (heart rate) demands quantified.

Results

Absolute O(2)max (ml/min) produced the strongest correlation (r = -0.64, P < 0.01) with the metabolic demand of heavy load-carriage (40 kg). The body composition index lean body mass/(fat mass + external load) produced a moderate correlation (r = -0.52, P < 0.01) with the metabolic demand of heavy load-carriage. The increases in metabolic and cardiovascular demands were greater when the load carried increased from 20 to 40 kg compared with 0 to 20 kg at all four gradients. A model incorporating anthropometric and physiological characteristics with gradient and load explains 89% of the variability in the metabolic demands of load-carriage compared with 82% using gradient and load alone.

Conclusion

The results show that indices of body composition as well as absolute aerobic power influence the relative metabolic demands of load-carriage. Application of these measurements would ensure selection criteria for load-carriage occupations are based on lean muscle mass rather than running speed.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing: what is its value? [^8d30e2dd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Due to the prognostic ability of key variables, CPET applications in cardiology have grown impressively to include all forms of exercise intolerance, with a predominant focus on heart failure with reduced or with preserved ejection fraction. As impaired cardiac output and peripheral oxygen diffusion are the main determinants of the abnormal functional response in cardiac patients, invasive CPET has gained new popularity, especially for diagnosing early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. The most impactful advance has recently come from the introduction of CPET combined with echocardiography or CPET imaging, which provides basic information regarding cardiac and valve morphology and function. This review highlights modern CPET use as a single or combined test that allows the pathophysiological bases of exercise limitation to be translated, quite easily, into clinical practice.

### Exercise: the ultimate treatment to all ailments? [^6ec99502]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Extensive clinical research has provided robust evidence that exercise is a cost-effective measure to substantially alleviate the burden of a large number of diseases, many of which belong to the cardiovascular (CV) spectrum. In terms of cardiac benefit, the positive effects of exercise are attributed to improvements in standard risk factors for atherosclerosis, as well as to its positive impact on several pathophysiological mechanisms for CV diseases. For secondary prevention, exercise, optimally in the context of a cardiac rehabilitation program, has been shown to improve functional capacity and survival. Clinicians should encourage physical activity and provide exercise recommendations for all patients, taking into consideration any underlying pathology. In the present review, the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of major CV risk factors and heart conditions are analyzed.

### Recommendations on the use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in young adult competitive athletes: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^f436c3d1]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-induced cardiac remodeling (EICR) — basic physiology and determinants — is described as the process by which the heart and vasculature change with respect to structure and function in response to repetitive exercise exposure, with cross-sectional imaging studies spanning the last 5 decades. During exercise, increasing oxygen demand is met by increasing oxygen uptake (VO2), maximal oxygen consumption (Peak VO2) reflects an individual's maximal volitional intensity, and in healthy people the product of stroke volume and heart rate may increase 5- to 6-fold during maximal exercise effort; cardiac chamber enlargement and the ability to generate a large stroke volume are cardiovascular hallmarks of the endurance-trained athlete. Isotonic (endurance) exercise involves sustained elevations in cardiac output with normal or reduced peripheral vascular resistance, whereas isometric (strength) exercise is characterized by marked and typically pulsatile increases in peripheral vascular resistance with normal or only slightly elevated cardiac output, representing a pressure challenge for the left ventricle. Across sports, athletes in predominantly isotonic disciplines (swimmers and runners) have larger LV chamber diameters than those in largely isometric sports (wrestling); isotonic activity stimulates dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers, while strength-based activity may lead to mild thickening of LV walls without chamber dilation, with the left and right atria largely unaffected by isometric training; the degree of EICR from pure isometric training is typically less unless coupled with long-term hypertension or illicit anabolic steroid use, and female athletes typically exhibit quantitatively less physiologic remodeling.

### The cardiovascular stress response as early life marker of cardiovascular health: applications in population-based pediatric studies – A narrative review [^8ae603a8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Measurements of the Cardiovascular Stress Response in Pediatric Population Studies

Ideally, multiple cardiovascular measurements are obtained during rest, exercise and recovery to obtain an adequate evaluation of the response of the cardiovascular system to exercise. These measurements include heart rate response and recovery, oxygen saturation changes, blood pressure response and recovery and changes in stroke volume, ejection fraction and cardiac output.

Clearly, heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrocardiography and blood pressure response and recovery, are most easily obtained. Previous studies have mainly focused on these measurements to determine an abnormal cardiovascular response to physical exercise. Abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise include an abnormal chronotropic response, abnormal heart rate recovery response, excessive rises in exercise blood pressure and exercise hypotension. An abnormal chronotropic response is the inability of the heart rate to increase equivalent to the increasing demand of blood flow during exercise. The inability to increase heart rate linearly in proportion to the physical effort, is common in both children and adults with congenital heart diseases and is associated with a poor prognosis. An abnormal heart rate recovery response is usually defined as a decline in heart rate of ≤ 12 beats from peak exercise to one minute after cessation of the exercise test. An excessive rise in exercise blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure value exceeding the 95th percentile for exercise blood pressure. Exercise induced hypotension (EIH) can also occur, which is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure during exercise below the pre-exercise value. These impaired cardiovascular responses to exercise are strongly associated with cardiovascular events, diseases and mortality within adult populations, but smaller studies have also shown associations of an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise with reduced cardiovascular health in children.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^08b6da82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — exercise assessment and mechanisms of exercise limitation in chronic respiratory disease are outlined as follows: Before starting an exercise training program, an exercise assessment is needed to individualize the exercise prescription, evaluate the potential need for supplemental oxygen, help rule out some cardiovascular comorbidities, and help ensure the safety of the intervention. This patient assessment may also include a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess the safety of exercise, to define the factors contributing to exercise limitation, and to identify a suitable exercise prescription, and analyzing the output from a cardiopulmonary exercise test may uncover otherwise hidden exercise-related issues such as hypoxemia, dysrhythmias, musculoskeletal problems, or cardiac ischemia. Exercise intolerance in individuals with chronic respiratory disease may result from ventilatory constraints, pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, or any combination of the above. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ventilatory requirements during exercise are often higher than expected because of increased work of breathing, increased dead space ventilation, impaired gas exchange, and increased ventilatory demand, with expiratory airflow obstruction and dynamic hyperinflation further limiting maximal ventilation and contributing to increased work of breathing, mechanical constraints on the respiratory muscles, and an intensified sense of dyspnea. Hypoxia directly increases pulmonary ventilation through augmenting peripheral chemoreceptor output and indirectly through stimulation of lactic acid production, whereas supplemental oxygen therapy during exercise, in hypoxemic and even in nonhypoxemic patients with COPD, allows for higher intensity training. The cardiovascular system is affected by chronic respiratory disease, with an increase in right ventricular afterload from elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to combinations of hypoxic vasoconstriction, vascular injury and/or remodeling, and erythrocytosis, and other cardiac complications include tachyarrhythmias and elevated right atrial pressure that may further compromise cardiac function during exercise. Lower limb muscle dysfunction is frequent in individuals with chronic respiratory disease and is an important cause of exercise limitation, and in COPD increased lactic acid production for a given exercise work rate increases ventilatory requirement, with a tendency to retain carbon dioxide during exercise further increasing acidosis and ventilatory burden. Despite adaptations, patients with COPD often have static and dynamic hyperinflation that places respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage, and both functional inspiratory muscle strength and inspiratory muscle endurance are compromised.

### Basic science behind the cardiovascular benefits of exercise [^c23fdf6e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of cardiovascular (CV) disease and all-cause mortality, with increases in cardiorespiratory fitness associated with corresponding decreases in CV disease risk. The effects of exercise upon the myocardium and vascular system are dependent upon the frequency, intensity and duration of the exercise itself. Following a prolonged period (≥ 6months) of regular intensive exercise in previously untrained individuals, resting and submaximal exercising heart rates are typically 5–20 beats lower, with an increase in stroke volume of ∼20% and enhanced myocardial contractility. Structurally, all four heart chambers increase in volume with mild increases in wall thickness, resulting in greater cardiac mass due to increased myocardial cell size. With this in mind, the present paper aims to review the basic science behind the CV benefits of exercise. Attention will be paid to understanding (1) the relationship between exercise and cardiac remodelling; (2) the cardiac cellular and molecular adaptations in response to exercise, including the examination of molecular mechanisms of physiological cardiac growth and applying these mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse pathological remodelling and heart failure; and (3) vascular adaptations in response to exercise. Finally, this review will briefly examine how to optimise the CV benefits of exercise by considering how much and how intense exercise should be.

### Metabolic coordination of physiological and pathological cardiac remodeling [^53ede0b2]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Role of Metabolism in Exercise-Induced Cardiac Growth

Exercise-induced increases in cardiac size were initially identified in the late 1890s, and they were first described in the 1950s. This form of cardiac hypertrophy occurs primarily in highly trained athletes, is relatively mild (≈10%–20% increase in heart mass), and is reversible on prolonged cessation of exercise. It is accompanied by unchanged or marginally enhanced systolic and diastolic function. Exercises that promote sustained increases in cardiac output (eg, endurance running) cause an eccentric form of cardiac remodeling, whereas exercises that increase systemic arterial pressures (eg, weight lifting) often promote concentric hypertrophy. Although adaptation of the heart to exercise is generally beneficial — protecting the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury, and increasing stroke volume — it may be maladaptive by promoting fibrosis, deleterious ventricular remodeling, or atrial or ventricular fibrillation. Nevertheless, exercise can lead to cardiac adaptations, which broadly applied to healthy and diseased populations, improves health, and complements exercise-induced increases in health span. –

As may be expected, the physical exertion occurring with exercise has robust effects on cardiac function and metabolism. Exercise increases left ventricular contractile power and myocardial oxygen consumption 3- to 10-fold above resting rates. The increases in myocardial oxygen consumption are caused by elevated ADP concentrations, which drive oxidative phosphorylation to regenerate ATP at higher rates. Changes in cardiac substrate catabolism provide the fuel for increased energy demands and are dependent on several integrated factors including workload, circulating hormones, and substrate availability and abundance. Importantly, the acute changes in metabolism that occur during exercise are different from the chronic changes that occur after adaptation. We discuss these issues below, concluding with evidence of how changes in metabolism may be involved in exercise-induced cardiac growth.

### Exercise and cardiac health: physiological and molecular insights [^59744e94]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The cardiac benefits of exercise have been recognized for centuries. Studies have undisputedly shown that regular exercise is beneficial for the cardiovascular system in young, old, healthy and diseased populations. For these reasons, physical activity has been recommended worldwide for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment. Although the benefits of exercise are clear, understanding of the molecular triggers that orchestrate these effects remains incomplete and has been a topic of intense research in recent years. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the cardiac effects of physical activity, beginning with a brief history of exercise in cardiovascular medicine and then discussing seminal work on the physiological effects of exercise in healthy, diseased and aged hearts. Later, we revisit pioneering work on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac benefits of exercise, and we conclude with our view on the translational potential of this knowledge as a powerful platform for cardiovascular disease drug discovery.

### Exercise and the cardiovascular system: clinical science and cardiovascular outcomes [^b4c991d6]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence has established the value of high levels of physical activity, exercise training (ET), and overall cardiorespiratory fitness in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This article reviews some basics of exercise physiology and the acute and chronic responses of ET, as well as the effect of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness on cardiovascular diseases. This review also surveys data from epidemiological and ET studies in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary heart disease and heart failure. These data strongly support the routine prescription of ET to all patients and referrals for patients with cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease and heart failure, to specific cardiac rehabilitation and ET programs.

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^0c38b726]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

During muscle contraction, metabolic heat production increases in an intensity dependent manner. During exercise in the heat or when wearing encapsulated clothing, individuals gain extra heat from the environment to the body or the trapping of heat within the clothing ensemble. To sustain exercise, cardiac output must match the demands for blood flow. Blood flow to active muscles is required to meet the oxygen demands for muscular activity, while blood flow to skin is required to meet the demands of thermoregulation. Vasodilation and increased skin blood flow increase the amount of blood pooled in peripheral vessels, which reduces central blood volume. Splanchnic and renal blood flow are reduced by both vigorous exercise and severe heat stress. Reductions in gut and renal blood flow are generally thought to facilitate shifts in cardiac output to the skin and exercising muscle to maintain blood pressure and allow continued exercise. When these adjustments are inadequate during exercise in hot environments at high metabolic rates (> 75% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂max)), skin, muscle, and brain blood flow are compromised and contribute to severity of exertional heat illness. These cardiovascular alterations lead to a diversity of outcomes including altered gut permeability that can have consequences to EHS pathophysiology.

### Cardiac output response to exercise in relation to metabolic demand in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1cc4d71b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Exercise intolerance is a hallmark of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet its mechanisms remain unclear. The current study sought to determine whether increases in cardiac output (CO) during exercise are appropriately matched to metabolic demands in HFpEF.

Methods and Results

Patients with HFpEF (n = 109) and controls (n = 73) exercised to volitional fatigue with simultaneous invasive (n = 96) or non-invasive (n = 86) haemodynamic assessment and expired gas analysis to determine oxygen consumption (VO2) during upright or supine exercise. At rest, HFpEF patients had higher LV filling pressures but similar heart rate, stroke volume, EF, and CO. During supine and upright exercise, HFpEF patients displayed lower peak VO2 coupled with blunted increases in heart rate, stroke volume, EF, and CO compared with controls. LV filling pressures increased dramatically in HFpEF patients, with secondary elevation in pulmonary artery pressures. Reduced peak VO2 in HFpEF patients was predominantly attributable to CO limitation, as the slope of the increase in CO relative to VO2 was 20% lower in HFpEF patients (5.9 ± 2.5 vs. 7.4 ± 2.6 L blood/L O2, P = 0.0005). While absolute increases in arterial-venous O2 difference with exercise were similar in HFpEF patients and controls, augmentation in arterial-venous O2 difference relative to VO2 was greater in HFpEF patients (8.9 ± 3.4 vs. 5.5 ± 2.0 min/dL, P < 0.0001). These differences were observed in the total cohort and when upright and supine exercise modalities were examined individually.

Conclusion

While diastolic dysfunction promotes congestion and pulmonary hypertension with stress in HFpEF, reduction in exercise capacity is predominantly related to inadequate CO relative to metabolic needs.

### Economic impact of moderate-vigorous physical activity among those with and without established cardiovascular disease: 2012 medical expenditure panel Survey [^28e9ac1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Overwhelming evidence points toward a world‐wide increase in prevalence of noncommunicable chronic diseases. Dall et al. estimated that by the year 2025, most growth in outpatient visits will be reflected primarily in the field of cardiology, which, along with vascular surgery, will have the highest projected growth in demand. 37 Consequently, several initiatives have been set up with a goal to help mitigate the increase in noncommunicable diseases, such as the American Heart Association's (AHA) 2020 Strategic Goals, 34 Health 2020, 38 or the "25×25" Strategy. 39 Unsurprisingly, PA is an integral part of all these efforts, and yet the current prevalence of PA engagement remains below 50% for non‐CVD and below 35% for CVD individuals, according to our results, including the advent of recent reports favoring interventions among middle‐aged individuals, 40 or even identifying the benefits of simpler strategies, such as walking, in the prevention of CVD. 41

### Physical activity in the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease [^e9278a47]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Adaptation of Coronary Circulation to Exercise Training in the Healthy Heart

An increase in cardiac output with physical exercise and increased skeletal muscle perfusion results in augmented myocardial oxygen demand. Because myocardial oxygen extraction from the blood is already ≈70% to 80% at resting conditions, the maintenance of myocardial oxygen and nutrient supply predominantly depends on coronary blood flow. 28 It has been shown that regular exercise training induces functional and morphologic changes of the vascular tree associated with reduced coronary vascular resistance. These changes allow augmented blood flow during exercise conditions in the presence of normal wall shear stress and blood flow velocity. 28, 29

Numerous studies have shown that NO derived from the endothelial isoform of the NO synthase (eNOS) is a prerequisite of vasomotion in conduit vessels. 30 An increase in shear stress (eg, during physical activity) has been proved to enhance eNOS mRNA and protein expression and promote phosphorylation of the serine 1177 residue of the enzyme, thereby boosting vascular NO production. 31, 32, 33, 34 However, animal studies suggest that after a few months of exercise training, eNOS expression levels reduce to the preexercise state. 35 This decline is explained by the fact that the normalization of shear stress at an early adaptive state requires a decline in vascular tone and, hence, vasodilatation; however, this change does not occur at a later stage when the vessels have already grown. 1

Despite over the past few decades incidence and mortality rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are declining in many countries, there are currently still about 126 million cases of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in the world. IHD also remains one of the leading causes of death, accounting for over 9 million deaths per year worldwide. The disease is most often progressive, and can have long stable periods but sometimes become unstable due to an acute atherothrombotic event or to oxygen supply/demand mismatch. Chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are two different manifestations of the same disease. CCS also displays several clinical scenariossuch as: suspected IHD with "stable" symptoms, new onset of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction in patients with suspected IHD, patients with stabilized symptoms < 1 year after an ACS/revascularization, patients > 1 year after initial diagnosis and, finally, asymptomatic subjects in whom IHD is detected at screening. Asymptomatic patients are those who most benefit from primary prevention. In fact, one of the main concerns is that CCS is often long‐time asymptomatic as, even in presence of significant atherosclerotic plaques, coronary blood flow at rest is frequently maintained by autoregulation processes, defined as the capacity to preserve blood flow during changes in perfusion pressure. Anyway, when the dilator reserve is compromised, the coronary blood flow becomes insufficient at high metabolic demands, for example, during physical exercise. Physical activity has undeniable benefits in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, therefore it must be advised to everyone, irrespective of the cardiovascular risk status, to maintain an optimal health condition. Moreover, in the presence of underlying CCS, intensive physical exercise may act as a trigger for life‐threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Pre‐participation cardiovascular screening can be very important to early detect disorders associated with SCD, and to prescribe the safest exercise program for every single patient.

The purpose of this review is to analyse the current evidence on the beneficial role of sport and exercise in the primary and secondary prevention of IHD.

### American College of Sports Medicine expert consensus statement to update recommendations for screening, staffing, and emergency policies to prevent cardiovascular events at health fitness facilities [^6359a84b]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2020). High credibility.

Therapeutic implications of physical activity (PA) and fitness indicate that low-fit individuals are approximately two to three times more likely to die during follow-up than their more fit counterparts. The absolute risk associated with each bout of exercise is relatively low and regular exercise, including high-volume endurance activity (> 1 h·d−1), reduces the long-term risk of acute cardiovascular events by up to 50%. Accordingly, a habitually sedentary lifestyle appears to be far riskier than a physically active one, and it is probably more important that individuals exercise regularly at a convenient time of day, regardless of the hour.

### The utilization and interpretation of cardiac biomarkers during pregnancy: expert panel [^fad448a2]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy is associated with increased hemodynamic demands on the maternal cardiovascular system. Significant neurohormonal fluctuations contribute to alterations in the cardiovascular system, which allow adaptation to the increased demands of normal pregnancy. Pregnant individuals often have symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, decreased exercise capacity, and lower extremity edema in the context of normal pregnancy that can be challenging to distinguish from those of cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, complications of pregnancy may include cardiovascular manifestations such as cardiomyopathy. While cardiac biomarker testing is widely utilized for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with suspected or proven cardiovascular disease, their use in the context of pregnancy is less well understood. Therefore, a better understanding of whether and how cardiac biomarkers can be integrated into clinical practice provides an important means of identifying pregnant individuals who require further cardiovascular evaluation. This paper will summarize our current knowledge on the use of cardiac biomarkers in pregnancy and provide suggestions on how to optimally use these tools in clinical practice based on the available evidence.

Exercise safety and warning signs during physical activity — population-level observations: Across "36.5 million hours of MVPA in women", the reports "highlight the rarity of cardiovascular complications during exercise and suggest that exercise is safe for most individuals". Exertion-related acute cardiovascular events are often preceded by warning signs or symptoms, which should prompt immediate cessation of exercise training and medical review.

### Considerations for stress testing performed in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging [^1d4cfea6]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

For myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), the best test to evaluate hemodynamic changes during stress is an exercise treadmill test. It provides independent prognostic value, including evaluation of total exercise time, performance, and capacity; heart rate response during exercise, with ischemia, and in recovery; blood pressure response; myocardial oxygen demand; and assessment of symptoms. Combining these exercise data with perfusion imaging provides the best prognostic value and risk stratification for patients. Although exercise stress testing accompanied by MPI is preferential, it is not always possible since an increasing number of patients cannot exercise to a maximal (symptom-limited) level. Further, there is much evidence in the literature demonstrating a suboptimal, non-symptom-limited (not achieving at least 4–6 min or < 85% of maximum predicted heart rate) exercise test performed as part of an MPI study may result in a false-negative outcome. Therefore, pharmacologic stress agents provide an excellent alternative for those patients who cannot achieve an adequate heart rate response or adequately perform physical exercise. This article focuses on considerations for performing stress (exercise and pharmacologic) testing in conjunction with MPI. It is meant to provide a basic overview of the principles of exercise stress testing; discuss the indications, contraindications, patient preparation, and protocols for exercise stress testing; discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for vasodilator (adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson) stress testing; and discuss the contraindications, administration protocols, and side effects for dobutamine stress testing.

### Cardiac ketone body oxidation enhances exercise performance [^8e7f8d56]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Exercise has been indisputably linked to improved health throughout the lifespan. Indeed, exercise capacity as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness (eg, maximum rate of oxygen consumption, VO₂max) is a strong, independent predictor of all-cause mortality. By promoting periodic metabolic and mechanical stress, regular exercise drives beneficial adaptations in nearly all tissues, with exercise duration and intensity modifying the level of benefit. Nevertheless, the ability to perform exercise at effective levels varies individually and diminishes with aging and disease. Identification of interventions that augment exercise capacity and their underlying mechanisms may lead to improved strategies to preserve overall health.

Recent studies show that acute hyperketonemia improves exercise capacity in human subjects. While exercise capacity is influenced by many factors, a primary limitation is O 2 delivery to skeletal muscles, with maximal cardiac output estimated to account for 70% to 85% of VO₂max constraint. The high cardiac workloads imposed by exercise depend on sufficient myocardial O 2 supply, achieved through local metabolic signaling that evokes vasodilation and increases blood flow. Elevated plasma levels of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) promote increased myocardial blood flow via a mechanism that requires cardiomyocyte BDH1 (3-OHB dehydrogenase 1), a key enzyme for ketone body oxidation in the heart. Together, these findings suggest that cardiomyocyte utilization of 3-OHB may accommodate heightened cardiac demand and, thereby, enhance performance. Accordingly, we tested whether exercise capacity improvements observed with exogenous ketone body delivery depend on cardiomyocyte catabolism of 3-OHB.

### Myocardial ischemia: lack of coronary blood flow or myocardial oxygen supply / demand imbalance? [^bf0a3b1f]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Regional myocardial blood flow and contractile function in ischemic myocardium are well matched, and there is no evidence for an oxygen supply/demand imbalance. Thus, myocardial ischemia is lack of coronary blood flow with electric, functional, metabolic, and structural consequences for the myocardium. All therapeutic interventions must aim to improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium as much and as quickly as possible.

### Type 2 diabetes and reduced exercise tolerance: a review of the literature through an integrated physiology approach [^0aada2ef]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular neurogenic determinants

When a neural motor impulse is sent to a skeletal muscle, a parallel impulse is given to the cardiovascular centres in the brainstem in order to increase cardiac output and central blood pressure mainly through sympathetic activation. The second determinant of increased adrenergic sympathetic tone during exercise is the muscle metaboreceptor that is stimulated by muscle mechanical and metabolic activity. These two systems are further modulated by arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes that allow a beat-per-beat optimal adjustment of systemic cardiovascular parameters in order to meet regional muscle metabolic demands. During exercise the systemic peripheral vascular bed normally undergoes sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction known as sympathetic restrain, which is meant to reduce blood flow to non-exercising tissues. In the working muscles, this is counterbalanced by local vasodilating mechanisms (functional sympatholysis) that allow muscular blood flow to adjust to meet the regional metabolic requests rapidly. In T2DM, several defects in the neural control of the cardiovascular responses to exercise have been observed.

Physical activity dose–response and guidelines — epidemiological studies report that 150 min·wk−1 of moderate physical activity (PA) or 75 min of vigorous PA are associated with decreased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality, with significant reductions beginning even at half of the recommended volume; data suggest a target goal of 150 to 300 min·wk−1 of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and for those performing little to no MVPA, replacing sedentary behavior with light-intensity PA reduces risk of all-cause mortality, CVD incidence and mortality, and type 2 diabetes; pooled analyses indicate neither an upper nor lower threshold for mortality benefits, with no increased mortality risk up to four times the current guideline amounts; at least 70% of maximal benefit is achieved by meeting 150 min·wk−1, and whereas 2008 guidance required at least 10 min of continuous MVPA, the 2018 Committee concluded that every minute counts toward the goal.

### Chronotropic incompetence and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^a54253d3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure (HF) is highly prevalent that afflicts millions of adults worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. About half of patients with HF were found to have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients suffered from HF symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality‐of‐life, and frequent hospitalizations that could not be explained by traditional mechanisms of insufficient cardiac contractility. There is no standard therapy that can improve 'the prognostic outcomes of all patients with HFpEF'. The cause and mechanism of HFpEF have been studied and showed highly pathophysiologic heterogeneity. Moreover, there is no simple screening tool to identify potential patients with HFpEF in outpatient department settings with noninvasive methods.

Chronotropic incompetence is one of the characters in HFpEF pathophysiology. The chronotropic incompetence is defined as inadequate chronotropic response to metabolic demand. A tolerable exercise requires robust and integrated physiologic augmentation from the pulmonary, respiratory, skeletal muscle, and cardiovascular systems. Cardiac output (CO) is the product of the heart rate and the stroke volume, and CO is the central determinant of maximal oxygen consumption (VO₂). As the normal response to increasing intensity of exercise, heart rate increases immediately to meet metabolic demands.

Studies have investigated the hemodynamic exercise reserve in patients with HFpEF. The most consistent and severe hemodynamic reserve abnormalities observed were impairment in chronotropic reserve and exaggerated increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) during exercise. However, research demonstrated that the peak exercise capacity cannot be improved after acute lowering PCWP by sublingual nitroglycerin, which implied that elevated PCWP during exercise is not by itself a limiting factor for exercise performance. Impaired cardiac β–receptor sensitivity was noticed in patients with HFpEF compared with controls, suggesting that chronotropic incompetence may play a more important role in patients with HFpEF with exercise intolerance.

The relationship between chronotropic incompetence and exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF remains unclear. To address this, we initiated a cohort study of patients with HFpEF undergoing invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing (iCPET) to evaluate the impact of chronotropic incompetence on cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, we assessed how exercise hemodynamic parameters correlate with these outcomes to provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying chronotropic incompetence in HFpEF.

### The myocardial oxygen supply: demand index revisited [^a6cbcc30]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Relationship Among LV Mass, Peak Systolic Tension and LV Myocardial Oxygen Consumption

In adult humans, the left ventricular mass index averages 55 to 95 g.m −2. There is much normal variation related to gender, physical fitness, and age. An abnormal increase in LV mass implies hypertrophy that may cause a 2‐ to 3‐fold increase in LV mass.

Resting myocardial oxygen consumption is normally 8 to 13 mL.100 g −1.min −1. At rest, it is linearly related to LV mass (Figure 5).

Figure 5.
Relation of resting left ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption (LVO 2) to LV mass, based on data from Strauer. The regression line has the equation LVO 2 = 0.1036 LV−2.12 mass. The dashed lines show the 95% confidence limits for points, and the standard deviation from regression is 2.22.

Resting LV myocardial oxygen consumption (mL.min −1) is also linearly related to peak meridional wall stress (kdynes.cm −2). Doubling wall tension approximately doubles LV oxygen consumption.

Hypertrophy and Myocardial Blood Flow

If hypertrophy is acquired after infancy intramyocardial vessels must at the very least lengthen to maintain flow across the thickened wall. There may also be other changes. In one recent study in mice, left ventricular pressure overload increased the number of microvessels early, but subsequently their number decreased. These microvessels were mainly capillaries that play little role in coronary vascular resistance, and there is no or little growth of the resistance vessels.

Therefore with maximal vasodilatation a given perfusion pressure produces about the same total myocardial blood flow in a hypertrophied as in a normal left ventricle. As a result, the maximal flow per unit mass of myocardium decreases. – During autoregulation, though, resting flow is increased by hypertrophy to supply the increased oxygen needs of the myocardium. This produces a decrease in coronary flow reserveso that less flow is available to meet increased usage with exercise. or tachycardia.

### Exercise-induced cardiovascular adaptations and approach to exercise and cardiovascular disease: JACC state-of-the-art review [^5f6944f1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of the sports cardiologist has evolved into an essential component of the medical care of athletes. In addition to the improvement in health outcomes caused by reductions in cardiovascular risk, exercise results in adaptations in cardiovascular structure and function, termed exercise-induced cardiac remodeling. As diagnostic modalities have evolved over the last century, we have learned much about the healthy athletic adaptation that occurs with exercise. Sports cardiologists care for those with known or previously unknown cardiovascular conditions, distinguish findings on testing as physiological adaptation or pathological changes, and provide evidence-based and "best judgment" assessment of the risks of sports participation. We review the effects of exercise on the heart, the approach to common clinical scenarios in sports cardiology, and the importance of a patient/athlete-centered, shared decision-making approach in the care provided to athletes.

### Benefits of exercise training on coronary blood flow in coronary artery disease patients [^18e4e730]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Every 34 seconds an American experiences a myocardial infarction or cardiac death. Approximately 80% of these coronary artery disease (CAD)-related deaths are attributable to modifiable behaviors, such as a lack of physical exercise training (ET). Regular ET decreases CAD morbidity and mortality through systemic and cardiac-specific adaptations. ET increases myocardial oxygen demand acting as a stimulus to increase coronary blood flow and thus myocardial oxygen supply, which reduces myocardial infarction and angina. ET augments coronary blood flow through direct actions on the vasculature that improve endothelial and coronary smooth muscle function, enhancing coronary vasodilation. Additionally, ET promotes collateralization, thereby, increasing blood flow to ischemic myocardium and also treats macrovascular CAD by attenuating the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and restenosis, potentially through stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions. In summary, ET can be used as a relatively safe and inexpensive way to prevent and treat CAD.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic contributors to the cardiac benefits of exercise [^28efa5c9]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Among its many cardiovascular benefits, exercise training improves heart function and protects the heart against age-related decline, pathological stress, and injury. Here, we focus on cardiac benefits with an emphasis on more recent updates to our understanding. While the cardiomyocyte continues to play a central role as both a target and effector of exercise's benefits, there is a growing recognition of the important roles of other, noncardiomyocyte lineages and pathways, including some that lie outside the heart itself. We review what is known about mediators of exercise's benefits-both those intrinsic to the heart (at the level of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, or vascular cells) and those that are systemic (including metabolism, inflammation, the microbiome, and aging)-highlighting what is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible.

### Early adaptations to training: upregulation of α-myosin heavy chain gene expression [^7232ba19]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Chronic exercise induces adaptations that increase the functional capacity of the cardiovascular system. Aside from ventricular growth, these adaptations include a shift in the MHC isoenzyme pattern to enhance ventricular contractility. It is unclear whether adaptations by the contractile elements are an early event and specific to exercise, or whether they progress as a function of cardiac growth. Examining early adaptations to training is also important because it is during this period when the greatest imbalance between increased demand and functional capacity exists, and it is likely that the mechanisms responsible for propagating changes in the myocardial phenotype are most active.

Purpose

To determine whether changes in left ventricular (LV) contractile elements are an early adaptation to chronic exercise.

Methods

Rats were randomly assigned to sedentary control or exercise training groups for 1 or 10 wk of training. After training, the LV was analyzed for protein by Western blot or mRNA by Northern and real-time QRT-PCR analysis.

Results

Plantaris cytochrome oxidase activity was significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 1 wk (+28%) or 10 wk (+32%) of training. Training significantly increased LV myofibrillar alpha-MHC protein and alpha-MHC-mRNA after both training periods. No changes in myofibrillar beta-MHC protein or beta-MHC-mRNA were observed. After 1 wk of training, LV skeletal alpha-actin-mRNA was significantly increased, whereas no changes were found for ANF, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, or cytochrome oxidase IV. Gel mobility shift analysis determined that YY1 DNA binding was significantly decreased in LV extracts from trained animals, although no change in YY1-mRNA expression was observed.

Conclusions

Increased myofibrillar alpha-MHC protein and alpha-MHC-mRNA expression are early events in the adaptation to chronic exercise and occur before significant cardiac growth. These adaptations enhance myocardial contractility and permit increases in maximal cardiac output during heavy exercise.

### Exercise: the ultimate treatment to all ailments? [^0de001ac]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSIONS

The strong assets of regular moderate exercise are its free availability at low cost and its simultaneous benefits for preventing and improving several cardiac diseases. Integration of exercise in the daily routine of all individuals is essential to improve global health. It is important to emphasize that current evidence suggest that exercising for three to five times the current recommendations is the ideal dose for maximum benefit to prevent several CV diseases, although even 1 hour per week of exercise is associated with a health benefit. Some individuals engaging in lifelong endurance exercise show a high prevalence of CAC, myocardial fibrosis and AF, the long‐term significance of which is uncertain. Overall regular exercise is associated with a significant reduction in CV morbidity and mortality and longevity of an additional 2 to 7 years of life.

### The triad of physical activity: an optimal combination for cardiovascular health [^058e5c28]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The combination of moderate to vigorous physical activity with muscle-strengthening physical activity is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on cardiovascular health. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence to compare the cardiovascular benefits of combined physical activity versus singular forms, especially in primary prevention. The main focus is on hormonal, nervous, genetic, and molecular adaptations, critical mechanisms underlying the body's response to physical activity. Our findings endorse superior benefits for combined moderate to vigorous and muscle-strengthening physical activity for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD). This combined approach synergistically enhances cardiovascular function and more effectively reduces risk factors than either activity alone. While more research is needed to distinguish between moderate and vigorous activity levels in combination with muscle-strengthening physical activity, current evidence supports comprehensive physical activity guidelines that maximize cardiovascular health. These findings highlight the importance of integrated physical activity regimens in public health strategies and clinical practice to mitigate the global CVD burden.

### Eccentric exercise in coronary patients: central hemodynamic and metabolic responses [^0e901b48]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

With lengthening (eccentric) muscle contractions, the magnitude of locomotor-muscle mass and strength increase has been demonstrated to be greater compared with shortening (concentric) muscle contractions. In healthy subjects, energy demand and heart rate responses with eccentric exercise are small relative to the amount of muscle force produced. Thus, eccentric exercise may be an attractive alternative to resistance exercise for patients with limited cardiovascular exercise tolerance.

Methods

We tested the cardiovascular tolerance of eccentric exercise in 13 coronary patients (ages 40–66) with preserved and/or mild reduced left ventricular function. Patients were randomly assigned to either an eccentric (ECC; N = 7) or a concentric (CON; N = 6) training group and trained for 8 wk. Training workload was increased progressively (from week 1 to 5) to an intensity equivalent to 60% VO₂peak.

Results

On average, maximum power output achieved with ECC was fourfold compared with CON (357 ± 96 W vs 97 ± 21 W; P < 0.005), whereas measures of oxygen uptake and blood lactate were significantly lower (P < 0.05 each), and ratings of perceived exertion were similar for ECC and CON. During a 20-min session of ECC and CON, central hemodynamics was measured by means of right heart catheterization. During ECC, responses of mean arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary capillary pressure, cardiac index, and stroke work of the left ventricle on average were in the normal range of values and similar to those observed during CON. Compared with baseline, after 8 wk of training, echocardiographic left ventricular function was unchanged.

Conclusion

The results indicate uncoupling of skeletal muscle load and cardiovascular stress during ECC. For low-risk patients with coronary heart disease without angina, inducible ischemia, or left ventricular dysfunction, ECC can be recommended as a safe new approach to perform high-load muscular exercise training with minimal cardiovascular stress.

### Cardiovascular response to recreational hockey in middle-aged men [^264727f9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The present study examined the hemodynamic response to recreational pick-up hockey relative to maximal exercise testing in middle-aged men. A total of 23 men with a mean age of 53 ± 7 years were studied. Graded exercise testing on a cycle ergometer determined maximal oxygen consumption, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR). Ambulatory BP and Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was performed during one of their weekly hockey games (mean duration = 45 ± 7.2 minutes): for "On-Ice" responses (PLAY; data recorded while standing immediately after a shift; 8.0 ± 1.4 shifts per game) and during seated recovery (BENCH), 15 minutes after the game. On-Ice HRs and BPs were significantly higher than values obtained during maximal cycle exercise, respectively (HR 174 ± 8.9 vs 163 ± 11.0 beats/min) (systolic blood pressure 202 ± 20 vs 173 ± 31 mm Hg; p < 0.05). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly throughout the duration of the game, whereas HR increased from 139 ± 20 to 155 ± 16 beats/min during the game. The myocardial oxygen demand (myocardial time tension index) increased significantly during PLAY concurrent with a decrease in estimated myocardial oxygen supply (diastolic pressure time index), with the endocardial viability ratio during PLAY demonstrating a significant decrease during the third quarter of the game (1.25 ± 0.24) versus the first quarter (1.56 ± 0.30), which remained depressed 15 minutes post-game (p < 0.05). In conclusion, recreational pick-up hockey in middle-aged men is an extremely vigorous interval exercise with increasing relative intensity as the game progresses. Hockey elicits peak BPs and HRs that can exceed values observed during maximal exercise testing and is characterized by progressive increases in myocardial oxygen demand and lowered supply during PLAY and BENCH time. Given the progressive and high cardiovascular demands, caution is warranted when estimating the cardiovascular demands of hockey from clinical stress testing, particularly in those whom coronary reserve may be compromised.

### Remote exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke is associated with lower exercise capacity through effects on oxygen pulse, a proxy of cardiac stroke volume [^0ab16fc4]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, healthy never-smokers with history of remote but prolonged exposure to SHS have an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise, which is characterised by a stroke volume (oxygen-pulse) and thus an exercise capacity that are reduced proportional to their years of exposure to SHS. The mechanisms by which past exposure to SHS may limit stroke volume and thus exercise capacity are not entirely clear. But impaired LV filling and emptying may be involved, with contributions from pulmonary hyperinflation (beyond ventilatory limitation) and vascular dysfunction, both peripherally and centrally. Overall, the abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise in this population reveals the presence of subclinical pathology that impairs the cardiopulmonary functional reserve and reduces the efficiency of body's oxygen delivery machinery, which could be disadvantageous during the times of increased cardiopulmonary output demands as in physiological distress or disease.

### Exercise at the extremes: unraveling the mechanisms of deleterious cardiovascular Adaptations [^f60c53a8]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular benefits of exercise are great, as regular exercise training improves risk factors and active individuals experience a 20%-50% risk reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The dose-response association between exercise volumes and cardiovascular health benefits appears to be curvilinear, with the greatest health improvements with small amounts of exercise and greater risk reductions with higher exercise volumes. Such observations have contributed to the belief that "more exercise is better". There is emerging evidence, however, that extreme exercise, characterized by long-term, high-volume, high-intensity training, may induce deleterious cardiovascular adaptations in some individuals. For example, intensive exercise training has been associated with an increased prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, and aortic dilatation. These findings indicate a possible upper limit for the health benefits of exercise.

To allow early identification of individuals at risk and promote the development of preventive countermeasures, insight into the underlying mechanisms of exercise-induced cardiovascular maladaptations is key. Unfortunately, it is impossible to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the cardiovascular benefits and possible risks of long-term exercise training because of the following: 1) the sample size and study duration (≥ 10 years) required to document deleterious effects is simply too large; 2) compliance with assignment to active or low, moderately, or highly active groups would be difficult and unethical to enforce; and 3) the cost of such a study would be enormous. Animal models are, therefore, a good alternative to investigate how exercise can produce deleterious cardiovascular adaptations.

In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Rubies et alstudied the consequences of long-term moderate vs intense exercise on the vasculature in a rodent model, and aimed to uncover mechanisms responsible for these adaptations. For this purpose, 78 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a long-term exercise group or a sedentary control group (n = 27). Exercised rats were subjected to a moderate exercise (45 min/session at 35 cm/s; n = 28) or intensive exercise (60 minutes at 60 cm/s; n = 23) training program with 5 exercise sessions/wk for 16 weeks, which is estimated to equal a 10- to 12-year training period in humans. A comprehensive combination of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro measurements was conducted to assess functional and structural properties of the thoracic aorta, left carotid artery, and intramyocardial arteries.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^e8d668a4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular system — sex-related differences in cardiac structure, oxygen transport, and hormonal effects are described as follows: Males have both cardiac and hematological adaptations compared with females resulting in a significant performance gap in endurance events, including greater cardiac mass, blood volume, higher cardiac output and hemoglobin concentrations and thus larger VO2max. At rest and across submaximal and maximal exercise, males have higher stroke volume and stroke volume index, while for the same absolute work females have the same cardiac output but a smaller stroke volume and higher heart rate; at the same relative work the heart rate is the same between sexes. Estrogens directly compromise cardiac contractility and result in a lower contractile reserve due to downregulation of L-type calcium channels, whereas testosterone is associated with greater ventricular mass and myocardial contractility and high exogenous testosterone analogues result in significant left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in athletes along with an elevated risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Testosterone has significant ergogenic effects on peripheral determinants of VO2max as a potent inducer of erythropoiesis, recalibrating the set-point of erythropoietin and improving hemoglobin and hematocrit to raise the oxygen carrying capacity of blood; sex differences in blood volume and hemoglobin mass (males > females) enhance LV filling and peripheral oxygen delivery in males, while females partially compensate by increasing oxygen extraction but arteriovenous oxygen extraction remains lower at submaximal exercise. Testosterone administration in females result in improvements in mitochondrial respiration and 8% greater capillary to fiber ratio compared with placebo.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^5e6ccfb6]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Aerobic power (VO2max) — males have higher values on average across trained and untrained adults; in absolute capacity female athletes are 60%–70% of similarly trained males and when normalized to body mass ~80%–85% of males, while elite male runners typically reach ~70–85 mL·kg−1·min−1 versus ~60–75 mL·kg−1·min−1 in elite female runners and cyclists, representing ~10%–14% difference when normalized to body mass; VO2max reflects maximal cardiac output (L·min−1 = heart rate x stroke volume) and peripheral oxygen utilization per the Fick equation.

### Dose response of incidental physical activity against cardiovascular events and mortality [^857a7f5d]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings add nuance to existing guidelines by informing the activity doses and contents of context-specific interventions aimed at CVD prevention and general health. Despite the excellent potential of structured exercise to prevent, treat, and manage CVD and other noncommunicable conditions, there appears to be a historical ceiling of regular participation in the population at ≈15% to 25%. The barriers to undertaking regular exercise in leisure time (eg, cost, time, low motivation, lifestyle priority, and poor skills or fitness), encountered by large segments of the middle-aged and older population suggest that a shift toward feasible and sustainable physical activity patterns that can be habitually embedded into daily routines is needed. Interventions targeting incidental physical activity may be a potent yet relatively unexplored avenue to promote healthier lifestyles, especially for people who face several barriers linked to structured exercise. The availability of wearable devices able to capture high-resolution patterns continuously across the day and machine learning–based intensity classification tools –, opens previously unavailable possibilities for understanding the health value of overall and IPA and could catalyze new interventions and guidelines. These health equivalence findings provide meaningful insight beyond the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach by offering perspective into multiple physical activity avenues to achieve the same potential benefit. For example, light- or moderate-activity health equivalence values may help guide the duration recommendations for adults or clinical populations unable to complete vigorous physical activity.

### Sex-specific differences in cardiovascular adaptations and risks in elite athletes: bridging the gap in sports cardiology [^ccc4fc74]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

In recent decades, there has been a consistent rise in the number of adults worldwide engaging in physical activity, observed across both developed and developing countries. This trend is part of a larger global movement aimed at incorporating fitness into daily routines to mitigate the risk of metabolic‐related disorders and consequent cardiovascular disease, while also enhancing mental health, cognitive function, and overall quality of life. Concurrently, the number of elite athletes has surged, catalyzing the development of a specialized field within cardiovascular medicine known as "sports cardiology". This discipline is dedicated to addressing the unique cardiovascular requirements and challenges faced by this population.

Notably, the participation of female athletes in competitive sports has seen a remarkable increase over the years. For instance, the proportion of women athletes in the Olympic Games has escalated from 23% in 1984 in Los Angeles to 49% in 2021 in Tokyo. Despite this, the extant body of research investigating the cardiovascular impacts of exercise has predominantly concentrated on male athletes, with female athletes receiving comparatively limited attention.

Moreover, despite burgeoning interest in the biological underpinnings of sex differences in cardiovascular events, there remains a paucity of definitive evidence elucidating how physical activity may differentially influence cardiovascular health outcomes between genders. Disparities in anthropometrics, physiological parameters, sex hormones, biochemical profiles, and psychological factors between genders contribute to a complex interplay of variables that affect cardiovascular adaptation to athletic training.

Given these complexities, our review aims to provide an examination of sex‐specific characteristics in hemodynamic adaptation, autonomic and neurological reflexes, cardiac diagnostics, cardiac remodeling, and sport‐related cardiac pathologies. We also elucidate the mechanisms underlying these differences and identify critical gaps in the current knowledge that warrant further investigation. Addressing these gaps will foster a more equitable approach to cardiovascular health in athletes, ultimately enhancing performance and reducing the risk of adverse cardiac events.

### Exercise and cardiovascular health: a state-of-the-art review [^ad72abd9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, and low levels of physical activity (PA) is a leading independent predictor of poor CV health and associated with an increased prevalence of risk factors that predispose to CVD development. In this review, we evaluate the benefits of exercise on CV health. We discuss the CV adaptations to exercise, focusing on the physiological changes in the heart and vasculature. We review the impact and benefits of exercise on specific CV prevention, including type II diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, in addition to CVD-related and all-cause mortality. Lastly, we evaluate the current PA guidelines and various modes of exercise, assessing the current literature for the effective regimens of PA that improve CVD outcomes.

### Haemodynamic compensations for exercise tissue oxygenation in early stages of COPD: an integrated cardiorespiratory assessment study [^00fe5b98]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular comorbidities are increasingly being recognised in early stages of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) yet complete cardiorespiratory functional assessments of individuals with mild COPD or presenting with COPD risk factors are lacking. This paper reports on the effectiveness of the cardiocirculatory-limb muscles oxygen delivery and utilisation axis in smokers exhibiting no, or mild to moderate degrees of airflow obstruction using standardised cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

Methods

Post-bronchodilator spirometry was used to classify participants as 'ever smokers without' (n = 88), with 'mild' (n = 63) or 'mild-moderate' COPD (n = 56). All underwent CPET with continuous concurrent monitoring of oxygen uptake (V'O 2) and of bioimpedance cardiac output (Qc) enabling computation of arteriovenous differences (a-vO 2). Mean values of Qc and a-vO 2 were mapped across set ranges of V'O 2 and Qc isolines to allow for meaningful group comparisons, at same metabolic and circulatory requirements.

Results

Peak exercise capacity was significantly reduced in the 'mild-moderate COPD' as compared with the two other groups who showed similar pulmonary function and exercise capacity. Self-reported cardiovascular and skeletal muscle comorbidities were not different between groups, yet disease impact and exercise intolerance scores were three times higher in the 'mild-moderate COPD' compared with the other groups. Mapping of exercise Qc and a-vO 2 also showed a leftward shift of values in this group, indicative of a deficit in peripheral O 2 extraction even for submaximal exercise demands. Concurrent with lung hyperinflation, a distinctive blunting of exercise stroke volume expansion was also observed in this group.

Conclusion

Contrary to the traditional view that cardiovascular complications were the hallmark of advanced disease, this study of early COPD spectrum showed a reduced exercise O 2 delivery and utilisation in individuals meeting spirometry criteria for stage II COPD. These findings reinforce the preventive clinical management approach to preserve peripheral muscle circulatory and oxidative capacities.

### Role of exercise in the prevention of cardiovascular disease: results, mechanisms, and new perspectives [^3dd06381]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

On an empirical basis, exercise has been regarded as a fundamental pre-requisite for human well-being and physical integrity since classical times. Only in the last decades, however, scientific evidence has accumulated proving its role in the prevention and treatment of multiple chronic diseases beyond any reasonable doubt. Few treatment strategies in medicine have been tested so rigorously in large cohorts of patients as regular physical exercise. With the advent of molecular biology, the underlying mechanisms, such as NO bioavailability and mobilization of progenitor cells, could be identified. This enhances our understanding of this therapeutic tool. Unfortunately, the low compliance rate of the patients is the major drawback of the intervention exercise training (ET). The objective of this manuscript is to summarize the current knowledge with respect to ET on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the molecular changes elicited by ET. Finally, we will critically assess reasons why ET as therapeutic option is not as effective at the population level in preventing CVD and what we may change in the future to make ET the most effective intervention to fight the development of CVD.

### Clinical implications for exercise at altitude among individuals with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^c595e990]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Altitude Exposure Among Individuals With CAD

In healthy individuals, altitude exposure causes coronary arterial vasodilatation and increased coronary blood flow. However, atherosclerosis may precipitate paradoxical vasoconstriction of coronary vessels in response to exercise and hypoxia. Furthermore, myocardial oxygen demand increases, even under resting conditions, because of sympathetically mediated increases in HR and BP. Coronary vasoconstriction, combined with altitude‐dependent decreased oxygen carrying capacity and increased myocardial oxygen demand, underlie the increased tendency for ischemia at altitude. Patients with CAD and angina should anticipate that hypoxia will exacerbate anginal symptoms. Increases in cardiac work stimulated by altitude can produce new ischemic symptoms in patients with CAD at sea level. Simulated altitude (eg, the Levy test, which exposes patients to hypoxic conditions [0.10 fraction of inspired oxygen] simulating an altitude of 5486 m) at rest can unmask ischemia and has been used as an electrocardiographic stress test. The Tenth Mountain Division Study found that the double‐product required to induce 1 mm of ST depression at 2500 m was 5% lower than at sea level. Notably, this reduction in ischemic threshold was attenuated after 5 days of acclimatization, which emphasizes the importance of acclimatization before exercise.

Patients with CAD who are asymptomatic at sea level can generally tolerate exercise at moderate altitudes without new ischemia or arrhythmias. In a study of patients who recently underwent revascularization after ACS, there was no evidence of ischemia during exercise after a rapid ascent from 540 to 3454 m. In another study of patients with CAD and HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction 39% ± 6%), no ischemia was induced when patients ascended from 1000 to 2500 m and exercised after 2 days of acclimatization. Several studies have examined patients after revascularization at several time points (6 weeks to 18 months; average, 12 ± 4 months) and altitudes ranging from 2500 to 3454 m. These studies suggest that patients who are > 6 months removed from revascularization do not encounter new ischemia, coronary events, or stent complications at altitude.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^2bce3d4b]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aerobic physical activity dosage for adults — minimum amounts and accumulation patterns to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — is specified with weekly time targets and options for shorter bouts. All adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to lower ASCVD risk. Shorter durations of exercise seem to be as beneficial as longer ones (e.g., ≥ 10-minute bouts) and additional reduction in ASCVD risk is seen with higher amounts (> 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity). There is likely no lower limit on the quantity of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at which benefits start to accrue, and sedentary individuals starting an exercise program should initiate exercise at a lower intensity and duration and progress gradually to recommended levels.

### Importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice: a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b31c9303]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) adaptations to endurance exercise — habitual endurance-type exercise produces biological changes that increase peak/maximal CRF, primarily via increased stroke volume and decreased venous oxygen content from greater O2 extraction in trained muscle; CRF can be increased in most people by regularly performing rhythmic contractions of large muscle groups continuously for an extended period at moderate or vigorous intensity, or with recovery breaks at lower intensity if the exercise approaches maximal effort.

### Moderate physical activity in healthy adults is associated with cardiac remodeling [^cecd7f11]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In adults with no known comorbidities of cardiovascular disease and no genetic variants associated with cardiomyopathy, increasing physical activity is an independent predictor of elevated biventricular volumes and LV mass. The effect of activity on cardiac structure is greater than that of systolic BP and similar to that of age. Unless the hours of regular physical activity per week are considered during CMR evaluation of the heart, there is a risk of overdiagnosing cardiac dilatation or hypertrophy in a proportion of active healthy adults.

Regular physical exercise is strongly associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality even when comparing moderate activity to a sedentary lifestyle. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this, including a decrease in myocardial oxygen demand, improved myocardial perfusion, and fewer cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physiological adaptations of the heart to exercise are mediated by structural, autonomic, and metabolic mechanisms, which increase cardiac output, and physical activity is associated with higher end-diastolic volumes and lower resting HR. In our population, we also found that LV mass and biventricular indexed volumes were positively associated with activity level, although the difference between sedentary and light physical activity groups was not significant. We observed that the RV may be particularly sensitive to training, and previous studies have shown incomplete recovery of the RV after exercise and chronic remodeling resistant to detraining. At least moderate exercise was associated with an increase in SV and a decrease in HR — resulting in no net change to resting CI. A modest decrease in biventricular EF was observed at the highest activity level, a finding shared with competitive athletes. The relationship between cardiac adaptation and exercise persisted after correction for age, sex, ethnicity, and systolic BP. Lean mass is a strong predictor of LV mass and volume, and exercise may facilitate body fat loss, as well as increasing fat-free mass. However, we observed that the relationship between activity and cardiac structure was independent of body composition.

### Dose response of incidental physical activity against cardiovascular events and mortality [^b8944a33]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Most clinical and public health guidelines have traditionally been developed with evidence on the cardioprotective properties of structured exercise. For example, the majority of the evidence in the 2020 Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) was derived from self-reported measures that primarily captured leisure-time exercise. Regular structured (leisure time) exercise may not be appealing or is inaccessible to many adults, and participation rates are typically low. In the United Kingdom, for example, just 2 in 5 middle-aged adults engage in exercise (including sports) at least once per month, and dropout rates in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs are often extreme (eg, 56% to 82%). Incidental physical activity (IPA), defined as nonexercise activities that are done as part of daily living (eg, transportation, work, housework, or other domestic activities) may have feasibility advantages for primary and secondary CVD prevention because it overcomes several barriers to structured exercise: namely, lack of time and motivation, costs, poor access to facilities, and low confidence in exercise capacity or skills. Currently, the limited IPA research available is based exclusively on self-reports of different physical activity domains, a methodology that is particularly susceptible to imprecision because of the inherent inability of recall questionnaires to capture any unplanned activities, including IPA.

### Impact of sex on cardiovascular adaptations to exercise: JACC review topic of the week [^88f4bf67]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Routine exercise leads to cardiovascular adaptations that differ based on sex. Use of cardiac testing to screen athletes has driven research to define how these sex-based adaptations manifest on the electrocardiogram and cardiac imaging. Importantly, sex-based differences in cardiovascular structure and outcomes in athletes often parallel findings in the general population, underscoring the importance of understanding their mechanisms. Substantial gaps exist in the understanding of why cardiovascular adaptations and outcomes related to exercise differ by sex because of underrepresentation of female participants in research. As female sports participation rates have increased dramatically over several decades, it also remains unknown if differences observed in older athletes reflect biological mechanisms vs less lifetime access to sports in females. In this review, we will assess the effect of sex on cardiovascular adaptations and outcomes related to exercise, identify the impact of sex hormones on exercise performance, and highlight key areas for future research.

### Exercise-induced cardiac troponin elevations: from underlying mechanisms to clinical relevance [^d69a9c5e]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

cTn elevations may indicate demand ischemia, so several studies have explored the association between the magnitude of exercise-induced cTn increases and significant CAD, but the results are inconsistent. – Several studies have found no increase in cTn after a short-duration (< 15 minutes) clinical exercise test in individuals with CAD. Other studies have reported significant cTn increases after clinical exercise or dobutamine stress tests. A recent meta-analysis including studies published between 2008 and 2016 found only minor increases in cTn concentrations after clinical exercise stress tests, with no difference in exercise-induced elevations of cTn concentrations between patients with inducible and noninducible ischemia (cTnT: 0.5 [0–0.9] ng/L versus 1.1 [0–2.2] ng/L, P = 0.29; cTnI: 2.4 [0.2–4.7] ng/L versus 1.8 [0.6–3.0] ng/L, P = 0.61). Similar findings were reported for pharmacological stress testing. Overall, these findings may be attributable to (1) exercise intensity or duration at the ischemia threshold being insufficient to produce cTn elevations sufficient to discriminate between those with and without severe CAD or myocardial ischemia; (2) cTn concentrations being measured too early after exercise and missing the cTn peak (Figure 3 A); or (3) the lack of an association between myocardial ischemia and exercise-induced cTn elevations.

### Confluence of depression and acute psychological stress among patients with stable coronary heart disease: effects on myocardial perfusion [^4a0a1bfe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Depression and Vascular Function

To understand the pathophysiological processes by which depression influences coronary vascular performance during acute psychological stress, it is essential to recognize the dynamic nature of the observed impairment in myocardial perfusion. Specifically in the current study, there were no depression‐related differences — or differences between those with and without impairment in myocardial perfusion during acute psychological stress — in the prior occurrence of ACS, in prior revascularization, or in the severity of myocardial perfusion impairment with exercise or pharmacologic stress. Thus, differences in coronary anatomy are not likely to account for the main finding. Furthermore, the increase in myocardial oxygen demand during the acute psychological stress, as reflected by increases in heart rate and blood pressure, similarly showed no difference, and indeed, was lower than the increase in demand that typically occurs during exercise‐provoked impairment in perfusion. Rather, these data point to a likely dynamic coronary obstruction,– whereby some aspect of underlying vulnerability in the coronary vasomotor response to psychological stress is specifically revealed among CHD patients as a function of depression.

### Physiology of angina and its alleviation with nitroglycerin: insights from invasive catheter laboratory measurements during exercise [^97acc933]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study has shown that a catheterization laboratory exercise protocol provides a paradigm with which the physiology of ischemia and the performance of antianginals can be studied. In patients with exercise-induced angina, administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in both the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to alleviate ischemia.

The main findings of the study are that (1) nitroglycerin causes significant reduction in afterload, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand; (2) exercise causes reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection, which is not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin; (3) exercise causes vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments, increasing relative stenosis severity; (4) nitroglycerin has the effect of vasodilating stenosed segments, thereby reducing relative stenosis severity; and (5) administration of nitroglycerin during exercise-induced ischemia maintains coronary pressure and increases coronary flow, despite a significant reduction in systemic pressure and afterload.

Myocardial Oxygen Consumption

Our findings suggest that nitroglycerin reduces oxygen consumption by attenuating myocardial work with a reduction in rate-pressure product and TTI. Another major determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption is LV afterload, determined by aortic pressure and the effects of arterial wave reflection. Our results show that there is indeed a significant reduction in arterial pressure augmentation with exercise and further reduction with nitroglycerin, suggesting that both contribute to reductions in afterload by affecting the peripheral arterial circulation.

### Effects of exercise mode on improving cardiovascular function and cardiorespiratory fitness after bariatric surgery: a narrative review [^ecfc65e4]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Obesity affects 600 million people globally and increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Bariatric surgery is an increasingly popular therapeutic intervention for morbid obesity to induce rapid weight loss and reduce obesity-related comorbidities. However, some bariatric surgery patients, after what is considered a successful surgical procedure, continue to manifest obesity-related health issues, including weight gain, reduced physical function, persistent elevations in blood pressure, and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of mortality and several health outcomes and could be improved by an appropriate exercise prescription after bariatric surgery. This review provides a broad overview of exercise training for patients after bariatric surgery and discusses cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential physiological adaptations in response to exercise training.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^455a6594]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Blood flow, oxygen delivery, and extraction — COPD limb muscle fatigue: During strenuous exercise, peripheral vasoconstriction related to the high demand for respiratory muscle blood flow appears to compromise limb muscle perfusion and consequently enhance muscle fatigue, and in COPD a redistribution of blood flow toward respiratory muscles may occur with strategies that reduce respiratory muscle work hypothesized to alleviate limb muscle fatigue by restoring limb blood flow. Reduced muscle capillarity could limit blood and oxygen delivery and increase susceptibility to muscle fatigue, with reduced capillarity observed in patients with COPD who developed quadriceps fatigue after cycling exercise; exercise training improved capillarity in COPD, suggesting augmenting capillarity may offer a route to reduce fatigability. Enhanced muscle fatigability can also occur when left ventricular function is compromised and this may be relevant in subsets of patients with COPD, including those with cardiac comorbidities and pulmonary hypertension, in whom altered cardiac output and oxygen delivery have been reported.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on the care of the athlete and athletic person with diabetes [^a0e5d392]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pre-exercise screening in diabetes — recent literature has shown that the risk of cardiac events, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia is low and that the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for most individuals with diabetes, and screening of individuals without symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) undergoing low-to moderate-intensity exercise has not been shown to reduce the risk of cardiac events. The American Diabetic Association guidelines state that pre-exercise medical clearance is not necessary for asymptomatic individuals who are receiving diabetes care consistent with the current guidelines who wish to begin a low or moderate-intensity physical activity that does not exceed the demands of brisk walking or everyday living. The American College of Sports Medicine guidelines state that physically inactive individuals with known metabolic disorders or those with signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, or metabolic diseases should seek medical clearance before starting any exercise program, regardless of the intensity. When screening is performed, evaluation often includes electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing at the discretion of the clinician, and although the risk stratification in this group is more complex, the workup should be the same as in any individual with symptoms of CVD. Indications for pre-exercise screening include patients with symptoms of CVD, regardless of exercise-intensity level.

### State of shock: contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^1f1e39f3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Myocardial Oxygen Consumption

Although the overarching purpose of vasopressors and inotropes in CS is to improve tissue oxygen delivery, these agents also increase myocardial oxygen demand, which in the setting of a cardiomyocyte oxygen supply–demand mismatch can cause further injury and contractile dysfunction. The energetic requirements of the myocardium is primarily met through oxidative metabolic pathways with < 5% of ATP derived from glycolytic pathways. Basal metabolic requirements account for 10% to 20% of the total myocardial oxygen requirements, with the remaining oxygen needs determined by variables that include heart rate, contractility, and systolic wall tension. The relative contribution of these variables has been characterized through human and animal models, primarily using exercise to induce increased cardiac work. From these studies, heart rate has been shown to be the greatest contributor to myocardial oxygen consumption. Through augmentation with pacing, it was found that 30% to 40% of the heart's metabolic needs were secondary to heart rate variation. However, this is likely an underestimate of the true impact of heart rate, due to pacing mediated reductions in end‐diastolic and stroke volumes, with some estimates of heart rate variation accounting for up to 50% to 70% of myocardial oxygen demand. The contribution of contractility has been elegantly assessed through several animal and human studies, showing that increased myocardial contractility under physiological stress (exercise) accounts for 15% to 25% of the oxygen demand. In addition to factors that influence myocardial oxygen requirements, supply is principally governed by the coronary perfusion pressure gradient, perfusion time (which occurs predominantly during diastole and is reduced with increased heart rate), and coronary artery vasomotor tone. Therefore, the interplay between hemodynamic supports, cardiac filling pressures, heart rate variation, and coronary vasomotor tone has the potential to adversely influence myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch in the setting of CS.

### Fetal and infant growth and the cardiovascular stress response in adolescence: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging study in a pediatric population-based cohort [^7f401e27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Most studies concerning cardiovascular outcomes in children are performed at rest. To reveal subtle functional cardiovascular adaptations not apparent at rest, cardiovascular exercise tests may be used to induce cardiovascular stress. Physical exercise is a stress situation for the cardiovascular system. To maintain an adequate perfusion of the body and to match the higher oxygen demands of the body, the cardiovascular system needs to adapt adequately. This is reflected by increased heart rate, blood pressure, and heart contractility, which result in increasing left ventricular volumes. Impaired cardiovascular responses to exercise are associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular events, diseases, and cardiac death in adults, and suboptimal cardiovascular health in children. Little is known about the cardiovascular stress response in children born with altered fetal or postnatal growth. One study of 80 young adults in Zimbabwe aged 20 years showed that children born with low birth weight had a higher risk of exercise‐induced hypertension compared with controls.

We hypothesized that, during exercise, children with altered fetal growth or rapid weight gain in early postnatal life have a suboptimal response to exercise, reflected by an altered cardiac response to exercise, higher heart rate, and higher blood pressure due to cardiovascular developmental adaptations, as compared with children born with adequate fetal growth and early infant growth. Therefore, we examined the associations of fetal and infant growth with the cardiovascular stress response induced by exercise in adolescence among a subgroup of 207 children participating in a population‐based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onwards. We performed an isometric handgrip exercise combined with detailed measurements of the cardiovascular system using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) measurements and continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure.

### Control of oxygen uptake during exercise [^2bf1a373]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

Other than during sleep and contrived laboratory testing protocols, humans rarely exist in prolonged metabolic steady states; rather, they transition among different metabolic rates (V O2). The dynamic transition of V O2 (V O2 kinetics), initiated, for example, at exercise onset, provides a unique window into understanding metabolic control. This brief review presents the state-of-the art regarding control of V O2 kinetics within the context of a simple model that helps explain the work rate dependence of V O2 kinetics as well as the effects of environmental perturbations and disease. Insights emerging from application of novel approaches and technologies are integrated into established concepts to assess in what circumstances O2 supply might exert a commanding role over V O2 kinetics, and where it probably does not. The common presumption that capillary blood flow dynamics can be extrapolated accurately from upstream arterial measurements is challenged. From this challenge, new complexities emerge with respect to the relationships between O2 supply and flux across the capillary-myocyte interface and the marked dependence of these processes on muscle fiber type. Indeed, because of interfiber type differences in O2 supply relative to V O2, the presence of much lower O2 levels in the microcirculation supplying fast-twitch muscle fibers, and the demonstrated metabolic sensitivity of muscle to O2, it is possible that fiber type recruitment profiles (and changes thereof) might help explain the slowing of V O2 kinetics at higher work rates and in chronic diseases such as heart failure and diabetes.

### Measurement of oxygen consumption on-kinetics during exercise: implications for patients with heart failure [^e37f948c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Oxygen consumption (VO(2)) on-kinetics describes the rate change in oxygen uptake at the initiation of exercise. Several mathematical and graphical methods are used to assess VO(2) on-kinetics during constant-load or progressive exercise. VO(2) on-kinetics is prolonged in patients with heart failure (HF) compared with individuals who have normal cardiopulmonary function. Cardiac function has been implicated as one of the controlling mechanism for this observation. The contribution that pulmonary, vascular, and skeletal muscle function makes to delayed VO(2) on-kinetics in HF has yet to be determined. VO(2) on-kinetics also appears to have clinical value in HF, although evidence supporting this claim is limited. Questions about the controlling mechanism(s) and practical application of VO(2) on-kinetics in HF therefore remain unanswered. This report provides an overview of VO(2) on-kinetics assessment techniques, reviews research pertaining to the HF population, and provides direction for future investigations.

4.1 Exercise training‐induced benefits

Both exercising groups showed similar and significant improvements in V̇O 2peak (~9%–12%), indicating the effectiveness of the training intervention. Although no additional verification tests were conducted, the increase in O 2 pulse (improved V̇O 2peak without changes in HR peak) suggests true physiological adaptations rather than increased effort or test familiarity. This improvement is clinically significant, as higher V̇O 2peak is strongly associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events and all‐cause mortality. The magnitude and pattern of V̇O 2peak gains align with previous short‐term aerobic and concurrent training studies in individuals with uncomplicated T2D (see Introduction). These exercise‐induced improvements in V̇O 2peak have been linked to both peripheral and central adaptations. Peripheral adaptations likely include enhanced microvascular oxygen delivery, vascular function improvements, vascular structural changesand increased capillary‐to‐myocyte interfacepossibly via increased red blood cell‐flowing capillaries in muscle. Central adaptations primarily involve increased left ventricular stroke volume.

Similarly, both exercise groups showed significant improvements in V̇O 2 kinetics, with a ~17%–20% reduction in τV̇O 2p during moderate‐intensity exercise. These changes align with findings from previous exercise training studies of similar duration in uncomplicated T2D (see introduction). Although not directly demonstrated in T2D, training‐induced changes in τV̇O 2p in clinical conditions such as heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are likely driven by the rate at which oxygen is delivered to and/or utilised by the contracting muscles. In the present study, we evaluated the influence of cardiovascular dynamics (systemic O 2 delivery) by expressing the early changes (30 s) of cardiovascular variables relative to later (240 s) responses. Consistent with recent findings, the absence of any training‐related changes herein suggests that submaximal cardiovascular dynamics may remain unaffected by exercise training, but future work using techniques to measure CO with higher temporal resolution is needed. However, this does not preclude a likely upregulated nitric oxide synthase and other mechanisms for increasing more perfusion amidst increasing demands, as exercise training has been shown to enhance the local matching of oxygen delivery to muscle V̇O 2 in T2D. In addition, exercise training increases peak vasodilatory capacity in both, men and women with diabetes, and tends to improve dynamic vasodilatory responses in women with T2D.

### Exercise for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: JACC focus seminar 1 / 4 [^9551bf0c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Regular exercise that meets or exceeds the current physical activity guidelines is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Therefore, exercise training plays an important role in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. In this part 1 of a 4-part focus seminar series, we highlight the mechanisms and physiological adaptations responsible for the cardioprotective effects of exercise. This includes an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness secondary to cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle adaptations and an improvement in traditional and nontraditional CVD risk factors by exercise training. This extends to the role of exercise and its prescription in patients with CVDs (eg, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, or atrial fibrillation) with special focus on the optimal mode, dosage, duration, and intensity of exercise to reduce CVD risk and improve clinical outcomes in these patients.

### Physiological cardiac remodelling in response to endurance exercise training: cellular and molecular mechanisms [^cdd5b7fd]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Exercise training fosters the health and performance of the cardiovascular system, and represents nowadays a powerful tool for cardiovascular therapy. Exercise exerts its beneficial effects through reducing cardiovascular risk factors, and directly affecting the cellular and molecular remodelling of the heart. Traditionally, moderate endurance exercise training has been viewed to determine a balanced and revertible physiological growth, through cardiomyocyte hypertrophy accompanied by appropriate neoangiogenesis (the Athlete's Heart). These cellular adaptations are due to the activation of signalling pathways and in particular, the IGF-1/IGF-1R/Akt axis appears to have a major role. Recently, it has been shown that physical exercise determines cardiac growth also through new cardiomyocyte formation. Accordingly, burgeoning evidence indicates that exercise training activates circulating, as well as resident tissue-specific cardiac, stem/progenitor cells. Dissecting the mechanisms for stem/progenitor cell activation with exercise will be instrumental to devise new effective therapies, encompassing myocardial regeneration for a large spectrum of cardiovascular diseases.

### Exercise testing in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: an appraisal through diagnosis, pathophysiology and therapy – A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association and European association of preventive cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology [^9b2445c3].

Oxygen uptake kinetics and determinants

Physical performance and VO 2 kinetics are dependent on the integrated interaction between the following processes: (i) the O 2 content in inspired air; (ii) the exchange of O 2 and carbon dioxide (CO 2) through adequate alveolar ventilation (VA) and lung diffusion (DL); (iii) the O 2 delivery activity by cardiac reserve (CO), blood Hb and vascular system to supply oxygenated blood to meet the increased O 2 demand of working skeletal muscles; and (iv) the O 2 diffusion (DM) process from capillaries to cells and mitochondrial respiration capacity in skeletal muscle.

In HFpEF, the O 2 cascade can be limited at several levels and to a varied extent (Figure 2) as pointed out by many studies. In an innovative HFpEF study performed with invasive CPET, i.e. by expired gas analysis and arterial and mixed venous blood sampling with key parameters directly measured (VA and CO) and others estimated (DL and DM), the individual limiting factors in the O 2 cascade during peak exercise were systematically evaluated by a phenomapping approach. Intriguingly, the O 2 pathways causing exercise intolerance were ranked through a computational system analysis to gauge insights on the functional significance of each O 2 pathway defects, examining factors that influence the magnitude of the O 2 pathway defect and how this may impact on peak VO 2.

The organ systems and pathways (from air to mitochondria) involved in exercise performance are depicted along with the limiting steps and pathophysiology behind exercise limitation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). EOV, exercise oscillatory ventilation; LA, left atrial; RV, right ventricular.

The vast majority of patients harboured compound mechanisms of exercise intolerance, defined as two or more defective steps in the O 2 cascade, and a wide variability of putative mechanisms was observed. These data confirm the complexity of HFpEF as a heterogeneous entity at tissue, cellular and molecular level. A typical example of different defective pathways altering the O 2 chain of utilization are two subjects with the same CO increase, but distinct sets of accessory O 2 pathway defects with one showing a predominant impairment in alveolar diffusion and the other presenting with a reduced delivery of O 2 due to concomitant anaemia and/or insufficient O 2 extraction due to impaired mitochondrial oxidative capacity.

### Timing of physical activity and cardiovascular health: opportunities and challenges [^75568dbb]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The global prevalence of sedentary lifestyles and inadequate physical activity (PA) poses a significant threat to health care systems and population well-being. Encouraging individuals to adopt healthy lifestyles and engage in sufficient PA remains a pressing task for clinicians, researchers, and stakeholders. Meeting the current guidelines, which recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity PA, or an equivalent combination of both, could have a profound impact on disease prevention, population longevity, and overall quality of life.

The current PA guideline focuses primarily on the total amount of PA without fully considering the patterns of PA accumulation. This emphasis is rooted in the findings of epidemiological studies and short-term clinical trials, which have shown that PA volume, but not PA pattern, is the key predictor of health outcomes. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the manner in which PA is accumulated is also crucially linked to health, presenting new opportunities for precision medicine and individualized PA prescriptions.

A recent study conducted by Cominetti et al explored the relationship between PA timing and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through two distinct study designs. The cross-sectional component examined the association between PA timing and biomarkers, including blood pressure and lipids, while the cohort study investigated the relationship between PA timing and CVD incidence. The findings of this study revealed a 3-fold increase in CVD incidence among individuals whose PA peaked between 7and 12, compared to those whose PA peaked between 10and 2, suggesting a potential hazard associated with morning PA compared to PA occurring later in the day.

It is essential to acknowledge that some PA is better than none, and this principle remains true even if PA occurs in the morning. This is particularly relevant for individuals who can only engage in PA during morning hours due to time constraints. However, the question of whether the morning, particularly the early morning, is an unfavorable time for exercise in terms of cardiovascular health presents a clinically important consideration. Physiological studies have reported a morning surge in blood pressure and augmented sympathetic nerve activity, which may exacerbate the PA-induced stress on the cardiovascular system, potentially leading to a temporary increased susceptibility to adverse CVD events.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing [^af22205e]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractBecause symptoms of cardiopulmonary disease often occur with exertion, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has a unique role in the assessment of patient symptoms, disease severity, prognosis, and response to therapy. In addition to the evaluation of cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology, CPET provides an assessment of the interaction of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems with the musculoskeletal, nervous, and hematological systems. In this article, we review key CPET variables, protocols, and clinical indications.
