## Question

What causes missed menstruation in anorexia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes missed menstruation in anorexia nervosa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and diagnostic framing of missed menses in anorexia nervosa. Then, I should map the primary trigger, namely energy deficiency, and its endocrine signals such as leptin. Next, I will trace the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis disruption and downstream hormonal consequences. After that, I should correlate clinical severity markers and cofactors like exercise and stress. Finally, I will consider reversibility, treatment implications, bone health, and modern diagnostic context, making sure I verify each step with appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical term and classification. Missed menstruation in anorexia nervosa is amenorrhea, most often due to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, reflecting central suppression of the reproductive axis in the setting of energy deficit and stress-related cues, which is highly characteristic of anorexia nervosa and related restrictive states [^111nmhxs] [^1174uazh]. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: older descriptions sometimes anchored to the DSM-IV era criterion of at least three consecutive missed menstrual cycles in postmenarchal females with anorexia; that historical criterion appears in earlier literature, but hold on, I should correct that for current practice because DSM-5 removed amenorrhea as a diagnostic requirement, even though menstrual status remains clinically important in evaluation and monitoring [^116wJMCw] [^115DM3uL].

> I will now examine the primary trigger. The fundamental driver is chronic negative energy balance from starvation or marked caloric restriction, often compounded by increased energy expenditure and psychosocial stress; most endocrine changes are adaptive responses to conserve energy under starvation conditions, which is precisely the milieu in anorexia nervosa and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea [^112upNrG] [^113KopWY]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — while stress or exercise alone can precipitate FHA, in anorexia nervosa these factors typically overlap with weight-loss–related energy deficiency, so I need to ensure I emphasize the combined effect rather than a single cause [^111nmhxs] [^113KopWY].

> Next, I should review the adipose-derived signal leptin, because this is pivotal. Energy deficiency lowers fat mass and suppresses leptin, a key permissive signal of energy sufficiency to hypothalamic reproductive centers; there is evidence for a leptin threshold below which menstrual function is not sustained, even if BMI is only modestly low, highlighting that fat mass and leptin, not BMI alone, gate ovulatory function [^112upNrG] [^117Dtd7w]. Wait, let me verify consistency with clinical heterogeneity — some women with low weight maintain menses, plausibly due to relatively higher fat mass and leptin for their weight and maintained GnRH pulsatility, which fits with observations that higher leptin tracks with better outcomes during weight maintenance in anorexia nervosa [^111Ciwmp] [^113kXqug].

> I need to trace the central neuroendocrine disruption. Low leptin and starvation-related signals converge on the hypothalamus to reduce GnRH pulse frequency and amplitude, producing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; this is a hallmark of the hypothalamic component of FHA and is well-described in the endocrine phenotype of anorexia nervosa, where estradiol is low and cortisol tends to be elevated [^112upNrG] [^114u1MGk] [^115EQvgm]. Hold on, I should verify that this is a functional, reversible downregulation rather than primary ovarian failure — the pattern of low or inappropriately normal LH/FSH with low estradiol in the context of energy deficit supports a functional hypothalamic mechanism, not primary gonadal insufficiency [^111nmhxs].

> Let me consider the downstream consequences. With impaired GnRH pulsatility, pituitary secretion of LH and FSH falls, ovarian folliculogenesis falters, estradiol drops, anovulation ensues, and menstruation ceases; clinically this is amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea depending on the degree of HPG axis suppression and residual ovarian activity [^112upNrG] [^115EQvgm] [^1174uazh]. I should double-check that this mechanism aligns with FHA reversibility, which it does, distinguishing it from irreversible causes of amenorrhea such as primary ovarian insufficiency or chromosomal abnormalities [^111nmhxs] [^114u1MGk].

> Next, I should review clinical markers that correlate with severity. Even after partial weight restoration, amenorrhea is associated with lower body weight, percent ideal body weight, BMI, hypometabolism on indirect calorimetry, and lower fat mass; importantly, menses can be absent at "normal" BMI if relative energy availability and fat mass remain insufficient, underscoring that absolute BMI is not the only determinant [^111QN9NY] [^111sZrwe] [^112DytPz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I must not conflate statistical group differences with individual thresholds — fat distribution and individual leptin thresholds likely modulate menstrual function, so clinical targets should be individualized rather than fixed solely on BMI cutoffs [^117Dtd7w] [^111nmhxs].

> I will now examine contributing cofactors. Excessive exercise increases energy expenditure and can independently perturb GnRH pulsatility; psychosocial stress and hypercortisolemia further suppress reproductive axis activity, creating an additive inhibitory milieu in anorexia nervosa that perpetuates amenorrhea until the net energy deficit and stress load are reversed [^113KopWY] [^112upNrG]. But wait, what if exercise is modest? Even then, in the context of inadequate intake, the energy availability may still be too low for normal reproductive function, which mirrors the FHA patterns described in athletes, including the triad of low energy availability, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density [^113KopWY] [^115gsWpp].

> Let me consider the evolutionary-adaptive context. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa is best viewed as an adaptive, reversible downregulation to prevent energetically costly reproduction during starvation; with correction of the energy deficit, HPG axis activity resumes and fertility potential improves, reinforcing the functional nature of the shutdown [^114xyaik] [^111nmhxs]. Hold on, I should verify that "reversible" does not imply immediate — recovery of menses often lags and may require weight and fat mass gains beyond the weight at which menses were lost, reflecting hysteresis of the system and the need to surpass individual leptin and energy availability thresholds [^114xyaik] [^117Dtd7w].

> Now, I need to connect mechanism to management and confirm reversibility with treatment. The primary treatment goals are nutritional rehabilitation, weight and fat mass restoration, normalization of eating behaviors, and reduction of excessive exercise and stress; menses typically resume with sustained correction of the energy deficit, sometimes at a weight modestly higher than the weight at amenorrhea onset, and guidelines emphasize ED-focused psychotherapy and family-based approaches alongside multidisciplinary medical and dietary care [^114xyaik] [^115DM3uL] [^116VFkYL] [^112Gptgf]. I should confirm hormonal therapy nuances — combined oral contraceptives may mask the return of spontaneous menses and do not address bone loss if energy deficit persists, so counseling and cautious, individualized use are recommended rather than using OCs to "treat" the amenorrhea itself [^111nmhxs].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and the modern diagnostic context. Although amenorrhea is no longer required for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, menstrual status remains a valuable clinical barometer of energy sufficiency, a screening prompt for disordered eating in gynecologic settings, and a treatment target; persistent hypoestrogenism contributes to decreased bone mineral density and higher fracture risk, so weight restoration is foundational, while adjuvant strategies for bone health require expert discussion given uncertain benefits of estrogen preparations in this population [^115DM3uL] [^116WV9qf] [^114BJ9Jt] [^113uZeUN]. Hold on, I should verify initial evaluation elements — vital signs, anthropometrics, and signs of malnutrition should be systematically assessed at presentation to contextualize amenorrhea within overall medical risk and guide level of care decisions [^112cHDHJ] [^notfound].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the causal chain is explicit and evidence-linked. Missed menstruation in anorexia nervosa is driven by functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: chronic energy deficiency lowers leptin and related signals, suppressing hypothalamic GnRH pulsatility, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with low LH/FSH, low estradiol, anovulation, and amenorrhea; cofactors such as excessive exercise, stress, and hypercortisolemia amplify suppression, and the process is adaptive and reversible with nutritional rehabilitation and normalization of energy availability, which remains the cornerstone of treatment and of resuming menses [^112upNrG] [^111nmhxs] [^117Dtd7w].

Missed menstruation in anorexia nervosa results from **hypothalamic suppression** [^112upNrG] due to energy deficiency [^114xyaik], leading to low GnRH, LH/FSH, and estradiol. This causes **low estrogen** and amenorrhea [^112upNrG]; high cortisol [^115EQvgm] and low leptin/insulin [^117Dtd7w] further amplify the effect. Management centers on **weight restoration** and normalized eating [^112upNrG]; menses typically return at 90% of expected weight or at a BMI of 19–20 kg/m², though persistent amenorrhea after weight recovery is common and warrants ongoing monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of missed menstruation in anorexia nervosa

The primary mechanism is **hypothalamic suppression** of GnRH [^112upNrG] due to chronic energy deficiency [^114xyaik], which reduces LH/FSH and estradiol and causes amenorrhea. Key hormonal changes include:

- **Low GnRH**: Reduced pulsatility lowers LH/FSH and estradiol.
- **Low estradiol**: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism causes amenorrhea [^115EQvgm].
- **High cortisol**: Chronic stress further suppresses the HPO axis [^115EQvgm].
- **Low leptin/insulin**: Signals energy deficiency and suppresses reproduction [^112upNrG].
- **High ghrelin/PYY**: Reflects starvation and may contribute to suppression [^1151RFDd].

---

## Clinical implications and health risks

Missed menstruation in AN signals **hypoestrogenism** [^112upNrG] and significant health risks, notably low BMD with osteopenia/osteoporosis and increased fracture risk [^114BJ9Jt]. Additional concerns include dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction; anovulation and infertility; impaired cognition and mood; and anxiety, depression, and body image distress [^1174uazh].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical evaluation

Amenorrhea is no longer required for an AN diagnosis, yet **menstrual status remains clinically important** [^116jnhHs]. Evaluation should include:

- **History**: Menstrual, weight, eating, exercise, and psychosocial factors.
- **Exam**: Vital signs, BMI, and signs of malnutrition [^112cHDHJ].
- **Labs**: Pregnancy test, LH/FSH, estradiol, prolactin, TSH, cortisol, and metabolic panel.
- **Imaging**: Pelvic ultrasound if indicated.

---

## Treatment strategies and management approaches

Management prioritizes **weight restoration** and normalized eating:

- **Nutritional rehabilitation**: Gradual weight gain to 90% of expected weight or BMI 19–20 kg/m².
- **Psychotherapy**: CBT or family-based treatment to address eating behaviors and body image [^115DM3uL] [^116VFkYL].
- **Medical monitoring**: Regular assessment of weight, menses, and complications [^116rDjV3].
- **Hormonal therapy**: Consider transdermal estrogen for persistent amenorrhea after weight recovery.

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

Menses typically return within 6–12 months of weight restoration, but **persistent amenorrhea** occurs in 20–30% despite weight recovery. Factors delaying return include low body fat (< 22%), excessive physical activity, which suppresses the HPO axis [^115gsWpp], and psychological stress; anxiety and depression can prolong amenorrhea [^114xyaik].

---

## Long-term reproductive and psychological consequences

Persistent amenorrhea in AN has **long-term consequences**, including **reproductive issues** (infertility, pregnancy complications, and unplanned pregnancy risk) and **psychological effects** (anxiety, depression, and body image distress) [^1174uazh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **multidisciplinary care** involving medical, psychiatric, psychological, and nutritional clinicians [^116rDjV3]. Plans should be individualized with tailored weight goals and monitoring [^111m3XTw] [^112Gptgf]; hormonal therapy may be considered for persistent amenorrhea after weight recovery [^111tFwJc].

---

Missed menstruation in AN reflects **hypothalamic suppression** due to energy deficiency and carries significant health risks. Management prioritizes **weight restoration** and normalized eating, with persistent amenorrhea requiring ongoing monitoring and possible hormonal therapy [^111nmhxs].

### The endocrine manifestations of anorexia nervosa: mechanisms and management [^112upNrG]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder characterized by altered body image, persistent food restriction, and low body weight. It is associated with global endocrine dysregulation in both adolescent girls and women. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis includes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with relative oestrogen as well as androgen deficiency, growth hormone resistance, hypercortisolaemia, non-thyroidal illness syndrome, hyponatraemia, and hypooxytocinaemia. Serum levels of leptin, an anorexigenic adipokine, are suppressed, and levels of ghrelin, an orexigenic gut peptide, are elevated in women with anorexia nervosa; however, levels of peptide YY, an anorexigenic gut peptide, are paradoxically elevated. Although most, but not all, of these endocrine disturbances are adaptive to the low energy state of chronic starvation and reverse with treatment of the eating disorder, many contribute to impaired skeletal integrity and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Although 5–15% of patients with anorexia nervosa are men, only limited data exist regarding the endocrine impact of the disease in adolescent boys and men. Further research is needed to understand the endocrine determinants of bone loss and neuropsychiatric comorbidities in anorexia nervosa in both women and men, as well as to formulate optimal treatment strategies.

### Differences of cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding index with SPECT in subtypes of anorexia nervosa: Relationship with personality traits [^113kgnaW]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2007). Low credibility.

Using single photon emission computed tomography and the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, 123I-5-I-R91150, we explored differences in the 5-HT2A binding index in anorexia nervosa patients with and without bulimic features. We also searched for associations between temperament dimensions and cortical 5-HT2A binding.

About nine restrictive and seven bulimic anorexia nervosa patients were examined, and cortical 123I-5-I-R91150 binding index values were compared between the two subgroups. Open explorative correlation analysis was used to examine any relationships between binding index values and temperament scores, as assessed with the Temperament and Character Inventory.

The 5-HT2A binding index was significantly reduced in the parietal cortex in bulimic anorexia nervosa patients in comparison with restrictive anorectics. Further, a positive correlation was documented between reward dependence and parietal 5-HT2A binding index across patients in the two subgroups.

Restrictive anorexia nervosa patients differ from binging/purging anorexia nervosa patients based on a reduced parietal 5-HT2A binding index in the latter. We speculate that the finding of a positive correlation between parietal 5-HT2A binding and reward dependence might reflect an association between these two variables, at least in anorexia nervosa patients.

### Few differences in psychiatric comorbidities and treatment response among people with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa [^113BG99J]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, research supports the importance of exploring trauma, childhood abuse, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and psychiatric comorbidity in predicting treatment outcomes for individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Some of these factors have been identified as important predictors of low body weight, mortality, eating pathology, amenorrhea, and limited psychosocial functioning for both adolescents and adults with AN in higher levels of care, as well as across transdiagnostic eating disorder (ED) samples.

Experiences of suicidal thoughts and behaviors have been associated with worse treatment outcomes for adolescents and adults with AN in inpatient levels of care. Furthermore, childhood abuse has been associated with premature treatment termination in an adult sample of individuals with AN admitted to inpatient care. Relatedly, lifetime trauma has been associated with premature treatment termination in a transdiagnostic sample of adult ED partial hospitalization program (PHP) patients. In some circumstances, however, these factors have driven increased motivation for change in treatment.

For example, in one sample of adolescents and adults with EDs attending an ED PHP, comorbid depression moderated treatment outcomes, such that greater levels of depression were associated with greater improvement over the course of treatment. However, despite the role of trauma, abuse, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and psychiatric comorbidity in predicting both positive and negative treatment outcomes, no studies to our knowledge have investigated whether these clinical characteristics differential.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^113X6tnU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Analyzing discrepant cases involves examining the categorization discrepancies across different methods. Given the dramatic decreases in cases, we further explored the consistency across methods. Only 32% of women categorized as premenopausal using the PEQ item were also categorized as premenopausal in case analyses. Similarly, a low percentage (26%) was categorized as perimenopausal with both methods. In contrast, 77% of cases were consistently categorized as postmenopausal across both methods.

We focused on women who were categorized differently across methods, particularly those who changed categories (e.g. from premenopausal using the PEQ item to perimenopausal during case analysis) or whose questionnaire data were insufficient for accurate stage categorization. In response, we established an "Unclear" category for cases where information was inadequate due to incomplete PEQ data or confounding factors such as surgeries (e.g. endometrial ablation), contraceptive use (e.g. oral contraceptives, IUDs), and other conditions (e.g. medical conditions, medication use).

Importantly, all discrepant cases were re-categorized as Unclear. None were re-categorized into a different menopausal stage. Many women were placed in the Unclear group due to insufficient information from the PEQ, as detailed in Table 2, which covers missing data from skipped questions about missed periods, cycle length, and hormonal contraceptive use, or due to contradictory information.

### The relationship between moderate to vigorous physical activity and cognitive rigidity in anorexia nervosa [^113uLxxd]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

A drive for physical activity despite being underweight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. This pilot study aims to detect which aspect of physical activity, if any, could be related to cognitive rigidity in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Twenty-eight outpatients with anorexia nervosa and 24 healthy participants were assessed for cognitive flexibility using the Trail Making Test (TMT) and for multiple dimensions of physical activity through subjective and objective assessments. Correlation analysis was conducted to untangle the relationship between cognitive rigidity and the different aspects of physical activity. Furthermore, the moderating effect of anorexia nervosa on this relationship was assessed. A principal component analysis was performed to incorporate all variables of physical activity into global factor(s) reflecting its multidimensional nature.

Cognitive rigidity (TMT B - A score) was significantly correlated with the amount of objectively assessed physical activity, but only in the sample of patients with anorexia nervosa. The principal component analysis confirms the correlation between a single construct of "physical activity" and cognitive rigidity in anorexia nervosa only. This pilot study suggests a relationship between cognitive rigidity and physical activity, which could help explain the persistence of physical activity despite ongoing malnutrition in patients with anorexia nervosa.

### Effects of vitamin D and estrogen receptor polymorphisms on bone mineral density in adolescents with anorexia nervosa [^116p3gSb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and a greater lifetime risk for fractures. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between BMD and genetic polymorphisms in individuals with AN. This case-control study analyzed vitamin D receptor (VDR) (VDRBsml, VDRFokI) and estrogen receptor (ESR) (ESR1Xbal, ESR1Pvull) polymorphisms in 45 adolescents diagnosed with AN and 46 age-matched healthy controls. BMD values of the AN group were classified as low or normal, and polymorphisms were compared between cases and controls. The effects of body mass index (BMI), duration of disease, and amenorrhea on BMD were also evaluated.

- **Results**: In girls with AN, a positive effect of the bb genotype of VDRBsmI polymorphism on femur Z-scores (p = 0.103) and of the Ff genotype of VDRFokI polymorphism on vertebra Z-scores (p = 0.097) was observed. In boys with AN, a positive effect of the Ff genotype of VDRFokI polymorphism on vertebra BMD (g/cm²) was detected (p = 0.061). No association was detected between ESR polymorphisms. An inverse relationship was observed between BMD and duration of illness and amenorrhea. A direct relationship was detected between BMD and BMI.

- **Conclusions**: Specific VDR gene polymorphism genotypes may have positive effects on BMD in patients with AN. Additionally, the lack of association between ESR gene polymorphisms and BMD could be attributed to the low estrogen status of the patient.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^115UD1VS]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

As a check on initial classifications, we examined responses to items querying the number of skipped periods in the last 3–4 months. We unexpectedly discovered that women who self-identified as premenopausal sometimes endorsed missing multiple periods, and women who self-identified as perimenopausal and postmenopausal sometimes indicated no missed periods. This was our first indication that women's self-categorization of menopausal stage, even when providing stage definitions, may be inaccurate in some cases.

Unfortunately, the Perimenopause Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) does not generate composite scores to quickly stage women, other than the self-identification item. Rather, it gathers responses that can be examined on a case-by-case basis to help with menopausal staging. We thus examined PEQ responses for all 207 women about missed periods, length of periods, dates of the last three menstrual periods, surgeries, medications, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), and use of hormonal contraceptives or IUDs.

We applied STRAW+10 criteria on a case-by-case basis, focusing on no missed periods for premenopausal women, two consecutively missed periods or periods characterized by a change of ≥ 7 days for two consecutive months for perimenopause, and no periods for ≥ 1 year for postmenopause. Because women were only asked about the last 3–4 months, these criteria could only be assessed for this timeframe.

### The outcome of anorexia nervosa in the 20th century [^111nXxHc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The present review addresses the outcome of anorexia nervosa and examines whether it changed over the second half of the 20th century. A total of 119 study series, covering 5,590 patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and published in the English and German literature, were analyzed concerning mortality, global outcomes, and other psychiatric disorders at follow-up.

There were large variations in outcome parameters across the studies. Mortality, estimated based on both crude and standardized rates, was significantly high. Among the surviving patients, less than half recovered on average, whereas one-third improved, and 20% remained chronically ill. The normalization of core symptoms, involving weight, menstruation, and eating behaviors, was slightly better when each symptom was analyzed in isolation. The presence of other psychiatric disorders at follow-up was very common. A longer duration of follow-up and, less strongly, a younger age at onset of illness were associated with a better outcome. There was no convincing evidence that the outcome of anorexia nervosa improved over the second half of the last century. Several prognostic features were isolated, but there is conflicting evidence. Most clearly, vomiting, bulimia, purgative abuse, chronicity of illness, and obsessive-compulsive personality symptoms are unfavorable prognostic features.

In conclusion, anorexia nervosa did not lose its relatively poor prognosis in the 20th century. Advances in etiology and treatment may improve the course of patients with anorexia nervosa in the future.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^116QKQAD]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

In terms of this effort, we learned the hard way that accurate staging is very difficult with questionnaires only — even when you provide definitions and supplemental questions about cycles and reproductive histories. There are simply too many factors that impact menstrual cycles, and reproductive histories are so individualized that it is difficult to provide enough detailed instructions or items to ensure that responses accurately reflect menstruation and menopausal status. The best, and likely most efficient, approach is to interview women to ensure that you capture all contextual factors and information necessary to accurately stage each woman. This approach also ensures the inclusion of women with complicated histories that are not sufficiently probed by survey questions. Ironically, these are the women who may be most sensitive to the effects of perimenopause and changing ovarian hormones on the risk for psychiatric disorders, and who should be prioritized in research.

We have started conducting phone screens in our new population-based study examining perimenopausal risk for eating disorders and psychosis in 750+ women during midlife. The time invested in these phone screens has been much less than the time we spent doing individual case analyses in our pilot project. Based on this experience, we offer key suggestions and considerations below for information to include in screening materials. We hope our suggestions will help others avoid the pitfalls we encountered in our pilot work — pitfalls that were significant learning experiences.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^113zJ8hd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

We begin our phone screens by asking women to self-identify their menopausal stage after providing the definition of each phase, as this helps us understand each woman's frame of reference at the start of the interview. We also ask women their rationale for identifying with a particular menopausal stage. This question has been very useful, as some women have simply indicated "I'm at that age" while others have disclosed that their doctor has performed blood tests to classify their menopausal stage. Our degree of confidence in self-identified stage varies significantly in these two cases, and knowing that blood tests were conducted allows us to further probe the results and use this information as corroborative data in staging determinations.

In general, we have found open-ended questions that include clarifying health information provide more relevant and accurate information than close-ended questions. For example, some women are not aware that their medications include estrogen and/or progesterone (even those on contraceptives). Explaining the purpose of medications often spurs women to mention medications that do contain these hormones. We then follow up with a list of potential medications/devices that affect menstrual cycles, in case the woman is unsure of the need to report them in the initial question. We also assess dates of past use, as this information is helpful for understanding changes in menstrual cycles.

### Patterns of menstrual disturbance in eating disorders [^115hGHTg]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

To describe menstrual disturbance in eating disorders (ED), we examined the menstrual history of 1,705 women. The study compared eating, weight, and psychopathological traits across different menstrual groups.

- **Results**: Menstrual dysfunction occurred across all eating disorder subtypes. Individuals with a normal menstrual history reported the highest lifetime body mass index (BMI), while those with primary amenorrhea reported the lowest. Groups with normal menstruation and oligomenorrhea showed greater binge eating, vomiting, and appetite suppressant use. Amenorrhea was linked with lower caloric intake and higher exercise levels. Traits such as harm avoidance, novelty seeking, perfectionism, and obsessionality varied among different menstrual status groups. There were no observed differences in comorbid Axis I and II disorders.

- **Conclusion**: Menstrual dysfunction is not confined to any specific eating disorder subtype. BMI, caloric intake, and exercise have strong associations with menstrual function. Menstrual status does not correlate with comorbidity. Menstrual irregularity is a feature associated with all eating disorders, rather than being exclusive to anorexia nervosa (AN).

### Stress and eating disorder behavior in anorexia nervosa as a function of menstrual cycle status [^112sJjtk]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Fluctuations in ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle and psychosocial stress contribute to eating disorder (ED) behavior.

Using ecological momentary assessment techniques, this study examined relationships between stress and binge eating, self-induced vomiting, and dietary restriction based on menstrual cycle status in anorexia nervosa (AN). One hundred nine females with full and subthreshold AN (17–45 years old) recorded ED behavior and stress ratings over 2 weeks. Using hierarchical linear modeling, individuals with eumenorrhea and those with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea were compared.

Results showed that following episodes of meal skipping, momentary stress decreased in individuals with normal menstrual cycles and increased in those with irregular menstrual cycles.

These findings suggest that changes in stress severity in response to food restriction may differ based on ovarian hormonal status and may be a mechanism by which AN is maintained in individuals without menstrual disturbance.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^1156GaMm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Assessing menopausal stage in women can be challenging given the medications, surgeries, and medical conditions that can impact reproductive status. The accuracy of women's self-identified menopausal status and assessment via questionnaire was significantly limited by an inability to fully assess important contextual factors. Interviews and brief phone screens are recommended for a more accurate menopausal assessment and staging of midlife women.

### Attachment, motivational systems and anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and proposed framework for eating disorders [^117ERTRp]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2023). Low credibility.

There is a direct association between patients with insecure attachment style (IAS), behavioral inhibition (BIS) and behavioral activation (BAS) motivational systems, and anorexia nervosa (AN). However, the possible direct relationships between these three variables have not been studied.

- **Objective**: The main objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between these variables and propose a framework for analyzing and understanding these relationships.

- **Methodology**: A systematic review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, searching the following terms: 'anorexia', 'attachment' and those related to motivational systems. The final search was limited to publications in English dated between 2014–2022 for 'anorexia and attachment' and 2010–2022 for 'anorexia and BIS/BAS'.

- **Results**: Of the 587 articles retrieved, 30 were included in this study for textual data analysis of the relationship between anorexia and attachment (17), anorexia and motivational systems (10), and anorexia, attachment and motivational systems (3). An association between avoidant IAS, AN, and hypersensitivity to punishment of the BIS was observed in the analysis. A relationship was also found with hyperreinforcement sensitivity of the BAS. After reviewing the articles, a possible relationship between the three factors, along with other mediating factors, was identified.

- **Discussion**: AN is directly related to the avoidant IAS and to BIS. Similarly, bulimia nervosa (BN) was directly related with anxious I

### SIGN 164 eating disorders: A national clinical guideline [^114Tqe1p]. SIGN (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for anorexia nervosa, particularly in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis, the SIGN 2022 guidelines recommend offering weight restoration as part of a holistic treatment program. This approach aims to improve bone mineral density in patients with low-weight anorexia, regardless of gender identity and age.

### Anorexia nervosa medical issues [^1139nSzt]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa is an increasingly common chronic psychiatric disorder with a multitude of medical complications. Most of these complications are reversible if there is timely restoration of body weight. A few of them, particularly osteoporosis, refeeding complications, and cardiac arrhythmia, are potentially much more serious. In the end, a multidisciplinary team approach, with input from a primary care provider who is familiar with these medical sequelae, together with psychiatric and dietary expertise, can effectuate a successful outcome.

The knowledge of anorexia nervosa (AN) indicates that it is a complex, serious, and often-chronic condition characterized by an interplay of debilitating cognitive, emotional, and physical processes, as well as destructive weight loss behaviors. The diagnostic criteria for AN consist of a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height, an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, and in post-menarchal females, the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles. AN often develops in adolescence and is most prevalent in youth, with the age of onset typically peaking between 15 and 19 years.

Lucas and colleagues reported incidence rates of AN in the northern United States to be 25.7 females and 3.7 males per 100,000 of the population per year in the 10 to 14-year-old age group, and 69.4 females and 7.3 males with AN per 100,000 of the population per year in the 15 to 19-year-old age group. Currently, at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), we treat on average 60 new eating disorder patients per year, 20 of whom would require hospitalization due to medical instability from AN.

Development of AN predisposes children and adolescents to a number of potentially harmful physical and emotional sequelae. Adverse physical effects related to profound weight loss and starvation include bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, amenorrhea, and osteopenia.

### SIGN 164 eating disorders: A national clinical guideline [^111tFwJc]. SIGN (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for anorexia nervosa, particularly with respect to patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis, the SIGN 2022 guidelines recommend considering the use of bisphosphonates or estrogen as supportive treatments to prevent the loss of or restore bone mineral density, thereby reducing fracture risk. It is essential to discuss the benefits and risks with the patient and ensure close monitoring by experts in eating disorders and bone metabolism for patients receiving these treatments.

### Life beyond the eating disorder: Education, relationships, and reproduction [^116c26RK]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

We investigated the sociodemographic characteristics in women with and without lifetime eating disorders.

Participants were from a multisite international study of eating disorders (N = 2,096). Education level, relationship status, and reproductive status were examined across eating disorder subtypes and compared with a healthy control group. Overall, women with eating disorders were less educated than controls, and the duration of illness and age of onset were associated with educational attainment. Menstrual status was associated with both relationship and reproductive status, but eating disorder subtypes did not differ significantly from each other or from healthy controls on these dimensions.

Differences in educational attainment, relationships, and reproduction do exist in individuals with eating disorders and are differentially associated with various eating disorder symptoms and characteristics. These data could assist in educating patients and family members about long-term consequences of eating disorders.

### Metabolic assessment of menstruating and nonmenstruating normal weight adolescents [^111QN9NY]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Resumption of menses (ROM) is a key indicator of recovery in anorexia nervosa (AN), but patients may remain amenorrheic despite weight restoration. The objective of this study is to better understand the mechanism of amenorrhea in patients with eating disorders.

- **Method**: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 382 normal weight adolescents with a history of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or eating disorder not otherwise specified, who had been referred for indirect calorimetry tests. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was compared between amenorrheic (n = 60) and regularly menstruating females (n = 121).

- **Results**: Participants with amenorrhea had a mean REE of 1,103 kcal/24 h (79% predicted), whereas participants who were menstruating regularly had a mean REE of 1,217 kcal/24 h (85% predicted; p = 0.001). The amenorrheic group was found to be at a lower mean body weight (53.7 ± 5.6 kg vs. 57.5 ± 7.4 kg; p ≤ 0.001), at a lower percent ideal body weight (98.5 ± 8.3% vs. 102.8 ± 10.2%; p = 0.005), and at a lower BMI (20.5 ± 1.7 vs. 21.5 ± 2.2; p = 0.002).

- **Discussion**: This study highlights that amenorrheic participants with a history of eating disorders who are at normal body weight are hypometabolic, suggesting an adaptive response to dietary restriction.

### Body composition in anorexia nervosa: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [^111sZrwe]. International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

After treatment, female AN patients had a 2.37 kg (95% CI: −3.75, −0.98, Q = 0.002) lower fat mass, which corresponded to 2.5% (95% CI: −4.3, −0.7, p adjCopas = 0.006) less total body mass compared with healthy controls. Female AN patients gained 6.39 kg (95% CI: 5.13, 7.65, Q = 3.07 × 10⁻²²) fat mass following treatment, which corresponded to 10.4% (95% CI: 7.96, 12.87, Q = 6.25 × 10⁻¹⁶) of total body mass. Posttreatment fat mass (β metareg = −0.23, p = .01; Table S5) and gain in fat mass during treatment (β metareg = −0.20, p = .02; Table S6) were negatively associated with the presence of amenorrhea. Following weight recovery, these values fully returned to levels seen in female healthy controls.

Specifically, compared with healthy controls, female AN patients had 3.51 kg (95% CI: −4.58, −2.43, Q = 8.07 × 10⁻¹⁰) less trunk fat mass prior to treatment. In relative terms, however, female AN patients had lower extremity body fat with 5.4% (95% CI: −8.4, −2.4, Q = 8.23 × 10⁻⁴) less total body mass. The presence of amenorrhea was significantly associated with lower extremity fat mass (β metareg = 0.31, p = .04; Table S4).

After treatment, female AN patients showed a higher trunk body fat percentage than controls at 12.0% (95% CI: 9.5, 14.4, p adjCopas < 1.00 × 10⁻⁴) of total body mass. However, this finding was strongly influenced by publication bias with an estimated 52 unpublished studies. These results on body composition were not influenced by height as female and male cases and controls showed no meaningful difference (i.e. 1 cm pretreatment) or by age.

### Menstrual cycle loss and resumption among patients with anorexia nervosa spectrum eating disorders: Is relative or absolute weight more influential [^112DytPz]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Prior research suggests that both body mass index (BMI) and weight suppression (highest past weight minus weight; WS) are important in determining adult anorexia nervosa (AN) severity. We examined associations between amenorrhea and WS, DSM-5 BMI severity category, and highest premorbid BMI among patients with AN.

- **Method**: Participants (N = 69) were adult female AN-spectrum patients at two residential treatment facilities. At admission, height and weight were measured. Participants completed questionnaires assessing menstrual status and weight history.

- **Results**: Greater WS, adjusted for BMI, was associated with menstrual function at admission. First amenorrhea onset occurred at a normal BMI for 38.5% of participants. Premorbid highest BMI positively correlated with BMI at amenorrhea onset, and higher BMI at amenorrhea onset was associated with higher BMI at menses resumption.

- **Discussion**: These findings add to the literature indicating that relative and absolute weight status are dual indicators of illness severity in AN, and preliminarily suggest that a large proportion of adults who present for treatment initially may have shown symptoms of starvation at a normal BMI. Results underscore the need to focus on weight loss in early detection efforts and may inform target weight setting in the treatment of AN.

### Factors associated with recovery from anorexia nervosa: A population-based study [^113mDZ8M]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

To examine factors associated with the outcome of anorexia nervosa among women from the general population.

- **Method**: Women (N = 2,881) from the 1975–1979 birth cohorts of Finnish twins were screened for lifetime DSM-IV anorexia nervosa (N = 55 cases) using questionnaires and the SCID interview. Potential factors associated with the likelihood of recovery were addressed in the same assessment. Recovery was defined as restoration of weight, menstruation, and the absence of bingeing and purging for at least one year prior to assessment. Using two-tailed t-tests and Pearson's chi-square tests, we contrasted recovered (N = 39) and unrecovered (N = 16) women. We then used logistic regression adjusted for duration of illness and Cox proportional hazard models to account for the variable lengths of illness on prognostic factors.

- **Results**: Unrecovered women were more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms prior to eating disorder onset (18.8% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.04), remain unemployed (18.8% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.04), report dissatisfaction with their partner/spouse (p = 0.02), and report high perfectionism (p = 0.05) than were recovered women. When duration of illness was accounted for in the analyses, premorbid depression was the sole factor significantly associated with decreased likelihood of recovery (hazard ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.03–0.89).

- **Discussion**: Predicting the course of anorexia remains fraught with difficulty, but premorbid depressive symptoms are associated with poor outcome of anorexia nervosa in the general population.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anorexia nervosa, specifically in relation to the initial evaluation, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial physical examination of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Vital signs**: Including temperature, resting heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), orthostatic pulse, and orthostatic BP.

- **Anthropometric measurements**: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) (or percent median BMI, BMI percentile, or BMI Z-score for children and adolescents).

- **Physical appearance**: Signs of malnutrition or purging behaviors.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^113uy1Fe]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

We follow a similar approach in asking about menstrual cycles, where we begin by asking the time since the last period. We then work backward to determine if there were any missed cycles. We ask each woman why she thinks she missed periods, as this has occasionally yielded information about causes that were not reported or identified initially (e.g. miscarriage, strenuous exercise). We also ask an open-ended question about the length of menstrual cycles, with instructions on how to calculate cycle length, working with participants to calculate typical cycle length and changes in cycle length over time (e.g. the past year). The focus is on recent changes in menstrual patterns, as the menopausal transition brings about changes in cycle length and regularity, even in women who have had very inconsistent menstrual patterns.

Indeed, in our experience, it is possible to identify changes in cycle length and regularity even in women with historically inconsistent periods, as most of these women do not miss more than one year of periods (for postmenopause) or miss two or more consecutive periods or have two or more consecutive periods that vary considerably in length outside of the very wide range of their typical cycle (for perimenopause). Nonetheless, we detail strategies for staging women whose cycles are so inconsistent (e.g. those with eating disorders) that assessing cycles alone is insufficient.

### Anorexia nervosa [^1174uazh]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

Anorexia nervosa is a disease that can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and conditions, including dehydration, increased QT interval, early satiety, and weight loss. Patients may also experience metabolic acidosis, mood changes, and vitamin D deficiency, accompanied by a fear of weight gain and potential hair loss.

- **Physical symptoms**: Orthostatic hypotension, iron deficiency anemia, fainting, overexercising, anovulation, peripheral edema, brittle nails, decreased body temperature, and use of diuretics or laxatives. Symptoms such as bradycardia, dyspnea, palpitations, orthostatic tachycardia, and hypotension are also common.

- **Behavioral and psychological symptoms**: OCD, personality disorders, difficulty concentrating, depression, malnutrition, anxiety, vitamin B12 deficiency, and slow thinking. Further complications include PTSD, self-induced vomiting, body image dissatisfaction, and denial of the severity of low body weight.

- **Nutritional deficiencies and related conditions**: Zinc deficiency, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and decreased serum phosphate. These deficiencies can lead to conditions like pancytopenia, decreased BMI, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement.

- **Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues**: Constipation, lightheadedness, fatigue, diarrhea, memory impairment, dental erosions, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and anorexia-induced abnormalities in electrolyte balance.

- **Other associated conditions**: Social anxiety disorder, PTSD, angular cheilitis, T1DM, and suicidal ideation. Anorexia nervosa may also lead to conditions such as alcohol use disorder, skin dryness, and inattention.

### Dissociable hormonal profiles for psychopathology and stress in anorexia and bulimia nervosa [^1151RFDd]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Both AN-BP (β = 0.23, t (77) = 4.72, p < 0.05) patients and hormonal contraceptive users exhibited nominally increased cortisol compared to those with amenorrhea (β = 0.13, t (77) = 2.08, p = 0.04). A nominally significant group-by-condition interaction indicated decreased cortisol reactivity to acute stress in BN, but not AN-BP, compared to controls (β = −0.10, t (81) = −2.23, p = 0.028). Both quadratic time (χ² (1) = 10.36, p = 0.001) and interaction (χ² (2) = 6.07, p = 0.048) terms significantly improved model fit indices.

- **Associations between acute psychological stress and metabolic markers**:
	- (a) Change in plasma cortisol relative to baseline by condition. Compared to controls, plasma cortisol was increased in both AN-BP (p < 0.001) and BN (p < 0.001), yet cortisol reactivity was nominally reduced following stress in BN relative to controls (p = 0.028).
	- A group-by-condition interaction showed augmented functionally active ghrelin (p = 0.007) (b) and PYY (p = 0.003) (c) in AN-BP after stress.
	- (d) Ad libitum consumption was reduced in AN-BP (p = 0.005) and nominally in BN (p = 0.016) compared to controls, and stress did not alter consumption.

### Moving beyond the phenotypic correlation between anorexia nervosa and autism [^115G2Wev]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Inal-Kaleli et al. is situated within a growing area of research, investigating the relationship between anorexia nervosa and autistic characteristics. Their synthesis of research within the topic finds support for elevated autistic characteristics and autism in individuals with anorexia nervosa, and a small but significant correlation between autistic traits and the level of eating disorder symptoms. In this commentary, we discuss the findings of Inal-Kaleli and colleagues and propose further research to generate insights into the nature of this link.

We focus on the potential origins of the observed relationship, specific mechanisms, and manifestation of anorexia nervosa in autistic populations, and the influence of sex and gender on the intersection of eating disorders and autism. By addressing these largely unexplored research avenues, future investigations can go beyond the phenotypic correlations and facilitate the development of prevention and intervention suited for individuals experiencing both disordered eating and elevated autistic traits.

### Body composition in anorexia nervosa: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [^113vVGo9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The goals of these meta-analyses were to: (a) replicate findings from the systematic review on fat mass; (b) extend the observations by quantifying them; (c) include fat-free mass; (d) include bone mineral content and density; (e) investigate their associations with each other; and (f) if possible, relate findings to secondary outcomes such as metabolic and hormonal parameters. This analytical approach aims to understand the potential associations between these factors, which are known to be physiologically interrelated. A thorough and rigorous examination of body composition and related laboratory parameters in individuals with anorexia nervosa could elucidate some of the physiological changes associated with this serious disorder, leading to more effective medical management, monitoring, and treatment approaches.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^111zqgBx]. International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Classifying midlife women into menopausal stages was much more challenging than we anticipated. Although some of these challenges are present in any questionnaire study (e.g. limited coverage, inability to probe ambiguous information), we believe there are unique challenges in assessing menopausal status. Some of these challenges stem from contraceptive use and surgeries or medical conditions that affect menstruation. It is difficult to stage these women using questionnaires alone, given the inability to ask follow-up questions about timelines and medical histories. It is also difficult to stage these women using STRAW+10 criteria, given how much these criteria rely on natural changes in cycles.

We offer suggestions below on how to overcome these challenges, but it is important to note the real difficulties in staging this group of women. These surgeries and medications are relatively common in midlife women. Data from our studies indicate that upwards of 48% of midlife women are using these medications or have these surgeries, and nationwide surveys provide similar estimates (i.e. ~11% of women aged 40 and above use IUDs or oral contraceptives, 22% have had hysterectomies, and over 500,000 undergo endometrial ablation annually). Most studies of menopause exclude these women (e.g. Baker et al; Gonçalves et al; Mangweth‐Matzek et al; Marcus et al; Raynal et al; Stojiljkovic‐Drobnjak et al; Thompson and Bardone‐Cone) to avoid staging issues. As we argue below, excluding these women significantly impacts the study results.

### Identification and management of eating disorders in gynecology: Menstrual health as an underutilized screening tool [^116WV9qf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that disproportionately affect females, often during their child-bearing years. Although the endocrinological and reproductive sequelae of these conditions often fall within the treatment purview of obstetrician-gynecologists, the assessment of eating pathology is challenging and often not part of routine clinical care. This commentary focuses on one of the common presenting symptoms of eating disorders in women: menstrual dysfunction, and discusses considerations for its clinical management in gynecology. Assessment of menstrual status provides a natural starting point for provider-patient discussion of disordered eating and weight behavior. Routine screening for eating disorders is critical and must be universal given the serious long-term consequences of these disorders.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^116oL3wd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Another group of women was categorized as unclear because of contraceptive use. Hormonal contraceptives often induce regular menses, and many IUDs cause menses to stop; consequently, the use of these medications/devices can complicate assessing natural changes in menstrual cycles. While a larger proportion of premenopausal women using these medications/devices was expected, nearly 20% of women self-identifying as perimenopausal also used these medications/devices. Anecdotally, women in our data collections are reporting that doctors are prescribing hormonal contraceptives to help with vasomotor and menopausal symptoms rather than MHT. Importantly, in the study, none of the unclear perimenopausal cases were taking MHT.

A history of surgeries or medical conditions/medications (e.g. PCOS, hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries) were the final reasons why women were categorized in the unclear category. The presence of these conditions made staging very difficult due to the loss of menses that commonly occurs and our inability to assess timelines of surgeries/medical conditions and changes in menstrual cycles. For example, in some cases, a natural menopausal transition seemed to precede the medical condition/treatment, but the lack of historical contextual information in the questionnaire (and inability to ask follow-up questions) made this difficult to determine.

### Current understanding of hypothalamic amenorrhoea [^114xyaik]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Reversing the negative energy balance by restoring body weight or fat mass and/or reducing exercise intensity may be sufficient to restore menses and improve rates of conception in some patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). It is not clear what degree of weight gain is required for the resolution of menstruation. Common advice suggests aiming for at least the same weight at which menstruation stopped, although one study has shown that patients with low-weight eating disorders were 2 kg heavier at the time their menses resumed than when they became amenorrhoeic.

Improving the energy deficit often requires behavioral change. In some women, simply explaining the need for increased caloric intake and providing basic advice on how to achieve this may be adequate. For others, weight gain may need to be supervised, or dietary patterns should be discussed with a registered dietician or nutritionist.

Many women with FHA have an element of disordered eating or an incipient eating disorder, which will require psychological support to facilitate changes in negative eating habits. In those with a formally diagnosed eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa, referral to a specialist eating disorder service is recommended. This enables these patients to receive appropriate treatment from a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatrists.

### Body composition in anorexia nervosa: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [^114BJ9Jt]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

- **Bone mineral content and density**: Compared with healthy controls, whole‐body bone mineral content in female individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) was 0.16 kg (95% CI: −0.19, −0.12, Q = 2.73 × 10⁻²⁰) lower before treatment and 0.09 kg (95% CI: −0.13, −0.05, Q = 1.63 × 10⁻⁵) lower after treatment. Weight‐restored female individuals with AN showed 0.10 kg (95% CI: −0.18, −0.03, Q = 0.01) lower whole‐body bone mineral content compared to controls, as they gained on average 0.05 kg (95% CI: 0.02, 0.09, Q = 0.01) during treatment. The interpretability of these estimates is limited due to the insufficient follow‐up time after weight recovery, which exceeded 6 months in only two studies (Dellava et al. 2009; Karlsson et al. 2000). The pretreatment whole‐body bone mineral content in females was associated with fat‐free mass (β metareg = 0.02, p = .02) and fat mass (β metareg = 0.05, p = .02), as well as the difference in fat mass between AN patients and controls (β metareg = 0.04, p = .002; Table S4). Accordingly, pretreatment whole‐body bone mineral density was 0.03 g/cm² (95% CI: −0.06, −0.01, p adjCopas = .02) lower in females with AN, although our analysis showed a density comparable to healthy controls posttreatment. However, only two studies with 74 AN cases could be included in this analysis.

Before treatment, female AN patients exhibited lower bone mineral density in several regions, including the hip, lumbar spine, and femoral neck, some of which are likely to persist after weight recovery. These findings were associated with the duration of illness, the age of AN cases, and differences in fat mass.

### Menstrual status and serum leptin levels in anorectic and in menstruating women with low body mass indexes [^117Dtd7w]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate serum leptin levels in anorectic women, menstruating women with low body mass indexes (BMI), and normally menstruating women with normal BMI, a prospective study was conducted in university clinics. Patients included fourteen amenorrheic individuals with anorexia nervosa (group A), 11 menstruating women with a BMI < 18 kg/m² (group B), and 20 normal controls.

- **Main outcome measures**: Determination of BMI, caloric intake, total fat mass, ovarian volume, and serum levels of leptin, insulin-like growth factor I, FSH, LH, E₂, PRL, and TSH.

The study results indicated that mean BMI and fat mass were similar in groups A and B, while significantly higher in controls. Mean caloric intake was significantly lower in group A compared to group B and controls. Median serum leptin levels were substantially lower in group A than in group B and controls, with group B having lower levels than controls. Additionally, median serum insulin-like growth factor I levels were significantly decreased in group A compared to both group B and controls. Binary segmentation analysis of groups A and B showed that LH was the most relevant variable in differentiating the two groups, followed by leptin.

The conclusion drawn was that a threshold of leptin levels exists, above which menstrual function is preserved, even in the presence of low body mass indexes.

### Chromosomal abnormalities and hormonal disorders of primary amenorrhea patients in Egypt [^114u1MGk]. Indian Journal of Human Genetics (2012). High credibility.

The key background information on amenorrhea includes the following:

- **Definition**: Amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menstrual periods in women.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of amenorrhea is complex and multifactorial. It can be caused by hormonal disorders such as pituitary dysfunction and absent ovarian function. Chromosomal abnormalities and impairment of GnRH pulsatile secretion are also potential causes.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence rates of primary and secondary amenorrhea in the general population are estimated at 0.3% and 3–4%, respectively.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, amenorrhea presents as the absence of menstrual periods. In primary amenorrhea, there is also an absence of secondary sexual characteristics in phenotypic women aged ≥ 14 years. In secondary amenorrhea, there may be other associated symptoms depending on the underlying cause. For example, patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea may present with severe bradycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, and/or electrolyte imbalance.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amenorrhea depends on the underlying cause. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is reversible, and normal menstrual function can be restored with appropriate treatment. However, amenorrhea due to chromosomal abnormalities or primary ovarian insufficiency may not be reversible.

### Impact of secondary amenorrhea on cardiovascular disease risk in physically active women: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KopWY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

A disruption of endogenous estrogen levels may impact these cardioprotective mechanisms. Secondary amenorrhea results in estrogen deficiency and is defined as the absence of menses for three consecutive cycles. Secondary amenorrhea is estimated to affect 3% to 14% of the general population, compared with 10% to 20% of subfertile women and 44% of competitive athletes. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common, reversible form of secondary amenorrhea with three often overlapping pathogeneses: stress-related, weight loss-related, and exercise-associated. In physically active women, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea has been causally linked to energy deficiency due to insufficient caloric intake in combination with high energy expenditure. This form of amenorrhea is well described in the female athlete triad, a medical disorder characterized by the interrelated conditions of low energy availability, with or without disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone mineral density. The triad affects both recreationally physically active women and competitive athletes. Athletes most at risk are those competing in sports prioritizing leanness, such as long-distance running.

A growing body of evidence is reporting cardiovascular alterations in premenopausal women with exercise-associated secondary amenorrhea, including impaired endothelial function and lipid profile alterations.

### Amenorrhoea in adolescent female athletes [^115gsWpp]. The Lancet. Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Low credibility.

Female athletes often experience amenorrhoea during training, but this should not be considered normal. Low energy availability is a common cause of menstrual dysfunction, and amenorrhoea can serve as a warning sign of some health and performance consequences associated with inadequate energy, including poor bone accrual and low bone mineral density.

Adolescence is an important time for bone accrual, growth, and development, making delayed menarche and secondary amenorrhoea particularly concerning in young athletes. The development of disordered eating and eating disorder behaviors also peaks during adolescence. Thus, screening for low energy availability, establishing the various causes of amenorrhoea, and treating amenorrhoea and low energy availability with an interdisciplinary team is most effective.

### What is worse for your sex life: starving, being depressed, or a new baby [^116y8okV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the sexual functioning of women in intimate relationships affected by anorexia nervosa, major depression, and during the postpartum period.

Complete data were available for 76 women who reported being in an intimate relationship, distributed as follows: anorexia (10 women), depression (24 women), and postpartum (42 women). Sexual functioning was assessed using the Social Adjustment Scale (Weissman and Bothwell, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 33, 1111–1115, 1976).

Significant differences were noted among the groups in terms of the frequency of sexual activity (p = .03) and sexual problems (p < .001), though not in enjoyment of sexual experiences (p = .55). In the preceding two weeks, both women with anorexia nervosa and those with major depression were more likely to have had sex than postpartum women. However, they were also more prone to encounter sexual problems compared to postpartum women. Enjoyment of sex was reported by most women across all groups, irrespective of their condition.

The conclusion drawn from the study indicates that women with anorexia nervosa and major depression, who are in intimate relationships, report similar sexual functioning profiles. These profiles differ from those of postpartum women, primarily in terms of the frequency of sexual encounters and reported sexual problems.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^1122iSos]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, we did not fully anticipate the challenges posed by the large number of women whose complicated histories would preclude accurate staging when we designed our project and budget. This oversight stemmed, in part, from the fact that most menopause studies only report the final sample size, without detailing exclusions due to hormonal contraceptive use, IUDs, medications, or surgeries. This made it more difficult to estimate the number of midlife women with these complicated reproductive histories.

While we currently do not have the funds for extensive endocrine testing, we are collecting daily estradiol and progesterone levels across 35 consecutive days from all perimenopausal women to examine hormonal contributions to eating and psychotic disorders during the menopausal transition. We will then use these hormone data, along with daily reports of menstrual bleeding/spotting and vasomotor symptoms, to corroborate our phone screen menopausal stage, particularly for women with medications/medical conditions/surgeries that make staging more difficult.

In premenopausal and postmenopausal women, we are not collecting hormones, but we are using their age, reported history of vasomotor symptoms, and daily reports of menstrual bleeding/spotting and vasomotor symptoms to validate their initial menopausal staging. Arguably, these methods do not conform perfectly to established staging criteria; however, we are committed to including these women in our study, and we can examine results with and without the more complicated cases to directly examine their effect.

### Physiologic regulators of bone turnover in young women with anorexia nervosa [^117LPKse]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

To clarify the role of physiologic regulators of bone turnover in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), adolescent girls with AN (n = 61) had anthropometric, nutrition, and exercise data acquired. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum samples were obtained for hormones, proresorptive cytokines, and bone formation markers, and urine samples were taken for bone resorption markers.

In bivariate correlation analyses, significant (P < .05) predictors of lumbar BMD included height, weight, and exercise. In multiple regression models, these significant relationships held, even after controlling for the duration of amenorrhea and AN. For total body BMD, the same positive predictors were found, and percentage of body fat was a negative correlate. For hip BMD, exercise and weight were found to be positive predictors. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was inversely correlated with N-telopeptides (NTx), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was directly correlated with osteocalcin. Proresorptive cytokine levels were low or undetectable.

Exercise and weight were positive predictors of BMD. These data are the first to suggest a relationship between DHEAS and increased bone resorption in AN. IGF-I was correlated with bone formation indices. Low cytokine levels suggest that these factors do not mediate the increased bone resorption of AN.

### Patterns of medical diagnoses before and following a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa: A Danish nationwide cohort study [^111viQCm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with increased odds of medical diagnoses such as malnutrition, anemia, amenorrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome, with some conditions becoming apparent up to ten years before diagnosis and rising sharply in the year leading up to it. Patients with AN are at increased risk of most medical diagnoses, particularly electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, and gastrointestinal disorders, with similar patterns observed both before and after diagnosis. Early recognition of AN in patients with unexplained symptoms like anemia, GI issues, or amenorrhea is crucial for timely intervention, with variations in diagnosis patterns based on age and sex. This emphasizes the importance of tailored screening strategies for diverse patient populations.

### Unplanned pregnancy in women with anorexia nervosa [^113sfHpo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of unplanned pregnancies in individuals with anorexia nervosa relative to women without eating disorders in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study.

In the method section, a sample of 62,060 women was analyzed, of which 62 reported anorexia nervosa. Data were collected from questionnaires completed by all participating mothers. Researchers compared the mother's age at birth and the frequency of mothers reporting their index pregnancy as unplanned.

Results indicated that women with anorexia nervosa were younger (26.2 years, standard deviation 4.76) than women without eating disorders (29.9 years, standard deviation 4.60) at the time of birth. Significantly more women with anorexia nervosa (50.0%) reported unplanned pregnancies compared to the referent group (18.9%). After adjusting for maternal age and infertility treatment, the relative risk of unplanned pregnancy in individuals with anorexia nervosa was 2.11 (95% confidence interval 1.64–2.72). Induced abortion was also significantly more common in women with anorexia nervosa than in the referent group (24.2% compared with 14.6%).

In conclusion, the higher rate of unplanned pregnancy and abortion in women with anorexia nervosa is of clinical concern because absent or irregular menstruation may be misinterpreted as decreasing the risk of pregnancy.

Level of evidence: II.

### Menstrual cyclicity is predictably unpredictable [^116JxoWa]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Low credibility.

"Time moves slowly but passes quickly" - Alice Walker.

This observation aptly encapsulates the phenomenon of menstrual cyclicity, reflecting its inherent unpredictability while maintaining a sense of inevitability. The intricacies of the menstrual cycle, influenced by a myriad of biological and environmental factors, often challenge efforts to predict its course with precision. Despite advancements in medical science, the cyclical nature of menstruation remains an area ripe for further research and understanding.

### SIGN 164 eating disorders: A national clinical guideline [^11216akj]. SIGN (2022). High credibility.

SIGN 2022 guidelines specifically address anorexia nervosa in pregnant patients. It is recommended to consider obtaining additional obstetric monitoring during pregnancy, such as fetal growth scans. This is to support and enable multidisciplinary intervention if indicated in pregnant patients with eating disorders or a history of eating disorders, particularly those with a low or high pre-pregnancy BMI or failure to gain gestational weight.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders [^115DM3uL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for anorexia nervosa, specifically with respect to psychotherapy, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend offering eating disorder-focused psychotherapy. This includes normalizing eating and weight control behaviors, restoring weight, and addressing psychological aspects of the disorder, such as fear of weight gain and body image disturbance, in adult patients with anorexia nervosa.

### The association between leptin and weight maintenance outcome in anorexia nervosa [^113kXqug]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Relapse after weight restoration in anorexia nervosa (AN) is a critical problem. A higher body fat percentage after weight gain has been shown to predict better weight maintenance outcomes. Leptin, a fat-derived hormone, has been associated with progress during weight gain, but its association with weight maintenance is unknown. This study aims to determine whether leptin levels after weight restoration in AN are associated with weight maintenance.

Participants in the study were 41 women with AN who were hospitalized for inpatient treatment. They were evaluated 2–4 weeks after weight restoration to a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 19.5 kg/m² for plasma leptin and body composition. Weight maintenance outcome was defined by whether a participant maintained a BMI of at least 18.5 kg/m² at the end of 1 year following hospital discharge.

Out of 41 patients, 20 (48.8%) maintained their weight at 1 year. Percent body fat and leptin were significantly higher in the group who maintained weight (body fat, p = .004, Hedges' g = 0.944; log-leptin, p = .010, Hedges' g = 0.821). However, there were no differences in predischarge BMI, duration of illness, and duration of amenorrhea. Using regression modeling, only higher log-leptin (p Wald = .021), percent body fat (p Wald = .010), and fat-adjusted leptin (p Wald = .029) independently predicted weight maintenance at 1 year.

Our findings suggest that for acutely weight-restored women with AN, higher predischarge leptin measurements are associated with better outcomes in the year following treatment. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Menopause is associated with decreased postprandial ghrelin, whereas a history of anorexia nervosa is associated with increased total ghrelin [^111pn3xv]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Middle age has been linked with various dysfunctional eating patterns in women. The hormone ghrelin is related to food intake, with plasma levels rising before eating and decreasing immediately afterwards. Animal research has shown that oestradiol is an antagonist of ghrelin. Given that both menopause and anorexia nervosa (AN) are states characterized by reduced oestradiol, the present study aimed to investigate for the first time whether menopausal status and a history of AN are linked with altered ghrelin levels in middle-aged women.

Based on previous research, we hypothesized that:

- **Post-menopausal women**: Would demonstrate comparably increased ghrelin after food intake.
- **Women with a history of AN**: Would exhibit increased total ghrelin levels.

Healthy, middle-aged women (n = 57) were recruited for the study. Of these women, 31 were post-menopausal and 27 had a history of AN. Plasma ghrelin was repeatedly collected before and following a meal standardized in terms of caloric content. Areas under the curves were calculated to indicate total (AUCg) and postprandial ghrelin (AUCi). Menopausal status was linked with postprandial ghrelin (AUCi -1.6 ± 2.2 vs -2.9 ± 2.6; P = 0.058), whereas a history of AN was linked with total ghrelin (AUCg 36.2 ± 5.6 vs 39.0 ± 3.7; P = 0.050). There were no interaction effects (both P > 0.466). A closer examination of the effects revealed that post-menopausal women showed marginally greater decreases in ghrelin immediately after food intake (P = 0.064) and marginally greater re-increases after 60 minutes (P = 0.084) compared to pre-menopausal women.

### Assessing obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) clinicians' knowledge, practice, and attitudes toward anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia nervosa, and amenorrhea [^111ibvXV]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) and atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN) are eating disorders characterized by extreme restriction of energy intake. However, in contrast to individuals with AN, those with AAN are not underweight. Although individuals with either AN or AAN can experience associated functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) that may prompt them to seek gynecologic care, little is known about obstetricians' and gynecologists' (OBGYNs') knowledge and approach to these patients. This study sought to fill this gap.

- **Methods**: A total of 119 OBGYNs read vignettes describing an underweight patient with AN and a normal-weight patient with AAN presenting with FHA. The OBGYNs then responded to items assessing their approaches, knowledge, and attitudes toward patients with amenorrhea and eating disorders (EDs) more broadly.

- **Results**: The participants ranked FHA as significantly more likely in the underweight vignette than in the normal-weight vignette. They reported more frequently asking about weight, eating, exercise, and body image in underweight patients with amenorrhea relative to patients who are normal weight or overweight. Overall, the participants demonstrated low knowledge of AN and AAN and reported less familiarity with AAN.

- **Conclusion**: OBGYNs may be less likely to identify FHA and assess for an ED in non-underweight patients with secondary amenorrhea. Therefore, patients with AAN having complications of malnutrition may be less likely to be properly evaluated and treated. Future research should investigate educational interventions that aim to improve this gap in knowledge.

### Preservation of neuroendocrine control of reproductive function despite severe undernutrition [^111Ciwmp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by low weight and self-imposed caloric restriction, leading to severe bone loss. Although amenorrhea due to acquired GnRH deficiency is nearly universal in AN, a subset of patients maintains menses despite low weight. The mechanisms underlying continued GnRH secretion despite low weight in these patients, and the impact of gonadal hormone secretion on bone mineral density (BMD) in such eumenorrheic, low-weight patients remain unknown.

We hypothesized that eumenorrheic women with AN would have higher body fat and levels of nutritionally dependent hormones, including leptin and IGF-I, than amenorrheic women with AN and comparable body mass index, and that BMD would be higher in these women. We also investigated whether the severity of eating disorder symptomatology differed between the groups.

We studied 116 women:

- **Participants**:
	1. 42 low-weight women who fulfilled all Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) diagnostic criteria for AN, except for amenorrhea.
	2. 74 women with AN and amenorrhea for at least 3 months.

The two groups were similar in body mass index (17.1 ± 0.2 vs. 16.8 ± 0.2 kg/m²), percent ideal body weight (78.2 ± 0.8% vs. 76.7 ± 0.8%), duration of eating disorder (70 ± 13 vs. 59 ± 9 months), age of menarche (13.2 ± 0.3 vs. 13.5 ± 0.2 years), and exercise (4.5 ± 1.0 vs. 4.2 ± 0.5 hours/week).

As expected, eumenorrheic patients had a higher mean estradiol level (186.6 ± 19.0 vs. 59.4 ± 2.5 nmol/liter; P < 0.0001) than amenorrheic subjects.

### Effect on bone health of estrogen preparations in premenopausal women with anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analyses [^113uZeUN]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Because estrogen therapies are widely prescribed for amenorrhea associated with anorexia nervosa (AN), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate the influence of estrogen preparations (EP) on bone mineral density in women with AN.

- **Method**: Prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of EP use to no treatment or placebo on bone mineral density and bone fractures were included. Independent reviewers selected studies for inclusion and extracted study characteristics, markers of methodologic quality, and outcomes for the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Using random-effects meta-analyses and inconsistency across trials using the I² statistic, data were combined across two eligible prospective cohort studies and four RCTs; none reported effects on bone fractures. Compared with placebo or no treatment, low-quality evidence found EPs have a moderate effect on bone mineral density in the lumbar spine [ES (effect size) 0.33, 95% CI (confidence interval) 0.09, 0.56; I² = 0%], but no significant effect on the femoral neck (ES 0.13, 95% CI -0.16, 0.43; I² = 0%). There were no significant treatment-subgroup interactions.

- **Discussion**: In general, EPs have uncertain benefit and should be avoided by women with AN in whom the success of weight and nutritional rehabilitation is judged by menses resumption.

### Body composition in anorexia nervosa: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [^115EQvgm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) was associated with body fat percentage-associated low T3- and T4-syndrome pretreatment, whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations were normal. Associations between fat mass and thyroid hormones have been described before; however, sufficiently powered long-term follow-up studies in AN are absent.

Steroid hormone concentrations were altered, showing high cortisol, low estradiol, and normal testosterone. Estradiol was negatively associated with fat-free mass, whereas cortisol was positively associated with fat mass. These findings suggest that fat-free mass may be a potential moderator for the return of menses in AN patients and should be further investigated, as most research in recovery of menses primarily focused on BMI- or weight-related cutoffs. Potential reverse causation should also be taken into account, where altered estradiol concentrations may precede changes in fat-free mass.

Overall, the meta-analyzed study sample was highly selected and biased as it comprised mostly European females aged between 14 and 31 years, emphasizing the urgent need for studies including diverse ancestries, such as Asia, South and Central America, and Africa. Females and males differ in body composition and metabolic characteristics, underscoring the need for more studies on males with AN. Our study selection was limited by the lack of control groups and underreported extensive sample overlap. Moreover, control groups were only measured at baseline in all longitudinal studies.

### Menstrual disorders in adolescents and young adults with eating disorders [^116jnhHs]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Low credibility.

Although amenorrhea is no longer a specific criterion required to make the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), the relationship between restrictive eating and menstrual status remains important in the diagnosis, treatment, and consequences for patients with eating disorders. Clinicians should understand the relationship between menstrual irregularities and malnutrition due to eating disorders, as it may be possible to intervene sooner if the diagnosis is made earlier.

Treatment of AN (in those who are underweight) and atypical AN (in those who are not underweight) is aimed at cessation of restrictive thoughts and behaviors, restoration of appropriate nutrition and weight, and normal functioning of the body. While eating disorder thoughts and behaviors are helped by both therapy and nutrition, regular functioning of the body, including regular menstruation, is linked to both appropriate nutrition and weight. Patients who are not underweight based on their body mass index (BMI) may still have oligo/amenorrhea due to their caloric restriction; thus, any patient who has irregular menses should have a detailed dietary evaluation as part of their workup.

Timely diagnosis and treatment of patients with eating disorders and amenorrhea are important due to the impact on bone mass accrual for adolescents who have prolonged amenorrhea. Menstrual abnormalities may also be seen in patients with bulimia nervosa (BN).

### Persistent amenorrhoea in weight-recovered anorexics: Psychological and biological aspects [^114HVWww]. Psychiatry Research (2003). Low credibility.

Demographic, psychopathological, and hormonal parameters of 22 women with previous anorexia nervosa (AN), presently recovered and in a state of stabilized nutritional normalization for 3 months to 2 years but with persistent amenorrhea, were studied alongside 20 psychophysically healthy age- and sex-matched normally menstruating controls. Body mass index (BMI) values did not differ between patients and controls.

Psychological examination, monitored by the Eating Disorder Inventory 1, Bulimic Investigation Test Edinburgh, Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale, and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire rating scales, showed the persistence of some psychopathological symptoms of AN. Hormonal examinations included basal plasma concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteotropic hormone, estrogens (E), progesterone, thyrotropic hormone, FT₃, FT₄ (immunoradiometric assays), leptin (LEP) (enzymatic-linked-immunosorbent assay), and 24-hour urinary free cortisol (immunoradiometric assay).

Hormone values were similar between patients and controls, except for E and LEP levels, which were significantly lower in patients than in controls. The concentrations of the two hormones were not correlated with the BMI of the patients, but LEP values were negatively correlated with the difference between the present BMI and the pre-anorexic one. The values of both hormones negatively correlated with some psychopathological aspects typical of AN, particularly with high 'body dissatisfaction', 'ineffectiveness', and 'interpersonal distrust', and with low 'interoceptive awareness'.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders [^116rDjV3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anorexia nervosa, with a particular focus on multidisciplinary care, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend providing a documented, comprehensive, culturally appropriate, and person-centered treatment plan. This plan should incorporate medical, psychiatric, psychological, and nutritional expertise, typically delivered through a coordinated multidisciplinary team for patients with an eating disorder.
