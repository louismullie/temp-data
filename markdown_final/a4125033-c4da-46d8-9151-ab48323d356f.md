## Question

Tamoxifen in breast cancer when to use and MOA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when tamoxifen should be used in breast cancer and how it works mechanistically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action to anchor indications. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and reconcile them with contemporary guideline-based uses. Next, I will stratify by menopausal status and disease setting, including adjuvant, metastatic, DCIS, and prevention. After that, I should review duration strategies, including extended therapy and switching, and consider special populations like men. Finally, I will examine resistance biology and safety to contextualize sequencing and monitoring, and close with practical prescribing pearls and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because indications flow from it. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that competitively binds estrogen receptors, exerting antiestrogenic effects in breast tissue while having partial agonist activity in other tissues such as bone and endometrium; this tissue-selective pharmacology explains both efficacy and toxicity profiles, and the active metabolite endoxifen contributes to potency and interindividual variability in response [^116ZJKKb] [^114UaexW] [^112amHUA].

> I need to check the labeled indications to ground the clinical framework. The FDA labeling supports tamoxifen for adjuvant treatment of early-stage ER-positive breast cancer, for treatment of ER-positive metastatic breast cancer, for reduction of invasive breast cancer after surgery and radiation in DCIS, and for primary prevention in high-risk women; these remain foundational, though practice has evolved with newer agents and strategies [^114jk6BD] [^112Gvx7A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about menopausal status. I should verify how guidelines diverge from the label. In premenopausal patients, tamoxifen is standard adjuvant therapy because aromatase inhibitors require ovarian suppression; in postmenopausal patients, while tamoxifen remains appropriate, many guidelines favor an aromatase inhibitor upfront or in sequence due to superior efficacy in several trials, so tamoxifen is often used as an alternative or as part of a switch strategy rather than default first-line in modern practice [^114M537x] [^115RdUgf] [^116p3z3q].

> Next, I should review adjuvant therapy duration and sequencing, since this is where extended strategies matter. Standard adjuvant tamoxifen is 5 years, but high-quality evidence supports extending to a total of 10 years for those at substantial residual risk, with either continued tamoxifen or a switch to an AI for up to 5 additional years; the ATLAS and aTTom programs demonstrated modest but meaningful reductions in recurrence and mortality with extension, informing current guideline recommendations [^114J45t9] [^117T6bKe] [^117Wna3r].

> Wait, let me verify the switching data and not overstate uniformity. Sequential strategies after 2–3 years of tamoxifen to an AI for a total of 7–8 years have also shown benefit in multiple trials, and NCCN notes survival advantages with switch strategies compared with tamoxifen alone; however, optimal sequencing remains individualized, balancing efficacy, toxicity, and patient preference, and some patients may complete 10 years of tamoxifen if AI therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated [^116p3z3q] [^115RdUgf].

> I will now examine metastatic disease, where the bar for endocrine therapy is lower and sequencing is common. Tamoxifen remains a reasonable first-line endocrine option for ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic disease, particularly in resource-limited settings or when rapid access to AI therapy is not available; in premenopausal patients, ovarian suppression is required if using therapies other than tamoxifen, and tamoxifen can be paired with suppression in higher-risk scenarios [^112VJ1y7] [^111oyccr] [^114SRggP].

> Let me consider DCIS carefully, because the benefit is risk reduction rather than recurrence modification of invasive disease. After breast-conserving surgery and radiation, tamoxifen reduces the risk of ipsilateral and contralateral invasive breast cancer in ER-positive DCIS; the decision to use it should weigh absolute risk, patient preferences, and uterine risk, with shared decision-making emphasized in guidelines and labeling [^114jk6BD] [^112Gvx7A].

> For primary prevention, I should confirm eligibility and magnitude of benefit. The USPSTF recommends offering tamoxifen to women aged 35 years and older at increased breast cancer risk and at low risk for adverse effects, with an approximate 30–50% relative risk reduction in invasive ER-positive breast cancer. Uptake remains low in practice, underscoring the need for risk communication and toxicity mitigation strategies [^11354sdx] [^116BdCFK] [^111f2G5V].

> But wait, what about men with breast cancer; I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize from women's data. ASCO recommends tamoxifen as the standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for men for an initial 5 years, with consideration of an additional 5 years for those at high risk who tolerate therapy, acknowledging the evidence base is limited and toxicity may impact adherence [^117T6bKe] [^114A1tCa].

> Next, I should review resistance biology to explain sequencing and the role of alternative endocrine agents. Tamoxifen resistance evolves from initial sensitivity to acquired growth promotion in some contexts, with growth factor signaling crosstalk contributing. This mechanistic insight supports switching to agents with different modes of action, such as aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which degrades the ER and lacks partial agonist effects, thereby circumventing SERM-specific resistance pathways [^117Lpwmc] [^116op8t6] [^1167cMKb].

> I need to ensure the safety profile is integrated into decisions, especially for extended therapy. Tamoxifen increases risks of venous thromboembolism and endometrial cancer due to partial agonist effects, necessitating baseline gynecologic assessment and symptom surveillance; conversely, it may have favorable effects on bone and lipids compared with AIs, which carry higher risks of osteoporosis and arthralgias, so bone health monitoring and symptom management plans are essential when choosing and sequencing endocrine therapy [^114UaexW] [^112BqjXV] [^116oXAoG].

> Let me double-check practical prescribing details that affect adherence and outcomes. The standard adult dose is 20 mg daily, typically for 5 years in adjuvant settings, with extension to 10 years for appropriate candidates; low-dose regimens such as 5 mg daily are under study and may mitigate toxicity in prevention or intraepithelial neoplasia settings, though this remains investigational for many indications and should be individualized; steady-state of active metabolites may take 4–6 weeks, which can influence early assessments of response or tolerability [^114jk6BD] [^111bJ6yu] [^112amHUA] [^11113LuT].

> Hold on, I should verify one more nuance about sequencing and cross-resistance. Although AIs are often favored upfront in postmenopausal patients, tamoxifen retains activity as a second-line endocrine agent after AI failure, and randomized switch data support continued endocrine sequencing to prolong disease control. This reinforces the principle of leveraging non-cross-resistant mechanisms before moving to chemotherapy in HR-positive disease [^117VsP43] [^116p3z3q].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is coherent: tamoxifen remains a cornerstone for premenopausal adjuvant therapy, a validated option for DCIS risk reduction, a prevention agent for high-risk women, and a reasonable endocrine therapy in metastatic disease and in men. In postmenopausal patients, it is frequently sequenced with or replaced by AIs based on contemporary trial data, with extended endocrine strategies tailored to recurrence risk, tolerability, and patient preference, all grounded in its SERM mechanism and evolving resistance biology [^114M537x] [^115RdUgf] [^114jk6BD] [^114FjoPA].

Tamoxifen is used for **ER-positive breast cancer** [^114jk6BD] across settings: adjuvant therapy (5–10 years) [^114J45t9], metastatic disease [^1152EiX8], DCIS risk reduction [^114jk6BD], and primary prevention in high-risk women [^11354sdx]. It is the **standard for premenopausal patients** [^114M537x] and an option for postmenopausal patients when AIs are unsuitable or as part of sequential therapy [^115RdUgf]. Mechanistically, tamoxifen is a SERM that **competes with estrogen for ER binding** [^116ZJKKb], blocking estrogen-driven proliferation in breast tissue [^116LGhGx]; it has partial agonist effects in other tissues, causing endometrial thickening and thromboembolic risk [^114jbhmp]. Resistance can occur via ER pathway alterations or growth factor signaling [^117Lpwmc]; switching to AIs or fulvestrant is recommended in such cases [^116mDsmR].

## Clinical indications for tamoxifen use

Tamoxifen is indicated in **multiple clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Adjuvant therapy**: For early-stage ER-positive breast cancer [^114jk6BD], typically for 5 years [^115AK6NM]; extended therapy to 10 years is considered for high-risk patients [^114J45t9] [^117Wna3r].

- **Metastatic breast cancer**: Treatment of ER-positive metastatic disease [^1152EiX8], including premenopausal women as an alternative to ovarian ablation [^1152EiX8].

- **Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)**: Reduces risk of invasive breast cancer following surgery and radiation [^112Gvx7A].

- **Primary prevention**: For women at high risk of breast cancer [^11354sdx], including those with a family history or genetic predisposition (e.g. BRCA mutations) [^116psUfo].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Tamoxifen is selected based on **hormone receptor status**, menopausal status, and individual risk factors:

- **Hormone receptor status**: ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive (PR-positive) tumors [^115LKsi4] are most responsive to tamoxifen [^1152EiX8].

- **Menopausal status**: Tamoxifen is effective in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women [^114M537x], but aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are often preferred in postmenopausal patients due to superior efficacy [^117QKvt2].

- **Risk assessment**: For primary prevention, tamoxifen is recommended for women aged ≥ 35 years [^11354sdx] with a 5-year breast cancer risk ≥ 1.67% [^notfound] or a lifetime risk ≥ 20%.

---

## Mechanism of action

Tamoxifen exerts its therapeutic effects through **competitive inhibition of estrogen receptors**:

- **Competitive binding**: Tamoxifen binds to estrogen receptors (ERs) in breast tissue, blocking estrogen from binding and inhibiting estrogen-dependent transcription and proliferation [^116ZJKKb].

- **Partial agonist activity**: Tamoxifen has partial agonist effects in other tissues, such as bone and uterus, which can lead to beneficial effects (e.g. bone preservation) [^114UaexW] and adverse effects (e.g. endometrial hyperplasia) [^114jbhmp].

- **Active metabolites**: Tamoxifen is metabolized into active metabolites (e.g. endoxifen) that further enhance ER blockade and antitumor activity [^112amHUA].

---

## Resistance to tamoxifen

Resistance to tamoxifen can be **intrinsic or acquired**, limiting its efficacy:

- **Intrinsic resistance**: Tumors may inherently lack ER expression or have pre-existing resistance mechanisms [^112UYE6q].

- **Acquired resistance**: Tumors may develop resistance through ER pathway alterations, growth factor signaling (e.g. HER2, EGFR), or changes in coactivator/corepressor expression [^117Lpwmc].

- **Clinical implications**: Resistance necessitates alternative endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant [^116mDsmR].

---

## Side effects and risks

Tamoxifen is associated with several **side effects and risks**, including:

- **Hot flashes**: Common vasomotor symptoms [^114UaexW].

- **Endometrial cancer**: Increased risk due to partial agonist activity in the uterus [^114C8HAt].

- **Thromboembolic events**: Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^116iE7aD].

- **Ocular toxicity**: Rare but serious [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other endocrine therapies

Tamoxifen is often compared with **aromatase inhibitors (AIs)** and fulvestrant:

| **Attribute** | **Tamoxifen** | **Aromatase inhibitors** | **Fulvestrant** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | SERM | Estrogen synthesis inhibition | ER degradation |
| Menopausal status | Pre- and postmenopausal | Postmenopausal | Pre- and postmenopausal |
| Efficacy | High in ER-positive tumors | Superior in postmenopausal | Effective in resistant cases |
| Side effects | Endometrial cancer, thromboembolism | Osteoporosis, arthralgia | Injection site reactions |

---

Tamoxifen remains a **cornerstone therapy** for ER-positive breast cancer, particularly in premenopausal women, with its use tailored to patient characteristics, tumor biology, and resistance patterns [^114M537x].

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^114M537x]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO adjuvant endocrine therapy — premenopausal at diagnosis — states that women who are pre- or perimenopausal at diagnosis should be treated with 5 years of tamoxifen; women diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who are pre/perimenopausal should be offered adjuvant endocrine therapy as follows: tamoxifen for an initial duration of 5 years; after 5 years, women should receive additional therapy based on menopausal status; if women are pre/perimenopausal, or if menopausal status is unknown or cannot be determined, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years (Evidence Quality: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong); or if women have become definitively postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or should switch to up to 5 years of an AI for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Evidence Quality for tamoxifen: High, Evidence Quality for AI: High; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Role of raloxifene in breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women: clinical evidence and potential mechanisms of action [^115xFXFZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Raloxifene is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study, an osteoporosis treatment trial, raloxifene therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of invasive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09–0.30).

Objective

This review summarizes available preclinical and clinical data pertaining to a potential role for raloxifene in the prevention of breast cancer, and examines the mechanisms of action by which raloxifene may exert an effect.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of MEDLINE for English-language studies published between 1966 and January 2003. Search terms included raloxifene, keoxifene, tamoxifen, SERM, estrogen, estrogen receptor, breast, mammary, growth factors, and apoptosis. The reference lists of identified articles were reviewed for additional publications.

Results

Both preclinical and clinical data suggest a role for raloxifene in the prevention of breast cancer. Like tamoxifen, raloxifene acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue through competitive binding to the ER. Raloxifene may also inhibit breast tissue proliferation through mechanisms independent of the ER.

Conclusions

Given raloxifene's mechanism of action and the preclinical evidence for its role in breast cancer prevention, a clinically favorable effect seems feasible. Results of ongoing clinical studies will provide evidence to support or refute the clinical findings of MORE and thus raloxifene's role in the breast cancer prevention.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MBC WHO ARE PREMENOPAUSAL THAT'S UNIQUE AS COMPARED TO THOSE WHO ARE POSTMENOPAUSAL?

When treating patients who are premenopausal, the same recommendations apply as in the case of postmenopausal patients, with one caveat. Whenever hormonal therapy — besides tamoxifen — is indicated, ovarian ablation is a prerequisite. It is recommended in addition to any modality used for treatment and can be combined with either tamoxifen or an AI, depending on availability and patients' tolerance. Surgical oophorectomy or radiotherapy ablation (when available) should be recommended rather than medical ovarian suppression strategies. For those patients who cannot tolerate ovarian ablation, tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative. Only surgeons with gynecologic surgical expertise should perform oophorectomies.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^1136s8fT]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

CLASSICAL CONCEPT OF TUMOUR TARGETING

The discovery of the ER as a critical component of the oestrogen signal-transduction pathway in target tissues and the utilisation of this knowledge as a target for antihormonal therapy in breast cancer improved the survival prospects for millions of breast cancer patients. However, the advance with antioestrogens occurred not only because of targeting the ER, to prevent oestrogen-stimulated tumour growth, but also because of the application of the appropriate duration of treatment. During the 1970s, when tamoxifen was initially being evaluated as an adjuvant therapy in patients, laboratory studies demonstrated that longer durations of complete antihormonal therapy were likely to provide more benefit for patients than shorter durations of therapy. At the time, the majority of clinical trials elected to use 1 year of therapy, because there was a sincere concern that longer durations would enhance the possibility of premature drug resistance. Following the methodical evaluation of randomised clinical trials, conducted over the past 20 years, it is now clear that 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen is only minimally effective, but 5 years of tamoxifen produces an increase in disease-free and overall survival. The use of long-term (5 years) adjuvant antihormone therapy is now standard for the treatment of breast cancer therapy.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1112k7jY]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force — risk-reducing medication selection by menopausal status notes that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors all reduce primary breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Use of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors is indicated only in postmenopausal women; only tamoxifen is indicated for risk reduction of primary breast cancer in premenopausal women.

### Clinical management of adverse events in adjuvant therapy for hormone-responsive early breast cancer [^116oXAoG]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Systemic adjuvant therapy has proven highly effective at reducing recurrences and deaths in patients who have received primary therapy for early breast cancer. However, as with all treatments, adjuvant therapy can cause unwanted side effects, and effective management of these events is essential to ensure that patients comply with, and continue, treatment. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is not associated with the more severe, acute toxicities of chemotherapy, and can therefore be taken for many years. At present, the standard duration of postoperative adjuvant endocrine therapy is 5 years. Prevention and treatment of adverse events associated with long-term endocrine therapy is particularly important in the adjuvant setting, where patients are clinically cancer free. In this situation, the efficacy benefits are not, therefore, obvious to the patient, but side effects may have a negative impact on daily life. Tamoxifen has been the gold standard endocrine therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer for many years, and the long-term side effects of this agent are well documented. In recent years, the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have begun to displace tamoxifen as the adjuvant therapy of choice, owing to greater efficacy and good tolerability. Predictably, the AIs and tamoxifen have partially overlapping side-effect profiles. Both therapies are associated with typical symptoms of estrogen deprivation; however, tamoxifen also has estrogenic activity in some tissues, which can cause either detrimental (genital tract) or beneficial (bone, cardiovascular system, lipids) effects that are not associated with AI use. To reduce treatment discontinuations, it is important that patients are made aware of the possible side effects of adjuvant therapy and the management strategies available to them, prior to starting therapy. The role of physical, alternative and pharmaceutical therapies in the management of adverse events associated with endocrine therapy has been investigated, and strategies are now available to alleviate symptoms and enable patients to benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy without a significant adverse impact on quality of life.

### Ongoing data from the breast cancer prevention trials: opportunity for breast cancer risk reduction [^115BVCQA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the compelling results of chemoprevention trials using SERMs for breast cancer risk reduction, there has been minimal use of either tamoxifen or raloxifene by women at risk for breast cancer. A number of reasons have been put forth to explain why patients may not be willing to adopt a SERM for breast cancer risk reduction. HRT is still widely used by postmenopausal women, even after published results showed an associated increased risk for breast cancer, but its use is contraindicated with concurrent SERM therapy. Patients erroneously perceive the risks of SERM therapy to be greater than its benefits, and they perceive the risks of therapy-related side effects to be greater than their risk of breast cancer. This problem is confounded by the fact that they (and perhaps their physicians) are confused by the concept of probabilistic risk. Finally, they fear endometrial cancer out of proportion to its true tamoxifen-related risk and do not understand that there is no increased risk of uterine malignancy associated with raloxifene; we must hope that lasofoxifene does not soon suffer the same fate of misinformation. Additional reasons not to adopt and initiate strategies to reduce the risk of breast cancer include the fear of adverse effects, medication costs, lack of reasonably accurate and feasible methods for assessing personal individual risk, and lack of established risk thresholds that maximize benefit and minimize harms.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^117Nfexj]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that SERMs introduce a new dimension into therapeutics for the prevention of osteoporosis and CHD, the question of unlimited treatment durations with SERMs will have consequences for the natural history of breast cancer. Early reductions in the incidence of ER-positive disease will potentially result in SERM-resistant breast cancers, thereby confronting the oncologist with unanticipated and complex treatment decisions in an increasing proportion of women. However, laboratory studies have established a new understanding of SERM resistance that could potentially convert breast cancer from an acute to a chronic, controllable disease.

CHANGES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ANTIHORMONE RESISTANCE

During the past 20 years, there has been an important change in the understanding of drug resistance to the antioestrogen tamoxifen. In the early 1980s, tamoxifen was anticipated to be effective in ER-positive breast cancers, but ineffective in ER-negative disease. Resistance to tamoxifen would develop because the ER-positive tumour cells would be controlled, but eventually these would be overwhelmed by the outgrowth of ER-negative breast cancer cells (Figure 1A

Figure 1
The evolution of antihormonal resistance. (A) About 20 years ago, it was believed that oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumours would usually be expected to respond to oestrogen withdrawal or a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) such as tamoxifen, but eventually resistance would occur because ER− cells would overgrow the tumour. (B) Emerging laboratory and clinical evidence suggests that SERM resistance evolves from acquired resistance (Phase I) to Phase II, where any SERM will maintain growth, whereas, unliganded ER does not provoke growth. However, oestrogen at physiological levels causes rapid apoptosis. In Phase III, tumours are completely resistant to all antihormonal therapies and grow spontaneously. Nevertheless, physiological concentrations of oestrogen causes rapid apoptosis.). However, this model was not consistent with the known clinical observation that select patients with metastatic breast cancer could be maintained on successive endocrine therapies for prolonged periods.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on the use of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: status report 2004 [^116dP5fu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update the 2003 American Society of Clinical Oncology technology assessment on adjuvant use of aromatase inhibitors.

Recommendations

Based on results from multiple large randomized trials, adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer should include an aromatase inhibitor in order to lower the risk of tumor recurrence. Neither the optimal timing nor duration of aromatase inhibitor therapy is established. Aromatase inhibitors are appropriate as initial treatment for women with contraindications to tamoxifen. For all other postmenopausal women, treatment options include 5 years of aromatase inhibitors treatment or sequential therapy consisting of tamoxifen (for either 2 to 3 years or 5 years) followed by aromatase inhibitors for 2 to 3, or 5 years. Patients intolerant of aromatase inhibitors should receive tamoxifen. There are no data on the use of tamoxifen after an aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant setting. Women with hormone receptor-negative tumors should not receive adjuvant endocrine therapy. The role of other biomarkers such as progesterone receptor and HER2 status in selecting optimal endocrine therapy remains controversial. Aromatase inhibitors are contraindicated in premenopausal women; there are limited data concerning their role in women with treatment-related amenorrhea. The side effect profiles of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors differ. The late consequences of aromatase inhibitor therapy, including osteoporosis, are not well characterized.

Conclusion

The Panel believes that optimal adjuvant hormonal therapy for a postmenopausal woman with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with tamoxifen. Women with breast cancer and their physicians must weigh the risks and benefits of all therapeutic options.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline Q and a… [^111oyccr]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Premenopausal metastatic breast cancer — endocrine therapy caveat: When treating patients who are premenopausal, the same recommendations apply as in the case of postmenopausal patients, with one caveat. Whenever hormonal therapy — besides tamoxifen — is indicated, ovarian ablation is a pre- requisite; it is recommended in addition to any modality used for treatment and can be combined with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI), depending on availability and patients' tolerance.

### The estrogen receptor: a model for molecular medicine [^1127r3Kp]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

The identification of the estrogen receptor (ER) in the laboratory provided a mechanism to describe the target site specificity of estrogen action in uterus, vagina, pituitary gland, and breast cancer. Most importantly, a test was established to predict the outcome of antihormonal therapy in breast cancer, and a target was identified to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The development of tamoxifen for the treatment of all stages of ER-positive breast cancers has resulted in the improved survival of breast cancer patients. However, the recognition of selective ER modulation, i.e., estrogen-like action in bones and lowering circulating cholesterol but antiestrogenic actions in breast and uterus, has resulted in the development of multifunctional medicines with the goal of preventing not only breast and uterine cancer but also osteoporosis and coronary heart disease.

### Safety of adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer [^112BqjXV]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as adjuvant endocrine therapy for hormone-sensitive breast cancer is increasing, as these drugs are more effective than tamoxifen alone in improving disease-free survival in breast cancer patients-whether used in lieu of tamoxifen as upfront therapy or after tamoxifen treatment periods of 2 years or longer. AIs differ from tamoxifen in their mechanism of action, effectively suppressing estrogen levels in postmenopausal women to near-undetectable levels. AI-associated adverse events largely mimic menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, losses in bone mineral density, gynecologic symptoms, and arthralgias. The AIs lack the infrequent but potentially serious adverse events associated with tamoxifen (eg, endometrial cancer, thromboembolic events, and stroke). Large randomized studies of AIs in the adjuvant setting have not demonstrated an adverse effect on lipids and cardiovascular health, but postmenopausal women receiving AIs are at risk for age-related changes in lipid parameters and an increased risk for cardiovascular events. To optimize the overall benefits of adjuvant endocrine therapy with an AI, patients should be monitored for bone loss and cardiovascular risk factors, and symptoms such as joint pain and vaginal dryness should be anticipated and managed proactively.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy in older women (ACTION) study-what did we learn from the pilot phase? [^112ZhT7c]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the western world, affecting one in nine women at some time in her life, with over 41 000 new cases and 13 000 deaths each year in the United Kingdom alone. In 2006, 33% (12 532) of new cases in the United Kingdom were in women aged 70 or over.

The increased incidence is primarily as a result of an ageing population and the changing lifestyle factors of that population, for example, later age at first birth, with the median age of onset being ∼65 years. Projected population forecasts in Western countries indicate that the proportion of older women will increase dramatically over the next 50 years, which will result in a significant increase in the number of older women diagnosed with breast cancer. However, data from the EUROCARE II study show that patients aged 65 to 99 diagnosed with breast cancer had a relative risk of cancer-related death at 1 year of 1.7 compared with those aged 55–64, although this reduced to 1.09 at 5 years. The reduction in mortality is therefore not uniform across all age ranges, with the 50% of women who present with the disease over the age of 70 years appearing to benefit least from recent advances.

Endocrine therapy, with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, is routinely used for older patients with hormone responsive disease. Clinical trials are currently examining age-related variations in surgical care and radiotherapy. However, the best management for older patients with high-risk disease, which is not hormone responsive, remains uncertain. The general observation of improvements in survival with respect to breast cancer are essentially confined to women aged < 70. It may not be coincidental that this age-associated cancer-specific survival is mirrored by the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy for early stage disease in younger patients.

With an average life expectancy of 15.3 years for a 70-year-old woman in the United Kingdom, the potential to gain a significant number of life years amply justifies research aimed at better targeting of chemotherapy treatment. Despite this, clinical trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy in this age group are sparse. A study of patients enrolled in 164 Southwest Oncology Group trials in the United States found that patients aged 65 and over were underrepresented in trials, with only 9% of patients enrolled in breast cancer trials aged over 65, despite 49% of breast cancer patients being in that age group. The findings were similar when trials excluding older patients were omitted from the analysis.

### Breast cancer index is a predictive biomarker of treatment benefit and outcome from extended tamoxifen therapy: final analysis of the trans-aTTom study [^117Wna3r]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aTTom (Adjuvant Tamoxifen — To Offer More?) trial is a pivotal prospective phase III study that established the benefit of an additional 5 years of tamoxifen in patients with early-stage hormone receptor–positive (HR +) breast cancer following the standard 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. The aTTom trial randomized 6,953 patients to receive either 5 or 10 years of tamoxifen and demonstrated improved outcomes from the additional 5 years of tamoxifen with respect to disease-free interval (DFI) at a median 8.9 years of follow-up [HR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77–0.96; P = 0.006]. In addition, results showed that the impact of extended tamoxifen increased in a time-dependent manner: a reduction in breast cancer-related deaths was observed with increased duration of tamoxifen treatment after year 5. Results from the aTTom trial were consistent with findings from other extended endocrine therapy trials, which reported modest benefits in absolute risk reduction with notable side effects and toxicities. At the same time, benefit from extended endocrine therapy is sensitive to the type, duration, and sequence of therapies administered. Studies of extended tamoxifen therapy following primary adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen reported significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) of about 3.8%. Trials that examined extended aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy following primary adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen also reported benefit, in DFS or in either recurrence-free interval (RFI) or recurrence-free survival (RFS; refs.). However, results from investigations of extended AI therapy following primary adjuvant therapy that included an AI were mixed, with reports of both improvement in DFS and no improvement in DFS. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend up to 10 years of an AI for postmenopausal women with moderate to high risk based on clinicopathologic features and prognostic biomarkers. Multi-gene classifiers that provide insight into endocrine sensitivity and benefit may provide an individualized approach to evaluating risk versus benefit and guide de-escalation or extension of endocrine treatment.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer [^111X5iYU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Estrogens play a pivotal role in the development of breast cancer. Endocrine therapy based on estrogen blockade is a well-established treatment in hormone-dependent breast cancer. Tamoxifen citrate has long been considered the "gold standard" due to its relative safety and efficacy. Aromatase inhibitors are anti-estrogen agents that target specifically the aromatase enzyme, which is the final step in the estrogen production. The first use of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer was associated with adverse effects such as rash, drowsiness, and adrenal-gland suppression. Newer third-generation agents are emerging as potential alternatives to tamoxifen, associating clinical efficacy with a more favorable safety profile.

Objectives

The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms of actions pharmacology, adverse effects, and clinical applications of the aromatase inhibitors available in the United States.

Methods

The terms breast cancer or neoplasia, aromatase, aromatase inhibitors, third-generation, endocrine therapy, and antiestrogens were used to search MEDLINE for English-language studies published between 1966 and April 2004. A parallel search was performed at the corresponding Web site of each of the aromatase inhibitors available in the United States. Identified publications relevant to the article objectives were selected.

Results

Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are the 3 commercially available aromatase inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. They have been used in several clinical scenarios, including advanced and early disease and chemoprevention, and in the neoadjuvant setting. There is evidence that aromatase inhibitors are more effective and tolerable than tamoxifen in advanced breast cancer and in the neoadjuvant setting. Based on the results of a large, randomized trial, their use in early disease and in chemoprevention is also promising. Aromatase inhibitors appear safe; however, the long-term safety profile is still unknown, especially concerning bone metabolism.

Conclusion

Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are a new treatment modality in estrogen and/or progesterone-receptor positive breast cancer. Although they are replacing the "classic" antiestrogen agents used in metastatic breast cancer, their benefit in early disease and as chemopreventive agents is not completely clear. Ongoing clinical studies should become available within the next few years and will provide additional recommendations for their use in patients with breast cancer.

### Appraising adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy [^115a4c1B]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen, once the gold standard adjuvant endocrine therapy for early breast cancer, is being challenged by third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) that have demonstrated improved disease-free survival in a variety of adjuvant settings for early breast cancer. Tamoxifen and AIs have different safety profiles, which should allow physicians to begin to individualize treatment based on a patient's comorbidities and risk factors. Because of its properties as a partial estrogen agonist, tamoxifen has a positive effect on serum lipids and may confer a cardioprotective benefit, as well as a beneficial effect on bone health. However, tamoxifen increases the risk for endometrial cancer and cerebrovascular/thromboembolic events. In comparison, the major side effect of AIs is increased bone loss, which may heighten the risk for osteoporotic fractures and bone pain. Because of their superior efficacy and manageable side effects, AIs are a cost-effective alternative to tamoxifen, and clinical guidelines now embrace AIs as appropriate adjuvant therapy for hormone-sensitive early breast cancer. The anticipated results of ongoing trials will provide further insights into the long-term safety and application of AI therapy in the adjuvant setting.

### Tamoxifen citrate [^1152EiX8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metastatic Breast Cancer:

Tamoxifen citrate tablets, USP are effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women and men. In premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer, tamoxifen is an alternative to oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation. Available evidence indicates that patients whose tumors are estrogen receptor positive are more likely to benefit from tamoxifen therapy.

Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer:

Tamoxifen citrate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of node-positive breast cancer in women following total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation. In some tamoxifen adjuvant studies, most of the benefit to date has been in the subgroup with four or more positive axillary nodes.

Tamoxifen citrate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of axillary node-negative breast cancer in women following total mastectomy or segmental mastectomy, axillary dissection, and breast irradiation.

The estrogen and progesterone receptor values may help to predict whether adjuvant tamoxifen therapy is likely to be beneficial.

Tamoxifen reduces the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer in patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer.

Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS):

In women with DCIS, following breast surgery and radiation, tamoxifen citrate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer (see BOXED WARNING at the beginning of the label). The decision regarding therapy with tamoxifen for the reduction in breast cancer incidence should be based upon an individual assessment of the benefits and risks of tamoxifen therapy.

Current data from clinical trials support 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for patients with breast cancer.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^111vyATe]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

There is an expanding clinical database that implicates oestrogen and progestins (hormone replacement therapy, HRT) in the development and growth of breast cancer. Evidence to support this conclusion comes from two major clinical sources: clinical studies of HRT, initially designed to determine the benefits of replacement approaches on postmenopausal women's health and the successful clinical strategy of treating breast cancer by blocking oestrogen action.

The Million Woman Study provides powerful information about the actual impact of HRT on the incidence of breast cancer. A total of 1 084 110 UK women aged 50–64 years were recruited to determine the association of HRT use with breast cancer incidence and death. It is estimated that 10 years use of HRT produces 19 additional breast cancers per 1000 users. These data extrapolate to an estimated total of an excess of 15 000 breast cancers associated with HRT over the past decade in the UK.

In contrast to the effects of hormone replacement on the incidence of breast cancer, the use of either an antioestrogen, tamoxifen, to block the action of oestrogen in breast cancer, or an aromatase inhibitor, to prevent oestrogen synthesis in postmenopausal patients, is effective, and is considered to be the standard treatment strategy for breast cancer. Indeed, the concept of antioestrogenic interventions has been advanced with the reduction of risk from breast cancer by using tamoxifen or raloxifene, as well as suggestions for the evaluation of a number of aromatase inhibitors as chemopreventives in high-risk postmenopausal populations.

To the casual observer, the clinical evidence appears to demonstrate that oestrogen is detrimental to women's health and especially implicated in breast cancer development and growth. However, there have been consequences to current antihormonal strategies and we will propose new concepts about antihormonal drug resistance in breast cancer, which can be rapidly incorporated into the treatment plan. In otherwords, there are now opportunities to kill sensitised tumour cells with oestrogen and advance a new innovation in therapeutics.

### The optimal duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer – with what drugs and for how long? [^111fwDBK]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy has made a significant impact in improving overall survival for women with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used therapy, although in post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have further improved outcomes either as an alternative to tamoxifen for 5 years, or given in sequential fashion following initial tamoxifen therapy. However, late recurrence remains perhaps the biggest risk in HR-positive breast cancer, with more than half all recurrences occurring beyond 5 years since primary diagnosis. As such, the current debate is whether extended AI or prolonged tamoxifen therapy should be given, and if so, to whom. We review some of the recent studies that have addressed this question and demonstrated further reduction in risk of recurrence, and discuss the clinical issues that face women and their health care providers in determining who should use which drug, and for how long.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116LGhGx]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer chemoprevention mechanisms and regulatory status — Tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective ER modulators that inhibit ERs in breast tissue and reduce risk for ER-positive breast cancer by blocking the proliferation of estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells where breast cancer can develop, and these medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit conversion of androgen to estrogen and can reduce risk of ER-positive breast cancer by decreasing the amount of estrogen available to bind to estrogen-sensitive epithelial cells, but aromatase inhibitors are not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for risk reduction of primary breast cancer.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH MBC AND UNKNOWN RECEPTOR STATUS?

In Basic settings, if no immunohistochemistry testing is available, clinicians may presume hormone receptor positivity and offer tamoxifen in most cases. This is based on the higher prevalence of hormone receptor–positive tumors worldwide and the relatively low toxicity of tamoxifen. Another alternative is single-agent chemotherapy. Combination regimens may be offered for symptomatic or immediately life-threatening disease for which time may allow only one potential chance for therapy. Clinicians may offer primary surgery for palliative reasons, including local control.

### Mechanisms of endocrine resistance and novel therapeutic strategies in breast cancer [^117Lpwmc]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen has been the mainstay of hormonal therapy in both early and advanced breast cancer patients for approximately three decades. The availability of novel compounds such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and fulvestrant, with different mechanism of action, is changing the scenario of endocrine treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer patients. In this review article, we have summarized the current knowledge of the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy, in order to derive information that might be useful for therapeutic intervention. We propose that resistance to endocrine therapy is a progressive, step-wise phenomenon induced by the selective pressure of hormonal agents, which leads breast cancer cells from an estrogen-dependent, responsive to endocrine manipulation phenotype to a non-responsive phenotype, and eventually to an estrogen-independent phenotype. In particular, evidence suggests for each 'action' introduced to block estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells (i.e. treatment with anti-estrogen), there are one or more corresponding 'reactions' that tumor cells can use to escape our attempts to block their growth: estrogen hypersensitivity associated with increased transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and/or increased non-genomic activity of ERalpha, estrogen supersensitivity, increased growth factor signaling, suppression of ERalpha expression and finally estrogen independence. Activation of growth factor signaling is involved in each step of this phenomenon, and might ultimately substitute estrogen in sustaining the growth and the survival of breast cancer cells. In this respect, results of pre-clinical and clinical studies with AIs, fulvestrant and signaling inhibitors sustain this hypothesis. More importantly, the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the resistance of breast cancer cells to endocrine therapy offers potential for novel therapeutic strategies.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^114SMKGL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Duration of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction — while the standard duration is 5 years, women who stop endocrine therapy after 3 years will likely still derive a benefit, based on the 50% risk reduction observed with 3 years of low-dose tamoxifen versus placebo and the 65% risk reduction reported in MAP3 after a median of 3 years of exemestane; currently, raloxifene is the only drug with clinical trial experience of more than 5 years of use for breast cancer risk reduction, and there are no data from randomized trials for tamoxifen, exemestane, or anastrozole to be given for longer than 5 years for women without a prior diagnosis of cancer, therefore this practice is not advised; furthermore, in adjuvant cancer treatment trials comparing 10 years versus 5 years of treatment, tamoxifen was associated with an increase in the risk of uterine cancer and pulmonary embolism and exemestane with an increase in the risk of osteoporosis, fracture, and hypertension.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^115AK6NM]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Section 3D — Length of endocrine therapy — adjuvant tamoxifen duration and baseline recommendations are outlined: in a meta-analysis of 55 trials of ER+/ER unknown tumors, one year of tamoxifen reduced recurrence by 21%, 2 years by 29%, and 5 years by 47%, with mortality and contralateral breast cancers similarly reduced and no effect in ER negative disease; both node negative and node positive patients benefitted, with the latter benefiting most. In NSABP B-14 (all node negative), 5 years of tamoxifen produced better disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with extended therapy, and "The consensus was to recommend 5 years of tamoxifen outside a clinical trial". Patients at a higher recurrence risk do benefit from extended endocrine therapy, but "There is, however, a paucity of data showing an OS benefit with extended endocrine therapy".

### Lessons learned from a candidate gene study investigating aromatase inhibitor treatment outcome in breast cancer [^11113LuT]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer and leading cause of cancer death in womenaffecting both pre- and postmenopausal women. Most breast cancers (75%) express the estrogen receptor α (ERα) known to fuel tumor growth through estrogen signaling. Its presence renders early-stage breast cancers (i.e. tumors that have not spread beyond breast and nearby lymph nodes) amenable to endocrine therapy as the key therapeutic approach. Valid adjuvant options include the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen that competes with estrogen for the binding to ERα to block signaling, and the 3 rd generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane that remove estrogen from the signaling cascade by blocking its synthesis. AIs evolved as the standard-of-care for postmenopausal womenand have become an option for premenopausal women together with concurrent ovarian suppression. Their mechanism of action in lowering estrogen levels is particularly important for postmenopausal women, as AIs target the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) in peripheral nonglandular tissues (and breast tumor) to block the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to 17β-estradiol and estrone, respectively. Current guidelines recommend 5 to 10 years of treatment to maximize risk-reduction. During this period and beyond, women continue to be at risk of recurrence and death that extends for decades following treatment. Therefore, additional biomarkers for the proper selection of drug treatment regimens are a high research priority.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^114J45t9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — appropriate sequence after 5 years of tamoxifen — includes the following directives: Women who have received 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered additional adjuvant endocrine treatment. If women are postmenopausal, they should be offered continued tamoxifen for a total duration of 10 years or should switch to up to 5 years of AI for a total duration of up to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Type: Evidence-Based, Evidence Quality: High, Strength of Recommendation: Strong). If women are premenopausal or menopausal status cannot be ascertained, they should be offered 5 additional years of tamoxifen for a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy (Type: Evidence-Based, Evidence Quality: High, Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Should aromatase inhibitors be used as initial adjuvant treatment or sequenced after tamoxifen? [^1113ACLy]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

A number of trials have studied the value of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for the adjuvant treatment of early hormone-responsive postmenopausal breast cancer. Three different AIs have been used and they have been compared as initial treatment (two trials) or after 2–3 years of tamoxifen (four trials), in both cases against a standard arm of 5 years of tamoxifen. In addition, two trials have evaluated AIs against no treatment after 5 years of tamoxifen. In all circumstances, the AIs have demonstrated superior efficacy. However, no results are currently available for the key question, that is – is it better to start initially with an AI or use it sequentially after 2 years of tamoxifen? Here, we review the trial results and present two models, which address this issue. The models clearly show that early treatment with an AI is superior to using it after 5 years of tamoxifen. They also favour an upfront strategy to sequencing after 2 years of tamoxifen, but in this case the differences are small and model-dependent. A key question is whether AIs have substantially better efficacy than tamoxifen for ER-positive–PgR-negative tumours, where the data are currently contradictory. A mechanism explaining why greater efficacy might be so is proposed. Further results from ongoing trials will be needed to resolve this issue.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer [^116yikxr]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

CURRENT GUIDELINES AND THE AROMATASE INHIBITORS

Both theand The Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiative have added aromatase inhibitors to their guidelines alongside tamoxifen as first-line therapy in postmenopausal oestrogen receptor-positive women with advanced breast cancer. The European Society of Mastology has also added aromatase inhibitors as first-line therapy in their advanced breast cancer guidelines.

Following the publication of the first results from the ATAC study, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) reviewed their guidelines on adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Their recommendations were that a 5-year course of tamoxifen should remain as standard therapy with adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor only in postmenopausal women with a relative or absolute contraindication to tamoxifen.

### Tamoxifen evolution [^113oAcj9]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Tamoxifen and early breast cancer

The relatively low toxicity of tamoxifen lead to the establishment of multiple clinical trials where the comparator with tamoxifen was the then current standard of no adjuvant therapy. The main issues to be addressed were the optimal duration of therapy and the toxicity in this early breast cancer setting. The first trial initiated in 1976 tested 1 year of tamoxifen treatment, the second 2 years and the third 5 years. These, and multiple later adjuvant trials, were reviewed by the Early Breast Cancer Trials Collaborative Group. Reductions in recurrence after about 10 years of follow-up were 21%, 29% and 47% for 1, 2 and 5 years of treatment, respectively. The corresponding mortality reductions were 12%, 17% and 26%, respectively, with a significantly significant test for trends in both recurrence and mortality.

The data from the EBCTCG led to the introduction of 5 years of tamoxifen as the standard of care as adjuvant therapy. Two trials were devised to explore the value of extending treatment to 10 years compared with 5 years. The ATLAS trial randomised 12,894 patients to either stop tamoxifen treatment at 5 years or to continue to complete a total of 10 years of therapy and showed a significant reduction in recurrence and mortality with the longer versus shorter treatment (recurrence at years 21.4% vs 25% and mortality 12.2% vs 15.0% for 5 and 10 years, respectively). Extended tamoxifen was associated with small increases in pulmonary embolism (HR 1.87; P = 0.01, and endometrial cancer (HR 1.30; P = 0.0002) and a reduction in ischaemic heart disease (HR 0.75; P = 0.02).

The ATTOM trial randomised 6,953 patients with ER-positive early breast cancer to the same approach and showed improved outcome with longer therapy with respect to breast cancer recurrence (P = 0.003) and breast cancer mortality (P = 0.05), although these data are still to be published.

These, and other, studies have led to changes in guidelines recommending extended treatment durations in women with poorer prognosis disease. The quantification of the risk of late recurrence in ER + EBC and novel, predominantly clinic-genomic assays to identify those at increased risk, will hopefully guide future extended adjuvant therapy strategies.

MECHANISM UNDERLYING THE PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF ANTIESTROGENS

In large randomized preventive trials of tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, these endocrine therapies have reduced the risk of ER-positive breast cancer by 30%-50%, particularly in women with an increased risk of breast cancer. – However, tamoxifen did not reduce breast cancer risk in women who never used estrogen-alone HRT (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67–1.50). Counterintuitively, the tamoxifen-mediated risk reduction of breast cancer was pronounced among women who also used estrogen-alone HRT (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.2–0.95).

Tamoxifen has dual properties as antiestrogenic and estrogenic in breast tissue and breast cancer, depending upon its concentrations and biological context. Absent estrogen, tamoxifen exhibits partial estrogenic activity, whereas in the presence of estrogen, tamoxifen acts as an antiestrogen that decreases estrogen-induced PgR expression. – Accordingly, tamoxifen exhibited higher sensitivity to ER-positive/PgR-positive breast tumors than ER-positive/PgR-negative breast tumors. Similarly, endocrine therapy was more effective in reducing recurrence and mortality for breast tumors expressing both ER and PgR (ER positive/PgR positive) than ER-positive/PgR-negative breast tumors. – Fittingly, tamoxifen resistance was associated with a loss of PgR expression in ER-positive/PgR-positive breast tumors.

Together, these findings suggest that the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens may be mediated by the ability of antiestrogens to suppress progesterone signaling.

### Tamoxifen citrate [^111PUuyr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3 summarizes the major outcomes of the NSABP P-1 trial. For each endpoint, the following results are presented: the number of events and rate per 1,000 women per year for the placebo and tamoxifen groups; and the relative risk (RR) and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) between tamoxifen and placebo. Relative risks less than 1.0 indicate a benefit of tamoxifen therapy. The limits of the confidence intervals can be used to assess the statistical significance of the benefits or risks of tamoxifen therapy. If the upper limit of the CI is less than 1.0, then a statistically significant benefit exists.

For most participants, multiple risk factors would have been required for eligibility. This table considers risk factors individually, regardless of other co-existing risk factors, for women who developed breast cancer. The 5-year predicted absolute breast cancer risk accounts for multiple risk factors in an individual and should provide the best estimate of individual benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).

Table 4 describes the characteristics of the breast cancers in the NSABP P-1 trial and includes tumor size, nodal status, ER status. Tamoxifen decreased the incidence of small estrogen receptor positive tumors, but did not alter the incidence of estrogen receptor negative tumors or larger tumors.

Interim results from 2 trials in addition to the NSABP P-1 trial examining the effects of tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer incidence have been reported.

### Window-of-opportunity trials to screen effective agents and optimize dose in breast cancer prevention [^112amHUA]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This literature review of WOO trials suggests that several agents both hormonal and nonhormonal have the potential to be promising actors within future preventive trials for breast cancer risk reduction.

Tamoxifen at 5 mg daily offers a significant benefit in preventing local and contralateral recurrences in women with IEN. According to these data, ASCO clinical practice guidelines has incorporated low-dose tamoxifen as an option in women with IEN. The effective role of low-dose tamoxifen after IEN was also implemented by the NCCN guidelines in case the patient suffers from side effects with the dosage of 20 mg or is unable to take the conventional dose. Recent real-world studies have highlighted low-dose tamoxifen as the most popular choice of preventive therapy for high-risk women –. Notably, tamoxifen has a long time to Cmax concentrations and plasma half-life of approximately 5–7 days, while its active metabolite, endoxifen, has an even longer half-life of 7–14 days. As a result, steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved only after 4–6 weeks of continuous administration. This delay in reaching steady-state can influence the biological response observed in short-duration WOO trials, potentially underestimating the full pharmacodynamic impact of tamoxifen. To address this, alternative pharmacokinetic modeling approaches or prolonged intervention periods should be considered in future WOO studies to ensure accurate assessment of drug efficacy.

Along the line of hormonal treatments, exemestane 3 times a week has been documented to be non-inferior to exemestane daily in decreasing ultrasensitive estradiol and Ki-67 LI levels in women with ER-positive early breast cancer. These results may also help to increase compliance and improve prognosis in intolerant women in the adjuvant setting. In addition, in a comparison WOO trial with celecoxib, exemestane correlated with an antiproliferative effect whereas celecoxib did not affect breast cancer proliferation, further supporting the use of exemestane as an effective agent in the prevention setting. Based on these promising results, a comparison between exemestane given every other day versus low-dose tamoxifen every other day in high-risk women has been launched (BabyTears, NCT06364267).

Among WOO trials with molecularly targeted agents selected in this review, lapatinib successfully resulted to reduce cell proliferation in women with premalignant breast lesions and HER2-positive breast cancer, thus supporting its role in the preventive therapy of HER-2 positive IEN.

### NCCN breast cancer clinical practice guidelines in oncology: an update [^116cQDZW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

The 2002 NCCN Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology represent the 7th annual update produced by a multidisciplinary panel of breast cancer experts from the NCCN member institutions. The Breast Cancer Panel uses an objective, evidence-based method when high-level evidence from clinical trials exists. In clinical situations in which high-level evidence is lacking, recommendations are generated through a multidisciplinary consensus development process. The NCCN institutions also review the complete guideline on an annual basis. In this update, several of the modifications in the 2002 Breast Cancer Guidelines are highlighted, including the use of aromatase inhibitors and leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists plus tamoxifen in the first-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer and the use of anastrozole in the adjuvant setting. The new guidelines for axillary lymph node staging are reported on in a companion article in this issue.

### Surgery, with or without tamoxifen, vs tamoxifen alone for older women with operable breast cancer: cochrane review [^114iYV4w]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Meaning of the study possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policymakers

Primary endocrine therapy should only be offered to women with ER-positive tumours who are unfit for, or who refuse, surgery. In a cohort of women with reduced life expectancy, owing to significant co-morbid disease, and ER-positive tumours, primary endocrine therapy may be an appropriate treatment choice. A national UK trial will shortly be starting to evaluate selection criteria for the use of primary endocrine therapy, (Endocrine +/− Surgical Therapy for Elderly women with Mammary cancer, ESTEEM), which will aid in decision making.

Unanswered questions and future research

Since these studies were designed, endocrine therapies other than tamoxifen have become available. Aromatase inhibitors have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting and may by attractive as primary endocrine therapy for older women who are unfit for surgery. Trials are needed to test this hypothesis. The ESTEEM trial will use aromatase inhibitors rather than tamoxifen, which may enhance the efficacy of primary endocrine therapy.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^116keub4]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Remarkably, the response of the breast tumour to oestrogen during the evolution of drug-resistance changes dramatically, from initially being growth stimulatory to becoming completely inhibitory after 5 years of antihormonal therapy. Apoptosis is initiated in response to minute concentrations of oestradiol, which results in dramatic tumour regression in heterotransplanted athymic mice. When this phenomenon was first noted and reported in the early 1990s, it was suggested that a woman's own oestrogen actually destroyed the micrometastases that were presensitised by 5 years of tamoxifen treatment. In otherwords, stopping tamoxifen at a critical time (5 years) was responsible for the long-term survival statistics. While the concept may have some veracity, the knowledge that minute concentrations of oestrogen can have a dramatic effect on tumour cell death could have important clinical implications for treatment. Indeed, a clear understanding of the mechanism of Phase II and III resistance is becoming increasingly important for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

The current focus on exhaustive antiendocrine therapy may in fact be disadvantageous for patients. The antitumour action of oestrogen in Phase II tamoxifen resistance can paradoxically be reversed by fulvestrant. In otherwords, oestradiol causes rapid tumour regression, fulvestrant causes tumourstasis, but a combination of oestradiol and fulvestrant causes robust tumour growth. If Phase II or III drug resistance to tamoxifen can be shown to occur in patients, then an oestrogen-rich environment would subvert the actions of fulvestrant. Obviously, one could enhance the probability of a response to fulvestrant by administering an aromatase inhibitor, but perhaps oestrogen should be pursued as a targeted alternative. To advance this idea, it would be valuable to examine whether the observations in the laboratory with the evolution of tamoxifen drug resistance apply to other SERMs and to breast cancer cells that have adapted to oestrogen deprivation, that is, as an expression of resistance to aromatase inhibitors.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tamoxifen is an estrogen agonist/antagonist. Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to the estrogen receptor, which can result in a decrease in estrogen receptor signaling-dependent growth in breast tissue. Tamoxifen has demonstrated antitumor activity against human breast cancer cell lines xenografted in mice. The drug has been shown to inhibit the induction of rat mammary carcinoma induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and to cause the regression of already established DMBA-induced tumors.

### Tamoxifen evolution [^111bJ6yu]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Tamoxifen evolution

Tamoxifen's introduction was timely as it heralded the era of powerful and, perhaps more importantly, better-tolerated agents targeting oestrogen signalling in breast cancers. Multiple randomised trials demonstrated that tamoxifen was equivalent in time to progression and survival and not inferior to the other SERMs tested. The adjuvant therapy and prevention trials versus placebo (or no treatment) indicated that 5 years of tamoxifen was the standard for the reduction of both relapse and breast cancer incidence. However, with time, improved aromatase inhibitors and the development of SERDs such as fulvestrant have led to a reduction in the indications for tamoxifen and it is now mainly used as adjuvant therapy for lower-risk premenopausal breast cancer and for prevention. A recent review of the treatment of advanced ER + ve breast cancer does not include tamoxifen at all in the suggested treatment algorithm for the disease.

Recent studies suggest that we may be on the brink of a new era of more widespread use of lower-dose tamoxifen, particularly for prevention in peri and postmenopausal women. Doses of about 5 mg per day are associated with fewer side effects than reported for the standard 20 mg dose. Reduction of mammographic density, endometrial proliferation, increased bone density and reduced markers of cardiovascular disease confer additional potential, and data suggest equivalence to the 20 mg dose. Further exploration of low-dose treatment is warranted, especially since more women at high risk of breast cancer are being identified in risk prediction programmes that utilise factors such as mammographic density and single-nucleotide polymorphism polygenic risk scores to introduce risk-adapted breast screening.

### Evolving uses of hormonal agents for breast cancer therapy [^115SKCrp]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

During the past decade, a number of new hormonal therapies (HTs) have been developed, including the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists. Their uses in breast cancer are continually evolving as new clinical trial results become available. Although tamoxifen, the most widely used HT for breast cancer, was originally approved for and used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), its effectiveness as MBC therapy led to its subsequent assessment and use as adjuvant and risk-reduction therapy for breast cancer. However, tamoxifen is not universally effective in these settings and is associated with infrequent known toxicities such as increased risk of thromboembolism and endometrial cancer; therefore, a search for more effective and more tolerable HTs has evolved.

Objective

This article reviews the data supporting the use of newer HTs as initial treatment of MBC and their potential use as adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and chemopreventive therapies.

Methods

Articles for inclusion in this manuscript were identified through the following searches, limited to English-language publications: MEDLINE (mid 1960s to January 2002), American Society of Oncology abstracts (1997–2001), and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium abstracts (2001 and 2002). The following search terms were used: breast cancer, breast cancer guidelines, hormonal therapies, tamoxifen, toremifine, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, megestrol acetate, fulvestrant, and ICI 182,780.

Results

Recent studies have focused on newer agents as initial and subsequent treatment of MBC, adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatments of breast cancer, and chemopreventive agents in both healthy women and women with a history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Results of clinical trials comparing AIs with tamoxifen as first-line MBC treatment show that AIs are as effective as, or more effective than, tamoxifen and are associated with fewer serious adverse events. Tamoxifen remains the gold standard for adjuvant therapy. However, preliminary results of ongoing clinical trials comparing tamoxifen with anastrozole suggest that anastrozole may be the superior agent. Both tamoxifen and the AIs have been shown to be active in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Trial results have shown that tamoxifen is effective for breast cancer prevention in patients at high risk of developing breast cancer but who are otherwise healthy, patients with a history of DCIS, and patients with lobular carcinoma in situ.

Conclusions

Although tamoxifen has been the gold standard of HT for breast cancer, results of ongoing trials assessing the newer HTs as initial, neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and chemopreventive therapies may substantially change our current clinical practice patterns.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^114A1tCa]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — duration advises that men who are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy should be treated for an initial duration of five years (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong), and that men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence may be offered an additional five years of tamoxifen therapy (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for the surgeon: options, side effects, and their management [^114Ui5Rt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy is often advised for women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. In premenopausal women, tamoxifen is the primary endocrine therapy option since aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are contraindicated in patients with residual ovarian function. The benefit of ovarian ablation/suppression in premenopausal patients remains controversial. In postmenopausal ER positive patients, treatment with an AI alone, switching strategies with an AI and tamoxifen, or extended therapy with an AI after 5 years of tamoxifen are superior to 5 years of tamoxifen alone. While the data supporting the use of endocrine therapy for ER positive breast cancer is clear, adverse effects occur with variable frequency and severity. The intensity and severity of the most common endocrine therapy adverse effects are mild to moderate for the majority of women, and serious life-threatening adverse effects are uncommon. However, compliance issues are often larger than recognized. Good communication with patients is critical to address concerns and symptoms, and more research is needed to identify effective methods to minimize treatment side effects.

### ICI 182, 780 (fulvestrant) – the first oestrogen receptor down-regulator – current clinical data [^117S6938]. British Journal of Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant) is the first in a new class of novel, steroidal, 'pure' antioestrogens — the oestrogen receptor (ER) down-regulators. Its unique mode of action and the absence of partial agonist activity make it a candidate for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen has been available for use over the past 25 years. However, its partial agonist activity has been associated with detrimental effects, particularly on the endometrium, and may be associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance. Other antioestrogen agents have previously been unable to demonstrate clinically relevant activity following the development of resistance to tamoxifen. In contrast, the unique mechanism of action of ICI 182,780 results in significant clinical activity in patients failing on tamoxifen therapy. Indeed, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that ICI 182,780 is at least as effective as the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced disease who have progressed during threatment with prior enocrine therapy. As such, ICI 182,780 will provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.

### Adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline focused update [^116WvgkZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and management of intolerance or early discontinuation — is addressed as follows: Meaningful clinical differences between the commercially available third-generation AIs have not been demonstrated to date, and postmenopausal patients intolerant of one AI may be advised to consider tamoxifen or a different AI. Women who are postmenopausal and are intolerant of either tamoxifen or an AI should be offered the alternative type of adjuvant endocrine therapy. If women have received an AI but discontinued treatment at < 5 years, they may be offered tamoxifen for a total of 5 years (Type: Informal consensus, Evidence Quality: Low, Strength of Recommendation: Weak). If women have received tamoxifen for 2–3 years, they should be offered a switch to an AI for up to 5 years, for a total duration of up to 7–8 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

### Role of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer [^111kn7LK]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Primarily, the role of the aromatase inhibitors has been investigated in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, although it is also now being assessed in premenopausal patients following ovarian ablation/suppression. Aromatase inhibitors markedly suppress endogenous oestrogens without directly interacting with oestrogen receptors, and thus have a different mechanism of action to the antioestrogen, tamoxifen. The inhibitors may be divided into subgroups according to their structure (steroidal and nonsteroidal), and there appears to be a lack of cross-resistance between the classes of aromatase inhibitors enabling them to be used sequentially and potentially to prolong endocrine hormone therapy. In addition, with increased efficacy and favourable safety and tolerability profiles, the aromatase inhibitors are starting to challenge tamoxifen as first choice endocrine treatment in a number of settings. Potential differences in side-effect profiles may appear between the steroidal and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors when used in long-term settings. Thus, it has been suggested that the steroidal agents have favourable end organ effects; for example, the steroidal inhibitor, exemestane, has minimal negative effects on bone and lipid metabolism in animal and clinical studies. This paper provides an overview of the current and future roles of aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer treatment.

### Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors with ovarian function suppression in pre-menopausal stage I-III lobular breast cancer [^117T1ELk]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. While breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different histologic and molecular subtypes, most cases express estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), making hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer the most common subtype overall.

Anti-estrogen endocrine therapies are the backbone of adjuvant systemic treatment for HR positive tumors, with two main classes in use: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). SERMs such as tamoxifen act as competitive antagonists of ER and can be used in both pre- and post-menopausal patients. In contrast, AIs inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen and are ineffective in pre-menopausal people unless combined with suppression of ovarian estrogen production with chemical or surgical ovarian function suppression (OFS).

Consequently, endocrine therapy guidelines for stage I-III HR positive breast cancer vary by menopausal status. For post-menopausal patients, trials show improved survival with the use of AI therapy compared to tamoxifen, making AI the preferred agent in this setting. For pre-menopausal patients, tamoxifen was the standard adjuvant endocrine agent until data published in 2014 suggested that incorporation of OFS and AIs showed improvements in disease-free survival (DFS). However, due to quality-of-life considerations and based on a patient's baseline risk and personal preferences, the choice of adjuvant endocrine therapy in pre-menopausal patients is quite individualized.

Several studies have evaluated the comparative efficacy of different endocrine therapy strategies for pre-menopausal patients with breast cancer. Two large phase III clinical trials (SOFT/TEXT) suggested that OFS in combination with tamoxifen or AI resulted in improved survival outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone. This benefit was greatest in high-risk patients (e.g. age < 35 years, tumors > 2 cm in size, or grade 3). Current guidelines allow clinicians to choose between OFS/AI, OFS/tamoxifen, or tamoxifen alone based on clinical and molecular features and patient preference, but lack definitive criteria to guide selection.

### The aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer [^111GdPpd]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2003). Low credibility.

Adjuvant hormonal therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of breast cancer recurrence and overall mortality in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been used in this setting for many years, both in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. Tamoxifen is not devoid of toxicity, and attempts have been made to develop newer hormonal agents with better efficacy and less toxicity. The aromatase inhibitors have shown equivalent or superior efficacy to tamoxifen in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and efforts are underway to determine the role of these agents in early breast cancer. The ATAC trial recently showed that use of the third-generation aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in the adjuvant setting led to a modest improvement in relapse-free survival as compared with tamoxifen. Patients treated with anastrozole were also less likely to develop uterine cancer or experience a thromboembolic event. However, patients treated with anastrozole were more likely than those treated with tamoxifen to suffer a fracture or other musculosketal problem. An ASCO technology assessment panel reviewed the relevant data and issued a consensus statement regarding the use of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. In general, the panel favored the continued use of tamoxifen as adjuvant hormonal therapy for most postmenopausal women. Within the next few years, further data from the ATAC trial and from other trials of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant setting should be available to guide treatment recommendations for this patient population.

### Breast cancer treatment in clinical practice compared to best evidence and practice guidelines [^11153Dv6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy

NCCN guideline

All women with DCIS and negative margins, and all women with BCS or mastectomy with T3 and greater should have radiation of standard fractionated doses totaling 40–60 Gy, unless contraindicated and/or the woman refuses.

Meta-analyses:

The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) found reduced relapse rates and comparable mortality for radiation following operation regardless of stage and node status). Radiation and BCS for DCIS reduces recurrence by 50%.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy

NCCN guideline

Multicycle adjuvant cytotoxic polychemotherapy should be prescribed for all women with node positive disease and/or with tumour greater than 1 cm, except for DCIS and LCIS, unless the woman refuses.

Meta-analyses:

) found significant survival benefits with cytotoxic polychemotherapy.concluded that it reduced annual risk of death by 16% and disease recurrence by 28%, irrespective of stage and node status.

Nonsteroidal antioestrogens

NCCN guideline

Women with positive oestrogen receptor (OR) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) disease, irrespective of diagnosis and disease stage, should receive a nonsteroidal antioestrogen unless contraindicated and/or the woman refuses.

Meta-analyses:

, found that tamoxifen reduced mortality and disease recurrence for women with OR/PR-positive disease. Combining chemotherapy with tamoxifen reduced 10-year relative mortality risk by 30–40%.

Other interventions

Axillary node dissection was included in treatment algorithms because NCCN recommended it in their guidelines even though no meta-analysis was published until 1999. Modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy plus axillary node dissection were also included.

Combined treatment algorithms

Four scenarios were developed from NCCN guidelines and meta-analyses. Each algorithm from both sources was compared to actual patient treatment. It is to be noted that a treatment prescribed by the physician that followed either algorithm was considered appropriate even if the women refused or did not complete therapy.

### Tailoring therapies – improving the management of early breast cancer: ST gallen international expert consensus on the primary therapy of early breast cancer 2015 [^113gKJMX]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

adjuvant endocrine therapy of premenopausal patients

In the light of recently published results from the SOFT and TEXT trials, the Panel considered treatment recommendations for two clinical scenarios. The first involved a 42-year-old patient with node-negative, grade 2, T1, ER-positive tumor not receiving chemotherapy. A large majority of the Panel would treat such a patient with tamoxifen alone. The second scenario involved a 34-year-old patient with lymph node-positive, grade 3, T1, ER-positive disease who remained premenopausal after adjuvant chemotherapy. An overwhelming majority of the Panel would advise OFS for this patient, and a large majority would use this with exemestane rather than tamoxifen.

More generally, the Panel considered that factors arguing for inclusion of OFS were age 35 or less; persisting premenopausal estrogen level after adjuvant chemotherapy; or the involvement of four or more axillary nodes. A lesser majority would add grade 3 disease or an adverse result from a multiparameter molecular marker test as indications for OFS.

Factors arguing for the use of an AI plus OFS rather than tamoxifen plus OFS were (overwhelmingly) the involvement of four or more nodes, with lesser majorities accepting age 35 or less; grade 3; or the adverse result of a multiparameter molecular marker test as supporting such treatment. The Panel was almost evenly divided as to whether a persisting premenopausal estrogen level after adjuvant chemotherapy should favor an AI rather than tamoxifen. As a supplementary question, the Panel was asked, 'if you decide to give OFS are you more likely to recommend tamoxifen or an AI?' with a majority favoring AI.

The Panel considered that if OFS were included the optimal duration of such therapy should be 5 years, and that extended endocrine therapy for a total of 10 years should be considered for premenopausal patients initially node-positive or with other adverse pathology.

### Fulvestrant: an oestrogen receptor antagonist with a novel mechanism of action [^1167cMKb]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Due to their favourable tolerability profiles, endocrine therapies have long been considered the treatment of choice for hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer. However, the oestrogen agonist effects of the available selective oestrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen, and the development of cross-resistance between endocrine therapies with similar modes of action have led to the need for new treatments that act through different mechanisms. Fulvestrant ('Faslodex') is the first of a new type of endocrine treatment – an oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates the ER and has no agonist effects. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of ER signalling and illustrates the unique mode of action of fulvestrant. Preclinical and clinical study data are presented in support of the novel mechanism of action of this new type of ER antagonist.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^111MHWkD]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

by comparing and contrasting the action of oestradiol in wild-type breast cancer cells and an ER-positive progesterone receptor-negative, oestrogen-deprived clone referred to as MCF-7 5C. Of interest is the observation that alterations in the media can enhance the actions of oestradiol as an apoptotic agent. Clearly, this is an area of research activity worthy of pursuit as the proposed therapeutic use of long-term aromatase inhibition can potentially reconfigure the cellular response to oestrogen.

The other relevant clinical scenario is the response of occult breast cancer cells to indefinite raloxifene administration for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Long-term culture of breast cancer cells in 1 μ raloxifene results in adaptation of cell-survival mechanisms and raloxifene resistance. Transplantation of cells into athymic mice demonstrates Phase II SERM resistance; tamoxifen or raloxifene stimulates growth, no treatment (no ER binding ligand) results in no growth, but oestradiol causes apoptosis and rapid tumour regression. Thus, a general principle is emerging that merits investigation in the laboratory to discover mechanisms that could be targeted and amplified.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^115LKsi4]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Section 3 — Endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR+ breast cancer — endocrine therapy is effective adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy, with tamoxifen an option for any patient with ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive (PgR+) invasive or noninvasive disease, while aromatase inhibitor (AI) use is limited to postmenopausal patients and premenopausal patients receiving ovarian function suppression (OFS). Overall clinical trial data shows better outcomes with AIs versus SERMS, but both categories of endocrine therapy improve local, regional, and distant disease-free survival. Prior to starting adjuvant endocrine therapy, the potential benefit from systemic chemotherapy needs to be assessed; if systemic chemotherapy is needed, endocrine therapy should start after chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy is usually initiated after completion of radiation therapy, but administration with concurrent radiation is an option.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^114jbhmp]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Antioestrogens and AIs have distinct mechanisms of action

Tamoxifen (antioestrogen) and aromatase inhibition (oestrogen deprivation) are distinct approaches to oestrogen-dependent breast cancer and efficacy, tolerability and toxicity differences stem from these pharmacological fundamentals. Unlike tamoxifen, AIs do not exhibit intrinsic hormonal properties but affect oestrogen receptor (ER) function indirectly by blocking the conversion of adrenal androgens to oestrogen in the peripheral (i.e. nonovarian) tissues of postmenopausal women, including the breast itself. When deprived of oestrogens, ERs cannot bind to DNA, and are therefore incapable of direct involvement in signalling. As a consequence, the side effects of AIs stem from oestrogen deprivation – for example, bone loss and atrophic vaginitis. In contrast, tamoxifen has an intrinsic endocrine action by binding to ERs with high affinity and activating ER dimerisation and DNA binding. Tamoxifen-bound ER has altered gene-regulatory properties referred to as SERM. In several normal tissues, tamoxifen-bound ER is active and promotes, for example, bone mineralisation and endometrial proliferation. In these instances, tamoxifen is acting as an 'oestrogen mimic' or receptor agonist. As a consequence, the serious side effects of tamoxifen are remarkably similar to oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) – venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke and endometrial cancer. Like ERT, maintenance of bone mineral density is an advantage of tamoxifen. These agonist effects may, however, limit efficacy. Aromatase inhibitors do not interact with ER; so potential resistance mechanisms related to SERM agonist effects on tumour cells are avoided. Preclinical models with MCF7 xenografts engineered to overexpress aromatase, as well as models of tamoxifen-dependent tumour growth, support this explanation for the therapeutic advantage of AIs.

First-line therapy for advanced disease

This discussion will focus on anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Fadrozole, a second-generation nonsteroidal AI, has been shown to be equivalent to tamoxifen but inferior to letrozole in advanced breast cancer, and will not be discussed further, as drug approval is restricted to Japan.

### A framework for the development of effective anti-metastatic agents [^113Jfcii]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Clinical drug development

Overview

Designing clinical trials and identifying end points that reflect the prevention of metastatic disease and can meet regulatory authority expectations for evidence of clinically significant benefit are arguably the most critical barrier to the development of new anti-metastatic agents. Measuring a clinically meaningful outcome in a realistic time frame, without requiring the recruitment of overwhelming patient numbers, is a key aim. The paucity of putative anti-metastatic agents being tested in clinical trials bears testament to these barriers.

Chemotherapies, hormone therapies, molecularly targeted agents, immunotherapies and various combinations thereof have produced responses and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in the metastatic setting but are insufficient to achieve cure in most patients. Some of these same treatments have prevented or delayed the development of overt metastatic disease in some (but not all) patients when administered to those without detectable metastases but in whom micrometastases are suspected. Examples include the use of combination chemotherapy in the perioperative setting for bladder cancer, and adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer. This scenario has led to a drug development pathway in which therapies likely to be effective in eliminating micrometastases are progressed to the adjuvant setting only after they first demonstrate antitumour effects in patients with advanced-stage disease. Such an approach also assumes that the biology of the metastases is similar to that of the primary tumour, which is not universally true. This drug development paradigm is further reinforced by the need to manage the very large risks associated with trials in the adjuvant setting (for example, relating to the need for large cohorts, healthier populations and long durations for data maturity; the high costs; and the lack of safety data in patients with anticipated long-term survival) by first demonstrating activity and acceptable toxicity in trials involving smaller numbers of patients with more rapidly attainable end points. In other words, demonstrated efficacy in patients with pre-existing metastases has traditionally been the obligate gateway to adjuvant trials of interventions for metastasis prevention.

The ability to delay or prevent metastases has the potential to enormously improve the survival durations of patients with cancer and could even lead to cures. However, the opportunity presented by anti-metastatic drugs cannot be explored adequately using conventional drug development pathways because drugs without cytotoxic or clinically meaningful cytostatic effects in the patients with overt metastatic disease will never advance to adjuvant trials. This point is central to the rethinking of clinical trial designs for metastasis prevention, with the clinical use of potential anti-metastatic drugs falling into three possible scenarios.

### Breast cancer treatment in clinical practice compared to best evidence and practice guidelines [^114rgJ1C]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy

Radiation was provided to 56.8% of women (Table 3). Over 90% received recommended fractionated doses totaling 40–60 Gy (28); 98% completed their regimen. Fewer than 1% refused radiation.

Cytotoxic polychemotherapy

Cytotoxic polychemotherapy was given to 37.1% of eligible women (Table 3). A total of 19 (4.1%) had neoadjuvant plus adjuvant regimens. Two refused all chemotherapy.

Nonsteroidal antioestrogens

Of women with OR- and/or PR-positive disease, 80.4% received a nonsteroidal antioestrogen, nearly always tamoxifen, including the 8% who refused (Table 3). Most who refused did so because of potential side effects. Nearly 5% were diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer while on tamoxifen for secondary prophylaxis.

Among women with recorded previous history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolus (PE) (n = 95 of the total population of 4395), 60.0% (n = 57) got tamoxifen, of whom 83.3% (n = 47) experienced another DVT or PE. All were OR or PR positive; none died. None were on recorded anticoagulation therapy.

Physician adherence with optimal or NCCN guideline treatments

Optimal or NCCN treatments were provided to 45.0% of women (Table 4

Table 4
Prescribing optimal or NCCN clinical guideline treatment (N = 464)). The majority at every disease stage, except those with DCIS, was not treated according to NCCN practice guidelines or optimal regimens from meta-analyses. Overuse of mastectomy, and under use of lumpectomy, reconstruction, radiation and cytotoxic polychemotherapy were the main results for every disease stage and scenario.

### Impact of NICE guidance on tamoxifen prescribing in england 2011–2017: an interrupted time series analysis [^111S7HsM]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Impact of NICE guidance

We estimated above that changes in prescribing patterns between 2013 and 2016 could account for 6440 new women taking up tamoxifen and 2010 raloxifene, or 8450 in total.

Previous estimates suggest 500,000 women are eligible for chemoprevention. This is ~3.7% of England's female population aged 35–74, the proportion of women previously found to have moderate or high risk of breast cancer by application of NICE criteria. Among those eligible, uptake in English studies has been around 10%. Therefore, if all 500,000 women were offered tamoxifen or raloxifene following publication of the NICE guidelines, and 10% were to accept, uptake would be 50,000.

However, this will represent an overestimate, since the uptake rates were calculated after application of exclusion criteria such as pregnancy, mastectomy or recent cancer diagnosis; total numbers excluded were not reported and are difficult to estimate. For example, women at moderate risk have a 3–8% chance of breast cancer between ages 40 and 50, with whole lifetime risk 17–30%. Conception rates in 2015 were 6.9% in the 35–39 age group but only 1.5% in over 40 s.

Our finding of 8450 leaves a large 83% shortfall against the 50,000 estimate, unlikely to be accounted for by ineligibility. This indicates that not all eligible women were offered tamoxifen, or that uptake was lower than preceding estimates would predict. Our uptake figure does not take into account the typical dropout rate of around 40% at 5 years. However, only those persisting will have the full protective benefit.

Previous studies in this population estimate that 22 women need to take tamoxifen for one invasive breast cancer to be prevented in the first 20 years (or 45 cases prevented per 1000 women taking the drug). Offering these drugs to 500,000 women aged 35–74, in keeping with NICE guidelines, with an estimated 8% uptake (allowing for an ineligibility rate of 20%), would in principle therefore result in prevention of up to 1818 cancers (assuming complete adherence). The increase in prescribing we observed would account for 384 breast cancers prevented, leaving a shortfall of up to 1434 avoidable cancers attributable to the implementation of the NICE guideline falling short of what would be predicted.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy after 5 years of tamoxifen — randomized studies have shown that extended endocrine therapy can reduce recurrence, and two strategies of either continuing tamoxifen for a total of 10 years or extending therapy by switching to an aromatase inhibitor (AI) are both associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence; based on these findings, the Expert Panel has in previous guidelines recommended either of these approaches for women who have proven tolerant of adjuvant endocrine therapy and are at substantial residual risk for late recurrence.

### Aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal breast cancer patients [^114EeUT9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2005). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have greatly enriched the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal patients. Before the introduction of the well-tolerated third-generation AIs, tamoxifen was the mainstay of endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Many clinical trials have shown the superiority of AIs compared with tamoxifen in adjuvant breast cancer treatment, as well as their benefit in metastatic breast cancer. NCCN guidelines recommendations for their use are based on the evidence provided by these clinical trials. This discussion reviews the evidence supporting the current guidelines for use of AI therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

### Antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer and the role of estrogen receptor signaling [^112UYE6q]. Oncogene (2003). Low credibility.

Antiestrogens include agents such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, and fulvestrant. Currently, tamoxifen is the only drug approved for use in breast cancer chemoprevention, and it remains the treatment of choice for most women with hormone receptor positive, invasive breast carcinoma. While antiestrogens have been available since the early 1970s, we still do not fully understand their mechanisms of action and resistance. Essentially, two forms of antiestrogen resistance occur: de novo resistance and acquired resistance. Absence of estrogen receptor (ER) expression is the most common de novo resistance mechanism, whereas a complete loss of ER expression is not common in acquired resistance. Antiestrogen unresponsiveness appears to be the major acquired resistance phenotype, with a switch to an antiestrogen-stimulated growth being a minor phenotype. Since antiestrogens compete with estrogens for binding to ER, clinical response to antiestrogens may be affected by exogenous estrogenic exposures. Such exposures include estrogenic hormone replacement therapies and dietary and environmental exposures that directly or indirectly increase a tumor's estrogenic environment. Whether antiestrogen resistance can be conferred by a switch from predominantly ERalpha to ERbeta expression remains unanswered, but predicting response to antiestrogen therapy requires only measurement of ERalpha expression. The role of altered receptor coactivator or corepressor expression in antiestrogen resistance also is unclear, and understanding their roles may be confounded by their ubiquitous expression and functional redundancy. We have proposed a gene network approach to exploring the mechanistic aspects of antiestrogen resistance. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we have begun to identify candidate genes that comprise one component of a larger, putative gene network. These candidate genes include NFkappaB, interferon regulatory factor-1, nucleophosmin, and the X-box binding protein-1. The network also may involve signaling through ras and MAPK, implicating crosstalk with growth factors and cytokines. Ultimately, signaling affects the expression/function of the proliferation and/or apoptotic machineries.

### The 38th David A. Karnofsky lecture: the paradoxical actions of estrogen in breast cancer – survival or death? [^1114VRco]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

During the first David A. Karnofsky Award lecture entitled "Thoughts on Chemical Therapy" in 1970, Sir Alexander Haddow commented about the dramatic regressions observed with estrogen in some breast cancers in postmenopausal women, but regrettably the mechanism was unknown. He was concerned that a cancer-specific target would remain elusive, without tests to predict response to therapy. At that time, I was conducting research for my PhD on an obscure group of estrogen derivatives called nonsteroidal antiestrogens. Antiestrogens had failed to fulfill their promise as postcoital contraceptives and were unlikely to be developed further by the pharmaceutical industry. In 1972, that perspective started to change and ICI 46,474 was subsequently reinvented as the first targeted therapy for breast cancer. The scientific strategy of targeting the estrogen receptor (ER) in the tumor, treating patients with long-term adjuvant therapy, examining active metabolites, and considering chemoprevention all translated through clinical trials to clinical practice during the next 35 years. Hundreds of thousands of women now have enhanced survivorship after their diagnosis of ER-positive breast cancer. However, it was the recognition of selective ER modulation (SERM) that created a new dimension in therapeutics. Nonsteroidal antiestrogens selectively turn on or turn off estrogen target tissues throughout the body. Patient care was immediately affected by the recognition in the laboratory that tamoxifen would potentially increase the growth of endometrial cancer during long-term adjuvant therapy. At that time, a failed breast cancer drug, keoxifene, was found to maintain bone density of rats (estrogenic action) while simultaneously preventing mammary carcinogenesis (antiestrogenic action). Perhaps a SERM used to prevent osteoporosis could simultaneously prevent breast cancer? Keoxifene was renamed raloxifene and became the first SERM for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis as well as the prevention of breast cancer, but without an increase in endometrial cancer. There the story might have ended had the study of antihormone resistance not revealed a vulnerability of cancer cells that could be exploited in the clinic. The evolution of antihormone resistance over years of therapy reconfigures the survival mechanism of the breast cancer cell, so estrogen no longer is a survival signal but a death signal. Remarkably, remaining tumor tissue is again responsive to continuing antihormone therapy. This new discovery is currently being evaluated in clinical trials but it also solves the mystery mechanism of chemical therapy with estrogen noted by Haddow in the first Karnofsky lecture.

Breast cancer, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab

Breast cancer accounts for one in four of all female cancers, making it by far the most common cancer in women in the western world, where one in nine women will develop the disease at some stage in their lives. Breast cancer treatment involves surgical removal of the tumour, although this is ineffective if malignant cells have escaped from the site of the primary tumour. Discovery of the involvement of the ovarian hormone oestrogen and its mechanism of action paved the way for the development of therapies for ER-positive patients that inhibit oestrogen action. These therapies include tamoxifen, which blocks the ER, and the oestrogen synthetase (aromatase) inhibitors formestane and exemestane, which inhibit oestrogen synthesis. Despite the huge improvement in cancer survival due to tamoxifen treatment, some patients relapse and the use of sequential therapy with exemestane after 2–3 years of tamoxifen treatment has improved disease-free survival, as compared with the standard 5 years of tamoxifen treatment alone. The use of endocrine agents has markedly reduced the number of deaths from breast cancer over the past decades. However, in many cases, these therapies fail due to recurrent endocrine-resistant tumours, and much effort is being made to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to endocrine therapies. Altered growth factor signalling, notably EGFR and insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) make a significant contribution to the development of antioestrogen resistance, and these have been reviewed recently.

### Management of male breast cancer: ASCO guideline [^117T6bKe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy in men with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer — states that men who are treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy should be treated for an initial duration of five years (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong). Men who have completed five years of tamoxifen, have tolerated therapy, and still have a high risk of recurrence based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors may be offered an additional five years of tamoxifen therapy (Type: formal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: strong). There is no evidence from clinical trials in men to inform duration, and tamoxifen use in men with breast cancer can be associated with treatment-limiting adverse effects that can lead to low adherence, treatment discontinuation, and a greater risk of recurrence and death.

### How do we increase uptake of tamoxifen and other anti-estrogens for breast cancer prevention? [^111f2G5V]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Several randomized controlled trials of anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, have demonstrated up to a 50–65% decrease in breast cancerincidence among high-risk women. Approximately 15% of women, age 35–79 years, in the U.S. meet criteria for breast cancer preventive therapies, but uptake of these medications remain low. Explanations for this low uptake includelack of awareness of breast cancer risk status, insufficient knowledge about breast cancer preventive therapies among patients and physicians, and toxicity concerns. Increasing acceptance of pharmacologic breast cancer prevention will require effective communication of breast cancer risk, accurate representation about the potential benefits and side effects of anti-estrogens, targeting-specific high-risk populations most likely to benefit from preventive therapy, and minimizing the side effects of current anti-estrogens with novel administration and dosing options. One strategy to improve the uptake of chemoprevention strategies is to consider lessons learned from the use of drugs to prevent other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. Enhancing uptake and adherence to anti-estrogens for primary prevention holds promise for significantly reducing breast cancer incidence, however, this will require a significant change in our current clinical practice and stronger advocacy and awareness at the national level.

### Preventive therapy for breast cancer [^112ZMsqH]. Current Oncology Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Trials with tamoxifen have clearly shown that the risk of developing oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer can be reduced by at least 50% with prophylactic agents. The current challenge is to find new agents which achieve this or better efficacy, but with fewer side effects. Recent results indicate that the selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene has fewer endometrial cancers, gynaecologic symptoms, and thromboembolic side effects, but is also slightly less efficacious. Results for contralateral tumours in adjuvant trials suggest that aromatase inhibitors may be able to prevent up to 70–80% of ER-positive breast cancers, and the MAP3 trial has shown to reduce all invasive breast cancer by 65% in the preventive setting. The IBIS-II trial is currently investigating anastrozole in healthy postmenopausal women. New agents are needed for receptor negative breast cancer and premenopausal women, and several possibilities are currently under investigation.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116iE7aD]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer risk-reducing medications — harms and menopausal indications: Tamoxifen and raloxifene are associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and vasomotor symptoms, and tamoxifen also increases the risk for endometrial cancer and cataracts, with these risks increased in older women and not applicable to endometrial cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy. Harms of aromatase inhibitors include vasomotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and musculoskeletal pain; data on harms for primary risk reduction are limited, a trend toward increased cardiovascular events has been observed in some trials, and aromatase inhibitors do not reduce, and may even increase, risk of fractures. Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors all reduce primary breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women; use of raloxifene and aromatase inhibitors is indicated only in postmenopausal women, and only tamoxifen is indicated for risk-reduction of primary breast cancer in premenopausal women.

### Breast cancer treatment in clinical practice compared to best evidence and practice guidelines [^1136mini]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Most women with breast cancer in this study were not treated according to regimens from either meta-analyses or NCCN clinical practice guidelines. In only one scenario (DCIS) was the majority of women treated according to either standard. These findings are consistent with a 1998 study of physician adherence with US National Institutes of Health clinical practice guidelines for early stage breast cancer, and with a 2002 study of all beneficial breast cancer diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Patient and physician characteristics had inconsistent relation to treatment. Physician-specific treatment at the beginning was essentially the same as at the end of the study, suggesting that incorporation of best evidence and clinical practice guidelines is slow in altering clinical care patterns. However, available meta-analyses published by 1995 may not have been available long enough to influence change.

Over- and undertreatment occurred simultaneously, sometimes in the same patient. For example, excluding women who requested it, 15.1% with DCIS or stage I, with clear margins, had mastectomy, an example of over treatment based on NCCN guidelines and meta-analyses; and only 15.6% had breast reconstruction within a year, an example of under treatment. In another example, tamoxifen was provided to 60% of women with known history of DVT or PE, a contraindication for use. Lack of specifics on detailed discussions between patient and physician means we do not know how and why decisions on specific care modalities were made.

What might account for discordance between actual and recommended or optimal treatment? First, there are likely important differences between patients in randomized control trials and general patients treated in the community. Community patients have variable disease and personal preferences, and physicians tailor treatment to individual needs. An unanswered question is whether physicians who participate in randomised trials practice according to their own study results, and differently than physicians not participating in trials.

### Aromatase inhibition in the treatment of advanced breast cancer: is there a relationship between potency and clinical efficacy? [^112ErRDX]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is regarded world wide as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both pre- and postmenopausal women, and currently comprises 18% of all female cancers. In the UK, breast cancer accounts for more than 14 000 deaths each year, while in Europe in 1995 it was responsible for the deaths of 124 000 women. However, between 1988 and 1998 mortality from the disease fell dramatically among women below the age of 70 years in Western (but not Eastern) Europe. Possible reasons for this improved mortality rate include the introduction of national breast screening programmes and new better treatment regimens.

It is recognised that two-thirds of breast tumours are oestrogen-receptor positive and women who have hormone receptor-positive tumours are suitable candidates for endocrine therapy. The use of endocrine therapy for the management of the disease has grown dramatically since the first pioneering report by Beatson in 1896 of a successful outcome in a premenopausal woman with breast cancer following ovarian ablation, and many different treatment approaches are now available. Although significant progress has been made over the past three decades in terms of both improved efficacy and tolerability of endocrine treatments for breast cancer, many challenges still lie ahead for both surgeons and oncologists in the treatment and management of all stages of the disease.

Until recently, and for more than 30 years, tamoxifen – a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) – had been the drug of choice for the treatment of hormone-responsive early and advanced breast cancer. However, although tamoxifen is an effective treatment, it has partial agonist activity. This is associated with an increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer and of thromboembolic disease, and limits its use. In addition, most tumours eventually become resistant to tamoxifen and alternative treatments are required. In recent years, a number of different classes of endocrine therapy have emerged as suitable alternatives in the treatment of advanced breast disease. Although several new SERMs have been developed (e.g. raloxifene), they have not been shown to produce any clinically relevant effects in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant tumours. Thus, there is a need for new therapies with improved tolerability profiles that are not cross-resistant with established endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen. The availability of endocrine agents with different mechanisms of action to tamoxifen, such as the aromatase inhibitors (AIs), is an important step forward in the search to provide more efficacious and better-tolerated therapies.

Hormone therapy

Treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen is beneficial, despite its side effects, irrespective of the patients' age, if the tumour expresses oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). Tamoxifen should not be prescribed to women with tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). The optimal duration for adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen is 5 years at a dose of 20 mg day −1 (standard, level of evidence: A). Patients treated with tamoxifen should have regular gynaecological clinical examinations (recommendation, expert agreement). Additional examinations are not necessary in the absence of symptoms.

Neoadjuvant treatment with antioestrogens can be used in elderly women with slowly evolving hormone-sensitive tumours (option, level of evidence: B1). This should be followed when possible by optimal locoregional treatment (option, expert agreement). At present, antioestrogens cannot be considered as standard neoadjuvant treatment for initially operable tumours.

Hormone therapy can be administered for different reasons, depending on the patients' age:
suppression of ovarian function in women with ovarian activity and/or as an antioestrogen,
antioestrogenic therapy in postmenopausal women.

In postmenopausal women, the combination of chemotherapy with an antioestrogen significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival (standard, level of evidence: A). The ratio of efficacy (overall or recurrence-free survival) and risk (toxicity) should be considered when taking the decision to prescribe this combination. The efficacy/risk ratio favours treatment in women with major metastatic risk factors (recommendation, expert agreement).

Other hormone therapy (progestogens, aromatase inhibitors) should not be considered as adjuvant treatments except in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard).

Further Discussion

Basic resource settings.

Many of the recommendations for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC emphasize offering tamoxifen in the Basic setting. Since most patients with BC have cancers that are HR-positive, the guideline recommends tamoxifen as a reasonable alternative. While the critical importance of basic immunohistochemistry, the Panel acknowledges that in some Basic settings, HR testing may not be available. As the potential harms of tamoxifen are relatively low, the Panel determined it offering a treatment option for patients in this situation was important. Tamoxifen is the historical mainstay of treatment for patients with HR-positive BC and is a recommended option in ASCO's 2016 guideline and re-affirmed in 2021. However, even tamoxifen may not be available (according to the global survey by Fundytus et al, it was universally available to 36% of oncologists in LMICs, and deemed substantial out-of-pocket expenses by 38% of respondents.) Referring the patients to higher-resource settings, if possible, is recommended.

For patients who are premenopausal, tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (surgical oophorectomy or radiotherapy ablation, when available) should be recommended rather than medical ovarian suppression strategies. Only surgeons with gynecologic surgical expertise should perform oophorectomies.

Limited resource settings.

In Limited resource setting recommendations for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC, sequencing tamoxifen with AIs, and ovarian ablation or suppression in patients who are premenopausal should be discussed. Chemotherapy for patients with resistance to hormonal treatments is appropriate when available. In recommendations 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 2.1.2, and 2.1.5, chemotherapy is an option in the Maximal setting guidelines. In recommendations 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4, the Maximal setting–recommended medical options are not likely available to most patients in the Limited settings, therefore, chemotherapy is an option.

Enhanced resource settings.

All the recommendations for HR-positive, HER2-negative, BRCA1 / 2 -negative, or unknown correspond to the ASCO Maximal setting recommendations. In situations where patients were previously treated with hormonal adjuvant therapy, it is important to consider the timing of the recurrence or diagnosis of the metastatic disease. Patients with an early recurrence (in the first 2 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy) will likely have endocrine-resistant disease. Patients with a diagnosis of metastatic disease after 12 months of completion of their adjuvant therapy should be noted as more endocrine sensitive and more likely to respond to further hormonal alternatives.

THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE ENDOCRINE THERAPIES

In patients with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapy is better tolerated than cytotoxic chemotherapy, while being equally effective. However, there are specific risks associated with endocrine treatments. For example, tamoxifen treatment is associated with a 2–4-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer, attributable to its oestrogen-like, partial agonist activity. The 'Arimidex', Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial showed a significantly greater incidence of ischaemic cerebrovascular events (2.1 vs 1.0%; P = 0.0006) and venous thromboembolic events (3.5 vs 2.1%; P = 0.0006) with tamoxifen, compared with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole. A number of other antioestrogens grouped together under the term SERMS have also been associated with partial agonist properties.

The AIs letrozole and exemestane may have an unfavourable effect on plasma lipid levels, and androgenic side effects have been reported with exemestane. Megestrol acetate, historically the most widely used progestin, is associated with weight gain and fluid retention and the high-dose oestrogen diethylstilboestrol is commonly associated with nausea, oedema, vaginal bleeding and cardiac problems.

The sequential use of well-tolerated hormonal therapies has become common clinical practice for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, where maintenance of quality of life is a primary aim. For this to be effective, it is necessary that the mechanism of action of newer agents differ from those previously used. This prerequisite prevents the sequential use of therapies belonging to the same class, and that therefore demonstrates cross-resistance with each other. Therefore, for some time, a search has been under way for an antioestrogen that lacks partial agonist properties and that has a mechanism of action different from tamoxifen.

Breast cancer — aromatase inhibitor (AI) adjuvant strategies and outcomes in postmenopausal patients include use as initial adjuvant therapy, as sequential therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended therapy following 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen, and the AIs are not active in patients with functioning ovaries and should not be used in patients whose ovarian function cannot reliably be assessed owing to treatment-induced amenorrhea. Results from two prospective, randomized trials provided evidence of an OS benefit for patients receiving initial endocrine therapy with tamoxifen followed sequentially by anastrozole (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28–0.99; p = 0.045) or exemestane (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69–1.00; p = 0.05) [excluding patients with ER-negative disease]) when compared with tamoxifen as the only endocrine therapy, and NCIC-CTG MA-17 demonstrated a survival advantage with extended letrozole compared with placebo in patients with ALN-positive (but not lymph node-negative), ER-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen and AIs have different side effect profiles, with AIs more commonly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased rate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis.

Both tamoxifen and raloxifene can reduce risk of some types of skeletal fractures, independent from the risk of breast cancer, and the USPSTF found that the benefits of taking tamoxifen, raloxifene, and aromatase inhibitors to reduce risk for breast cancer are greater than small in women at increased risk for the disease.

neoadjuvant endocrine therapy

The Panel was almost unanimous in supporting the use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy as an option for postmenopausal patients with highly endocrine-responsive disease. If given, the Panel considered that such treatment should be continued until maximal response or for a minimum of 4–8 months.

bisphosphonates

The Panel did not support the use of bisphosphonates for antitumor effect in either pre- or postmenopausal patients.

male breast cancer

Adjuvant tamoxifen was strongly supported, but only a slim majority would consider aromatase inhibitors in patients with contraindications to tamoxifen, such as thrombosis. The Panel did not support extended endocrine treatment beyond 5 years for male breast cancer. The lack of any evidence on these latter two points was acknowledged.

summary of systemic treatment recommendations

The approach to treatment within breast cancer subtypes greatly simplifies the definition of therapy indications, since the subtypes themselves incorporate many of the risk and predictive factors used in previous consensus recommendations. The broad recommendations are summarized in Table 3 and essentially indicate endocrine therapy alone for patients with clinicopathologically classified 'Luminal A' disease (except in defined high-risk cases), chemo-endocrine therapy for 'Luminal B', the addition of anti-HER2 therapy in the presence of 'HER2 positivity', and a reliance on chemotherapy for most patients with 'Triple negative' disease (e.g. those with invasive ductal carcinoma).

In conclusion, we present a novel ex vivo drug treatment platform coupled to scRNA-seq for human breast tumors. Through this platform, we identified distinctions in cellular response of subpopulations in normal human breast tissue and primary human tumors. Several mechanisms of resistance to tamoxifen were identified in resistant malignant cell subpopulations within human tumors, and signatures of those subpopulations predicted poor outcomes in patients with ER + /HER2 − breast tumors. Further studies are needed to determine clinically actionable strategies to identify patients at risk for therapeutic failure based on the presence of low-abundance drug-resistant subpopulations and determine cotreatment strategies to overcome resistance.

Figure 1
Pharmacogenomics discovery and validation, translation and implementation. The figure illustrates the fact that these components of pharmacogenomic research are interdependent and that each serves to inform the other two.

Breast cancer is the number one invasive cancer of women worldwide. 13, 14 In spite of major advances that have been made in the treatment of breast cancer, over 40,000 women die each year in the United States alone as a result of this disease. A major advance in both the treatment and the chemoprevention of breast cancer was the realization that the growth and origin of many of these tumors is driven, at least in part, by estrogens. 15, 16 That insight was followed by the development and application to the treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and, subsequently, of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), drugs that inhibit the biosynthesis of estrogens. 15, 16 Both SERMs and AIs dramatically reduce the recurrence of ER+ tumors after surgery, 15, 16 as well as the occurrence of breast cancer in women with increased risk for this disease. 17, 18, 19, 20 However, there are large individual differences in clinical response to SERM and AI therapy, both with regard to therapeutic efficacy, i.e. prevention of either the occurrence or recurrence of breast cancer, and the frequency of adverse drug reactions. A portion of that variation is determined by inheritance, often as a result of common germline genetic polymorphisms. During the past decade, the development of genome‐wide genotyping has made it possible to perform hypothesis‐generating genome‐wide discovery studies that have broadened our understanding of the role of genomics in breast cancer risk, breast cancer chemoprevention, the efficacy of drugs used to treat ER+ breast cancer, and the occurrence of adverse responses to therapy with those drugs. Subsequent paragraphs briefly summarize the application of GWAS to identify genes associated with response to drugs used to prevent or treat breast cancer, always followed by functional validation and the mechanistic pursuit of GWAS signals. Finally, this type of research requires significant funding, and the examples described below were funded by the US NIH NIGMS through the Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN) and involved both national and international collaboration, in the case of the studies described below, collaboration with the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences in Japan was particularly important.

BREAST CANCER SERM CHEMOPREVENTION GWAS

Two different classes of drugs have demonstrated efficacy in the chemoprevention of breast cancer: SERMs and AIs. 17, 18, 19, 20 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer chemoprevention. However, even though in both the US and the UK public health authorities have recommended SERM chemoprevention, very few subjects are being treated with these drugs for that purpose. Included among the reasons are the fact that ∼50 patients need to be treated to prevent one case of breast cancer and the occurrence of extremely rare, life‐threatening side effects. 17, 18, 19 Therefore, reliable biomarkers to identify the patients most likely to benefit from SERM chemoprevention are needed. Beyond SERMs, AIs have also been shown to prevent breast cancer. The Canadian Cancer Trials Group MAP.3 study included 4,560 women at moderate risk for breast cancer and reported a 65% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer when compared to placebo after 3 years of treatment with the steroidal AI exemestane. 20 However, the drugs most commonly used for breast cancer chemoprevention are the SERMs, and the most compelling evidence in support of their efficacy came from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) double‐blind, placebo‐controlled P‐1 trial of tamoxifen and the double‐blind P‐2 comparison of tamoxifen with raloxifene. 17, 18, 19 These two studies included over 33,000 women, and their results were the major basis for FDA approval of these two drugs for breast cancer prevention. Therefore, we used samples from women who participated in P‐1 and P‐2 to perform the GWAS described subsequently.

BREAST CANCER AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY GWAS

Over the past three decades, endocrine therapy has been the standard of care for the adjuvant therapy of ER+ breast cancer. Approximately 70% of breast cancers in the United States are hormone receptor‐positive, and the majority of those tumors occur in postmenopausal women. 23 Initially, these women were treated with tamoxifen, which reduced the rate of recurrence by ∼50%. However, during the past decade increasing evidence has accumulated that shows an advantage for AI adjuvant therapy, and today the majority of postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer are treated with one of the third‐generation AIs, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, 24 drugs which also reduce recurrence rates by ∼50%. It would be a major advance if we had biomarkers that would allow us to identify breast cancer patients who will or will not respond to adjuvant AI therapy. That was one of the goals as we set out to perform a GWAS using samples obtained from postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer who had been treated with AI therapy in the adjuvant setting, i.e. after the surgical resection of their tumors. 5

### Fulvestrant: an oestrogen receptor antagonist with a novel mechanism of action [^116op8t6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

New hormonal therapies with novel mechanisms of action that are not cross-resistant with the existing treatments make important additions to the repertoire of treatments for breast cancer. This enables additional endocrine agents to be used sequentially, with the aim of extending the effective duration of well-tolerated treatment before cytotoxic chemotherapy becomes necessary.

Fulvestrant ('Faslodex') is the first of a new type of endocrine treatment – an oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates the ER and has no agonist effects. An understanding of ER signalling is essential to distinguish between the mode of action of fulvestrant and that of tamoxifen and the other selective ER modulators (SERMs). This article summarises the current knowledge of oestrogen signalling, and outlines the mechanism of action of fulvestrant.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^114UaexW]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) — mechanism, populations, and adverse effects are summarized as follows: SERMs act as estrogen agonists or antagonists depending on the target tissue; tamoxifen has been used to prevent and treat hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women and in men, whereas raloxifene reduces the risk of HR+ breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women but is not used to treat patients already diagnosed with HR+ breast cancer. Tamoxifen and raloxifene competitively inhibit estradiol by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER); both exert an antiestrogenic effect on breast tissue and an estrogenic effect on the skeletal system, with tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, an estrogen agonist in the uterus. Both lower cholesterol and increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE); a family history of VTE is not a contraindication to SERM use, but SERMs should be used cautiously in those with a personal or family history suggestive of a coagulopathy. Frequent side effects include vasomotor symptoms (VMS), increased vaginal discharge, arthralgias and myalgias, and peripheral edema.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer risk-reducing medications — recommendations state that the USPSTF recommends that clinicians offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects (B recommendation), and recommends against the routine use of risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors, in women who are not at increased risk for breast cancer (C recommendation). This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy (such as atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ), and does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

### Why do we continue to have an incomplete understanding of estrogen receptor (s) actions in cancer systems? [^115DT9Vx]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The topic proposed asks why we have an incomplete understanding of estrogen receptor (ER) action in cancer. We agree that the role of ER in some cancers is poorly understood, but the role of ER in luminal breast cancer (which represents the biggest subtype of the most common cancer in women) is very well characterised. Although technologies evolve and allow us to learn more about the intricacies of the genome and the multitude of ways breast cancer can adapt to bypass treatments, our understanding of how ER regulates gene expression is extraordinary. We would posit that the key events in ER-mediated cell cycle progression are already known and although new information adds granular information to our paradigms of ER action, we need to better characterise what has been discovered already.

### Adjuvant hormonal therapy for premenopausal women with breast cancer [^11425JLj]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

Hormonal manipulation has been used for over 100 years to treat breast cancer. Ovarian ablation/suppression and tamoxifen are currently accepted adjuvant endocrine therapies for premenopausal breast cancer. Methods of permanently ablating ovarian function include surgical oophorectomy and radiation-induced ovarian failure; medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues is a reversible approach. Adjuvant chemotherapy frequently results in permanent amenorrhea and thus represents an indirect form of ovarian ablation. Although early randomized trials of ovarian ablation suffered from small sample sizes and design flaws, a meta-analysis of their results through the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group demonstrated a clear benefit from ovarian ablation as a single intervention in the adjuvant treatment of women less than 50 years of age with breast cancer. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis also demonstrated the efficacy of 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen as a single treatment modality, regardless of age. Even with these improvements in disease-free and overall survival, several important questions remain unanswered. The relative efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy versus ovarian ablation/suppression has not been strictly defined. However, the data suggest that the clinical benefit of either chemotherapy or ovarian ablation/suppression and 5 years of tamoxifen is similar. Thus, ovarian ablation/suppression combined with tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative to chemotherapy for some women with good-risk early-stage breast cancer (high hormone receptor expression, low-grade or lymph node-negative disease), particularly those wishing to preserve fertility. The value of combining ovarian ablation/suppression with chemotherapy, other endocrine therapy, or both and ameliorating the long-term morbidity of estrogen deprivation remain important areas for investigation. With the advent of multiple targeted endocrine therapies with distinct mechanisms of action, there is a unique opportunity to design highly informative clinical trials that can define the optimal combinations and sequencing of hormonal therapies in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS

The target site-specific actions of SERMs are not well understood, but there is an emerging understanding of the modulation of the SERM ER complex in breast cancer (Figure 3

Figure 3
The development of tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant breast cancer and the changing role of oestradiol (E 2) in the life and death of ER-positive cancer cells. (A) E 2 -stimulated growth is inhibited by the use of an aromatase inhibitor to block oestrogen synthesis or TAM to block the ER and prevent oestrogen-stimulated gene transcription. Optimal antioestrogenic effects occur in the absence of pre-existing cell surface signalling mechanisms. (B) Prolonged use of TAM promotes an increase in HER2/neu cell surface signalling that creates a survival pathway phosphorylating the TAM ER complex and coactivator proteins. The transcription complex becomes activated to enhance gene activation and TAM-stimulated growth. If this is Phase I resistance, then oestrogen will also promote growth; so an aromatase inhibitor is an appropriate second-line therapy. If it is Phase II resistance, E 2 causes apoptosis. (C) In Phase II tamoxifen resistance, the E 2 ER complex collapses the survival mechanisms by dramatically reducing the level of cell surface signalling by preventing HER2/neu mRNA transcription and the nuclear level of NF κ B, a transcription factor. (D) In Phase II tamoxifen resistance, the E 2 ER complex also enhances the synthesis of Fas receptor mRNA and protein which, in the presence of Fas ligand (FasL) activates caspase 8 and a cascade of events resulting in apoptosis. These figures are summaries of the mechanisms described inand.). Antioestrogenic action appears to be dominant in a cancer cell with no cell surface signalling, and the SERM ER complex binds preferentially to corepressor molecules to prevent gene activation and cell replication (Figure 3A). In contrast, the oestrogen-like actions of an SERM become dominant in acquired resistance when cells are selected with enhanced cell surface signalling, reduced corepressors but increased coactivator molecules (Figure 3B). This molecular mechanism could serve as a working model for Phase I drug resistance. It is plausible that the subsequent evolution of drug resistance into Phase II results from an enhanced sophistication in establishing survival pathways during continuing selection in an oestrogen-deprived environment. Ultimately, the ER appears to become redundant for growth in Phase III drug resistance. However, it is the remarkable switch from oestrogen-stimulated growth in breast cancer to oestrogen-stimulated death that merits investigation.first focused attention on the fas, fas ligand pathway as a potential mechanism of oestrogen-induced apoptosis in oestrogen-deprived breast cancer cells. Study of molecular mechanisms for oestrogen-induced tumour regression have recently been extended with the demonstration that oestrogen simultaneously collapses survival mechanisms (HER2/neu NF κ B) in the Phase II SERM-resistant tumour, and enhances the expression of the fas receptor (Figure 3C, D). Clearly, much needs to be done to understand the new molecular endocrinology of oestrogen action, but the knowledge now creates opportunities for novel applications in therapeutics.

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116psUfo]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer states: For women aged ≥ 35 y at increased risk for breast cancer, offer to prescribe risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors (Grade: B). For women aged ≥ 35 y not at increased risk for breast cancer, do not routinely use risk-reducing medications, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors (Grade: D). This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women 35 years and older, including women with previous benign breast lesions on biopsy, and does not apply to women who have a current or previous diagnosis of breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The USPSTF has also made recommendations on screening for breast cancer and on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA gene mutations.

METHODS

End points

Several end points could be used in evaluating the different strategies. Recurrence is the most sensitive endpoint for evaluating efficacy, and includes distant recurrence, local recurrence and contralateral tumours. This is preferable to disease-free survival (DFS), which would also include intercurrent deaths without recurrence. These latter events rightfully belong in the safety or overall analysis, but are not relevant for efficacy, where they dilute real differences in efficacy with events unrelated to breast cancer. Using only distant recurrences would provide a better surrogate for death from breast cancer, but their use requires longer follow-up, and it is too early to use this end point at this stage.

The use of recurrence rates gives equal weight to early and late recurrences. It is clear that an early recurrence is more detrimental than a late one, and integrating the recurrence curves to give the per cent of 'time lost to recurrence' is probably the best summary measure of efficacy in this context. Thus a recurrence at year 1 would lose 90% of the first 10 years to recurrence, but a recurrence at year 9 would only lose 10%. For a 10-year window, the actual number of years lost is just the percentage multiplied by 10, and this gives a useful measure for comparing strategies. We will evaluate both measures, but focus on this latter outcome measure below.

Carryover

One key question is how long the effect will be maintained after treatment is stopped. The EBCTCG overview has shown that the effect of tamoxifen on recurrence is maintained for about 5 years after stopping 5 years of treatment. The only data on AIs come from the ATAC trial where the same magnitude of reduction was seen in year 6 as in previous years.

Carryover is a consequence of curing a proportion of patients, and not simply holding tumours in check. If treatment is curative, then all future recurrences are prevented, so the hazard ratio will remain below unity even after treatment has stopped. This is expected for chemotherapy, but the long-term results from the overview strongly suggest that tamoxifen is also curing a proportion of patients, and that its action is more than cytostatic. A reasonable assumption is that the early superiority of AIs over tamoxifen will result in a higher cure rate and that the reduction in recurrence rates will also be maintained for 5 years after the treatment ceases. This assumption is used in our base case model. However, given the importance of this parameter and the paucity of data, models with a 2-year carryover are also evaluated.

### Targeting oestrogen to kill the cancer but not the patient [^116mDsmR]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

It is now clear that there are two types of drug resistance to tamoxifen: intrinsic resistance, where the tumour is either ER negative or ER positive with pre-existing enhanced survival pathways (HER2/neu plus a coactivator molecule AIB1), and acquired resistance where an ER-positive tumour that initially responds to treatment now becomes tamoxifen-stimulated and grows in response to either tamoxifen or oestrogen. An ER-positive breast tumour that initially responds to an SERM eventually develops acquired resistance by clonal selection for increased cell surface signalling that subverts the SERM ER complex through enhanced phosphorylation cascades. The laboratory description of acquired resistance forms the scientific basis for the understanding of current therapeutic interventions with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant as second-line agents, following the development of clinical resistance to tamoxifen. Aromatase inhibitors block oestrogen synthesis and fulvestrant destroys the ER to prevent the growth of breast cancers with acquired tamoxifen resistance. However, despite the remarkable investment in a broad range of antihormonal therapies, the actual advance in improved survival and reduced side effects has been modest.

The successful control of breast cancer with antihormonal therapy requires years of successive treatments. An obstacle to the progress in therapeutics is a clear understanding of the changes that occur in the breast cancer cell, as a consequence of exhaustive antihormonal therapies. It is presumed that the cancer cell must create a sophisticated survival network and suppress the natural process of apoptosis to subvert the continuous inhibitory signal through the ER. Until recently, no laboratory models replicated the former clinical scenario, but the deficiencies in our knowledge are being corrected.

Drug resistance to tamoxifen evolves through three phases: Phases I and II both require tamoxifen, or a related SERM, to maintain growth, but in Phase III the ER-positive tumour is refractory to all antihormonal therapies and growth is SERM independent (Figure 1B).

### Selective estrogen-receptor modulators and antihormonal resistance in breast cancer [^114ggyfm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Selective estrogen-receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs) are synthetic nonsteroidal compounds that switch on and switch off target sites throughout the body. Tamoxifen, the pioneering SERM, blocks estrogen action by binding to the ER in breast cancers. Tamoxifen has been used ubiquitously in clinical practice during the last 30 years for the treatment of breast cancer and is currently available to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women. Raloxifene maintains bone density (estrogen-like effect) in postmenopausal osteoporotic women, but at the same time reduces the incidence of breast cancer in both high- and low-risk (osteoporotic) postmenopausal women. Unlike tamoxifen, raloxifene does not increase the incidence of endometrial cancer. Clearly, the simple ER model of estrogen action can no longer be used to explain SERM action at different sites around the body. Instead, a new model has evolved on the basis of the discovery of protein partners that modulate estrogen action at distinct target sites. Coactivators are the principal players that assemble a complex of functional proteins around the ligand ER complex to initiate transcription of a target gene at its promoter site. A promiscuous SERM ER complex creates a stimulatory signal in growth factor receptor-rich breast or endometrial cancer cells. These events cause drug-resistant, SERM-stimulated growth. The sometimes surprising pharmacology of SERMs has resulted in a growing interest in the development of new selective medicines for other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This will allow the precise treatment of diseases that was previously considered impossible.

### Impact of NICE guidance on tamoxifen prescribing in england 2011–2017: an interrupted time series analysis [^115hsPQf]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

A NICE economic impact assessment estimated a reduction of 11 cancers over 50 years per 1000 women offered tamoxifen or raloxifene. However, setting our findings in the context of the NICE forecast is challenging. Contrary to current literature, which gives a 10% estimate for uptake, NICE assumed an uptake rate of 25% (with no source given, and scenarios additionally modelled with 50 and 75% uptake); and a 50% one-year dropout rate (attributed to 'expert opinion'). In estimating 50-year risks, they used a risk reduction figure of 35% averaged from two studies with only up to 10 years follow-up data, and applied this to unpublished annual cancer incidence rates obtained from personal communication. The potential total eligible population and uptake were not calculated.

Consistent with our results, previous studies find that the response in primary care to new guidelines generally falls short of expectations. – Sometimes this may be because a change in practice precedes the guidelines; however the initial steady rate of tamoxifen prescribing we report follows a period of decline between 2001 and 2009.

An extensively reported GP survey showed wide variation in GPs' knowledge of change in the evidence and guidance on preventive treatment. Our results do not indicate that the change in use of tamoxifen was concentrated in a subset of practices. This lack of variation in response by individual practices may be because chemoprevention is often discussed in specialist clinics, each of which will cover a range of practices. However, this discussion will often be initiated in primary care, thus leaving room for variation in care driven by variation in primary care physicians' knowledge.

### ICI 182, 780 (fulvestrant) – the first oestrogen receptor down-regulator – current clinical data [^114oBPBa]. British Journal of Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant™) is the first in a new class of novel, steroidal, 'pure' antioestrogens – the oestrogen receptor (ER) down-regulators. Its unique mode of action and the absence of partial agonist activity make it a candidate for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen has been available for use over the past 25 years. However, its partial agonist activity has been associated with detrimental effects, particularly on the endometrium, and may be associated with the development of tamoxifen resistance. Other antioestrogen agents have previously been unable to demonstrate clinically relevant activity following the development of resistance to tamoxifen. In contrast, the unique mechanism of action of ICI 182,780 results in significant clinical activity in patients failing on tamoxifen therapy. Indeed, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that ICI 182,780 is at least as effective as the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole in the treatment of postmenopausal patients with advanced disease who have progressed during threatment with prior enocrine therapy. As such, ICI 182,780 will provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. © 2001 Cancer Research Society

### Medication use to reduce risk of breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116BdCFK]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) findings — evidence on benefits, harms, and risk assessment indicates that risk assessment tools can predict the number of cases of breast cancer expected to develop in a population but perform modestly at best in discriminating between individual women who will or will not develop breast cancer. Risk-reducing medications (tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors) provide at least a moderate benefit in reducing risk for invasive estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer, while benefits are no greater than small in women not at increased risk for the disease. Tamoxifen and raloxifene and adequate evidence for aromatase inhibitors indicate associations with small to moderate harms, and overall the net benefit of taking medications to reduce risk of breast cancer is larger in women who have a greater risk for developing breast cancer.
