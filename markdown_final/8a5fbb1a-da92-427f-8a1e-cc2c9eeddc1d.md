A. Upper uterine segment CS
B. Twins pregnant
C. Obesity
A 32-year-old woman

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single factor among prior upper uterine segment (classical) cesarean, twin gestation, and obesity most increases the risk of uterine rupture in this current pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how prior classical cesarean alters baseline rupture risk and by how much. Then, I should verify what data exist for twin gestation as an independent risk factor for rupture. Next, I will examine whether obesity meaningfully increases rupture risk after adjusting for confounders. Finally, I need to synthesize a comparative risk hierarchy and confirm that no interaction effect supersedes the dominant factor identified, before concluding definitively.

> Let me first confirm the risk associated with a prior classical cesarean incision. A classical incision is high-transverse or vertical in the upper uterine segment, which heals less reliably and carries the highest risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies, typically cited around 1% to 12% depending on labor management, far exceeding the risk after low-transverse incisions, and is the main reason ACOG recommends avoiding trial of labor after cesarean in such patients [^1133RZCF] [^113H5K6p] [^113fA9Lc].

> Wait, let me verify how to frame the comparison options precisely. The stem says "upper uterine segment CS", which in common obstetric usage corresponds to a classical uterine incision; the other options are twin gestation and obesity, so I should keep the comparator focused on these three, recognizing that "classical" is the key scar morphology driving risk in the prior CS category [^113H5K6p].

> I need to check whether twin gestation independently increases rupture risk. The most direct population signal comes from large U.S. cohort analyses of TOLAC where twin pregnancies were rare; there were only two ruptures among 4,317 twins, yielding an absolute rate similar to singletons and insufficient to establish a major independent risk increase, suggesting that if a risk exists, it is small and far below classical-scar risk [^115CNXvL]. But wait, what if we consider pathophysiology rather than just absolute counts? Twin gestation imposes uterine overdistension and can unmask or worsen a scar weakness, yet case reports of spontaneous rupture in unscarred twins underscore a mechanical vulnerability rather than proving a higher risk than a classical scar; taken together, twins appear to be a modest contributor at most, not a dominant driver like a classical incision [^115g6V7P] [^115CNXvL].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of obesity. Obesity can impair wound healing and is associated with more operative complications, but when rupture risk is examined in TOLAC cohorts, higher BMI has shown either no association or a mild protective effect after adjustment, likely due to less effective contractions, and obesity is not cited as a primary independent risk factor for rupture magnitude comparable to a classical scar; thus, obesity's contribution appears minor relative to the other options here [^115CNXvL].

> Let me synthesize a comparative hierarchy, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating twins or obesity. Classical cesarean scar confers the highest rupture risk among the three by roughly an order of magnitude or more compared with low-transverse scars and far exceeds what has been demonstrated for twins or obesity, while twin gestation appears at most a small independent contributor and obesity likely contributes minimally if at all after confounder adjustment, placing the order as: prior classical CS > twin gestation > obesity for absolute rupture risk in this pregnancy [^1133RZCF] [^113H5K6p] [^115CNXvL].

> I should confirm there isn't a synergistic effect that would make twins plus classical scar exceed classical alone as the dominant risk. Although overdistension can theoretically worsen a weak scar, no high-quality evidence shows that twinning multiplies classical-scar risk beyond the already very high baseline, and guidelines continue to treat classical incision as the overriding contraindication to TOLAC irrespective of plurality, reinforcing that the classical scar itself is the primary determinant here [^113fA9Lc].

> Conclusion: I need to ensure the answer is precise and clinically actionable. The highest-risk factor for uterine rupture in this pregnancy is the prior upper uterine segment (classical) cesarean scar, given its substantially higher baseline rupture risk compared with low-transverse scars and compared with the modest contributions, if any, from twin gestation and obesity in adjusted analyses [^1133RZCF] [^113H5K6p] [^115CNXvL].

---

The highest risk of uterine rupture in this patient is **prior upper uterine segment (classical) cesarean** [^113fA9Lc] because it carries a 4–9% rupture risk in subsequent pregnancies [^113H5K6p], far exceeding the modest risk from twin gestation or obesity. Twin pregnancy adds only a **small, incremental risk** [^115CNXvL], and obesity is not an independent risk factor for rupture [^notfound]. Management should prioritize **planned cesarean delivery at 36–37 weeks** [^113H5K6p] to minimize rupture risk.

## Risk factors for uterine rupture

Uterine rupture is rare but severe; risk varies by **clinical context**. Key risk factors include:

- **Previous uterine surgery**: Especially classical cesarean or myomectomy [^113H5K6p] [^1133RZCF].
- **Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)**: Particularly with induction or augmentation [^115XGNLW] [^1127Gv3b].
- **Multiple gestation**: Twin pregnancy increases risk, though less than classical cesarean [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Associated with wound complications but not an independent rupture risk [^115CNXvL].

---

## Comparative risk analysis

| **Risk factor** | **Relative risk of uterine rupture** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Classical cesarean section | 4–9% | - Highest risk <br/> - Strongly contraindicates TOLAC [^113H5K6p] [^113fA9Lc] |
| Twin pregnancy | Slightly increased | Modest independent risk; far less than classical cesarean [^notfound] |
| Obesity | Not an independent risk | - No direct association with rupture <br/> - Increases wound complications [^115CNXvL] |

---

Classical cesarean carries the **highest risk** due to poor scar healing and weak myometrium, whereas twins add only a small incremental risk and obesity is not a direct rupture risk [^113fA9Lc].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Given the combination of classical cesarean and twins, **management should include**:

- **Planned cesarean delivery**: Schedule at 36–37 weeks to reduce rupture risk [^113H5K6p].
- **Avoidance of TOLAC**: Classical cesarean is a contraindication to TOLAC [^113fA9Lc].
- **Close monitoring**: Watch for abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, or fetal distress [^113sd9Zh].

---

## Conclusion

The **primary risk** of uterine rupture in this patient is the prior classical cesarean section; twin pregnancy contributes only a small additional risk, and obesity is not an independent risk factor. Planned cesarean at 36–37 weeks is recommended to mitigate rupture risk [^113H5K6p].

### Incidence of recurrent uterine rupture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112EoMqw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Uterine rupture is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in the mother and fetus. Uterine rupture occurs more frequently in the setting of a scarred uterus. – Recent studies have highlighted the growing incidence of uterine rupture attributed to the rising rate of cesarean delivery and myomectomy surgery, especially in pregnancies among older gravid patients.

About 10% of uterine ruptures are managed through hysterectomy, and the remaining cases undergo repair without removal of the uterus. Despite uterine preservation, clinicians may not recommend subsequent pregnancies. However, patients with prior uterine rupture often express an interest in childbearing. Therefore, providing patients who have experienced prior uterine rupture with comprehensive counseling on the risks of future pregnancies is important. Brief reviews have crudely estimated the incidence of recurrent uterine rupture, and they did not take into account the weights of each study; moreover, they were not systematic reviews with rigorous methodology. Therefore, the overall pooled incidence of recurrent uterine rupture remains unknown.

The purpose of this systematic review was to estimate the pooled incidence of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies among patients with previous uterine rupture. The results will provide an appropriate point of counseling for patients with prior uterine rupture and help guide the management of subsequent pregnancies.

### Risk of uterine rupture and adverse perinatal outcome at term after cesarean delivery [^112rz3ov]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Current information on the risk of uterine rupture after cesarean delivery has generally compared the risk after trial of labor to that occurring with an elective cesarean delivery without labor. Because antepartum counseling cannot account for whether a woman will develop an indication requiring a repeat cesarean delivery or whether labor will occur before scheduled cesarean delivery, the purpose of this analysis was to provide clinically useful information regarding the risks of uterine rupture and adverse perinatal outcome for women at term with a history of prior cesarean delivery.

Methods

Women with a term singleton gestation and prior cesarean delivery were studied over 4 years at 19 centers. For this analysis, outcomes from five groups were studied: trial of labor, elective repeat with no labor, elective repeat with labor (women presenting in early labor who subsequently underwent cesarean delivery), indicated repeat with labor, and indicated repeat without labor. All cases of uterine rupture were reviewed centrally to assure accuracy of diagnosis.

Results

A total of 39,117 women were studied. In term pregnant women with a prior cesarean delivery, the overall risk for uterine rupture was 0.32% (125 of 39,117), and the overall risk for serious adverse perinatal outcome (stillbirth, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, neonatal death) was 106 of 39,049 (0.27%). The uterine rupture risk for indicated repeat cesarean delivery (labor or without labor) was 7 of 6,080 (0.12%); the risk for elective (no indication) repeat cesarean delivery (labor or without labor) was 4 of 17,714 (0.02%). Indicated repeat cesarean delivery increased the risk of uterine rupture by a factor of 5 (odds ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.49–17.44). In the absence of an indication, the presence of labor also increased the risk of uterine rupture (4 of 2,721 [0.15%] compared with 0 of 14,993, P < .01). The highest rate of uterine rupture occurred in women undergoing trial of labor (0.74%, 114 of 15,323).

Conclusion

At term, the risk of uterine rupture and adverse perinatal outcome for women with a singleton and prior cesarean delivery is low regardless of mode of delivery, occurring in 3 per 1,000 women. Maternal complications occurred in 3–8% of women within the five delivery groups.

### Analysis of the uterine rupture during pregnancy and delivery in a provincial maternal and children care hospital in China: 2013–2022 [^1177e6rY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, the second and early third-trimester uterine rupture remains a diagnostic challenge but is associated with catastrophic outcomes. In addition, remarkably worse maternal outcomes were seen in patients with second-trimester rupture when compared with patients who experienced late-pregnancy rupture. Pregnant women with a history of uterine surgery, even at an early gestational age, should be closely monitored by obstetricians for the risk of uterine rupture if they experience persistent abdominal pain. Graded management (all pregnant women need to be risk-graded, well-educated and strict control of high-risk factors), early hospitalization and individualized delivery plans for patients at high risk of uterine rupture are key to the early diagnosis and treatment of uterine rupture.

By remaining vigilant about uterine rupture, identifying and managing high-risk pregnant women, and enhancing the emergency treatment capabilities of multidisciplinary medical teams, clinicians can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### Inter-pregnancy interval and uterine rupture during a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^116iGGep]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the United States and Australia, 32%–37% of all mothers gave birth by caesarean delivery in 2021, and 31% gave birth by caesarean delivery in the United Kingdom in 2019. Recent reports demonstrate that having a previous caesarean delivery is now the most common indication for a caesarean delivery in the current pregnancy. Conversely, despite a trial of labour after caesarean (TOLAC) being considered safe for most women, only 12%–14% of women with one or more previous caesarean deliveries had a vaginal birth.

Uterine rupture, often defined as any full thickness separation of the myometrial layer and the visceral peritoneum, typically occurs at the site of a previous caesarean scar but can also occur following other uterine surgery such as myomectomy. The cardinal risk factor for uterine rupture is a TOLAC, as rupture in the absence of uterine contractions is rare. Consequently, uterine rupture may be avoided in most cases if a caesarean delivery is performed before labour. Hence, when deciding on the planned mode of birth, the risks of a planned caesarean delivery must be balanced against the risks of a TOLAC, primarily uterine rupture. To deepen understanding of the risks of the latter choice, we focus only on TOLAC outcomes, and particularly the primary serious risk which is uterine rupture. Uterine rupture in turn, is associated with serious complications including perinatal mortality, neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and maternal hysterectomy.

### Clinical analysis of complete uterine rupture during pregnancy [^115tEHut]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the etiology and risk factors for complete uterine rupture

Due to the low cesarean section rate and the large number of patients with two or multiple deliveries between 1960 and 1990, uterine rupture was the predominantly primary. After 1990, with the implementation of family planning policies, the cesarean section rate increased, and subsequently, cesarean section scar rupture became the primary cause of uterine rupture. Therefore, with the improvement in medical standards, doctors' awareness of uterine rupture, and repeated emergency drills, the main etiology has changed.

The known etiologies and risk factors for uterine rupture are as follows.

Previous uterine injury or history of abnormalities.

A history of myometrial surgery and short or long intervals between surgeries, which include cesarean section (incidence of uterine rupture was 0.071%, 0.095% for a history of one cesarean Sect. and 1.92% for a history of two or more cesarean Sects.), history of repair of uterine rupture (33%), myomectomy, wedge resection of the uterine horn (incidence of uterine rupture is up to 30%), tubal surgery, hysteroscopic septum resection (incidence of uterine rupture is 1.0%–2.7%), and separation of adhesions in the uterine cavity. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection may increase the incidence of cesarean delivery complications. Current research suggests that the uterine wound healing takes 12 weeks, while myometrial incision healing and scar formation takes 6–12 months; however, wound healing does not mean that it is able to withstand the pressure of pregnancy immediately. It also undergoes a process of tissue reconstruction, which further strengthens the elasticity of the uterine myometrial wall in the area of the scar. Therefore, less than 12–18 months is a high-risk factor for uterine rupture, and 2–3 years after cesarean section is the optimal period for uterine incision healing. After > 5 years, the uterine scar's degree of muscularization will gradually deteriorate and it will lose elasticity, making uterine rupture more likely during another pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture for second pregnancies has been reported in the literature, even when tubal surgery does not involve the mesosalpinx or uterine horn, with a higher risk in the presence of electrocoagulation injuries, injury to or absence of part of the myometrial layer of the uterine horn, localized unsutures, and short intervals between pregnancies. The incidence of uterine rupture in our study was 0.79 per 1000 in those with a history of cesarean section, 0.057% in those with a history of one cesarean section, and 0.022% in those with a history of two or more cesarean sections. In our study, 11 patients (33.33%) had an interval of pregnancy out of 1.5 and 5 years, two (6.06%) had a history of tubal surgery, one (3.03%) had a history of wedge resection of the uterine horn, and one (3.03%) was a person living with HIV. It is important to note that in patients with a history of uterine rupture, the rupture was not at the same location. Uterine injuries include abortion, curettage, as well as sharp or blunt contusions such as car accidents, knives, and hidden uterine ruptures. In the present study, six (18.18%) patients had a history of intrauterine manipulation as a risk factor. Congenital abnormalities include uterine dysplasia, and connective tissue defects. In the present study, two patients (6.06%) had a double uterus. Furthermore, one patient (case 7) had a history of transabdominal cervical cerclage. During pregnancy, the cerclage line increases with the uterus, creating a chronic transverse cutting effect on the cervix, Uterine rupture occurs at the site of the cervical cut once there is significant uterine contraction.

### Clinical analysis of complete uterine rupture during pregnancy [^1125vAZA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture(UR) is a serious complication that directly jeopardizes the life of the mother and the fetus. It refers to the rupture of the uterine body or the lower uterine segment in late pregnancy or during labor, requiring a cesarean section to terminate the pregnancy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. The most common risk factors of UR are a history of previous cesarean section (CS), myomectomy, multiparity, malpresentation, breech extraction, and instrumental deliveries.

The incidence of uterine rupture in China has recently been reported to range from 0.1% to 0.55%; although this incidence rate is low, UR is highly likely to lead to serious adverse outcomes.

Currently, there are no effective means for detecting or predicting the weakest points of the uterus. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to provide reference information and practical experience for the early recognition, management and emergency treatment of uterine rupture.

### Prevention of the first cesarean delivery [^114WBZvW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Education of providers and patients on the importance of vaginal delivery, for the current pregnancy as well as future pregnancies, is essential to reverse the current trend of primary cesareans. When discussing cesarean with patients, counseling should include the effect on subsequent pregnancy risks including the possibility of uterine rupture and placentation abnormalities. In addition, counseling must include the concept that normal labor takes time. Re-education on the natural process of labor, the importance of allowing the time needed, and patience with the duration of pregnancy and process of labor is essential.

### Pregnancy complications and risk of uterine rupture among women with singleton pregnancies in China [^1132v4mW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture (UR) is a tear in the uterine wall that occurs before or during labour. It poses considerable risks for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, including serious health risks for both mother (e.g. maternal death) and foetus (e.g. stillbirth, neonatal death). Mounting evidence supports that a history of caesarean section is a major risk factor for UR in subsequent pregnancies, and the risk increases with the number of previous cesarean deliveries. The incidence of UR varies across countries, ranging from 0.18 to 9 cases per 1,000 pregnant women. Many countries have created policies to decrease caesarean rates, but the UR rate has increased over the years. It is unknown whether the increasing rate of UR is due to the effects of potential risk factors related to a history of caesarean section.

Evidence suggests that women who have a history of caesarean section may be at increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as placental abruption, placenta previa, placenta percreta, gestational diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia. These pregnancy complications may be partly considered manifestations of dysfunctional placental function. To date, placenta percreta has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of UR. However, there are limited data on the association of other pregnancy complications with UR. A few studies with small sample sizes have analysed the risk of UR with diabetes and hypertension, but these studies have yielded different conclusions. In addition, current guidelines only discuss the impact of vaginal trial delivery after caesarean section on the occurrence of UR, but the effects of pregnancy complications related to previous caesarean deliveries have not been reported. If a link between pregnancy complications and UR is confirmed, it may provide additional preventive measures.

We hypothesize that pregnancy complications (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, placental abruption, placenta previa, placenta percreta) may be associated with an increased risk of UR. Therefore, our study analysed more than 9 million singleton pregnant women from China's National Maternal Near Miss Surveillance System (NMNMSS) to evaluate whether these pregnancy complications were associated with the risk of UR. By analysing the impact of each pregnancy complication in different gestational age groups, we provided insights into the early interventions that would contribute to reducing the incidence of UR in pregnant women.

### Outcome of subsequent pregnancies post uterine rupture in previous delivery: a case series, a review, and recommendations for appropriate management [^114DxybK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To provide clinicians with concrete solutions on the best management of and counseling for patients in a subsequent pregnancy following uterine rupture.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients treated between 2005 and 2020 at Sheba Medical Center was conducted. All patients who had undergone a complete uterine rupture and subsequently had a full-term pregnancy were included. A literature review was conducted using Pubmed database and including previously published literature reviews.

Results

Fifteen patients with subsequent pregnancies following uterine rupture were included in our cohort. Mean interval between rupture and subsequent pregnancy was 3.8years (range 2.2–6.9years). One patient had repeat uterine rupture of less than 2 cm at 36 +5 weeksof pregnancy. A total of 17 studies were selected in this literature review, including a total of 774 pregnancies in 635 patients. The risk of repeated uterine rupture was 8.0% (62/774), ranging from 0% to 37.5%. Overall, the risk of maternal death was of 0.6% (4/635), with only four cases reported in three studies.

Conclusion

The risk of recurrence after uterine rupture is significant but should not prevent patients from conceiving.

### Uterine rupture: what family physicians need to know [^111fWSjL]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Vaginal birth after cesarean section is common in this country. Physicians providing obstetric care should be aware of the potential complications. Uterine rupture occurs in approximately one of every 67 to 500 women (with one prior low-transverse incision) undergoing a trial of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean section. Rupture poses serious risks to mother and infant. There are no reliable predictors or unequivocal clinical manifestations of rupture, so physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for possible rupture, especially in the presence of fetal bradycardia or other evidence of fetal distress. Management is surgery for prompt delivery of the infant and control of maternal hemorrhage. Newborns often require admission to an intensive care nursery. Prevention of poor outcomes depends on thorough anticipation and preparation. The physicians and the delivery institution should be prepared to provide emergency surgical and neonatal care in the event of uterine rupture.

### Non-haemorrhagic uterine rupture at 28 weeks of pregnancy following previous caesarean section: a case report [^111ZoNn6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture following previous caesarean section is a documented risk; its incidence among women with at least one prior caesarean section was found to be 0.5%. This complication contributes to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Perinatal outcomes after uterine rupture depend on the interval between diagnosis and delivery and hence early diagnosis and delivery decrease fetal morbidity and mortality. However, the initial signs and symptoms of uterine rupture are not very specific and this makes early diagnosis difficult. There is therefore need to put forward other symptoms and signs that could suggest this diagnosis so that clinicians' suspicion is increased; there is also need to put forward uncommon intraoperative findings in patients with uterine rupture to correlate with the signs and symptoms of patients.

### Incidence of recurrent uterine rupture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yHufv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to quantify the incidence of recurrent uterine rupture in pregnant women.

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov for observational studies was performed from 2000 to 2023.

Methods Of Study Selection

Of the 7,440 articles screened, 13 studies were included in the final review. We included studies of previous uterine ruptures that were complete uterine ruptures, defined as destruction of all uterine layers, including the serosa. The primary outcome was the pooled incidence of recurrent uterine rupture. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 value. Subgroup analyses were conducted in terms of the country development status, year of publication, and study size (single center vs national study). The secondary outcomes comprised the following: 1) mean gestational age at which recurrent rupture occurred, 2) mean gestational age at which delivery occurred without recurrent rupture, and 3) perinatal complications (blood loss, transfusion, maternal mortality, and neonatal mortality).

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

A random-effects model was used to pool the incidence or mean value and the corresponding 95% CI with R software. The pooled incidence of recurrent uterine rupture was 10% (95% CI 6–17%). Developed countries had a significantly lower uterine rupture recurrence rate than less developed countries (6% vs 15%, P = .04). Year of publication and study size were not significantly associated with recurrent uterine rupture. The mean number of gestational weeks at the time of recurrent uterine rupture was 32.49 (95% CI 29.90–35.08). The mean number of gestational weeks at the time of delivery without recurrent uterine rupture was 35.77 (95% CI 34.95–36.60). The maternal mortality rate was 5% (95% CI 2–11%), and the neonatal mortality rate was 5% (95% CI 3–10%). Morbidity from hemorrhage, such as bleeding and transfusion, was not reported in any study and could not be evaluated.

Conclusion

This systematic review estimated a 10% incidence of recurrent uterine rupture. This finding will enable appropriate risk counseling in patients with prior uterine rupture.

### Obstetric emergencies [^1127Gv3b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Uterine rupture, uterine inversion, and pelvic lacerations/hematomas are all associated with increased risk for hemorrhage at the time of delivery. Certain clinical factors will increase the likelihood that these complications will occur, and clinical management can be adapted to reduce risk. Prior cesarean section is a significant risk factor for uterine rupture, with the degree of risk directly related to the location and quantity of prior uterine incisions. Obstetric trauma is another independent risk factor for uterine rupture. In turn, uterine inversion has traditionally been associated with overly aggressive management of the third stage of labor. The forces of normal labor and delivery will sometimes result in lacerations and hematomas of the lower genital tract. Except for the most superficial tears, these lacerations require surgical repair to restore proper anatomical appearance and support and to limit blood loss. Trauma in pregnancy remains one of the major contributors to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

### Incidence of recurrent uterine rupture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11475gGJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

STUDY SELECTION

Full-text articles in which a previous complete uterine rupture occurred were included. Complete uterine rupture was defined as destruction of all layers of the uterus, including the serosa. Studies with prior incomplete uterine rupture, in which the serosa remained intact, were not included because aspects of clinical care and anticipated outcomes differ from those with complete uterine rupture. The included patients were women who had previously developed a uterine rupture, subsequently become pregnant, and then given birth. The diagnostic approach to uterine rupture was determined by the methodology used in each respective article. We excluded pregnancy resulting in miscarriage in patients with prior uterine rupture, articles from which the required data could not be extracted from the original work, studies with fewer than five patients, studies not published in English, and studies published before the year 2000.

All retrieved studies were exported to EndNote 20.4. Study screening was conducted after duplicates were identified and removed with this system.

The primary outcome was the pooled incidence of recurrent uterine rupture in patients with previous uterine rupture. The secondary outcomes comprised the following: 1) mean gestational age at which recurrent uterine rupture occurred, 2) mean gestational age at which delivery occurred without recurrent uterine rupture, and 3) perinatal complications (blood loss, transfusion, maternal mortality, and neonatal mortality).

The quality of each included study was assessed with the Risk-of-Bias Assessment Tool for Non-randomized Studies. This tool was developed to assess the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies and consists of the following six domains: 1) selection of participants (selection bias), 2) confounding variables (selection bias), 3) measurement of exposure (performance bias), 4) blinding of outcome assessments (detection bias), 5) incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and 6) selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). The risk of bias in each area was categorized as a low risk, high risk, or unclear risk. The details and evaluation criteria of these domains are shown in Appendix 2, available online at. A funnel plot was created to examine the publication bias. When the number of studies was sufficient, the Egger test was used to examine the asymmetry of the funnel plot.

### Incidence of recurrent uterine rupture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nBemn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Uterine rupture is more prevalent in developing countries than in developed countries, and it is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. We performed a subgroup analysis according to the country's economic status (developed vs developing countries). The incidence of recurrent uterine rupture was 6% in developed countries and 15% in developing countries. This difference may be attributed to a number of factors, including a delayed response to obstructed labor; differences in use of medications; lack of dissemination of health information, including warning signs, to patients; and limited access to health care in economically poor countries. It is notable that the observed differences were driven primarily by a single study. Nonetheless, it is possible that increased access and improved obstetric care in developing countries could reduce the number of recurrent uterine ruptures in pregnancy.

Some prior reports concluded that allowing a subsequent pregnancy after uterine rupture is appropriate. Our pooled incidence of recurrent uterine rupture, maternal mortality, and neonatal mortality may be viewed differently by different clinicians and patients. If a patient with a history of uterine rupture wishes to become pregnant, the risk of recurrent uterine rupture and the possibility of serious conditions including death of the mother and newborn should be discussed as part of shared decision making.

We also found that the mean gestational age at which recurrent uterine rupture occurred was 32.49 weeks, which is before the time when delivery would typically be recommended. Patients should be instructed to visit the hospital as soon as signs of labor appear, and they need to be evaluated promptly. We also found that the pooled mean gestational age at delivery in patients with a history of uterine rupture was 35.77 weeks. However, it was difficult to identify the indications for delivery in each included study. Frank et alused a decision analysis model with a theoretical cohort and proposed that delivery should be planned between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. Our result is consistent with this recommendation and may simply represent standard practice patterns. Delivery timing will ultimately be based on an assessment of the balance between complications of prematurity and any evidence of an increased risk of recurrent uterine rupture.

Methodological quality was evaluated for each study by using criteria from the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Uterine rupture was categorised as asymptomatic or symptomatic.

Results

We reviewed 568 full text articles to identify 71 potentially eligible studies, 21 of which were rated at least fair in quality. Compared with elective repeat caesarean delivery, trial of labour increased the risk of uterine rupture by 2.7 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 4.73) per 1000 cases. No maternal deaths were related to rupture. For women attempting vaginal delivery, the additional risk of perinatal death from rupture of a uterine scar was 1.4 (0 to 9.8) per 10,000 and the additional risk of hysterectomy was 3.4 (0 to 12.6) per 10 000. The rates of asymptomatic uterine rupture in trial of labour and elective repeat caesarean did not differ significantly.

Conclusions

Although the literature on uterine rupture is imprecise and inconsistent, existing studies indicate that 370 (213 to 1370) elective caesarean deliveries would need to be performed to prevent one symptomatic uterine rupture.

### Uterine rupture: risk factors and pregnancy outcome [^111JJjm9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed at determining risk factors and pregnancy outcome in women with uterine rupture.

Study Design

We conducted a population-based study, comparing all singleton deliveries with and without uterine rupture between 1988 and 1999.

Results

Uterus rupture occurred in 0.035% (n = 42) of all deliveries included in the study (n = 117,685). Independent risk factors for uterine rupture in a multivariable analysis were as follows: previous cesarean section (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0, 95% CI 3.2–11.4), malpresentation (OR = 5.4, 95% CI 2.7–10.5), and dystocia during the second stage of labor (OR = 13.7, 95% CI 6.4–29.3). Women with uterine rupture had more episodes of postpartum hemorrhage (50.0% vs 0.4%, P < .01), received more packed cell transfusions (54.8% vs 1.5%, P < .01), and required more hysterectomies (26.2% vs 0.04%, P < .01). Newborn infants delivered after uterine rupture were more frequently graded Apgar scores lower than 5 at 5 minutes and had higher rates of perinatal mortality when compared with those without rupture (10.3% vs 0.3%, P < .01; 19.0% vs 1.4%, P < .01, respectively).

Conclusion

Uterine rupture, associated with previous cesarean section, malpresentation, and second-stage dystocia, is a major risk factor for maternal morbidity and neonatal mortality. Thus, a repeated cesarean delivery should be considered among parturients with a previous uterine scar, whose labor failed to progress.

### Pregnancy outcomes and associated factors for uterine rupture: an 8 years population-based retrospective study [^112tc2rp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study showed that the key risk factor of UR was the presence of scar, and previous cesarean section is the most important cause of uterine scarring. Therefore, to reduce UR rate, we need to strictly control the indication of cesarean section so as to reduce the rate of cesarean section. Globally, cesarean delivery rates have been steadily increasing over the past 20 to 30 years. A major contributor to this has been elective repeat cesarean sections. Approximately one-third to half of the elective cesareans are performed because of a history of cesarean delivery. Routine elective repeat cesarean section for all women with a prior cesarean section is not universally advocated, desired, or without risk. Furthermore, multiple cesarean sections also carry the increased risks of placenta previa and placenta accrete with future pregnancies. Such a policy would result in significant financial cost. On the other hand, VBAC is able to resolve such problems. As another mode of birth after caesarean section, VBAC is associated with fewer complications, such as shorter maternal hospitalization, less blood loss, and a decreased incidence of puerperal infections and thrombotic events. TOLAC is a safe option for most people and 75% women may be successful. In recent years, VBAC has been supported as a way to decrease related complications and slow the increase in cesarean births to some extents. For instance, in Norway, all mothers with a previous caesarean section are offered a chance of TOLAC unless there is an absolute contra-indication. As a result, the TOLAC rate is as high as 51, and 80% succeed in that country. While VBAC is being advocated by more and more countries, the VBAC rate in China was only 9.6% in 2016, compared to 12.4% in the United States in the same year. While TOLAC is an accepted practice in hospitals with advanced medical equipment and obstetric skills, it still can be controversial. A successful VBAC is associated with fewer complications compared with elective repeat cesarean delivery, whereas a failed TOLAC is associated with more complications. TOLAC has gone through three stages in the U.S. Stage one, the VBAC rate had increased from 5% in 1985 to 28.3% by 1996 as recommendations favored TOLAC; Stage two, the VBAC rate had decreased to 8.5% by 2006 as the number of UR and other complications related to TOLAC increased. During that time, some hospitals stopped offering TOLAC altogether; Stage three, VBACs had been on the rise again since 2016 and increased to 13.3% by 2018, when a balance between TOLAC and safety was reached. The U.S. experience is worth learning and most part of China is currently going through the stage two, so we can see the reversal of the VBAC. Therefore, promoting TOLAC in China and ensuring safety is needed. In our study, we were expecting UR rates to become higher as more people attempted a TOLAC. However, this was not the case observed from this study and ruptures occurring after TOLAC did not become more serious. The ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommended TOLAC depending on the hospital's resources and availability of obstetric, pediatric, anesthesiology, and operating room staffs. Our hospital is one of the three hospitals with the largest number of births in China, and Shanghai is among the top medical treatment areas in China, which is close to developed countries. Therefore, we have rich enough medical experience to reduce the occurrence of UR and ensure the maternal and perinatal safety. Our study provides evidence that under the condition of strict control and indication, TOLAC is safe and reliable and worth carrying out. With the implementation of birth encouragement policy in China, an increasing amount of second-child pregnant women are choosing to attempt a TOLAC. As a result, the rate of cesarean section and the consequent risks of UR will decline as a whole, and the national medical burden and financial expenditure can be reduced.

### Analysis of the uterine rupture during pregnancy and delivery in a provincial maternal and children care hospital in China: 2013–2022 [^111zNLgo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine Rupture (UR), a complete or partial rupture of the uterine body or lower segment of the uterus during pregnancy or delivery, is a potentially life-threatening condition for both mother and fetus. The primary risk factor for uterine rupture is uterine scar in a previous cesarean delivery. In addition to caesarean section scar, Other associated risk factors include uterine surgery, placenta accreta, induction of labor(IOL), congenital uterine anomaly, short interval between deliveries.

A multicenter study of 13 provinces in China showed that the incidence of uterine rupture was 0.03%. Although this incidence rate is low, uterine rupture is highly likely to lead to serious adverse outcomes. Since the full liberalization of the two-child policy in 2016 and the opening of the three-child policy in 2021, the cesarean section rate in China has increased from 43.36% (2017) to 45.00% (2022). Concurrently, the proportion of women in China with prior childbirth experience has risen to 53.27% (2022). At the same time, the estimated incidence of related pregnancy complications, particularly uterine rupture, is increasing annually.

Previous studies had concentrated more on late-pregnancy uterine rupture in women with prior cesarean sections, while research on mid-trimester uterine rupture was few. Uterine rupture in the second trimester of pregnancy is extremely rare. The literature on uterine rupture during mid-trimester is indeed limited, primarily consisting of case reports and small case series. This makes it challenging to draw broad conclusions about the risk factors, presentation, and outcomes associated with this complication. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze the prevalence, clinical characteristics and maternal and neonatal complications of mid-trimester and late-pregnancy uterine rupture and provide practical experience for the early recognition, management and emergency treatment of uterine rupture.

History of uterine surgery

All surgical interventions causing damage to the uterine muscular layer during gynecological procedures are considered high-risk factors for uterine rupture during pregnancy. These include myomectomy, interstitial resection of the fallopian tubes, resection of the uterine cornua, hysteroscopic electrotomy, electroablation, dilation and curettage. One source of uterine scarring is caesarean section (CS), with rates increasing worldwide. In 2022, China experienced a cesarean section rate of 45%. A history of previous cesarean section is an important cause contributing to the risk of uterine rupture [, and]. A cesarean section leaves behind a surgical scar on the uterus. The healing process can result in the formation of fibrous scar tissue, which is less elastic and more prone to rupture compared to healthy uterine tissue. The rate of uterine rupture is approximately 1% for women with one previous cesarean delivery versus 3.9% for those with greater than one previous cesarean delivery. In our study, 95 had a history of prior cesarean section, accounting for 73.64% of the cases, of which 38 had a history of two or more CS. Current research shows that intervals shorter than 12 to 18 months are a high-risk factor for uterine rupture, while the optimal window for healing of a cesarean section scar is between 2 and 3 years post-surgery. After a period exceeding five years, the degree of muscularization in the uterine scar will gradually deteriorate and it will lose elasticity, increasing the risk of uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancies. In this study, the median interval from last CS was 5 years, ranging from 1 to 14 years. The incidence of uterine rupture in our study was 0.12% in those with a history of cesarean section. Our study showed that the surgical operation of D&C is also a main risk factor of uterine rupture. Previous study has reported that D&C can lead to damage of the endometrium, the uterine muscular wall or even result in uterine perforation, which can contribute to weakening the uterine wall. Then fragile tissue can lead to rupture at the weak points of the uterus due to excessive distension during late pregnancy or overly strong contractions during childbirth. The rupture of the uterus at earlier gestational weeks may be related to greater local tension on the uterine floor and body scars during pregnancy. Abortion-induced partial damage to the endometrium, pathological changes in the uterine muscle fibers, thinning of the muscular wall, Of the 129 cases, 77 (59.7%) had a history of dilation and curettage (D&C), with 15 who had severe postpartum hemorrhage and three who underwent hysterectomies. The high rate of abortion curettage also highlights the need for enhanced sex education in our country. There is insufficient awareness about proper contraception, and artificial abortions, including repeated ones, increase the risk of uterine damage and scarred uterus.

### Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review [^116QF4jM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.

### Clinical analysis of complete uterine rupture during pregnancy [^113quvUm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the First people's Hospital of Chenzhou is a critical care center wherein treatment, consultation, referral, and technical guidance are proviede to pregnant women in Southern Hunan and the city with acute and critical illnesses. This was a retrospective study aimed at exploring the clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of patients with complete uterine rupture between January 2015 and December 2022. The data (complete clinical data, medical history, and surgical records) of all patients with complete uterine rupture admitted to our hospital were retrospectively analyzed.

Diagnostic criteria

Complete uterine rupture was defined as rupture of the entire wall of the uterine myometrium, with the uterine cavity communicating with the abdominal cavity during late pregnancy or labor.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was defined as bleeding of ≥ 500 mL for vaginal delivery and ≥ 1000 mL for cesarean delivery within 24 h after delivery of the fetus.

Research methods

Basic maternal information (age, pregnancies, number of deliveries), previous pregnancy and surgery-related indicators (risk factor, causes and clinical manifestations, comorbidities, distance between periconceptional caesarean section scar and vesicovaginal fold), situation at the time of uterine rupture (gestational age, interval between the current pregnancy and previous cesarean section delivery, rupture site and length, bleeding volume and number of required blood transfusions, minimum hemoglobin level), mode of the current delivery (induced delivery, transvaginal delivery, or cesarean section), and outcomes of the mother and child (postpartum hemorrhage, hysterectomy, maternal death, perinatal deaths, severe neonatal asphyxia (Apgar scores are recorded at 1, 5, and 10 min after birth, with a score below or equal to 3 indicating severe asphxia) were cllected from the patients' medical records. This study meticulously adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement guidelines.

### Predicting uterine rupture in women undergoing trial of labor after prior cesarean delivery [^114Z5hqq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Uterine rupture is the most serious complication for women undergoing trial of labor (TOL) after prior cesarean delivery. While rates of uterine rupture vary significantly according to a variety of clinically associated risk factors, the absolute risk for this complication ranges between 0.5 and 4 percent. Previous vaginal delivery and prior successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery confer the lowest risk of rupture on women attempting TOL. In contrast, multiple prior cesareans, short interpregnancy interval, single layer uterine closure, prior preterm cesarean, labor induction and augmentation have all been suggested in some studies as factors which may increase the rate of uterine rupture. While considering these risk factors is important in counseling women regarding childbirth following cesarean delivery, the infrequency of uterine rupture coupled with relatively weak associations for most risk factors has prevented the development of an accurate prediction tool for uterine rupture. Preliminary studies suggest that sonographic evaluation of the uterine scar may hold some promise for identifying women at risk.

### First-trimester uterine rupture: a case report and systematic review of the literature [^111BKxUx]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to present a case of first-trimester uterine rupture and perform a systematic review to identify common presentations, risk factors, and management strategies.

Data Sources

Searches were performed in PubMed, Ovid, and Scopus using a combination of key words related to "uterine rupture", "first trimester", and "early pregnancy" from database inception to September 30, 2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria

English language descriptions of uterine rupture at ≤ 14 weeks of gestation were included, and cases involving pregnancy termination and ectopic pregnancy were excluded.

Methods

Outcomes for the systematic review included maternal demographics, description of uterine rupture, and specifics of uterine rupture diagnosis and management. Data were extracted to custom-made reporting forms. Median values were calculated for continuous variables, and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for case reports and case series.

Results

Overall, 61 cases of first-trimester uterine rupture were identified, including our novel case. First-trimester uterine ruptures occurred at a median gestation of 11 weeks. Most patients (59/61 [97%]) had abdominal pain as a presenting symptom, and previous uterine surgery was prevalent (44/61 [62%]), usually low transverse cesarean delivery (32/61 [52%]). The diagnosis of uterine rupture was generally made after surgical exploration (37/61 [61%]), with rupture noted in the fundus in 26 of 61 cases (43%) and in the lower segment in 27 of 61 cases (44%). Primary repair of the defect was possible in 40 of 61 cases (66%), whereas hysterectomy was performed in 18 of 61 cases (30%). Continuing pregnancy was possible in 4 of 61 cases (7%).

Conclusion

Uterine rupture is an uncommon occurrence but should be considered in patients with an acute abdomen in early pregnancy, especially in women with previous uterine surgery. Surgical exploration is typically needed to confirm the diagnosis and for management. Hysterectomy is not always necessary; primary uterine repair is sufficient in more than two-thirds of the cases to achieve hemostasis. Continuing pregnancy, although uncommon, is also possible.

### Previous preterm cesarean delivery and risk of subsequent uterine rupture [^112LaKaR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine if women with a history of a previous preterm cesarean delivery experienced an increased risk of subsequent uterine rupture compared with women who had a previous nonclassic term cesarean delivery.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed in singleton gestations that had a previous nonclassic cesarean delivery from 1999 to 2002. Women with a history of a previous preterm cesarean delivery were compared with women who had a previous term cesarean delivery. Women who had both a preterm and term cesarean delivery were included in the preterm group.

Results

A prior preterm cesarean delivery was significantly associated with an increased risk of subsequent uterine rupture (0.58% compared with 0.28%, P < .001). When women who had a subsequent elective cesarean delivery were removed (remaining n = 26,454) women with a previous preterm cesarean delivery were still significantly more likely to sustain a uterine rupture (0.79% compared with 0.46%, P = .001). However, when only women who had a subsequent trial of labor were included, there was still an absolute increased risk of uterine rupture, but it was not statistically significant (1.00% compared with 0.68%, P = .081). In a multivariable analysis controlling for confounding variables (oxytocin use, two or more previous cesarean deliveries, a cesarean delivery within the past 2 years, and preterm delivery in the current pregnancy), patients with a previous preterm cesarean delivery remained at an increased risk of subsequent uterine rupture (P = .043, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.01–2.50) compared with women with previous term cesarean delivery.

Conclusion

Women who have had a previous preterm cesarean delivery are at a minimally increased risk for uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy when compared with women who have had previous term cesarean deliveries.

### Maternal and fetal outcomes of uterine rupture and factors associated with maternal death secondary to uterine rupture [^113kMmdQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture is the tearing of the uterine wall and the loss of its integrity through breaching during pregnancy, delivery or immediately after delivery. It is a catastrophic event in obstetrics, often resulting in both maternal and fetal adverse consequences. Beyond this, it may expose the women have harmful sequel such as permanently infertility secondary to hysterectomy.

Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high across many of the developing world especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia. More than 87% of maternal deaths from the global maternal mortality ratio of 210 deaths per 100, 000 live births in 2013 is accounted by Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Ethiopia is the fifth country where the highest maternal mortality occurred next to Democratic Republic of Congo. In this country, uterine rupture and obstructed labor together account for 29% of the total maternal mortality. This makes uterine rupture and obstructed labor to be the second major causes of maternal mortality next to abortion-related complications.

Even though uterine rupture is a rare event in developed countries, it is still one of the major public health problem in developing countries that endanger the life of many mothers. WHO systematic review of maternal mortality and morbidity secondary to uterine rupture showed that the prevalence of uterine rupture tends to be lower in developed countries than developing countries with a prevalence rate of 0.006%. Uterine rupture in developed countries mostly occurs secondary to prior cesarean section.

Globally, the incidence of uterine rupture is 0.07% which is much lower than what is in Africa - 1.3%. The main reasons for the occurrence of uterine rupture in developed countries are the use of uterotonics and trial of labor on a scarred uterus.

However, the major causes of uterine rupture in developing countries are obstetric and non-obstetric multihued of factors such as; multi-gravidity, teen-age pregnancy, old primi, poor socio-economic status, previous cesarean section scar, unsupervised labor and unwise use of uterotonic agents. A study from Uganda reported that multi-gravidity, old age pregnancy, and rural residency as significant predictors of uterine rupture. In addition, studies from Nigeria and Uganda showed that the main reasons for the occurrence of uterine rupture were unwise use of oxytocin drug, obstructed labor, grand multi-parity and abnormal fetal presentation.

### Prior cesarean birth and risk of uterine rupture in second-trimester medication abortions using mifepristone and misoprostol: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KohbG]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the risk difference of uterine rupture when using current mifepristone and misoprostol regimens for second-trimester abortion among individuals with prior cesarean birth compared with those without prior cesarean birth.

Data Sources

We searched the terms second trimester, induction, mifepristone, and abortion in PubMed, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library from inception until December 2022.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included randomized trials and observational studies including a mixed cohort, with and without uterine scar, of individuals at 14–28 weeks of gestation who used mifepristone and misoprostol to end a pregnancy or to manage a fetal death. We excluded case reports, narrative reviews, and studies not published in English. Two reviewers independently screened studies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Absolute risks with binomial CIs were calculated from pooled data. Using R software, we estimated total risk difference by the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method without continuity correction. For studies with zero events, a continuity correction of 0.5 was applied for individual risk differences and plotted graphically with forest plots. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with Higgins I2 statistics. Funnel plot assessed for publication bias. Of 198 articles identified, 22 met the inclusion criteria: seven randomized trials (n = 923) and 15 observational studies (n = 6,195). Uterine rupture risk with prior cesarean birth was 1.1% (10/874) (95% CI 0.6–2.1) and without prior cesarean birth was 0.01% (2/6,244) (95% CI 0.0–0.12). The risk difference was 1.23% (95% CI 0.46–2.00, I2 = 0%). Of the 12 reported uterine ruptures, three resulted in hysterectomy.

Conclusion

Uterine rupture with mifepristone and misoprostol use during second-trimester induction abortion is rare, with the risk increased to 1% in individuals with prior cesarean birth.

### Pregnancy outcomes and associated factors for uterine rupture: an 8 years population-based retrospective study [^11659WFf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture (UR) is a full-thickness separation of the uterine wall through breaching during pregnancy, labor, or immediately after delivery. According to the world health organization, the average incidence of UR is 5.3/l0 000. UR is one of the most dangerous obstetric problems and a life-threatening emergency. It is an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal mortality ranges between 1 and 13% and neonatal mortality between 74 and 92% as a result of UR. The determinant factors for maternal and fetal outcomes of UR differ across geographical regions due to differences in socio-demographic status, the availability and accessibility of routine obstetric care, and health system effectiveness. Analyzing outcomes and factors associated with maternal and fetal complications of UR in the study area, Shanghai, is important to prevent and improve local clinical management by designing appropriate policies and strategies.

Although the occurrence of UR is relatively rare in general, it is more frequent in low-income compared to high-income countries. In high-income countries, the greatest risk factor is a scarred uterus, typically from a previous cesarean delivery. Risks of UR are also related to other factors, such as parity, obstructed labor, induction of labor, use of prostaglandins, and/or breech presentation. VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean section) is an important practice to reduce caesarean section rate. However, in China, many hospitals are reluctant to attempt a TOLAC (trial of labor after caesarean delivery) due to increased risks of severe adverse outcomes, such as UR and fetal or neonatal death. Nevertheless, reports on UR and its maternal and perinatal outcomes for such delivery are lacking in China. As to scarred uterus, previous studies on the outcomes of UR were generally concentrated on patients with previous cesarean section, while very few studied patients with other gynecological surgery history.

The aim of this study was to analyze all cases of UR in our hospital during the period 2013–2020 to assess the incidence, its linkage with previous caesarean and other gynecological surgery history, and the maternal and perinatal risk factors as well as the implications of UR.

### Risk factors for complete uterine rupture [^112886hX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Complete uterine rupture is a rare peripartum complication associated with a catastrophic outcome. Because of its rarity, knowledge about its risk factors is not very accurate. Most previous studies were small and over a limited time interval. Moreover, international diagnostic coding was used in most studies. These codes are not able to differentiate between the catastrophic complete type and less catastrophic partial type. Complete uterine rupture is expected to increase as the rate of cesarean delivery increases. Thus, we need more accurate knowledge about the risk factors for this complication.

Objective

The objective of the study was to estimate the incidence and risk factors for complete uterine rupture during childbirth in Norway.

Study Design

This population-based study included women that gave birth after starting labor in 1967–2008. Data were from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and Patient Administration System, complemented with information from medical records. We included 1,317,967 women without previous cesarean delivery and 57,859 with previous cesarean delivery. The outcome was complete uterine rupture (tearing of all uterine wall layers, including serosa and membranes). Risk factors were parameters related to demographics, pregnancy, and labor. Odds ratios for complete uterine rupture were computed with crude logistic regressions for each risk factor. Separate multivariable logistic regressions were performed to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Results

Complete uterine rupture occurred in 51 cases without previous cesarean delivery (0.38 per 10,000) and 122 with previous cesarean delivery (21.1 per 10,000). The strongest risk factor was sequential labor induction with prostaglandins and oxytocin, compared with spontaneous labor, in those without previous cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 48.0, 95% confidence interval, 20.5–112.3) and those with previous cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 16.1, 95% confidence interval, 8.6–29.9). Other significant risk factors for those without and with previous cesarean delivery, respectively, included labor augmentation with oxytocin (adjusted odds ratio, 22.5, 95% confidence interval, 10.9–41.2; adjusted odds ratio, 4.4, 95% confidence interval, 2.9–6.6), antepartum fetal death (adjusted odds ratio, 15.0, 95% confidence interval, 6.2–36.6; adjusted odds ratio, 4.0, 95% confidence interval, 1.1–14.2), and previous first-trimester miscarriages (adjusted odds ratio, 9.6, 95% confidence interval, 5.7–17.4; adjusted odds ratio, 5.00, 95% confidence interval, 3.4–7.3). After a previous cesarean delivery, the risk of rupture was increased by an interdelivery interval < 16 months (adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–5.4) and a previous cesarean delivery with severe postpartum hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–13.2).

Conclusion

Sequential labor induction with prostaglandins and oxytocin and augmentation of labor with oxytocin are important risk factors for complete uterine rupture in intact and scarred uteri.

### Analysis of the uterine rupture during pregnancy and delivery in a provincial maternal and children care hospital in China: 2013–2022 [^113YXCzL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis of the adverse maternal outcomes among patients in the second-trimester uterine rupture

The major finding of the current study was that patients with uterine rupture during mid-trimester were more likely to receive a blood transfusion (41.67%) and exhibited higher rates of bladder injury (33.33%). We highly suspect that this adverse pregnancy outcome is the result of a combination of factors, including a higher rate of uterine surgery history (100%), placental implantation (25%), and increased use of oxytocin (33.33%) and TOLAC rates (50%) in patients with mid-trimester uterine rupture.

Among the 12 pregnant women who experienced uterine rupture in the second trimester, eight had a history of cesarean section, seven had a history of dilation and curettage(six had a history of both CS and D&C), two had a history of ectopic pregnancy tubal surgery, and one had a history of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for adenomyosis. The thermal ablation procedure for adenomyosis can cause degeneration and necrosis of uterine myometrial cells, leading to structural changes in the uterine muscular layer and damage to the endometrium. Uterine surgery causes structural changes in the uterine muscular layer, leading to reduced elasticity and functional abnormalities of the uterine muscle layer. This makes it more likely for conditions such as placental accreta to develop; thereby increasing the risk of uterine rupture during pregnancy. Three patients had placenta accrta.

### The incidence, risk factors and maternal and foetal outcomes of uterine rupture during different birth policy periods: an observational study in China [^113VJgkX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture is an emergency obstetric condition in which the uterine wall is torn and the integrity of the uterus is destroyed, often causing serious maternal and perinatal complications. The incidence of uterine rupture is low. According to a systematic review by the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of uterine rupture based on community research is 0.053% and that based on medical institution research is 0.31%.

In November 2013 and October 2015, China implemented the partial two-child policy and the universal two-child policy, respectively. The numbers and proportions of older women, multiparous women and women with previous caesarean sections have been constantly increasing, which may lead to maternal and neonatal health problems. It has been reported that compared with those during the period of the one-child policy, the incidences of maternal placental accreta spectrum disorder and birth defects during the period of the universal two-child policy have increased. Uterine rupture is an obstetric disease that is closely related to maternal reproductive characteristics. The changes in these reproductive characteristics may also affect the uterine rupture incidence and maternal and neonatal outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no research report on the incidence of uterine rupture or the changes in maternal and foetal outcomes in women with uterine rupture under the different birth policies.

Previous caesarean section delivery is the most important risk factor for uterine rupture. However, whether the risk of uterine rupture increases with the increasing number of previous caesarean sections is still unclear. Moreover, according to the 2019 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines for vaginal birth after caesarean section delivery, women with two previous low-transverse caesarean deliveries are candidates for trial of labour after caesarean delivery (TOLAC), but the expert consensus on the management of vaginal birth after caesarean section delivery in China (2016) indicates that a history of two uterine operations is a contraindication for TOLAC. At the same time, the ACOG guideline and Chinese expert consensus do not mention the influence of maternal age or parity on uterine rupture, and there are also contradictions among research study results. These findings suggest that the relationship between the risk of uterine rupture and maternal age, parity, or the number of previous caesarean sections needs more research evidence.

### Evaluation of obstetricians' surgical decision making in the management of uterine rupture [^113LyCHM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture stands as a single obstetric accident that exposes the flaws and inequities of health systems and the society at large due to the degree of neglect that it entails. It is a common obstetric complication in low income countries. And affected mothers and their unborn babies suffer grievous outcomes, hence the various terms used to qualify uterine rupture in the literature. The major predisposing factors are poverty, ignorance, illiteracy, traditional practices, high parity, poor infrastructure, cephalopelvic disproportion, previous uterine scars and poor obstetric care. Poor obstetric care comprises lack of antenatal care, having unsupervised deliveries outside of health facilities, injudicious use of oxytocics to facilitate labour, and the resultant obstructed labour. All these factors abound in low income countries and make uterine rupture a commoner complication of pregnancy and labour compared to high income countries where uterine rupture very rarely complicates labour and the major risk factor is previous cesarean scar.

In Nigeria, uterine rupture is a frequent obstetric complication and reported incidence rates vary from 1 in 81 to 1 in 426 deliveries. These rates are largely similar to rates from sub-Saharan African countries like Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan, but generally higher than the rate of 1 in 445 deliveries from Tanzania. Some studies show that most cases of uterine rupture occur outside the hospital. These consist of the 59 to 85% of women suffering uterine rupture who did not register for antenatal care (unbooked) plus the proportion that registered for antenatal care (booked) but embarked on delivery outside the hospital and only return after the rupture had occurred. On the contrary, other studies show that greater than 55% of ruptures occur after the woman was admitted into a health facility, highlighting the role of third delays in uterine rupture. Uterine rupture is often associated with high maternal and perinatal mortalities with reported maternal case fatality rates of 5.9 to 21.3% and perinatal mortality rates of 75.4 to 98.6%. Maternal and perinatal morbidities are similarly high among survivors. Uterine dehiscence, uterine "windows" and occult or incomplete ruptures describe the partial separation of the uterine wall with intact overlying serosa. They are not often included as cases of uterine rupture because they seldom result in major maternal and fetal complications.

### Are the risk factors for developing type 1 and type 2 cesarean scar pregnancy different? [^114znLMr]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A significant increase in cesarean sections worldwide, in particular in China, with the highest cesarean section rate, results in an increase in the incidence of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) in China.CSP affects approximately 0.2% of women with a history of cesarean section, and is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy where the embryo fully or partially implants either in the muscle or fibrous tissue of the scar after a previous cesarean section.CSP carries a high risk of uterine rupture and life‐threatening bleeding if the pregnancy continues. Therefore, the termination of the pregnancy is clinically recommended upon confirmation of diagnosis.

Based on imaging findings and pregnancy progression, CSP is traditionally classified into 2 subtypes. Type 1 (or endogenic) CSP is defined when the embryo implantation is located on the site of the scar, and the gestational sac grows toward the uterine cavity. Type 2 (or exogenic) CSP is defined when the embryo is implanted into the scar, and the sac grows toward the abdominal cavity. An urgent need to develop screening and management recommendations to better understand the risks associated with CSP. The 2 subtypes of CSP could manifest in different complications. For example, uterine rupture occurs more often in type 2 CSP (review in Shafqat et al). Additionally, there is no universally accepted standard option for managing 2 types of CSP, and optimal management may differ between the 2 types of CSP, and that would depend on the experiences of gynecologists. However, emerging evidence suggests that subtype‐specific approaches might be necessary because the severity and risks can vary significantly between subtypes.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^116xxygT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound lexicon — cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (EP) denotes implantation of a pregnancy in a cesarean section scar or niche and is becoming more common as cesarean delivery rates rise. Because implantation at this site carries a high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, including uterine rupture and complications of placenta accreta spectrum, the term cesarean scar EP should be used in lieu of "cesarean scar pregnancy", consistent with recommendations of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine.

### Evaluation of obstetricians' surgical decision making in the management of uterine rupture [^113VZ4mt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Obstetricians' distribution in Nigeria is skewed in favour of the south as well as urban communities. And because most of the secondary health facilities lack medical doctors and associate clinicians are not employed to provide EmOC in Nigeria, rural-dwelling women and their unborn babies are starved of skilled attendance in pregnancy and childbirth. Common risk factors for uterine rupture abound in Nigeria and some like previous caesarean scars, are rising and may ultimately cause a rise in the incidence of uterine ruptures from previous caesarean scars. Uterine rupture carries very high maternal and perinatal mortalities, and the morbidities among survivors can be lifelong and devastating. Its surgical management and obstetricians' surgical preferences are scenario-dependent, influenced by patients' condition on presentation, surgeons' skills and ability to cope, and others. Obstetricians vary in their preferences for the standard surgical method, with reasons.

We recommend equitable redistribution of the obstetricians working in Nigeria to enhance the coverage of secondary hospitals, especially those secondary hospitals in or closer to rural communities. We also recommend the deployment of medical doctors trained in EmOC to provide services in the secondary hospitals, supervised by the obstetrician. And, if EmOC provision continues to remain quantitatively low, we recommend the employment of clinical assistants trained in EmOC to work under the supervision of the doctors or the obstetricians. These measures will make EmOC more readily available and accessible to the poor and illiterate rural women who are at greatest risk of uterine rupture and ultimately lead to an improvement in the outcome of their pregnancies and childbirth with an overall reduction in the prevalence of uterine rupture. In the event of uterine rupture, we recommend that the obstetricians' surgical decisions be guided by the prevailing case scenarios with the ultimate aims of averting fatalities and keeping morbidity extremely low.

### Clinical analysis of complete uterine rupture during pregnancy [^113sd9Zh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations and early diagnosis of uterine rupture

In general, most uterine ruptures progress from uterine rupture precursors, with the main clinical manifestations being abdominal pain (especially during the intervals between contractions), uterine tenderness (reported in the literature to be approximately 36.0%), fetal abnormalities, abnormal vaginal bleeding, pathological contractions, hematuria, disappearance of contractions, hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension, or shock), change of fetal position, signs of uterine rupture detected by ultrasound, and changes in abdominal contour. Some symptoms are asymptomatic; however, typical symptoms are rare (less than 10%). Currently, pregnancy relies on the co-monitoring of history, clinical presentation, signs, and ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is very difficult to rely on pregnancy management to prevent uterine rupture, which may be due to the following: the timing of uterine rupture is random, the rupture may be unrelated to the original surgical site, most patients have multiple risk factors, and the weakest part of the uterus may change with gestational age and cannot be predicted in advance. The time window for uterine rupture is difficult to control. The time may be longer in patients with thick abdominal fat and varying pain tolerance. If referral is required (long travel time), the optimal time for resuscitation is easily delayed. Abdominal pain, fetal distress, and vaginal bleeding do not allow us to initially consider uncommon uterine ruptures. Clinicians have limitations in considering abdominal pain, which is prone to misdiagnosis as other acute abdominal conditions or labor precursors. Furthermore, multiple pregnancies, literacy levels, and family economic status may lead to irregularities during obstetrical tests. Uterine rupture most often occurs suddenly most ofter, with immediate surgery performed upon diagnosis, failure to achieve continuous fetal heart monitoring, or fetal death at the time of presentation. Other conditions that do not directly lead to uterine rupture but can interfere with early recognition, such as mental retardation, history of frequent coitus, history of abdominal trauma, unawareness of the condition by family members (inability to provide an accurate history when the patient is in shock), use of ritodrine (rapid heart rate) and vomiting during pregnancy, can mask the early signs of shock. Color ultrasonography and MRI can be affected by the level of the examiner, thickness of abdominal fat in the pregnant woman, measurement site, number of measurements, bladder filling, rupture site (posterior wall rupture is difficult to diagnose), fetal movement, dynamic monitoring or not, and clarity of the ultrasound machine. In addition, the presence of unknown previous surgery (inverted T-shaped incision, uterine monolayer suture, weak local myometrium, infection, poor healing of incision, cause of postpartum hemorrhage, and method used to stop bleeding), diverticulum of the uterine incision (occurs in approximately 60% of patients after a primary cesarean section and 100% after three cesarean Sects.), any perforation during uterine manipulation, artificial placental removal during previous delivery, and subsequent follow-ups can affect the diagnosis of uterine rupture. In particular, the healing of the original cesarean section scar is unknown; a study showed that the use of synthetic absorbable monofilament sutures for uterine closure was associated with increased residual myometrial thickness, with respect to synthetic absorbable multifilament sutures. A uterine segment thickness after cesarean section below 2.0 mm between 35 and 38 gestational weeks has been repetitively associated with a greater risk of uterine rupture or scar dehiscence. Furthermore, when the breach is small and there are no blood vessels at the breach, there may be no obvious symptoms or imaging changes. Atypical symptoms, difficult diagnosis of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and unsupportive ancillary tests plague surgical decision-making. There is limited data on some factors that may affect the healing of the uterine incision (previous history of postpartum hemorrhage, gestational diabetes mellitus or diabeties as a comorbidity, embryo transplantation, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and hypoproteinemia), and factors that may provide local protection, such as the severity of the pelvic-abdominal adhesions (three patients in this study had little hematochezia or peritoneal hemorrhage). Therefore, the education of pregnant women and their families, as well as the rapid recognition of uterine rupture after it occurs, are key to early diagnosis.

### Two uterine scars and a vaginal birth [^116vu5d3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Uterine scarring increases the risk of uterine rupture during labour, which can result in significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. There is insufficient evidence for a clear recommendation on the safety of vaginal delivery in the context of a patient with both a uterine perforation and a previous lower uterine segment caesarean section. We present the case of a woman with a history of one previous caesarean section and uterine perforation with a uterine manipulator, who subsequently had an uncomplicated normal vaginal delivery.

### Cesarean hysterectomy and uterine-preserving alternatives [^1169vMab]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hysterectomy at the time of an obstetric delivery or postpartum is an uncommon time to perform one of the most common gynecologic procedures. Hysterectomy associated with pregnancy is often unplanned and undesired. Postpartum complications associated with the need for hysterectomy carry significant risks, which pose challenges for mother-infant bonding and can signify an unexpected end to fertility. The most common indication for hysterectomy is postpartum hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage is caused by uterine atony, genital tract laceration, uterine rupture, invasive placentation, infection, or coagulopathy. Multidisciplinary teams improve outcomes and are capable of managing complex medical and surgical complications that occur postpartum.

### Pregnancy complications and risk of uterine rupture among women with singleton pregnancies in China [^1132jbgW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The occurrence of UR may be directly or indirectly caused by a weak myometrium and excessive expansion of the uterine cavity. In our study, we found that placenta percreta was associated with an increased risk of UR in women. The possible reason for this might be the thinning of the uterus after multiple induced abortions, and the placental villi invade the myometrium at the site of placental implantation (particularly at a previous scar site), resulting in UR. In addition, we found that the risk of UR was slightly higher in women with gestational diabetes mellitus who had an LGA foetus (especially at 34–36 weeks gestational age). we hypothesize that excess foetal growth leads to excessive expansion of the uterine cavity during late pregnancy among diabetic women, resulting in UR.

UR often occurs before or during labour without warning. The risk of UR can increase in the presence of predisposing factors. Clinicians may tend to focus on women with a history of caesarean delivery, ignoring those without such a history but with complications during pregnancy. Current guidelines developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) place a strong emphasis on the impact of vaginal trial delivery after caesarean section on UR. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of guidelines for pregnant women with pregnancy complications to prevent the occurrence of UR. For example, current guidelines developed by the ACOG only recommend that women with gestational diabetes mellitus should be counselled regarding the risks and benefits of a scheduled caesarean delivery when the estimated foetal weight is 4,500 g or more. Our findings suggest that controlling weight throughout pregnancy for women with gestational diabetes mellitus may play an important role in preventing the occurrence of UR. Our findings also support the recommendation that women with uncomplicated placenta previa should have a planned delivery at 36–37 weeks of gestation to avoid haemorrhage. Moreover, evidence has shown that an accurate prenatal diagnosis and a standardized multidisciplinary team approach improve the pregnancy outcomes of women with placenta percreta. Thus, standardized protocols for prenatal diagnosis and management of pregnancy complications may help to reduce the occurrence of UR.

### Misoprostol [^113kAVtS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

MISOPROSTOL ADMINISTRATION TO WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT CAN CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS, ABORTION, PREMATURE BIRTH OR UTERINE RUPTURE.

UTERINE RUPTURE HAS BEEN REPORTED WHEN MISOPROSTOL WAS ADMINISTERED IN PREGNANT WOMEN TO INDUCE LABOR OR TO INDUCE ABORTION. THE RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE INCREASES WITH ADVANCING GESTATIONAL AGES AND WITH PRIOR UTERINE SURGERY, INCLUDING CESAREAN DELIVERY (See also PRECAUTIONS and LABOR AND DELIVERY).

MISOPROSTOL SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN BY PREGNANT WOMEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ULCERS INDUCED BY NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) (See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).

PATIENTS MUST BE ADVISED OF THE ABORTIFACIENT PROPERTY AND WARNED NOT TO GIVE THE DRUG TO OTHERS.

Misoprostol should not be used for reducing the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers in women of childbearing potential unless the patient is at high risk of complications from gastric ulcers associated with use of the NSAID, or is at high risk of developing gastric ulceration. In such patients, misoprostol may be prescribed if the patient

has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy.
is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.
has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake.
will begin misoprostol only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period.

### Preterm premature rupture of the membranes: current approaches to evaluation and management [^113pSQmv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) complicates 3% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately one third of all preterm births. Because preterm PROM presents a clinical situation where early delivery is to be anticipated and prenatal and neonatal complications are common, the physician caring for women with this common obstetric complication has an opportunity to intervene in a manner that can improve perinatal outcome. This article addresses clinically relevant questions regarding the evaluation and management of preterm PROM.

### Inter-pregnancy interval and uterine rupture during a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^112w3vm3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Population

The population consisted of all reported livebirths in the United States from 2011 to 2021 for women recorded as having one previous livebirth by caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births using the 2003 revision of the U.S. Certificate of Live Birth. Due to the available data fields, it was not possible to exclude rare cases where there could have been both a stillbirth and livebirth in the past, one of which was a vaginal birth.

The inclusion criteria were vaginal birth or birth by caesarean delivery with a trial of labour attempted from 17 weeks gestational age onwards. These criteria represented women undergoing a TOLAC. Parturients with spontaneous, augmented and induced labours were included to facilitate counselling around the risks of these types of labour. Exclusion criteria were triplets or higher birth order, and congenital abnormalities in the infant. There were post-hoc decisions to exclude twins as there were only two uterine ruptures in this group, and to exclude gestational ages greater than 43 or greater than the interdelivery interval, as these were more likely to result from data entry errors or are of reduced relevance to typical clinical circumstances. Additionally, a post-hoc decision was made, to conduct a complete case sensitivity analysis, for all livebirths and stillbirths compared with livebirths only for the years 2014–2021. This decision was prompted by the unavailability of uterine rupture data for stillbirths before 2014. For the combined outcome of fetal death (stillbirth) or neonatal death within 28 days of birth, data from stillbirths and period linked data were utilised, spanning 2014 to 2019.

Thus, we used three datasets:
(1) All livebirths from 2011 to 2021 for the main analysis.
(2) All livebirths and stillbirths (2014–2021) were compared with livebirths only (2014–2021) in a sensitivity analysis.
(3) For the combined outcome of fetal death (stillbirth) and neonatal death within 28 days of birth, analysis was restricted to 2014 to 2019.

Outcomes

The pre-specified primary outcome was tabulated predictions for uterine rupture risk in typical parturients according to number of months of IPI, and whether labour onset was spontaneous. Risk of secondary adverse outcomes were also assessed among the rupture group.

### The incidence, risk factors and maternal and foetal outcomes of uterine rupture during different birth policy periods: an observational study in China [^113Rbs46]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, there are no studies on changes in the incidence of uterine rupture or maternal and foetal outcomes in women with uterine rupture during different birth policy periods in China. Moreover, the results of association studies of maternal age, parity and previous caesarean section number with the risk of maternal and foetal outcomes in women with uterine rupture have not been consistent. This research aims to conduct and discuss the above two aspects.

Methods

We included singleton pregnant women with no maternal complications other than uterine rupture from January 2012 to June 2019 in China's National Maternal Near Miss Surveillance System. The data in this study did not differentiate between complete and partial uterine rupture and uterine dehiscence. Through Poisson regression analysis with a robust variance estimator, we compared the incidences of uterine rupture and maternal and foetal outcomes in women with uterine rupture during different birth policy periods in China and determined the relationship between maternal age, parity or previous caesarean section number and uterine rupture or maternal and foetal outcomes in women with uterine rupture.

Results

This study included 8,637,723 pregnant women. The total incidences of uterine rupture were 0.13% (12,934) overall, 0.05% during the one-child policy, 0.12% during the partial two-child policy (aRR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.53–2.52) and 0.22% (aRR = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.94 4.29) during the universal two-child policy. The maternal near miss and stillbirth rates in women with uterine rupture were respectively 2.35% (aRR = 17.90; 95% CI: 11.81–27.13) and 2.12% (aRR = 4.10; 95% CI: 3.19 5.26) overall, 5.46 and 8.18% during the first policy, 1.72% (aRR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.32–1.17) and 2.02% (aRR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37–0.83) during the second policy, and 1.99% (aRR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.52–1.53) and 1.04% (aRR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.24–0.54) during the third policy. The risk of uterine rupture increased with parity and previous caesarean section number.

Conclusion

The uterine rupture rate in China continues to increase among different birth policy periods, and the risk of maternal near miss among women with uterine rupture has not significantly improved. The Chinese government, obstetricians, and scholars should work together to reverse the rising rate of uterine rupture and improve the pregnancy outcomes in women with uterine rupture.

### Practice bulletin no. 172: premature rupture of membranes [^117Y3hxH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Preterm delivery occurs in approximately 12% of all births in the United States and is a major factor that contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) complicates approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the United States (3). The optimal approach to clinical assessment and treatment of women with term and preterm PROM remains controversial. Management hinges on knowledge of gestational age and evaluation of the relative risks of delivery versus the risks of expectant management (eg, infection, abruptio placentae, and umbilical cord accident). The purpose of this document is to review the current understanding of this condition and to provide management guidelines that have been validated by appropriately conducted outcome-based research when available. Additional guidelines on the basis of consensus and expert opinion also are presented.

### Optimal timing and mode of delivery after cesarean with previous classical incision or myomectomy: a review of the data [^113H5K6p]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Uterine rupture is an obstetrical emergency that can be catastrophic for the mother and fetus. Previous uterine surgery, including previous cesarean delivery or myomectomy, is an established risk factor, although the exact magnitude of the associated risk remains uncertain. We reviewed the literature related to uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery with classical incision or myomectomy in an attempt to quantify outcomes associated with various management strategies. Although cesarean delivery with a classical incision is relatively uncommon (representing 0.3%-0.4% of deliveries), it presents a significant risk of rupture in subsequent pregnancies (1%-12% on the basis of published reports). Available data suggest that scheduled cesarean at 36–37 weeks optimizes both maternal and fetal outcomes in these cases. Patients with previous myomectomy are more frequently encountered in the obstetrical population. The risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies in these women is substantially lower than those with a history of previous classical incision (0.5%-0.7% on the basis of published reports). Although less common, given the potentially devastating consequences of uterine rupture, scheduled delivery at 38 weeks is suggested in those women requiring cesarean delivery. Despite the lack of well-controlled studies, preferred management strategies can be gleaned from previously published data to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes in women with these risk factors.

### Rupture of an unscarred uterus in a quadruplet pregnancy [^112BZ5U5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture of an unscarred uterus is a rare complication in a quadruplet pregnancy.

Case

A 30-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 0030, with a quadruplet pregnancy and no previous uterine surgeries presented with moderate vaginal bleeding at 32 4/7 weeks of gestation. Fetal testing was reassuring, and the cervix showed no signs of preterm labor. A decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery because of the amount of vaginal bleeding, with surgical findings of uterine rupture superior to the lower uterine segment.

Conclusion

High-order gestations may be an independent risk factor for uterine rupture.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^114gh5RE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — maternal health considerations and cesarean risks: Preterm birth is frequently associated with fetal malpresentation, making the choice of cesarean delivery a common issue; earlier cesarean delivery is associated with a higher likelihood of a vertical uterine incision (classical hysterotomy), which has more frequent perioperative morbidities than low transverse cesarean delivery and leads to recommendations for repeat cesarean delivery, and periviable cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy; beyond procedure-related risks, maternal morbidity and mortality may also arise from decisions not to intervene, such as expectant management after preterm premature rupture of membranes causing maternal infection or severe preeclampsia progressing to hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, underscoring the need to weigh risks in the context of parents' goals of care, potential for newborn survival with immediate delivery, likelihood of latency to improve newborn outcomes, and the possibility of severe adverse maternal outcomes with attempted pregnancy prolongation.

### Spontaneous uterine rupture and surgical repair at 21 weeks gestation with progression to live birth: a case report [^112riDo8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture in the non-laboring uterus is a rare occurrence, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality for the mother and fetus. Management of this presentation is complex at pre-viable gestations.

Case Presentation

A 35 year old primigravid woman with multiple previous myomectomies presented with spontaneous complete thickness uterine rupture at 21 weeks gestation. A 10 cm myometrial defect and iatrogenic amniotomy were surgically corrected with fetal preservation. This led to pregnancy continuation to 32 weeks gestation when elective cesarean delivery resulted in excellent neonatal outcome.

Conclusions

Early surgical diagnosis, multidisciplinary team approach, iatrogenic amniotomy and continuous two-layer myometrial closure were factors that contributed to pregnancy prolongation in this large myometrial rupture.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 80: premature rupture of membranes. clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists [^11442ZHD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Preterm delivery occurs in approximately 12% of all births in the United States and is a major factor contributing to perinatal morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Despite extensive research in this area, the rate of preterm birth has increased by 38% since 1981 (3). Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is a complication in approximately one third of preterm births. It typically is associated with brief latency between membrane rupture and delivery, increased potential for perinatal infection, and in utero umbilical cord compression. Because of this, both PROM at and before term can lead to significant perinatal morbidity and mortality. There is some controversy over the optimal approaches to clinical assessment and treatment of women with term and preterm PROM. Management hinges on knowledge of gestational age and evaluation of the relative risks of preterm birth versus intrauterine infection, abruptio placentae, and cord accident that could occur with expectant management. The purpose of this document is to review the current understanding of this condition and to provide management guidelines that have been validated by appropriately conducted outcome-based research. Additional guidelines on the basis of consensus and expert opinion also are presented.

### Induction of labor in women with a scarred uterus: does grand multiparity affect the risk of uterine rupture? [^115o1TU6]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous cesarean delivery is the most important risk factor for subsequent uterine rupture. Data are inconsistent regarding grand multiparity (≥ 6th delivery) and a risk for uterine rupture. Specifically, no data exist regarding the risk that is associated with labor induction or augmentation in grand multiparous women after cesarean delivery.

Objective

This study aimed to examine whether grand multiparity elevates the risk for uterine rupture in trials of labor after 1 previous cesarean that involved induction or augmentation of labor.

Study Design

A retrospective multicenter study was conducted that included all trials of labor after cesarean delivery at 24–42 gestational weeks with vertex presentation between the years 2003–2015. The study groups were defined in the following manner: (1) grand multiparous parturients (current delivery ≥ 6) who underwent labor induction or augmentation; (2) multiparous parturients (delivery 2–5) who underwent induction or augmentation; (3) grand multiparous parturients with no induction or augmentation of labor. The primary outcome was uterine rupture rate, which was defined as complete separation of all uterine layers. Secondary outcomes were obstetric and neonatal complications.

Results

A total of 12,679 labors were included in the study. The study group included 1304 labors of grand multiparous parturients after 1 previous cesarean delivery, of which 800 parturients underwent induction of labor and 504 parturients received labor augmentation. The multiparous group included 3681 parturients with either labor induction or augmentation. The third group included 7694 grand multiparous parturients without induction or augmentation. Incidence of uterine rupture was similar among the 3 study groups (0.3%, 0.3%, and 0.2%, respectively; p = 0.847). In the multivariable model that was adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, birthweight, and prolonged second stage of labor, no association was found between grand multiparity and uterine rupture in women with a scarred uterus who underwent labor induction or augmentation.

Conclusion

Labor induction/augmentation during trial of labor after cesarean delivery in grand multiparous parturients appears to be a reasonable option that has a similar uterine rupture risk as in multiparous parturients. Avoiding a mandatory cesarean delivery enables reduction of the risk for future multiple cesarean deliveries.

### Inter-pregnancy interval and uterine rupture during a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^1133nDjc]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Short interpregnancy interval (IPI) following caesarean delivery is associated with uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies. However, the interval required to minimise this risk is unknown. We investigated how the interval between pregnancies and induction or augmentation of labour affect the likelihood of uterine rupture among parturients with one previous livebirth by caesarean delivery who had a subsequent trial of labour.

Methods

In this population-based cohort study, we used data from U.S National Vital Statistics System from 2011 to 2021. Multiple pregnancies and births of infants with congenital abnormalities were excluded. A linear spline logistic regression with one knot was used to assess the relationship between uterine rupture and interpregnancy interval for spontaneous and for induced/augmented labours. Multivariable logistic regression was performed with multiple imputation and stepwise backward elimination to adjust for maternal demographic and clinical factors including maternal age, height, and BMI and gestational age. The predicted risk of uterine rupture was tabulated for interpregnancy intervals between zero and 21 months. Adverse outcomes were compared between labours with and without uterine rupture.

Findings

We examined 491,998 trials of labour among parturients with one previous livebirth by caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births. The odds ratio (OR) of uterine rupture per three months interpregnancy interval was 0.91 (95% CI 0.88–0.94) between zero and 21 months after adjusting for confounders, with no further change in risk detected beyond 21 months. The OR was 2.51 (95% CI 2.27–2.78) for induced or augmented labours compared with spontaneous labours. Other factors associated with uterine rupture included older maternal age, shorter maternal height, more advanced gestational age (from 35 to 43 weeks), and heavier birthweight. Predicted rates of uterine rupture ranged from 0.36% at zero to 0.19% at 21 months' interpregnancy interval for spontaneous labours and from 0.91% to 0.47% for induced/augmented labours for parturients with a typical clinical and demographic background. When uterine rupture occurred, the rates of unplanned hysterectomy, intrapartum or neonatal death, and neonatal seizures were 4.0% (95% CI 3.2–5.1%), 3.7% (95% CI 2.7–5.1%), and 2.6% (95% CI 1.8–3.3%) respectively.

Interpretation

The risk of uterine rupture progressively decreases as IPI increases until about 21 months and then stabilises. Counselling should advise that for women choosing between a planned TOLAC or a planned caesarean delivery after one previous caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births waiting until 21 months or longer after a prior low transverse caesarean delivery might minimise the risk of uterine rupture. The absolute risk of certain serious maternal and fetal/neonatal complications such as unplanned hysterectomy and perinatal death is low.

### Practice bulletin no. 160: premature rupture of membranes [^111jDYLk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Preterm delivery occurs in approximately 12% of all births in the United States and is a major factor that contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) complicates approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the United States. The optimal approach to clinical assessment and treatment of women with term and preterm PROM remains controversial. Management hinges on knowledge of gestational age and evaluation of the relative risks of delivery versus the risks of expectant management (eg, infection, abruptio placentae, and umbilical cord accident). The purpose of this document is to review the current understanding of this condition and to provide management guidelines that have been validated by appropriately conducted outcome-based research when available. Additional guidelines on the basis of consensus and expert opinion also are presented.

### Pregnancy complications and risk of uterine rupture among women with singleton pregnancies in China [^116TRDx4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design and setting

We obtained data from China's NMNMSS between 2012 and 2018. The system covers 438 hospitals in 326 districts or counties throughout 30 provinces, each of which manages more than 1,000 deliveries annually. Data collected included sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric history, pregnancy complications, and pregnancy outcomes of all pregnant or postpartum women in a hospital. Doctors in each hospital were trained to collect data prospectively from admission to discharge. Quality assurance was ensured by staff from county-level, municipal-level and provincial-level maternal and child health hospitals 1–2 times a year. At the same time, the National Office for Maternal and Child Health Surveillance verified the quality of the records by selecting 6–8 hospitals randomly in each province once a year.

Study population

We restricted the analysis to pregnant women with singleton births who delivered at or after 28 complete weeks of gestation. Women with multiple pregnancies were not included because they are prone to pregnancy complications and UR. Women lacking information on delivery method, history of caesarean section, or gravidity were excluded. We also excluded women with an unlikely combination of gravidity and parity. This left a total of 9,454,239 women for the study.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in pregnancy-clinical phenotypes and diagnostic scores [^112d5d4P]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

During a women's life cycle, pregnancy is a period in which she is at risk for hemorrhagic events and obstetrical syndromes that may develop into disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This life-threatening condition is a complication of obstetrical and non-obstetrical causes including: (1) acute peripartum hemorrhage (uterine atony, cervical and vaginal lacerations, and uterine rupture); (2) placental abruption; (3) Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome; (4) retained stillbirth; (5) sepsis; (6) amniotic fluid embolism; and (7) acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Acute obstetrical hemorrhage is one of the leading causes for DIC in pregnancy and is one of the most avoidable etiologies of maternal death. In order to develop a common language among physicians a novel pregnancy specific DIC scoring system was developed and point of care testing is currently being validated for utilization in pregnant women. The current review will present the underlying mechanisms, diagnostic scores and, in brief, a therapeutic approach for DIC in pregnancy.

### Pregnancy after advanced ovarian cancer with spontaneous uterine rupture in second trimester: a case report and review of the literature [^115g6V7P]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding systemic treatment, the administered platinum/taxane‐based chemotherapy does not appear to have had an impact on pregnancy outcomes in previous publications. On the other hand, bevacizumab, which is an angiogenesis inhibitor, can cause gastrointestinal ruptures due to change in vascular integrity, and diaphragmatic and non‐pregnant uterine ruptures during treatment with bevacizumab have been reported. Moreover, there are publications describing the effect of bevacizumab on the reduction of smooth muscle, crucial for its use in the treatment of benign metastatic leiomyomatosis. Therefore, the bevacizumab could be considered as a relevant factor in our case. Nevertheless, the described ruptures occurred during or shortly after ongoing therapy with bevacizumab. In contrast, the uterine rupture in our case did not occur until 17 months after the last bevacizumab administration.

The third possible contributing factor is the twin pregnancy. Only two case reports of uterine rupture in twin pregnancies without the presence of classic risk factors were identified which occurred in the 11th and 30th week of pregnancy. The adenomyosis, which the patients in both cases had, and the overstretching of the uterus due to the twin pregnancy, were considered as crucial factors in these cases. In our case adenomyosis was absent, but rapid extension of the uterus due to twin pregnancy could have been a contributing factor to the rupture.

Ultimately, a clear explanation of our case of uterine rupture in the 18th week of pregnancy is still missing. A combination of the resection of the uterine serosa during the therapeutic operation for ovarian cancer resulting in microlesions of the uterus, which were impaired in healing under therapy with bevacizumab, and the uterine overstretching due to the twin pregnancy could be considered as a multifactorial explanation of the case presented here.

When considering risk of fertility sparing surgery in AOC, the obstetrical complications are relevant, but the oncologic outcome, with the increased risk of recurrence is dominant because it determines the overall survival. Therefore, the current guidelines suggest the possibility of fertility preserving surgery only in early ovarian cancer up to stage IC. There are no recommendations regarding fertility sparing surgery in AOC or optimal timing of pregnancy after AOC.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for premature rupture of membranes, more specifically with respect to epidemiology, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that the reported recurrence risk of PPROM in future pregnancies is 10–32%, but the most common complication in future pregnancies is preterm birth (34–46%).

### An unusual cause for epigastric pain in pregnancy. spontaneous uterine rupture with herniation of the amniotic sac in a 33-week primigravida [^111Nmsns]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old in vitro fertilisation patient presented at 33 weeks of gestation with abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a cystic lesion adjacent to the fundus. During caesarean section, a defect at the fundus was identified with herniation of the amniotic sac through this defect. There were no complications postoperatively and the patient made an unremarkable recovery. With at least one maternal death reported in the most recent confidential enquiry into maternal death, uterine rupture is an obstetric emergency and can have catastrophic outcomes. The incidence of uterine rupture as a result of previous perforation is unclear with little published data and few case reports. Cases of uterine rupture after perforation following hysteroscopic resection of fibroids, uterine septum are well published but the authors found no known previous cases related to laparoscopy. Counselling patients post perforation should include discussion regarding the management of future pregnancies and the risk of uterine rupture.

### Pregnancy outcomes and associated factors for uterine rupture: an 8 years population-based retrospective study [^113W1gEN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

UR in pregnancy is rare, but when it occurs the consequences can be life-threatening to both the mother and the fetus. The occurrence of UR varies in different parts of the world. Globally, the incidence of UR is 0.07% with the tendency of being lower in the developed countries than the developing countries. The rate of UR in our study was 0.0196%, consistent with the rate observed in the developed countries as Shanghai is among the most economically developed regions in China, which is close to developed countries. There were no cases of maternal death due to UR in our study.

There has been a wide variation in the aetiology UR over years, where the increase rate of TOLAC and the use of uterotonics have created the two most common predisposing factors in the developed countries. However, the major causes of UR in the developing countries are both obstetric and non-obstetric multitude of factors: multi-gravidity, teen-age pregnancy, old primi, poor socio-economic status, previous cesarean section scar, unsupervised labor, and unwise use of uterotonic agents.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^111RxSVc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines comparison from the US (2010 version), Canada (2005 version) and United Kingdom (2007 version) show similarities and differences in recommendations for VBAC process. Uterine rupture is identified as the most serious complication among women attempting a trial of labor; however, there is recognition that differences in the definition may contribute to the reported incidence rates. With regards to induction of labor, all three guidelines agree that induction and augmentation of labor is an option for women attempting a VBAC, but there is an increased risk of uterine rupture with inappropriate use of oxytocin. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SOGC recommend against PGE1 for the same outcome, with the SOGC guideline recommending PGE2 only in rare circumstances. All three guidelines agree that women with a history of one or two uncomplicated low-transverse CD and no contraindications to VBAC should be educated, counselled and offered a TOLAC. The SOGC's updated guidelines (July 2019) continue to support the previous recommendation of offering women (without contraindications) the option of a TOLAC. The new guideline provides details on the likelihood of VBAC (greater among women with spontaneous labor, lower among women with factors that negatively affect this likelihood), the risk of uterine rupture (baseline risk of 0.47% among women with a prior CD; higher relative risk of uterine rupture, but low absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; risk greatest for women over 40 weeks of gestation; use of fetal monitoring is recommended as an indicator of the presence of uterine rupture), risk of other outcomes (higher relative risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity, but lower absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; higher relative risk of maternal death for elective cesarean section), and recommends against using ultrasonographic measurements of the lower uterine segment to counsel patients on the possibility of a TOLAC.

### Spontaneous uterine rupture and surgical repair at 21 weeks gestation with progression to live birth: a case report [^111inMrB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Several unique maternal and fetal concerns arise following emergency fetal surgery in addition to chorioamniotic separation and oligohydramnios. These include risk of repair dehiscence, postoperative infection, premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor. Serial imaging was used to evaluate the uterine wall thickness post-repair (range 0.29 to 0.4 cm). A cohort of normal pregnancies demonstrated mean fundal myometrial thickness in the second trimester of 5.9mm, but the utility of scar monitoring in this unique circumstance is unknown and cannot be compared to surveillance protocols used to plan trial of labor after cesarean. Postoperative antibiotics were given for 24 h. Alternative regimens include intrauterine antibiotics infused in warmed Lactated Ringer's solution, in addition to systemic antibiotics. Our patient did not have any symptoms or signs of preterm labor throughout her course. Various protocols for tocolysis following fetal surgery have been described, and could be considered in uterine rupture cases.

A multidisciplinary team was formed to plan delivery including the patient's wishes. Factors that contributed to the decision-making process included fetal maturity, risk of developmental sequelae of severe prematurity, risk of secondary uterine rupture, risk of premature labor, and associated risk of fetal demise. Planned cesarean delivery was predicted to provide significantly superior maternal and neonatal outcomes as compared to expectant management with emergency delivery, due to the risk of secondary uterine rupture and its consequences. Confirmation of fetal pulmonary maturity has been reported in a similar case, but was not performed as it was decided that the results would not influence the timing of delivery. Risks of subsequent pregnancy and recurrent uterine rupture were discussed extensively; the patient declined the options of concurrent hysterectomy or tubal interruption. The same surgical team that was involved in the uterine rupture repair carried out the cesarean delivery in order to provide continuity of clinical care and surgical expertise.

In conclusion, a multidisciplinary team approach was crucial to navigating medical and ethical considerations. Insights into successful technical closure of uterine wall dehiscence included iatrogenic amniotomy and its repair and foley catheter balloon reduction of amniotic membranes allowing for superior myometrial reapproximation. Furthermore, these novel techniques resulted in successful continuation of pregnancy with excellent neonatal outcome after this rare presentation of pre-viable spontaneous uterine rupture.

### Twin pregnancies with uterine fibroids are not at increased risk for obstetric complications: single center cohort study [^1128qUmQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

However, considering the two cases of uterine rupture in our study, unnecessary myomectomy should be avoided. In one retrospective review of 19 cases of uterine rupture after laparoscopic myomectomy, the authors recommended multilayered closure of the myometrium and limited use of electrocautery for prevention of uterine rupture. Moreover, during antenatal care of women with scarred uterus, symptoms such as sharp low abdominal pain should be urgently managed with alert, considering the possible occurrence of uterine rupture.

It is well known that twin pregnancies carry increased risks for obstetric complications. Especially, early uterine distension is thought to induce preterm labor in women with twin pregnancies. In explaining no significant association between obstetric outcomes and UFs in twin pregnancies, Stout et al. proposed that more frequent check-up, early uterine distension, and planned early delivery in twin pregnancies might have mitigated adverse effects that could be attributable to fibroid tumors detected in singleton pregnancies.

### Inter-pregnancy interval and uterine rupture during a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery and no previous vaginal births: a retrospective population-based cohort study [^115CNXvL]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study identified gestational age as an additional risk factor. Some smaller studies found that gestational ages > 40 weeks, or ≥ 41 weeks, independently increase the risk of uterine rupture in women attempting TOLAC while others found no significant difference. We found an increasing risk of uterine rupture for every week between 35 weeks and 43 weeks with on odds ratio of 1.12 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.16) per week of gestational age. This may provide useful information for women beyond 41 weeks gestation who are weighing the options between continued expectant management and caesarean delivery. Our results are also consistent with smaller studies reporting increased rates of uterine rupture for maternal age ≥ 35 years, height of ≤ 160 cm, birthweight of ≥ 4.5 kg, and induced onset of labour. The rate of uterine rupture in twin pregnancies was low (2/4317), but there were insufficient data to make any conclusions. Our study also identified a mild protective effect from increasing BMI, possibly due to weaker contractions in mothers with higher BMI. Others have found no association, or a higher risk of uterine rupture with increasing BMI without adjusting for confounders such as maternal height.

Our finding of low rates of perinatal death following uterine rupture is consistent with the study by Landon et al. who reported two intrapartum stillbirths or neonatal deaths among 114 uterine ruptures (1.8%) consistent with our rate of 3.7%. Our 2.5% rate of neonatal seizures is consistent with the 6.2% (7/114) rate of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) reported by Landon et al. as not all infants with HIE have seizures. Furthermore, we found that 10.1% of infants had a 5-min Apgar score < 4 compared with 14% with an Apgar score ≤ 5 in the Landon study, and a rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit of 27.7% compared with 40.4% (46/114; 95% CI 31–50%).

3 RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE DURING VBAC

The major concern regarding VBAC, and the main reason why clinicians hesitate to offer it, is uterine rupture — a complication that can severely affect both mother and fetus, often requires transfusion, and can lead to an emergency hysterectomy. The risk of uterine rupture differs according to the type of uterine incision that was performed and the number of previous CSs, but overall, the risk is infrequent, with an average rate of 0.3%. In a study of 17 898 women with a history of CS who underwent VBAC, the overall rate of uterine rupture was 0.7%. The rates of uterine rupture were 0.7% for women with a prior low uterine segment transverse incision, 2% for those with a prior low vertical incision, 1.9% with a prior classical, inverted T, or J incision, and 0.5% for those with an unknown type of prior incision. Another study of 18 794 women who birthed at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation after previous CS reported a uterine rupture rate of 0.5%. In a systematic review of 14 studies including 4254 women with previous CS, uterine rupture and scar dehiscence occurred in 2.1% of the women. A meta‐analysis of patients undergoing VBAC after two previous CSs reported a uterine rupture rate of 1.36%. Macones et al.reported that uterine rupture occurred in 1.8% of 1082 women with two previous CSs who underwent VBAC. In a retrospective review by Cahill et al.of 860 women with ≥ 3 prior CSs, 89 had VBAC and there were no cases of uterine rupture. These studies support that the overall risk of uterine rupture remains low even in women with > 1 previous CS. Therefore, more emphasis should be given to identifying women with good potential for successful VBAC.

### Pregnancy complications and risk of uterine rupture among women with singleton pregnancies in China [^115Fw1YG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Variable definition

UR was defined as uterine or lower uterine dehiscence during late pregnancy or delivery. According to the degree of dehiscence, UR can be divided into complete UR (tearing in all layers of the uterine wall) and incomplete UR (tearing in the muscular layers). Common clinical manifestations of UR include foetal distress, sudden tearing uterine pain, cessation of uterine contractions and abnormal vaginal bleeding. UR was diagnosed by a health professional with imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound examination); or during emergency caesarean delivery; or peripartum hysterectomy or laparotomy after vaginal birth. Unfortunately, UR is captured as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) in the NMNMSS, and the type of rupture is lacking. We identified five pregnancy complications related to previous caesarean delivery for analysis: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, placental abruption, placenta previa and placenta percreta. Preeclampsia included pregnancies with preeclampsia, eclampsia or HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome, as well as chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed by a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performs during 24–28 gestational weeks in all pregnant women. Placental abruption was defined as the premature separation of the implanted placenta before delivery. Placenta previa was defined as the placenta covering the internal os of the cervix. Placenta percreta, as the most severe grade of the placenta accreta spectrum disorders, occurs when the chorionic villi penetrate the uterine serosa.

### Clinical analysis of complete uterine rupture during pregnancy [^1122VcxS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

(2) Combined uterine injuries or abnormalities in this pregnancy

Postnatal etiologies include advanced age, muliple pregnancies and deliveries, spontaneous tonic uterine contractions, excessive contractions due to the use of oxytocin or prostaglandins and maternal sensitivity to drugs, prostaglandin or saline intra-amniotic infusion, sharp forceps contusion, external inversion, amniotic fluid overload, or multiple pregnancies. In this study, one patient (3.03%) was treated with uterotonics and three (9.09%) underwent induction of labor.
Intrapartum etiologies include any mechanism leading to obstruction of fetal descent, such as pelvic stenosis, cephalopelvic disproportion, obstruction of the soft birth canal, abnormal fetal position, and macrosomia; internal inversion; forceps delivery; emergency labor; breech traction; fetus destruction; excessive dilatation of the uterus in the lower part of the uterus caused by fetal anomalies; excessive pressure in the uterine cavity during delivery; implantation of the placenta or severe adhesion; and difficulty in manually stripping the placenta. One patient (case 20) in this study had uterine rupture due to breech traction during vaginal delivery and eight (24.24%) had placenta implantation.
Acquired etiologies include gestational trophoblastic disease, adenomyosis, posterior flexion uterine implantation, and uterine artery embolization surgery. One patient in this study had adenomyosis.
CSP involves a poorly healed uterine incision, wide scarring, and inflammation, leading to the development of microscopic fissures through which the fertilized ovum is deposited into the myometrium. Most cases have a poor prognosis [1]. Only one case of CSP was reported in this study.
Placental implantation: when it occurs at the site of the original cesarean section scar is caused by a structural defect in the endometrium that allows the placenta to attach abnormally to the uterine myometrium. In our study, four patients (12.12%) had placental implantation, with three who had severe postpartum hemorrhage and two who underwent hysterectomies.
Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC), during a second pregnancy or request for a vaginal trial of labor; A meta-analysis showed that TOLAC results in a 0.27% higher risk of uterine rupture. The management of TOLAC is a multifactorial. Factors such as a previous vaginal delivery, use of epidural anesthesia, indication for previous cesarean section, pregnancy complications (such as preeclampsia, and placental anomalies), fetal weight above 4000 g, dose of oxytocin used, induction of labor with prostaglandins, women who delivered at > 41 +0 weeks of gestation, ethnicity, cervical length, head-perineum distance, maternal age (maybe), inter-delivery interval, body mass index (maybe), and prolonged second stage of labor (maybe) contribute to uterine rupture during TOLAC. However, there are no data or literature supporting whether to perform a TOLAC and assess the risk of uterine rupture in a second pregnancy after a history of two cesarean deliveries and after one VBAC.

### Laparoscopic management of uterine rupture after early second-trimester medical abortion in a patient with a prior cesarean section [^116WYvAU]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To show the possibility of laparoscopic management of uterine rupture.

Design

Video with explanations.

Setting

In the medical management with misoprostol for termination of pregnancy at any time the risk of uterine rupture may be possible. The risk is likely higher in women with a previous uterus surgery. In a systematic review of available studies, the risk of rupture was .28% among women with a prior cesarean delivery who were undergoing second-trimester misoprostol-induced abortion, meaning if 414 women with a history of cesarean delivery were given misoprostol for second-trimester abortion, 1 would experience uterine rupture. Uterine rupture has only been reported 3 times in first-trimester abortion and only once managed via laparoscopy: a missed abortion reported in 2005, a case of a ruptured unscarred uterus in a women undergoing medical abortion, and a case of a delayed miscarriage at 8 weeks' gestation after misoprostol managed by laparotomy and sharp curettage.

Interventions

Total laparoscopic management in a patient with uterine tear after misoprostol treatment.

Conclusion

Early second-trimester medical abortions with misoprostol can cause uterine rupture. In hemodynamically stable cases, total laparoscopic management is possible approach.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^111WeLPB]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cesarean section (CS) rates are increasing globally and are expected to continue to increase unless intervening measures are taken. It is projected that by 2030, nearly 30% of women globally will give birth by CS. In many countries, primarily in urban areas, primary CS on maternal request, supported by obstetricians, is increasing in frequency. Primary CS is considered a rapid and safe procedure, with favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, as with any other surgical procedure, CS does carry short‐ and long‐term risks for the mother, baby, and subsequent pregnancies. These risks include severe maternal morbidities (hemorrhage requiring hysterectomy or blood transfusion, uterine rupture, anesthetic complications, shock, cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, assisted ventilation, venous thromboembolism, major infection, or in‐hospital wound disruption or hematoma), which are increased three‐fold for CS compared with vaginal birth. The incidence of placenta accreta spectrum increases with each subsequent CS, from 1% with one prior CS to 3% with three or more prior CSs. After three CSs, the risk that placenta previa will be complicated by placenta accreta is almost 40%.

Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) avoids repeat CS and the associated potential short‐ and long‐term risks. VBAC is generally attempted after one previous CS; however, it may be considered after two prior CSs in carefully selected patients. Four key components of VBAC counseling include the individualized risk of uterine rupture, the individualized likelihood of successful VBAC (or risk of intrapartum CS), a patient's future reproductive plans, and patient preference. These components are discussed in these good practice recommendations, which take into account the complexities of VBAC and language sensitivities. The term "trial of labor after cesarean" (TOLAC) has not been used, following feedback from women that this can be perceived as offensive. To provide clarity on the outcomes of VBAC, these are referred to as "successful" and "unsuccessful".

### Practice bulletin no. 184: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^113fA9Lc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, indications for trial of labor, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to avoid offering a trial of labor after Cesarean delivery in patients at high risk of uterine rupture (such as with previous classical uterine incision or T-incision, prior uterine rupture, or extensive transfundal uterine surgery) or if vaginal delivery is otherwise contraindicated (such as placenta previa).

### Infant outcome after complete uterine rupture [^1174wABa]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Complete uterine rupture is a rare peripartum complication often associated with a catastrophic outcome for both mother and child. However, little has been written based on large data sets about maternal and infant outcome after complete ruptures. This is partly due to the rarity of the event and the serious maternal and infant outcome; it is also partly due to the use of international diagnostic codes that do not differentiate between the less catastrophic partial rupture and more catastrophic complete uterine rupture. As uterine rupture is expected to increase due to increased cesarean delivery rates worldwide, it is important to know more completely about the outcome following complete uterine rupture.

Objective

We sought to explore risk factors associated with poor infant outcome in cases of complete uterine rupture.

Study Design

This population-based study used data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, the Patient Administration System, and medical records. We included births with complete uterine rupture after start of labor in all maternity units in Norway during the period 1967 through 2008 (n = 244 births), identified among 2,455,797 births. Uterine ruptures were identified and further studied through a review of medical records. We estimated the associations between infant outcomes and demographic and labor risk factors using logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for each risk factor were determined after adjustment for demographic factors and period of birth. The main outcome measure was infant outcome: healthy infant, intrapartum/infant deaths, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.

Results

We identified 109 (44.7%) healthy infants, 56 (23.0%) infants needing neonatal intensive care unit admission, 64 (26.2%) intrapartum/infant deaths, and 15 (6.1%) infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The highest number of intrapartum/infant deaths occurred in 1967 through 1977 (51.6%) and the fewest in 2000 through 2008 (15.0%). Unscarred uterine ruptures did not significantly increase intrapartum/infant deaths compared to scarred uterine ruptures. Placental separation and/or fetal extrusion had the highest odds ratio for intrapartum/infant deaths (odds ratio, 17.9; 95% confidence interval, 7.5–42.4). Time-to-delivery interval < 20 minutes resulted in fewest intrapartum/infant deaths (9.9%), although there were 2 deaths at 10-minute interval. Time to delivery > 30 minutes vs < 20 minutes increased risk of death (odds ratio, 16.7; 95% confidence interval, 6.4–43.5).

Conclusion

Intrapartum/infant death after complete uterine rupture decreased significantly over the decades. Time to delivery > 30 minutes and placental separation and/or fetal extrusion had the highest association with intrapartum/infant deaths after complete uterine rupture. Time to delivery < 20 minutes limited the incidence of intrapartum/infant deaths.

### Uterine rupture after uterine artery embolization for symptomatic leiomyomas [^111ZZn9L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are few data regarding safety of pregnancy after uterine artery embolization. However, numerous women desire future fertility after this procedure. Uterine rupture without a history of cesarean delivery or uterine scarring is an exceedingly rare complication in pregnancy.

Case

We report a case of uterine rupture in a primigravid woman after uterine artery embolization. Her pregnancy was also complicated by placenta previa with placenta increta, resulting in a favorable neonatal outcome in an otherwise life-threatening situation for mother and fetus.

Conclusion

Uterine artery embolization is a risk factor for abnormal placentation and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^112Hpuoz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Stillbirth with prior uterine scar — induction, misoprostol, and delivery approach: Both induction of labor and dilation and evacuation remain options for women with a previous hysterotomy, and in a population-based case-control study of 611 stillbirths, induction of labor resulted in vaginal delivery for 91% of women (41 of 45) with a history of cesarean delivery with 2 cases of uterine rupture; although induction of labor is preferred rather than cesarean delivery in the setting of fetal demise, a previous hysterotomy modifies management. Several studies have evaluated misoprostol at a dosage of 400 μg every 6 hours for stillbirth between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation with a previous uterine scar, and randomized trials support vaginal misoprostol to terminate nonviable pregnancies before 24 weeks of gestation; between 24 weeks and 28 weeks, lower doses of misoprostol (200 μg per dose) may be preferred, whereas after 28 weeks, women with a previous hysterectomy and fetal demise should undergo induction of labor per standard protocols for trial of labor after cesarean rather than misoprostol administration. In patients after 28 weeks of gestation with a previous hysterotomy, cervical ripening with a transcervical Foley catheter has been associated with uterine rupture rates comparable with spontaneous labor and may be a helpful adjunct for an unfavorable cervix, and based on limited data in patients with 1 previous low transverse cesarean delivery, trial of labor remains a favorable option. In general, cesarean delivery for fetal demise should be reserved for unusual circumstances, with repeat cesarean delivery a reasonable option in women at increased risk of uterine rupture such as those with a history of classical hysterotomy or transfundal surgery, and women who opt for induction should understand the increased risk and clinicians should be attuned to signs and symptoms of uterine rupture throughout labor.

### Misoprostol [^113CFKU9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

8473501/0323F

Read this leaflet before taking misoprostol and each time your prescription is renewed, because the leaflet may be changed.

Misoprostol is being prescribed by your doctor to decrease the chance of getting stomach ulcers related to the arthritis/pain medication that you take.

Do not take misoprostol to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcers if you are pregnant. (See boxed WARNINGS .) Misoprostol can cause abortion (sometimes incomplete which could lead to dangerous bleeding and require hospitalization and surgery), premature birth, or birth defects. It is also important to avoid pregnancy while taking this medication and for at least one month or through one menstrual cycle after you stop taking it. Misoprostol may cause the uterus to tear (uterine rupture) during pregnancy. The risk of uterine rupture increases as your pregnancy advances and if you have had surgery on the uterus, such as a Cesarean delivery. Rupture (tearing) of the uterus can result in severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or maternal or fetal death.

If you become pregnant during misoprostol therapy, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately. Remember that even if you are on a means of birth control it is still possible to become pregnant. Should this occur, stop taking misoprostol and contact your physician immediately.

### Recurrent uterine rupture in third trimester of pregnancy [^116yFEDf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a case of recurrent upper segment uterine rupture in a 31-year-old woman at 32 +5 /40 weeks of gestation. She had fundal uterine rupture 3years ago in her first pregnancy at 40 weeks of gestation. There was no history of uterine malformation or prior uterine surgery. However, we noted that she had had three laparoscopic procedures for endometriosis treatment. She was scheduled to have an elective repeat caesarean section at 34 +6 /40 weeks of gestation in the index pregnancy. Unfortunately, she presented at 32 +5 /40 weeks with features of acute abdomen and signs of fetal distress. She had a category 1 caesarean section and was found to have fundal uterine rupture at the same site. She had a smooth uneventful recovery following a timely intervention and discharged home on day 5 postoperatively in a good condition with her baby girl.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of cesarean delivery and other uterine surgery as risk factors for placenta accreta [^114bSYby]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of placenta accreta has increased in recent years and it has been suggested that the rising trend in cesarean delivery and other uterine surgery is the underlying cause.

Objective

To explore the magnitude of the effect of performing single and repeat cesarean deliveries or other uterine surgery on the incidence of placenta accreta.

Search Strategy

Relevant databases were searched for papers published before August 1, 2018, using terms including "accreta" and "cesarean".

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies assessing the risk of placenta accreta according to women's history of uterine surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analyses were performed to assess the risks associated between uterine surgery and placenta accreta, hysterectomy, and uterine rupture. The I 2 statistic was used to examine between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

The risk of placenta accreta in a second pregnancy increased for women who had undergone a cesarean in their first pregnancy compared with vaginal delivery (OR 3.02; 95% CI, 1.50–6.08). Absolute risk of placenta accreta increased with the number of previous cesareans. The risk of uterine rupture and hysterectomy was also associated with the number of cesareans.

Conclusions

Risk of placenta accreta, hysterectomy, and uterine rupture increases with the number of previous cesarean deliveries.

### Does continuity of care impact decision making in the next birth after a caesarean section (VBAC)? a randomised controlled trial [^117PJjmD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

As an alternative, women who have had a previous lower-segment CS, and an uncomplicated pregnancy, can be offered to attempt a vaginal birth after CS (VBAC). However, a cross-sectional study undertaken in one Australian state (New South Wales) showed that, despite this, the rate of VBAC declined significantly between 1998 and 2006 (from 31% to 19%, respectively) and the proportion of women who attempted a vaginal birth also declined (from 49% to 35%, respectively). In this study, more than half the women (59%) who attempted VBAC were successful.

The best available international evidence suggests that VBAC does not increase the risk of hysterectomy or maternal mortality. Neonatal mortality rate, after adjustments are made for pre-existing fetal anomalies, has been reported to be 24 per 10,000 for women who planned a VBAC compared with 9 per 10,000 for those who planned a repeat CS. Although this results in an increased risk, the absolute risk is small, and comparable to the background risk of neonatal mortality for women having their first baby. In the United States, a large prospective observational study involving nearly 46,000 women showed that planned VBAC was associated with a 1% increased risk of a blood transfusion, a 1% increased risk of endometriosis, and a 0.7% risk of symptomatic uterine rupture. Rates of uterine rupture for women who undergo a planned VBAC have been reported to be in the range of 22–74 per 10,000, compared with a risk of 0.5–2 per10,000 births in women with non-scarred uteri. Other evidence shows a lesser increase in risk of perinatal mortality for VBAC, with a risk difference of 1.5 per 10,000 births compared with repeat caesarean section. Therefore offering women the opportunity to attempt VBAC, in an appropriately staffed and resourced maternity unit, is a safe and ethical innovation to test.

### Analysis of the uterine rupture during pregnancy and delivery in a provincial maternal and children care hospital in China: 2013–2022 [^115oiN66]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Uterine rupture is rare and life-threatening for both mothers and newborns. This study aimed to explore the clinical manifestation, site of rupture, obstetric risk factors, maternal and neonatal complications, and birth outcomes with mid-trimester and late-pregnancy uterine rupture.

Methods

Data from patients with uterine rupture occurring at Hunan Maternal and Child Health Hospital between January 2013 and December 2022 were reviewed retrospectively.

Results

153,722 deliveries occurred during the 10 years of the study period. A total number of 129 uterine ruptures were identified: 12 ruptures occurred in the second trimester and 117 cases of uterine rupture diagnosed at or after 28 weeks gestation. The total incidence was 8.4/10,000. Most of the patients had a history of cesarean section (73.6%). 59.7% cases had a history of dilation and curettage. The rupture was more likely to occur on the lower uterine segment (86.82%). Seventy-one patients (55%) presented with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. Twenty-seven (20.9%) cases underwent a labor trial. There were 17 perinatal deaths associated with uterine rupture and neonatal asphyxia was observed in five infants. There was one maternal death. Postpartum hemorrhage occurred in 25 cases. Five patients underwent hysterectomy. Patients with uterine rupture during mid-trimester were more likely to receive a blood transfusion and exhibited higher rates of bladder injury.

Conclusion

Uterine rupture especially mid-gestational uterine rupture is rare and remains a diagnostic challenge. Remarkably worse maternal outcomes were seen in patients with second-trimester rupture when compared with patients who experienced late-pregnancy rupture. Pregnant women with a history of uterine surgery, even at an early gestational age, should be closely monitored by obstetricians for the risk of uterine rupture if they experience persistent abdominal pain. Early recognition and prompt intervention are key to improve maternal and child outcomes.

### The incidence, risk factors and maternal and foetal outcomes of uterine rupture during different birth policy periods: an observational study in China [^116q2irn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

b Adjusted for the clustering of births within hospitals; region; hospital level; maternal sociodemographic characteristics (maternal age, parity, previous caesarean section, education level, marital status, and number of antenatal care visits); and maternal obstetric characteristics (foetal presentation, delivery methods, foetal sex, and foetal weight)

c We did not adjust for maternal age in the different age groups

d We did not adjust for parity in the different parity groups

e We did not adjust for previous caesarean sections in different groups of previous caesarean section

The risks of maternal near miss and stillbirth increased with increasing parity among women with uterine rupture. Additionally, the risks of maternal near miss among women with a parity of 2 and 3 or more were respectively 3.31-fold (aRR = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.62–6.77) and 4.73-fold (aRR = 4.73, 95% CI: 2.04–4.27) those of women with a parity of 0, and the risks of stillbirth among women with a parity or 2 and 3 or more were respectively 2.15-fold (aRR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.09–4.27) and 3.21-fold (aRR = 3.21, 95%CI: 1.54–6.65) those of women with a parity of 0, respectively (Table 3).

As the number of previous caesarean sections decreased, the risks of maternal near miss and stillbirth increased among women with uterine rupture. The risks of maternal near miss among women with a parity of 1 and parity of 0 were respectively 2.18-fold (aRR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.30–3.65) and 4.68-fold (aRR = 4.68, 95% CI: 2.50–8.76) those of women with a parity of 2, and the risks of stillbirth were respectively 2.62-fold (aRR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.54–4.56) and 4.47-fold (aRR = 4.47, 95% CI: 2.58–7.74) those of women with a parity of 2 (Table 3). After multiple-factor adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference between maternal age and the risk of maternal near miss or stillbirth among women with uterine rupture (Table 3).

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^111SRRMA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The rising global rate of cesarean section (CS) has prompted renewed focus on vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) as a safe and effective alternative to repeat CS in properly selected women. The FIGO good practice recommendations provide evidence-based recommendations to guide VBAC care. Success rates for VBAC range from 60% to 80%, with the highest likelihood in women with prior vaginal birth, non-recurrent CS indications, interbirth intervals ≥ 18months, BMI < 30kg/m 2, and spontaneous labor onset. While uterine rupture is the primary concern, its risk remains low at approximately 0.3%-0.7% for women with one prior low transverse CS. Comparisons show that VBAC generally results in similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes than planned repeat CS, including lower maternal mortality, fewer infections, and shorter hospital stays. This article emphasizes appropriate patient counseling, facility readiness for emergency CS, and continuous fetal monitoring during labor. With proper implementation, VBAC offers a valuable strategy to reduce unnecessary repeat surgeries, improve outcomes, and support informed maternal choice.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication abortion between 14 0 / 7 and 27 6 / 7 weeks of gestation: jointly developed with the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine [^113CMuf7]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Medication abortion — prior cesarean delivery and uterine rupture risk is described as follows: Compared with the background uterine rupture rate without a prior uterine scar (0.083), the increased relative rupture risk among those with history of one cesarean delivery was not statistically significant (RR, 2.36; 95% CI, 0.39–14.32), while the rupture risk was 2.5% in patients with two or more cesareans (RR 17.55; 95% CI, 3.00–102.8); in patients with one or more prior cesarean deliveries, the use of PGE1 was also associated with higher retained placenta risk (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03–1.43) and blood transfusion compared to those without a uterine scar. History of more than one prior cesarean delivery is not a contraindication to medication abortion regimens using misoprostol, and there is insufficient evidence to conclusively support a change in medication abortion regimen in the setting of prior uterine incision; given increased uterine rupture risk in the multiply-scarred uterus, lower misoprostol doses can be considered, and expert opinion suggests reducing misoprostol doses at higher gestational durations, while mifepristone administration may lower total abortion time but there are no data on whether mifepristone affects uterine rupture rates.

### The role of uterine closure in the risk of uterine rupture [^114FFfjr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of prior single-layer compared with double-layer closure on the risk of uterine rupture.

Methods

A multicenter, case-control study was performed on women with a single, prior, low-transverse cesarean who experienced complete uterine rupture during a trial of labor. For each case, three women who underwent a trial of labor without uterine rupture after a prior low-transverse cesarean delivery were selected as control participants. Risk factors such as prior uterine closure, suture material, diabetes, prior vaginal delivery, labor induction, cervical ripening, birth weight, prostaglandin use, maternal age, gestational age, and interdelivery interval were compared between groups. Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted.

Results

Ninety-six cases of uterine rupture, including 28 with adverse neonatal outcome, and 288 control participants were assessed. The rate of single-layer closure was 36% (35 of 96) in the case group and 20% (58 of 288) in the control group (P < .01). In multivariable analysis, single-layer closure (odds ratio [OR] 2.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–5.28) and birth weight greater than 3,500 g (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.21–3.38) were linked with increased rates of uterine rupture, whereas prior vaginal birth was a protective factor (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.24–0.93). Single-layer closure was also related to uterine rupture associated with adverse neonatal outcome (OR 2.89; 95% CI 1.01–8.27).

Conclusion

Prior single-layer closure carries more than twice the risk of uterine rupture compared with double-layer closure. Single-layer closure should be avoided in women who could contemplate future vaginal birth after cesarean delivery.

### Labor before a primary cesarean delivery: reduced risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent trial of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean [^114RWdrZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of the onset of labor before a primary cesarean delivery on the risk of uterine rupture if vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is attempted in the next pregnancy.

Methods

Longitudinally linked birth records were used to follow women from a primary cesarean delivery to a trial of labor at term for their next birth. The effects of characteristics of both the trial of labor and primary cesarean deliveries on the risk of uterine rupture were examined.

Results

Of 10,160 women who had a trial of labor, 39 (0.38%) had a uterine rupture. Women who were induced or augmented for their trial of labor had a greater relative risk (RR) of uterine rupture (crude RR 4.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.23–8.07). Women whose primary cesarean delivery was planned or followed induction of labor also had an increased risk of uterine rupture (crude RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.24–5.49), and this risk remained after adjustment for other factors. Women with a history of either spontaneous labor or vaginal birth had one uterine rupture for every 460 deliveries; women without this history who required induction or augmentation to proceed with a VBAC attempt had one uterine rupture for every 95 deliveries.

Conclusion

Labor before the primary cesarean delivery can decrease the risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent trial of labor. A history of primary cesarean delivery preceded by spontaneous labor is favorable for VBAC.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^115oPpRd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Interpregnancy interval — women should be advised to avoid interpregnancy intervals shorter than 6 months and should be counseled about the risks and benefits of repeat pregnancy sooner than 18 months; most of the data from observational studies in the United States would suggest a modest increase in risk of adverse outcomes associated with intervals of less than 18 months and more significant risk of adverse outcome with intervals of less than 6 months between birth and the start of the next pregnancy; interdelivery intervals of less than 18 months have been associated with increased risk of uterine rupture among women undergoing trials of labor after cesarean; and interpregnancy intervals of greater than 5–10 years also may be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.

### Time and the risk of ruptured tubal pregnancy [^113zyfYr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Tubal pregnancy remains an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. We sought to quantify the relationship of time between symptom onset and treatment and the risk of tubal rupture.

Methods

We reviewed inpatient, clinic, and physician office charts of 221 women with tubal pregnancy. We assessed the conditional risk of rupture with passing time and other factors related to rupture.

Results

Time between symptom onset and treatment varied from 3 hours to 66 days with an average of 7 days. There was a 32% rupture rate. The conditional risk of rupture was highest within the first 48 hours of symptom onset (5–7%). The risk dropped, leveled off, and remained fairly steady at approximately 2.5% per 24 hours of untreated symptoms. Classic tubal pregnancy signs, symptoms, and tests were not helpful in predicting rupture.

Conclusion

The rate of rupture is highest in women with the shortest times between symptom onset and treatment. With passing time, the risk declines, but remains steady despite women's getting into care.

### Delivery after previous… [^116R5AFi]. Wikipedia (2006). Low credibility.

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which affect the decision for planned vaginal or planned abdominal delivery. There is a slightly higher risk for uterine rupture and perinatal death of the child with VBAC than ERCS, but the absolute increased risk of these complications is small, especially with only one previous low transverse caesarean section. In 2010, the National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, and American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology all released statements in support of increasing VBAC access and rates. Recently, it is recognized that as the number of cesarean sections a patient undergoes increases so does the risk of significant obstetrical complications It is still suggested to try VBAC over ERCS even with its slightly higher risk of uterine rupture.

Most women in the UK should be counselled to avoid induction of labour if there are no medical reasons for it, as the risks of uterine rupture of the previous scar are increased if the labour is induced. Other intrapartum management options, including analgesia/anesthesia, are identical to those of any labour and vaginal delivery. Factors favoring VBAC
- If the previous caesarean involved a low transverse incision there is less risk of uterine rupture than if there was a low vertical incision, classical incision, T-shaped, inverted T-shaped, or J-shaped incision.
- A previous successful vaginal delivery increases the chances of a successful VBAC.
- The indication for the previous caesarean section should not be present in the current pregnancy.
- Location at an institution equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care.

Factors favoring ERCS
- The more caesarean sections that a woman has had, the less likely she will be eligible for VBAC. VBAC after two or more prior lower uterine segment transverse CS is controversial. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with a prior history of even two previous uncomplicated low transverse Caesarean sections, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy at term, with no contraindication for vaginal birth, may be considered suitable for planned VBAC.
- The presence of twins may reduce the chance of successful VBAC, but if the leading twin is head first and there are no other reasons to recommend caesarean section, VBAC should be offered.
- VBAC may be discouraged if there are other medical complications but this will require an individualised assessment and discussion between the woman and her obstetrician.

According to ACOG guidelines, the following criteria may reduce the likelihood of VBAC success but should NOT preclude a trial of labour: having two prior caesarean sections, suspected fetal macrosomia at term, gestation beyond 40 weeks, twin gestation, and previous low vertical or unknown previous incision type, provided a classical uterine incision is not suspected.
- Maternal request for elective repeat CS after counselling
- Maternal or fetal reasons to avoid vaginal birth in current pregnancy
- Previous uterine incision other than transverse segment including classical. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with a prior history of one classical caesarean section should give birth by elective repeat caesarean section. Uterine rupture A caesarean section leaves a scar in the wall of the uterus which is considered weaker than the normal uterine wall.

### Uterine rupture… [^1141eJzL]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Uterine rupture is the tearing of the muscular wall of the uterus during pregnancy or childbirth. Symptoms, while classically including increased pain, vaginal bleeding, or a change in contractions, are not always present. Disability or death of the mother or baby may result. Risk factors include vaginal birth after cesarean section, other uterine scars, obstructed labor, induction of labor, trauma, and cocaine use. While typically rupture occurs during labor it may occasionally happen earlier in pregnancy. Diagnosis may be suspected based on a rapid drop in the baby's heart rate during labor. Uterine dehiscence is a less severe condition in which there is only incomplete separation of the old scar. Treatment involves rapid surgery to control bleeding and delivery of the baby. A hysterectomy may be required to control the bleeding. Blood transfusions may be given to replace blood loss.

Women who have had a prior rupture are generally recommended to have C-sections in subsequent pregnancies. Rates of uterine rupture during vaginal birth following one previous C-section, done by the typical technique, are estimated at 0. 9%. Rates are greater among those who have had multiple prior C-sections or an atypical type of C-section. In those who do have uterine scarring, the risk during a vaginal birth is about 1 per 12, 000. Risk of death of the baby is about 6%. Those in the developing world appear to be affected more often and have worse outcomes. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of a rupture may be initially quite subtle. An old cesarean scar may undergo dehiscence; with further labor the woman may experience abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, though these signs are difficult to distinguish from normal labor. Often a deterioration of the fetal heart rate is a leading sign, but the cardinal sign of uterine rupture is loss of fetal station on manual vaginal exam.

Intra-abdominal bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock and death. Although the associated maternal mortality is now less than one percent, the fetal mortality rate is between two and six percent when rupture occurs in the hospital. In pregnancy uterine rupture may cause a viable abdominal pregnancy. This is what accounts for most abdominal pregnancy births.
- Abdominal pain and tenderness. The pain may not be severe; it may occur suddenly at the peak of a contraction. The woman may describe a feeling that something "gave way" or "ripped. "
- Chest pain, pain between the scapulae, or pain on inspiration — Pain occurs because of the irritation of blood below the woman's diaphragm.
- Hypovolemic shock caused by bleeding, evidenced by falling blood pressure, tachycardia, tachypnea, pallor, cool and clammy skin, and anxiety.

The fall in blood pressure is often a late sign of haemorrhage
- Signs associated with fetal oxygenation, such as late deceleration, reduced variability, tachycardia, and bradycardia.
- Absent fetal heart sounds with a large disruption of the placenta; absent fetal heart activity by ultrasound examination
- Cessation of uterine contractions
- Palpation of the fetus outside the uterus. The fetus is likely to be dead at this point.
- Signs of an abdominal pregnancy
- Post-term pregnancy. Risk factors A uterine scar from a previous cesarean section is the most common risk factor. Other forms of uterine surgery that result in full-thickness incisions, dysfunctional labor, labor augmentation by oxytocin or prostaglandins, and high parity may also set the stage for uterine rupture.

### Delivery after previous caesarean section [^114zJg1M]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which affect the decision for planned vaginal or planned abdominal delivery. There is a slightly higher risk for uterine rupture and perinatal death of the child with VBAC than ERCS, but the absolute increased risk of these complications is small, especially with only one previous low transverse caesarean section. In 2010, the National Institutes of Health, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, and American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology all released statements in support of increasing VBAC access and rates. Recently, it is recognized that as the number of cesarean sections a patient undergoes increases so does the risk of significant obstetrical complications It is still suggested to try VBAC over ERCS even with its slightly higher risk of uterine rupture.

Factors favoring VBAC
- If the previous caesarean involved a low transverse incision there is less risk of uterine rupture than if there was a low vertical incision, classical incision, T-shaped, inverted T-shaped, or J-shaped incision.
- A previous successful vaginal delivery increases the chances of a successful VBAC.
- The indication for the previous caesarean section should not be present in the current pregnancy.
- Location at an institution equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care. Factors favoring ERCS
- The more caesarean sections that a woman has had, the less likely she will be eligible for VBAC. VBAC after two or more prior lower uterine segment transverse CS is controversial.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that women with a prior history of even two previous uncomplicated low transverse Caesarean sections, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy at term, with no contraindication for vaginal birth, may be considered suitable for planned VBAC.
- The presence of twins may reduce the chance of successful VBAC, but if the leading twin is head first and there are no other reasons to recommend caesarean section, VBAC should be offered.
- VBAC may be discouraged if there are other medical complications but this will require an individualised assessment and discussion between the woman and her obstetrician.

According to ACOG guidelines, the following criteria may reduce the likelihood of VBAC success but should NOT preclude a trial of labour: having two prior caesarean sections, suspected fetal macrosomia at term, gestation beyond 40 weeks, twin gestation, and previous low vertical or unknown previous incision type, provided a classical uterine incision is not suspected. Criteria where ERCS should be performed The presence of any of the following practically always mean that ERCS will be performed – but this decision should always be discussed with a senior obstetrician:

- Maternal request for elective repeat CS after counselling
- Maternal or fetal reasons to avoid vaginal birth in current pregnancy
- Previous uterine incision other than transverse segment including classical.

### Asherman's syndrome… [^111q9sYa]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Asherman's syndrome is an acquired uterine condition that occurs when scar tissue forms inside the uterus and/or the cervix. It is characterized by variable scarring inside the uterine cavity, where in many cases the front and back walls of the uterus stick to one another. There is no one cause of AS. Risk factors can include myomectomy, cesarean section, infections, age, genital tuberculosis, and obesity. Genetic predisposition to AS is being investigated. Some studies show that a severe pelvic infection, independent of surgery may cause AS. AS can develop even if the woman has not had any uterine surgeries, trauma, or pregnancies. While rare in North America and European countries, genital tuberculosis is a cause of Asherman's in other countries such as India. Causes The cavity of the uterus is lined by the endometrium.

This lining is composed of two layers, the functional layer which is shed during menstruation and an underlying basal layer, which is necessary for regenerating the functional layer. Trauma to the basal layer, typically after a dilation and curettage performed after a miscarriage, or delivery, or abortion, can lead to the development of intrauterine scars resulting in adhesions that can obliterate the cavity to varying degrees. Asherman's syndrome affects women of all races and ages equally, suggesting no underlying genetic predisposition for its development. AS can result from other pelvic surgeries including cesarean sections, removal of fibroid tumours and from other causes such as IUDs, pelvic irradiation, schistosomiasis and genital tuberculosis.

Chronic endometritis from genital tuberculosis is a significant cause of severe intrauterine adhesions in the developing world, often resulting in total obliteration of the uterine cavity which is difficult to treat. Classification Various classification systems were developed to describe Asherman's syndrome, some taking into account the amount of functioning residual endometrium, menstrual pattern, obstetric history, and other factors which are thought to play a role in determining the prognosis. With the advent of techniques that allow visualization of the uterus, classification systems were developed to take into account the location and severity of adhesions inside the uterus. This is useful as mild cases with adhesions restricted to the cervix may present with amenorrhea and infertility, showing that symptoms alone do not necessarily reflect severity.

Other patients may have no adhesions but amenorrhea and infertility due to a sclerotic atrophic endometrium. The latter form has the worst prognosis. Prevention A 2013 review concluded that no studies were reporting on the link between intrauterine adhesions and long-term reproductive outcome after miscarriage, while similar pregnancy outcomes were reported after surgical management, medical management or conservative management. There is an association between surgical intervention in the uterus and the development of intrauterine adhesions, and between intrauterine adhesions and pregnancy outcomes, but there is still no clear evidence of any method of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In theory, the recently pregnant uterus is particularly soft under the influence of hormones and hence, easily injured.

### Caesarean section [^114Ghjwq]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

Reasons for the operation include, but are not limited to, obstructed labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, shoulder presentation, and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary. Medical uses Complications of labor and factors increasing the risk associated with vaginal delivery include:

- Abnormal presentation
- Prolonged labor or a failure to progress
- Fetal distress
- Cord prolapse
- Uterine rupture or an elevated risk thereof
- Uncontrolled hypertension, pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia in the mother.
- Large baby weighing > 4, 000 grams
- Umbilical cord abnormalities Other complications of pregnancy, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant diseases, include:

- Previous fetus
- HIV infection of the mother with a high viral load
- An outbreak of genital herpes in the third trimester
- Previous classical caesarean section.
- Previous uterine rupture
- Prior problems with the healing of the perineum
- Bicornuate uterus
- Rare cases of posthumous birth after the death of the mother Other
- Decreasing experience of accoucheurs with the management of breech presentation.

Although obstetricians and midwives are extensively trained in proper procedures for breech presentation deliveries using simulation mannequins, there is decreasing experience with actual vaginal breech delivery, which may increase the risk. Mother In those who are low risk, the risk of death for caesarean sections is 13 per 100, 000 vs. for vaginal birth 3. 5 per 100, 000 in the developed world. The United Kingdom National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth. Wound infections occur after caesarean sections at a rate of 3–15%. The presence of chorioamnionitis and obesity predisposes the woman to develop a surgical site infection. Women who had caesarean sections are more likely to have problems with later pregnancies, and women who want larger families should not seek an elective caesarean unless medical indications to do so exist.

The risk of placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening condition that is more likely to develop where a woman has had a previous caesarean section, is 0. 13% after two caesarean sections, but increases to
2. 13% after four and then to 6. 74% after six or more. Subsequent pregnancies Women who have had a caesarean for any reason are somewhat less likely to become pregnant again as compared to women who have previously delivered only vaginally. Women who had just one previous caesarean section are more likely to have problems with their second birth. Delivery after previous caesarean section is by either of two main options: Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. A vaginal birth after caesarean section confers a higher risk of uterine rupture, blood transfusion or endometritis, and perinatal death of the child.
