## Question

acute respiratory failure defined

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to define acute respiratory failure and its subtypes, distinguish ARDS within hypoxemic failure, and reconcile evolving definitions from Berlin to the proposed global ARDS criteria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching definition of acute respiratory failure. Then, I should classify it into hypoxemic and hypercapnic types. Next, I will define ARDS as a subset of hypoxemic failure using the Berlin criteria and then the proposed global modifications. After that, I should review epidemiology and outcomes to anchor clinical significance. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically usable definition and note limitations and controversies that affect bedside application and research enrollment.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition of acute respiratory failure. Acute respiratory failure is the short-term inability of the respiratory system to maintain adequate arterial oxygenation or ventilation to meet metabolic demands, typically defined as PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg or PaCO2 greater than 50 mm Hg with pH less than 7.35, recognizing that thresholds may be adjusted for chronic lung disease and that the clinical context matters more than any single number in isolation [^112wtU4t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before we classify the syndrome. I need to ensure I separate type I (hypoxemic) from type II (hypercapnic) respiratory failure. Type I reflects impaired oxygenation with normal or low PaCO2 and is often due to V/Q mismatch, shunt, or diffusion limitation, whereas type II reflects alveolar hypoventilation with CO2 retention and respiratory acidosis, commonly from COPD exacerbation, obesity hypoventilation, drug overdose, or ventilatory pump failure, and both can coexist in mixed presentations [^115brhLM].

> Next, I should review ARDS as a specific form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The Berlin definition requires acute onset within 7 days of a known insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms, bilateral opacities on chest imaging not fully explained by cardiogenic edema or other causes, and impaired oxygenation with PaO2/FiO2 300 mm Hg or less under at least 5 cm H2O PEEP or CPAP, stratified into mild, moderate, and severe by PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300, 200, and 100 mm Hg respectively, which improves predictive validity for mortality compared with prior definitions [^115CVfds] [^116svmLQ] [^1173QUDw].

> Wait, let me verify the key exclusions and caveats so I don't overcall ARDS. The Berlin framework emphasizes excluding cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload as the primary explanation, and when the cause is unclear, objective evaluation such as echocardiography is advised; it also acknowledges that interobserver variability for chest radiography can limit reliability, which is why some have explored standardized imaging sets or adjuncts like lung ultrasound to improve consistency [^116svmLQ] [^1173QUDw].

> I will now examine the proposed global ARDS definition, because practice has shifted toward noninvasive support that the Berlin criteria did not originally encompass. The global definition retains the Berlin timing and imaging constructs but adds three categories: nonintubated ARDS for patients on HFNO at or above 30 L/min or NIV, intubated ARDS with Berlin PaO2/FiO2 strata, and a resource-limited category that allows pulse oximetry-based SpO2/FiO2 315 or less when ABG is unavailable and permits lung ultrasound in place of chest radiography, while removing the requirement for a specific PEEP or device in those settings to broaden applicability and earlier recognition [^115b69ep] [^113d8vmd] [^111Vmvvw].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the global definition formally adopted the Kigali modification wholesale, but I should double-check that nuance. The global proposal incorporates the spirit of Kigali for resource-limited settings by allowing oximetry and ultrasound in place of ABG and chest radiography, yet it is framed as an extension of Berlin rather than a replacement, and it explicitly recommends reporting outcomes by Berlin strata to preserve comparability while enabling broader inclusion of nonintubated patients and those in low-resource environments [^115b69ep] [^111bCXS8] [^111omcXr].

> Let me consider the clinical rationale for including HFNO and oximetry, because I need to ensure this aligns with outcomes. Evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 and other causes of acute hypoxemic failure on HFNO who otherwise meet ARDS criteria have mortality and trajectories comparable to NIV-treated patients meeting Berlin criteria, and the Berlin oxygenation thresholds show similar predictive validity in HFNO cohorts, supporting the extension to nonintubated ARDS and earlier identification for trials and care pathways [^116UmeMs] [^114bukcg] [^116ytVy4].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and outcomes to contextualize why precise definitions matter. ARDS accounts for roughly 10% of ICU admissions globally and is associated with high mortality that scales with severity, with in-hospital mortality around 24% for mild, 32% for moderate, and 45% for severe ARDS in contemporary cohorts, and underrecognition remains substantial, with up to half of mild ARDS missed in practice, underscoring the need for clearer, feasible criteria and automated detection where possible [^116kDUKW] [^111Mjsf9].

> Hold on, I should verify the broader acute respiratory failure burden to avoid overgeneralizing from ARDS. Acute respiratory failure is a leading cause of ICU admission worldwide, and while ARDS represents a significant fraction, many patients have acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that never meets ARDS imaging or risk-factor criteria; this heterogeneity complicates trial design and has prompted calls for subphenotyping and treatable-trait approaches to better target therapies and enrich for responders [^113uAqQe] [^115faL28] [^1138GQiM].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable definition, but I need to ensure it remains faithful to the evidence. Acute respiratory failure is the acute inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and/or ventilation, operationally PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg or PaCO2 greater than 50 mm Hg with pH less than 7.35, recognizing chronic baseline adjustments and the possibility of mixed failure; within this, ARDS is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury presenting within 7 days of an insult with bilateral opacities and impaired oxygenation, historically PaO2/FiO2 300 mm Hg or less with at least 5 cm H2O PEEP, and now extended to include patients on HFNO or NIV and those in resource-limited settings using oximetry and ultrasound, with severity stratification by oxygenation that correlates with mortality [^112wtU4t] [^115CVfds] [^115b69ep].

> But wait, what if I am overemphasizing oxygenation indices and neglecting ventilatory mechanics and trajectory. I should confirm that while oxygenation anchors diagnosis and severity, clinical course and physiology such as compliance, driving pressure, and early trajectory also inform risk and response; indeed, some patients improve rapidly while others persist, and early stabilization of oxygenation on standardized settings can reclassify severity and prognosis, reinforcing the need to integrate time, trajectory, and context into decision-making and trial enrollment strategies [^1175r7WN] [^116gku1a] [^114GZeuP].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge limitations and controversies so the definition is applied thoughtfully. The Berlin and global definitions remain syndromic without a pathological gold standard, imaging criteria have interobserver variability, and expanding to HFNO may increase heterogeneity; nonetheless, the global extension better reflects contemporary practice, facilitates earlier recognition, and enables broader research, provided investigators continue to stratify and report by Berlin-compatible categories and address feasibility and validity prospectively [^1173QUDw] [^111bCXS8] [^115b69ep].

Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a **life-threatening condition** characterized by the **acute inability of the lungs to maintain adequate gas exchange**, resulting in hypoxemia (PaO2 < 60 mmHg), hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 50 mmHg with pH < 7.35), or both [^11765Ywp]. It is classified as **type I (hypoxemic), type II (hypercapnic), or type III (mixed)** based on the predominant gas-exchange abnormality [^112wtU4t]. ARF requires **urgent intervention** to restore oxygenation and ventilation, with management tailored to the underlying cause and severity [^116kDUKW].

---

## Clinical definition and diagnostic criteria

ARF is defined by the following **diagnostic criteria**:

- **Hypoxemic respiratory failure (type I)**: PaO2 < 60 mmHg on room air or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mmHg, indicating impaired oxygenation [^112wtU4t].

- **Hypercapnic respiratory failure (type II)**: PaCO2 > 50 mmHg with pH < 7.35, indicating inadequate alveolar ventilation and respiratory acidosis [^112wtU4t].

- **Mixed respiratory failure**: Combination of hypoxemia and hypercapnia occurring simultaneously [^112wtU4t].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

ARF results from **various pathophysiological mechanisms**, including:

- **Impaired gas exchange**: Alveolar-capillary membrane injury, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or intrapulmonary shunting, commonly seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^115vRXwx] and pneumonia [^notfound].

- **Ventilatory failure**: Reduced alveolar ventilation due to respiratory muscle fatigue, central respiratory depression, or airway obstruction, often observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations [^112LeyY1] and opioid overdose [^notfound].

- **Increased metabolic demand**: Elevated oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, as seen in sepsis [^notfound] or severe trauma, exacerbating respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with ARF typically present with the following **signs and symptoms**:

- **Dyspnea and tachypnea**: Rapid, shallow breathing and respiratory distress [^112QDMNb].

- **Cyanosis**: Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to hypoxemia [^112PkP9G].

- **Altered mental status**: Confusion, lethargy, or coma resulting from hypoxemia and hypercapnia [^115brhLM].

- **Accessory muscle use**: Paradoxical abdominal wall motion and nasal flaring, indicating increased respiratory effort [^1137ocL1].

- **Auscultatory findings**: Crackles, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds, depending on the underlying cause [^112PkP9G].

---

## Common causes of acute respiratory failure

ARF can result from **numerous underlying conditions**, including:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Pulmonary | - Pneumonia [^notfound] <br/> - ARDS [^115vRXwx] <br/> - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Asthma exacerbation <br/> - COPD exacerbation [^112g3wve] |
| Cardiac | - Acute heart failure [^notfound] <br/> - Cardiogenic pulmonary edema <br/> - Arrhythmias |
| Neuromuscular | - Guillain-Barré syndrome <br/> - Myasthenic crisis <br/> - Spinal cord injury <br/> - Respiratory muscle fatigue [^notfound] |
| Central nervous system | - Stroke <br/> - Drug overdose [^115brhLM] <br/> - Head trauma <br/> - Central respiratory depression [^notfound] |
| Trauma and surgery | - Flail chest <br/> - Pneumothorax <br/> - Hemothorax <br/> - Postoperative respiratory complications [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic evaluation of ARF includes:

- **Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis**: Essential for assessing oxygenation (PaO2), ventilation (PaCO2), and acid-base status (pH) [^112wtU4t].

- **Chest radiography**: Identifies pulmonary infiltrates, consolidation, pneumothorax, or other structural abnormalities [^113d8vmd].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Provides detailed imaging of the lungs and thoracic structures, useful in complex cases [^113d8vmd].

- **Pulmonary function tests**: Assess respiratory mechanics and gas exchange abnormalities [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and biomarkers (e.g. BNP, troponin) to identify underlying causes and complications [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management of ARF depends on the **underlying cause, severity, and patient-specific factors**:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen is the initial intervention to correct hypoxemia, with escalation to high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as needed [^113uAqQe].

- **Mechanical ventilation**: Invasive mechanical ventilation is indicated for severe hypoxemia, hypercapnic respiratory failure, or when non-invasive methods fail [^111n4eGC]. Lung-protective strategies (low tidal volume, limited plateau pressure) are essential to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [^114h57AX].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and diuretics are used based on the underlying cause (e.g. COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, cardiogenic pulmonary edema) [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Fluid management, nutritional support, and treatment of underlying conditions are critical components of management [^112QDMNb].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

ARF is associated with **high morbidity and mortality**, varying by underlying cause, severity, and patient factors. Mortality ranges from 34% to 55% in severe cases, such as ARDS [^112QDMNb] and severe COVID-19-related respiratory failure [^117KyKpF]. Long-term consequences include chronic respiratory symptoms, pulmonary fibrosis, and reduced quality of life [^115vRXwx].

---

Acute respiratory failure is a **critical condition** characterized by impaired gas exchange, requiring rapid diagnosis and targeted management. It encompasses hypoxemic, hypercapnic, and mixed types, each with distinct pathophysiology and clinical implications [^112wtU4t].

Objectives

To summarize the prevalence of various forms of acute respiratory failure in acutely ill patients and review the major factors involved in the outcome of these patients.

Data Sources and Selection

MEDLINE search for published studies reporting the prevalence or outcome for patients with acute respiratory failure and cited reference studies and abstracts from a recent international meeting in the intensive care medicine field.

Data Synthesis and Extraction

From the selected articles, information was obtained regarding the prevalence of acute respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury as defined by the North American-European Consensus Conference, the outcome, and the factors influencing mortality rates in this population of patients.

Conclusions

The prevalence of acute respiratory failure varies according to the definition used and the population studied. Nonsurvivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome die predominantly of respiratory failure in < 20% of cases. The relatively high mortality rates of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome are primarily related to the underlying disease, the severity of the acute illness, and the degree of organ dysfunction.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: diagnosis, outcomes, long-term sequelae, and management [^115vRXwx]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterised by acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is defined by the Berlin criteria. In this Series paper the diagnosis, management, outcomes, and long-term sequelae of ARDS are reviewed. Potential limitations of the ARDS definition and evidence that could inform future revisions are considered. Guideline recommendations, evidence, and uncertainties in relation to ARDS management are discussed. The future of ARDS strives towards a precision medicine approach, and the framework of treatable traits in ARDS diagnosis and management is explored.

### What is the acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^115DPDP5]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

It has been known for decades that shock and sepsis can cause a syndrome of acute respiratory failure with characteristics of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Over the years, this syndrome has been given a number of names, including congestive atelectasis, traumatic wet lung, and shock lung. In 1967 the modern counterpart to this syndrome was described and subsequently called the "acute respiratory distress syndrome" (ARDS). This syndrome results from lung injury and inflammation. As with inflammation elsewhere, ARDS is accompanied by many cellular and molecular processes, some of them specific to the syndrome, others perpetuating the syndrome, and others inactivating the by-products of inflammation. Since no specific clinical sign or diagnostic test has yet been described that identifies ARDS, its diagnosis is based on a constellation of clinical, hemodynamic, and oxygenation criteria. Current ARDS treatment is mainly supportive, since these patients frequently have coexisting conditions. Although in 1994 a new standard ARDS definition was accepted, that definition failed to standardize the measurement of the oxygenation defect and does not recognize different severities of pulmonary dysfunction. Based on current evidence there is a need for a better definition and classification system that could help us to identify ARDS patients who would be most responsive to supportive therapies and those unlikely to benefit because of the severity of their disease process. This paper examines our current understanding of ARDS and discusses why the current definition may not be the most appropriate for research and clinical practice.

How Will the Newly Proposed Definition Influence Epidemiological Research?

The proposed global definition for ARDS will allow epidemiological studies to have a global reach and thus teach us more about the underlying risk factors, disease course, and outcomes of patients fulfilling the criteria. One of the potential pitfalls of the broadening of the definition according to the new global definition may be that many more patients with acute respiratory failure will fulfill the definition of ARDS, especially in resource-limited settings. For example, some patients breathing spontaneously with hypoxemia from atelectasis may be labeled as having ARDS, whereas hypoxemia would be reversed with positive pressure ventilation. The many important uncertainties surrounding the epidemiological consequences of the proposed broadening of the criteria for ARDS should be the focus of future research, which may lead to further refinement.

### Definitions and epidemiology of the chronically critically ill [^111VmUM6]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Patients who are chronically critically ill constitute 5–10% of patients with acute respiratory failure but demand a disproportionate share of ICU resources. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials require definitions for enrollment, and a uniform definition would be ideal to allow comparisons between studies. While a consensus definition exists (≥ 21 consecutive days of mechanical ventilation for ≥ 6 h/d), many study designs have required alternative definitions that include requirement for a tracheostomy, a different period of mechanical ventilation, or admission to a weaning facility. Regardless of definition, studies have indicated that the incidence of chronic critical illness has doubled in recent decades and may double again in the next decade. The overall 1-year survival for chronically critically ill patients is between 40% and 50%, depending on the cohort studied. New clinical prediction rules have been developed to better identify patients who are at high risk and low risk of death. These models could be enhanced by data on functional outcomes for survivors. The healthcare system has been adapting to the increase in chronic critical illness by increasing critical beds in short-term and long-term acute care hospitals, but continued monitoring of resources will be necessary, since the prevalence of chronic critical illness is expected to increase further.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^116kDUKW]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening form of respiratory failure that affects approximately 200 000 patients each year in the United States, resulting in nearly 75 000 deaths annually. Globally, ARDS accounts for 10% of intensive care unit admissions, representing more than 3 million patients with ARDS annually.

Objective

To review advances in diagnosis and treatment of ARDS over the last 5 years.

Evidence Review

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2012 to 2017 focusing on randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines. Articles were identified for full text review with manual review of bibliographies generating additional references.

Findings

After screening 1662 citations, 31 articles detailing major advances in the diagnosis or treatment of ARDS were selected. The Berlin definition proposed 3 categories of ARDS based on the severity of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (Pao2/Fio2 ≤ 100 mm Hg), along with explicit criteria related to timing of the syndrome's onset, origin of edema, and the chest radiograph findings. The Berlin definition has significantly greater predictive validity for mortality than the prior American-European Consensus Conference definition. Clinician interpretation of the origin of edema and chest radiograph criteria may be less reliable in making a diagnosis of ARDS. The cornerstone of management remains mechanical ventilation, with a goal to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Aspirin was not effective in preventing ARDS in patients at high-risk for the syndrome. Adjunctive interventions to further minimize VILI, such as prone positioning in patients with a Pao2/Fio2 ratio less than 150 mm Hg, were associated with a significant mortality benefit whereas others (eg, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal) remain experimental. Pharmacologic therapies such as β2 agonists, statins, and keratinocyte growth factor, which targeted pathophysiologic alterations in ARDS, were not beneficial and demonstrated possible harm. Recent guidelines on mechanical ventilation in ARDS provide evidence-based recommendations related to 6 interventions, including low tidal volume and inspiratory pressure ventilation, prone positioning, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, higher vs lower positive end-expiratory pressure, lung recruitment maneuvers, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Conclusions and Relevance

The Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome addressed limitations of the American-European Consensus Conference definition, but poor reliability of some criteria may contribute to underrecognition by clinicians. No pharmacologic treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have been shown to be effective, and management remains supportive with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Guidelines on mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome can assist clinicians in delivering evidence-based interventions that may lead to improved outcomes.

How Will the Global Definition Shape Intervention Trials?

The recognition of the category of nonintubated patients with ARDS will facilitate earlier inclusion of patients into intervention trials. Based on preclinical data and the experience with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), this may allow for more beneficial effects of pharmacological interventions. Simultaneously, the included population may become even more heterogeneous. Thus, such a broadened definition should be accompanied by a form of phenotyping within trials to reduce clinical, physiological, or biological heterogeneity. Indeed, inclusion of patients with respiratory failure because of a single pathogen was part of the recipe for success in COVID-19 trials. For nonpharmacological interventions such as ventilation strategies and extracorporeal support, the global definition will likely have fewer consequences, as these interventions are typically linked to the type of respiratory support.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome 40 years later: time to revisit its definition [^1132eGg9]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a common disorder associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The aim of this article is to critically evaluate the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and examine the impact the definition has on clinical practice and research.

Data Sources

Articles from a MEDLINE search (1950 to August 2007) using the Medical Subject Heading respiratory distress syndrome, adult, diagnosis, limited to the English language and human subjects, their relevant bibliographies, and personal collections, were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome is important to researchers, clinicians, and administrators alike. It has evolved significantly over the last 40 years, culminating in the American-European Consensus Conference definition, which was published in 1994. Although the American-European Consensus Conference definition is widely used, it has some important limitations that may impact on the conduct of clinical research, on resource allocation, and ultimately on the bedside management of such patients. These limitations stem partially from the fact that as defined, acute respiratory distress syndrome is a heterogeneous entity and also involve the reliability and validity of the criteria used in the definition. This article critically evaluates the American-European Consensus Conference definition and its limitations. Importantly, it highlights how these limitations may contribute to clinical trials that have failed to detect a potential true treatment effect. Finally, recommendations are made that could be considered in future definition modifications with an emphasis on the significance of accurately identifying the target population in future trials and subsequently in clinical care.

Conclusion

How acute respiratory distress syndrome is defined has a significant impact on the results of randomized, controlled trials and epidemiologic studies. Changes to the current American-European Consensus Conference definition are likely to have an important role in advancing the understanding and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1124fNR6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to lung inflammation, not caused by cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It was first described in 1967, and in 1988, a more explicit clinical definition quantified the severity of physiologic respiratory impairment (the lung injury score). Since then, the clinical definition of ARDS has been revised, first by an American–European consensus conference convened in 1992 by the American Thoracic Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and subsequently by the ARDS Definition Task Force convened in Berlin in 2012 by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Each revision of the definition was made with the goal of providing a definition that would consistently and accurately identify patients with similar characteristics for clinical care and epidemiological, observational, and interventional research studies. Although the Berlin definition of ARDS was a major step forward, some of its limitations were recognized soon after publication. Specifically, it was recognized that its requirement for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive ventilation could not be met in settings in which these modalities are not available.

In the decade since the Berlin definition was published, several developments in the management and study of ARDS have prompted consideration of an expansion of the Berlin definition. First, noninvasive pulse oximetric methods for evaluating oxygenation criteria for ARDS have been validated and applied in observational studies and clinical trials. Second, the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) to manage severe hypoxemic respiratory failure increased after the publication of the FLORALI (Clinical Effect of the Association of Noninvasive Ventilation and High Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy in Resuscitation of Patients With Acute Lung Injury) trial in 2015, and its use became widespread during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who are managed with HFNO do not meet the Berlin definition of ARDS, which requires invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation with a minimum of 5 cm H 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Third, the Berlin definition is problematic in resource-limited settings because chest radiography, arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements, and mechanical ventilation are not always available. These limitations led to the proposed Kigali modification of the Berlin definition for resource-limited settings; however, the Kigali modification has not been formally incorporated into the current ARDS definition. Finally, ultrasound imaging is increasingly used in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, sometimes supplanting traditional chest radiography.

### Rethinking acute respiratory distress syndrome after COVID-19: If a "Better" definition is the answer, what is the question? [^116UVJog]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has a somewhat controversial history, with some even questioning the need for the term "ARDS". This controversy has been amplified by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic given the marked increase in the incidence of ARDS, the relatively new treatment modalities that do not fit neatly with the Berlin definition, and the difficulty of making the diagnosis in resource-limited settings. We propose that attempts to revise the definition of ARDS should apply the framework originally developed by psychologists and social scientists and used by other medical disciplines to generate and assess definitions of clinical syndromes that do not have gold standards. This framework is structured around measures of reliability, feasibility, and validity. Future revisions of the definition of ARDS should contain the purpose, the methodology, and the framework for empirically testing any proposed definition. Attempts to revise critical illness syndromes' definitions usually hope to make them "better"; our recommendation is that future attempts use the same criteria used by other fields in defining what "better" means.

Discussion

The recommendation for a global definition of ARDS builds on the accepted Berlin definition of ARDS by incorporating changes in clinical practice and scientific evidence and facilitating application in settings with limited access to diagnostic and therapeutic resources, including respiratory support devices, chest radiography, and ABG analysis. In addition, it addresses several limitations of the Berlin definition and expands the ability to study the natural history of ARDS. The major conceptual model for the pathophysiology of ARDS has not changed from the Berlin definition, but minor revisions were made to the conceptual model to emphasize the lack of consistent histological findings or biomarkers for ARDS and the importance of initial clinical management on the basis of the clinical presentation of ARDS. It should also be noted that our ability to distinguish between the specific pathology of ARDS and the more general syndrome of noncardiogenic acute hypoxemic respiratory failure remains limited. The NHLBI has recently funded a consortium of six university centers, including several participating hospitals, to prospectively study the clinical and biological determinants of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis, including longer-term outcomes, a key issue for the broad category of critically ill patients and their caregivers, as recently reviewed.

The proposed global definition of ARDS accounts for the expanding use of noninvasive support for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The category of nonintubated ARDS comprises patients on HFNO or NIV at the time of diagnosis. The committee agreed on a threshold of oxygen delivery of 30 L/min with HFNO because 30 L/min can provide low levels of PEEP.

The Kigali modification is included in the expanded global definition of ARDS for resource-limited settings, which addresses a major limitation of the Berlin definition. The committee also considered whether this modified definition should be universally applicable (i.e. also in settings in which advanced technologies are available). Allowing any respiratory device (rather than requiring HFNO, NIV, or ventilation) is important for resource-limited settings in which advanced respiratory support is not always available. However, the consensus was that allowing any respiratory device in all settings would not support the face validity of ARDS as a syndrome of critical illness, as very mildly hypoxemic patients could be included. To balance the need for a definition that can be applied in various settings while still being broadly acceptable to clinicians and researchers, a separate category for resource-limited settings was created. How the pathophysiology, natural history, and outcomes of ARDS using this global definition compare with those using the Berlin definition will be an important area of prospective research.

### Current incidence and outcome of the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114i7gYc]. Current Opinion in Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute respiratory distress syndrome:

- Definition: ARDS is an acute inflammatory disease of the lungs that develops secondary to pulmonary or extrapulmonary damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to interstitial and alveolar edema. Clinically, ARDS is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, decreased lung compliance, and bilateral radiographic infiltrates in the absence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Pathophysiology: An acute injury to the lungs (direct or indirect) is the most common cause of ARDS, with pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, and sepsis accounting for > 85% of all cases.
- Epidemiology: In the US, the incidence of ARDS is estimated at 64.2–78.9 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- Disease course: Classically, an initial exudative phase with interstitial and alveolar edema is followed by a proliferative phase, which may further progress to a fibrotic phase. The latter is associated with collagen deposition, along with interstitial and alveolar fibrosis, causing decreased lung compliance, respiratory dysfunction, multisystem organ failure, and death.

### The Berlin definition of ARDS: an expanded rationale, justification, and supplementary material [^116svmLQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our objective was to revise the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using a conceptual model incorporating reliability and validity, and a novel iterative approach with formal evaluation of the definition.

Methods

The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine identified three chairs with broad expertise in ARDS who selected the participants and created the agenda. After 2 days of consensus discussions a draft definition was developed, which then underwent empiric evaluation followed by consensus revision.

Results

The Berlin Definition of ARDS maintains a link to prior definitions with diagnostic criteria of timing, chest imaging, origin of edema, and hypoxemia. Patients may have ARDS if the onset is within 1 week of a known clinical insult or new/worsening respiratory symptoms. For the bilateral opacities on chest radiograph criterion, a reference set of chest radiographs has been developed to enhance inter-observer reliability. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure criterion for hydrostatic edema was removed, and illustrative vignettes were created to guide judgments about the primary cause of respiratory failure. If no risk factor for ARDS is apparent, however, objective evaluation (e.g., echocardiography) is required to help rule out hydrostatic edema. A minimum level of positive end-expiratory pressure and mutually exclusive PaO(2)/FiO(2) thresholds were chosen for the different levels of ARDS severity (mild, moderate, severe) to better categorize patients with different outcomes and potential responses to therapy.

Conclusions

This panel addressed some of the limitations of the prior ARDS definition by incorporating current data, physiologic concepts, and clinical trials results to develop the Berlin definition, which should facilitate case recognition and better match treatment options to severity in both research trials and clinical practice.

The panel also discussed the minimum timeframe for which patients must continue to meet criteria for ARDS. Experts agree that ARDS is not a transient phenomenon, but instead is a syndrome that takes days or weeks to resolve. The prevalence of rapidly improving ARDS (P/F > 300 or extubated within the first 24 h after diagnosis) in six ARDS Network trials was > 10% and increased over time. If the subjects in a trial have a very low risk of the condition that the intervention is hypothesized to prevent (e.g. VILI), the trial will not verify the value of the intervention. These data prompt the question of how long diagnostic criteria must be present before patients can be diagnosed with ARDS. Experts agreed that some minimum period of stabilization and stability prior to diagnosing ARDS is likely appropriate; however, the length of this period remains uncertain. A long stabilization period would increase specificity but prevent early therapeutic interventions. Since oxygenation can be affected by clinical interventions and ventilator settings, experts have considered whether oxygenation failure in ARDS should be judged using standardized ventilator settings, which could identify higher risk patients but may add further feasibility challenges to trial enrollment and may not confer additional clinical advantages.

The expert panel noted the disconnect between the conceptual model of ARDS — a specific type of inflammation and host response to injury — and the lack of measures of inflammation in ARDS definitions. This disconnect is due to insufficient data on operating characteristics or poor feasibility of direct measures of pulmonary inflammation or immune response. While some successes have been documented with the application of sub-phenotypes of ARDS (see Domain 2), much work remains to be done to harmonize a clinically feasible definition with the conceptual pathophysiological model of ARDS. At the same time the panel discussed whether predictive validity for mortality is the best measure of an ARDS definition. Diagnostic accuracy in ARDS is challenging without a universal reference standard. Future work in refining the ARDS definition should carefully consider other facets of validity as well as reliability. At the same time, we need new prospective observational studies to better categorize patients with acute non-cardiogenic hypoxemic respiratory failure, including ARDS, across a broad range of characteristics, including imaging and biomarkers, with the goal of developing more personalized treatments. Until such information becomes available, clinicians may at times wish to use the broader umbrella syndrome of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure when deciding to implement certain therapeutic strategies, particularly those that are not directed against specific ARDS mechanisms.

### The Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome: should patients receiving high-flow nasal oxygen be included? [^114bukcg]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The 2012 Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) provided validated support for three levels of initial arterial hypoxaemia that correlated with mortality in patients receiving ventilatory support. Since 2015, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has become widely used as an effective therapeutic support for acute respiratory failure, most recently in patients with severe COVID-19. We propose that the Berlin definition of ARDS be broadened to include patients treated with HFNO of at least 30 L/min who fulfil the other criteria for the Berlin definition of ARDS. An expanded definition would make the diagnosis of ARDS more widely applicable, allowing patients at an earlier stage of the syndrome to be recognised, independent of the need for endotracheal intubation or positive-pressure ventilation, with benefits for the testing of early interventions and the study of factors associated with the course of ARDS. We identify key questions that could be addressed in refining an expanded definition of ARDS, the implementation of which could lead to improvements in clinical practice and clinical outcomes for patients.

### From Berlin to global: the need for syndromic definitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1138GQiM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

If some of the changes proposed by the global definition do increase the heterogeneity of patients labeled as having ARDS, will this be problematic? After all, the syndrome's notorious heterogeneity has already made it difficult to find effective therapies in clinical trials. However, most landmark trials have used stringent clinical criteria to test interventions only on subsets of patients with ARDS (enrichment). Even in patients on IMV, there is evidence of a heterogeneous inflammatory response associated with different mortality outcomes and treatment effects. As such, some upcoming trials of ARDS are designed around biological phenotypes of ARDS, aiming to recruit those most likely to benefit from specific interventions (predictive enrichment). Perhaps recruitment of patients with nonintubated ARDS will enable interventional studies that affect progression to IMV, a key outcome especially where resources are constrained.

Will this global definition be the final ARDS definition? Likely not. Rigorous studies testing the implementation, reliability, and validity of the global definition versus the Berlin criteria are needed to inform intensivists and inspire future modifications. More fundamentally, in a decade or two, we may have moved beyond syndromic concepts in favor of treatable traits — that is, specific patterns of biological derangements that appear across syndromic definitions and have discrete responses to therapeutic interventions (Figure 1). Critical care is on the cusp of an era of precision medicine, resulting from advances in omics science, data science, and machine learning, which have led to a new understanding of shared molecular host response signatures across a variety of critical illness syndromes. But although we hold such a future in sight, it remains aspirational. For now, the updated ARDS definition better reflects the current care of patients with acute lung injury in diverse settings and should enable progress toward better outcomes for our patients around the world.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^117KyKpF]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a pandemic, resulting in unprecedented pressure on healthcare systems globally. Although most patients present with mild symptoms including fever and malaise, 8–32% of patients presenting to hospital may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), depending on the admission criteria and available resources, with an ICU mortality of 34–50%.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory failure (C-ARF) who are admitted to the ICU with hypoxaemia typically require some form of respiratory support. COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may differ from other causes of ARDS, since patients may present with profound hypoxaemia accompanied by a wide range of respiratory compliance. However, whether ARDS due to COVID-19 is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS remains a matter of debate. Consequently, there is no uniform agreement on the optimal management of respiratory failure, including the most appropriate oxygenation and ventilation strategies that limit or prevent additional lung injury or other complications in these patients.

There are few published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) related to the respiratory management of C-ARF. As a result, clinical practice variations in the management of C-ARF exist, making the optimal therapeutic management unclear. Given the dearth of evidence, we aimed to achieve agreement on the respiratory management of C-ARF using a Delphi process, defined by at least 70% agreement among experts who met pre-specified qualification criteria.

### Novel phenotypes in respiratory failure: same as It ever was [^115faL28]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A central challenge in clinical studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is its inherent heterogeneity. As documented in the landmark LUNG SAFE (Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure) trial, patients with ARDS present with a spectrum of abnormalities in gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, a spectrum of clinical severity, and a spectrum of outcomes. Indeed, for this reason the Berlin definition of ARDS has been criticized as being overly broad. A major focus of ARDS clinical research has therefore been identification of subphenotypes or endotypes within ARDS that can be used to design trials and tailor treatment. To date, however, no subphenotype has been demonstrated to predict treatment response or improve outcomes in a prospective trial. Crucially, despite its limitations, the Berlin definition does identify populations of patients that benefit from particular treatments. Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation, when applied to the broad population who meet the Berlin definition, reduces mortality. This is likely true even in the setting of relatively normal respiratory system mechanics. For example, a reanalysis of ARMA (Ventilation with Lower Tidal Volumes as Compared with Traditional Tidal Volumes for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) trial data by Hager and colleagues showed that reduced Vis associated with reduced mortality even when plateau pressures (Pplats) are not high. In the two decades since the publication of that landmark trial, initial suspicion of low Vventilation has therefore given way to widespread consensus that most patients with ARDS by the Berlin definition benefit from a lung-protective approach.

### Pitfalls of acute respiratory distress syndrome diagnosis based on interventions [^111JSLwD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the newly proposed global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by Matthay and colleagues. However, we believe that the new definition is still subject to some limitations of the Berlin definition.

Apart from the original intubated ARDS category, the authors recommended including patients requiring a minimum degree of respiratory support with either high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation under the new category of nonintubated ARDS. Nevertheless, we believe that the idea of defining a clinical syndrome on the basis of use of and/or response to therapeutic intervention is incorrect, although not confined to the definition of ARDS only, because it should be based on two premises. First, all patients with ARDS should have equal access to the specified therapeutic intervention. Second, all treating physicians should comply with the same strategy regarding the specified therapeutic intervention. When applying the above two premises to patients with ARDS, this means that all patients with ARDS should have the same chance of receiving the same respiratory support (including high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation), and all intensive care physicians should set the same positive end-expiratory pressure or the minimum flow level in the same patient. Obviously, none of the above premises is true, indicating that the preference of treating physicians (with regard to when and how to use respiratory support) may have an impact on whether the patient could be diagnosed with ARDS.

The proposed modified definition for resource-limited settings does not solve the above problem. For example, a patient with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is treated with awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but breathing room air. This patient does not meet either the Berlin definition or the new global definition. In this way, shall we propose another ARDS category to include patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation? Or shall we include another category whenever a new respiratory support comes into clinical practice?

The conceptual model defines ARDS as an acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury, leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue. Unfortunately, there are no diagnostic criteria with regard to the above physiological derangements, despite the use of surrogate markers only, in either the Berlin definition or the newly proposed global definition of ARDS.

### Identification of persistent and resolving subphenotypes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in two independent cohorts [^114GZeuP]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) is associated with extended hospital length of stay, functional disability, and increased mortality, but care remains supportive. One challenge in identifying effective therapeutics for a broadly defined syndrome like acute HRF is heterogeneity in treatment response and prognosis. Defining reliable subsets of patients with high likelihood of disease-related events or differential treatment responses (often termed subphenotypes) can help target clinical care and trial enrollment to patients most likely to benefit. Previous efforts to identify subphenotypes of respiratory failure have largely centered on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which represents less than a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation, and two-thirds of patients with acute HRF. Reliably diagnosing ARDS is also challenging, largely driven by variability in the interpretation and sensitivity of the chest radiograph. As such, characterizing subphenotypes of acute HRF is a newly identified research priority by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute with potential to expand inclusion criteria for trials.

One area of heterogeneity in HRF is the early clinical trajectory. The majority of patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation are weaned off within three days, while others may develop worsening lung injury and/or excessive fibroproliferation contributing to prolonged need for mechanical ventilation and hypoxemia. Using trajectories of clinical and biologic data to classify subphenotypes has helped identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes in such heterogeneous conditions as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury, and can help determine early biologic events that contribute to subsequent clinical course.

Our overall goal was to define and characterize a novel subphenotype of acute HRF using persistence of respiratory failure at day 3 following the initiation of mechanical ventilation (persistent HRF). The primary objective of this study was to estimate mortality of patients with persistent HRF compared to patients whose respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation resolves (resolving HRF). The secondary objective was to compare circulating biomarkers previously linked to severity and outcomes in lung injury and profile the early biologic differences between patients with persistent and resolving HRF. In exploratory analyses, we examined relationships between persistent/resolving HRF and ARDS. In particular, we were interested in characterizing the clinical and biologic features of patients with acute HRF who do not fulfill ARDS criteria, a population that is relatively understudied.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113BKBJb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

For clinical trials, investigators may elect more stringent criteria for enrollment for prognostic enrichment. For example, if there is concern that including patients on HFNO will select for less severely ill patients, investigators may choose to limit their study populations to moderate to severe intubated ARDS. Conversely, investigators who choose to focus on preventing progression to mechanical ventilation may elect to enroll only patients in the nonintubated ARDS category. This proposed definition lends flexibility to the investigation of ARDS and opens important avenues for prospective study (Table 3).

Several additional topics that were considered by the committee but not included in the final global definition merit discussion. First, underrecognition of ARDS is a common problem with the Berlin definition. In LUNG SAFE (Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure), 20% of patients with severe ARDS and up to 50% of those with mild ARDS were not recognized as having ARDS. Clearly the revised definition needs a similar evaluation for reliability.

Second, because ARDS is a dynamic syndrome where some patients improve rapidly whereas others may have protracted courses, investigators may choose to focus on subjects with a diagnosis of ARDS that persists beyond 24 hours if they wish to exclude rapidly improving patients from their study population.

Third, the global definition also does not capture differences in the long-term functional outcomes of patients with ARDS. Although the committee acknowledges the importance of long-term outcomes in ARDS, they are not a fundamental component of the initial diagnosis. The long-term outcomes of patients with diagnoses of ARDS using the new global definition of ARDS should be prioritized in prospective epidemiological studies.

Last, developments in ARDS subphenotyping, specifically latent class analysis–based hyper- and hypo-inflammatory phenotypes based on plasma biomarkers and clinical data, were not integrated into the current definition (,–). Although these phenotypes have been demonstrated across multiple clinical trial populations and observational cohorts, prospective validation with point-of-care biomarker platforms is needed to determine if these phenotypes are unique to ARDS or have broader applicability to sepsis, and how they may affect management.

Pulmonary shock — definition of acute pulmonary failure: The contemporary definition of acute pulmonary failure is the short-term (hours to days) inability of the respiratory system to maintain either an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of at least 60 mm Hg or an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg, according to demands of cellular metabolism at sea level.

### The global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome: ready for prime time? [^111bCXS8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Is This the End of the Berlin Definition for ARDS?

Rather than a new definition, the global definition is an extension of Berlin. The intubated category retains the Pa O 2 /F O 2 severity cutoffs described before but allows the use of Sp O 2 /F O 2 when no arterial blood gas measurement is available. It adds two new categories, nonintubated ARDS and ARDS in resource-limited settings, that would otherwise not be classified as ARDS. Because the global definition is not formally endorsed by any of the scientific societies, it should not replace Berlin. Yet, it would also be detrimental to work with multiple ARDS definitions. Therefore, to ensure comparability, we strongly encourage that authors keep reporting effect estimates for patients fulfilling Berlin criteria, even when a broader population is included. A formal redefinition is very much needed and will benefit from the proposed global definition and the research that will follow.

To conclude, the proposed global definition of ARDS extends the criteria formulated in the Berlin definition and will broaden the population on a global scale. There are important uncertainties surrounding the epidemiological consequences of these changes, which require close inspection and further research. Formal reformulation of the ARDS definition through scientific societies will need to follow.

Domain 1: ARDS definition

ARDS was first described in 1967 by Ashbaugh and colleagues in 12 patients with new onset hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and reduced respiratory system compliance. Inflammation, edema, and hyaline membranes were uniformly present in lungs of non-survivors. Subsequently, diagnosis of ARDS evolved from informal pattern recognition to formalized clinical definitions. The Lung Injury Score, proposed in 1988 was supplanted in 1994 by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition, and further updated by an ESICM-sponsored process leading to the 2012 'Berlin Definition'. As part of these 2023 ESICM ARDS Treatment Guidelines, experts from the Definition Domain were charged with highlighting issues that should be addressed in subsequent revisions, based on knowledge accrued in the last decade which may be relevant to the current ARDS definition.

- The categories of acute respiratory distress syndrome laid out by the Berlin definition may be associated with increased extravascular lung water and pulmonary microvascular permeability, which is the hallmark of lung pathophysiology.

- The categories of the Berlin definition of disease progression are also associated with the severity of physiological derangements and the incidence of organ failure.

### Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, incidence, and epidemiology: proceedings from the pediatric acute lung injury consensus conference [^112bDb8a]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although there are similarities in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults and children, pediatric-specific practice patterns, comorbidities, and differences in outcome necessitate a pediatric-specific definition. We sought to create such a definition.

Design

A subgroup of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome investigators who drafted a pediatric-specific definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome based on consensus opinion and supported by detailed literature review tested elements of the definition with patient data from previously published investigations.

Settings

International PICUs.

Subjects

Children enrolled in published investigations of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Several aspects of the proposed pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome definition align with the Berlin Definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: timing of acute respiratory distress syndrome after a known risk factor, the potential for acute respiratory distress syndrome to coexist with left ventricular dysfunction, and the importance of identifying a group of patients at risk to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There are insufficient data to support any specific age for "adult" acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with "pediatric" acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, children with perinatal-related respiratory failure should be excluded from the definition of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Larger departures from the Berlin Definition surround 1) simplification of chest imaging criteria to eliminate bilateral infiltrates; 2) use of pulse oximetry-based criteria when PaO2 is unavailable; 3) inclusion of oxygenation index and oxygen saturation index instead of PaO2/FIO2 ratio with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure level for invasively ventilated patients; 4) and specific inclusion of children with preexisting chronic lung disease or cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Conclusions

This pediatric-specific definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome builds on the adult-based Berlin Definition, but has been modified to account for differences between adults and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We propose using this definition for future investigations and clinical care of children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and encourage external validation with the hope for continued iterative refinement of the definition.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: the Berlin definition [^115CVfds]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined in 1994 by the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC); since then, issues regarding the reliability and validity of this definition have emerged. Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance (≤ 40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure (≥ 10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute (≥ 10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27%; 95% CI, 24%-30%; 32%; 95% CI, 29%-34%; and 45%; 95% CI, 42%-48%, respectively; P < .001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2–11; 7 days; IQR, 4–14; and 9 days; IQR, 5–17, respectively; P < .001). Compared with the AECC definition, the final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.577 (95% CI, 0.561–0.593) vs 0.536 (95% CI, 0.520–0.553; P < .001). This updated and revised Berlin Definition for ARDS addresses a number of the limitations of the AECC definition. The approach of combining consensus discussions with empirical evaluation may serve as a model to create more accurate, evidence-based, critical illness syndrome definitions and to better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

There is an urgent need for RCTs that compare HFNO to NIV/CPAP for patients with AHRF using important endpoints such as mortality, intubation, and total duration of mechanical ventilation. Long-term patient follow-up and cognitive and function outcomes assessments would enable determination of whether observed differences in short-term outcomes (e.g. intubation) are associated with long-term impairment in survivors.

### Weaning from noninvasive respiratory support in children in acute settings: expert consensus statement using modified Delphi methodology [^1169R4Wa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To reach a consensus on the definition and modalities of weaning from noninvasive ventilation in acute settings.

Design

A modified Delphi survey using closed and open-ended questions.

Setting

Three rounds of consensus determination were sent via electronic mail survey to 33 experts. The survey questionnaire had four sections: definition of weaning, definition of weaning failure, criteria to initiate weaning, and modalities of weaning. Questions where agreement had been reached on round 1 were no longer part of the survey in rounds 2 and 3.

Subjects

Twenty-five international experts from 10 countries.

Measurement and Main Results

Overall, this survey generated positive consensus from experts for 19/35 statements (9 with strong agreement and 10 with weak agreement) about weaning from noninvasive respiratory support. No negative consensus could be identified.

Conclusion

The clinical practice statements issued address important aspects of definition of weaning, definition of weaning failure, criteria to initiate weaning, and modalities of weaning in acute settings.

### Evaluating construct validity of computable acute respiratory distress syndrome definitions in adults hospitalized with COVID-19: an electronic health records based approach [^1147D6qU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common form of hypoxemic respiratory failure with high mortality but few treatments. The high resource utilization and overall burden of the condition was underscored by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has been the most common cause of ARDS and respiratory failure in recent years. Scaling ARDS research and surveillance to advance treatment is challenging, because the consensus Berlin definition for the syndrome is complex, subjective, and often demands manual ascertainment. Developing an ARDS definition that is computable in electronic health records (EHR) can enable efficient, reproducible case identification, as research networks and care quality monitoring organizations increasingly use electronically computable definitions to facilitate clinical data collection, track public health case counts, and ensure appropriate care delivery. Rapid case identification is especially critical for pandemic preparedness, guiding resource allocation and care decisions.

However, the construct validity of the Berlin definition (extent to which the construct captures what it claims to) has been called into question with the evolving epidemiology and treatment of respiratory failure during COVID-19. There is ongoing discussion about how criteria might be modified to better reflect contemporary management and capture key outcomes. To address these gaps our primary aim was to develop a computable ARDS definition consistent with Berlin criteria (EHR-Berlin), and evaluate two indices of construct validity: criterion validity (degree to which the construct compares to accepted standards) and predictive validity (degree to which the construct predicts relevant outcomes). We hypothesized the EHR-Berlin definition would have high concordance (Cohen's kappa > 0.80) with classification made by expert clinicians (manual-Berlin), and at least moderate correlations with outcomes (Pearson | r | > 0.3, a threshold used for many pulmonary research instruments). Our secondary aim was to assess how changing timing, oxygenation, and imaging criteria affected the predictive validity of ARDS classification, hypothesizing that expanding criteria can maintain similar relationships to outcomes.

### Acute respiratory failure in COVID-19: is it "typical" ARDS? [^116A8e5N]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), broke out in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a significant threat to international health. COVID-19 was of clustering onset and mainly affected the respiratory system with some patients rapidly progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); other organ functions were less involved. These patients were likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and might die. The elderly and those with comorbidities are at highest risk of death. The death appeared to be related to ARDS. Although several studies have reported the clinical features of COVID-19, our understanding about it remains limited. Can we consider all the cases of acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 as ARDS? The answer is probably no. Based on current reports and our experience in the management of COVID-19-related ARDS patients, we realized that there are many differences between COVID-19-related ARDS and ARDS caused by other factors as defined by Berlin criteria, and therefore differences in treatment. Thus, we aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences (Fig. 1).

Acute respiratory failure categories in COPD exacerbations — criteria are specified as follows: No respiratory failure includes respiratory rate ≤ 24 breaths per minute, heart rate < 95 beats per minute, no use of accessory respiratory muscles, no changes in mental status, hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask 24–35% inspired oxygen (FiO2), and no increase in PaCO2. Acute respiratory failure – non-life-threatening includes respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute with use of accessory respiratory muscles, no change in mental status, hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask > 35% FiO2, and hypercarbia with PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated 50–60 mmHg. Acute respiratory failure – life-threatening includes respiratory rate > 24 breaths per minute with use of accessory respiratory muscles, acute changes in mental status, hypoxemia not improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask or requiring FiO2 > 40%, and hypercarbia with PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated > 60 mmHg or the presence of acidosis with pH ≤ 7.25.

### Rethinking acute respiratory distress syndrome after COVID-19: If a "Better" definition is the answer, what is the question? [^114qTtVk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Predictive validity

Predictive validity has received a great deal of attention since its use in the Berlin definition addressing the severity subcategories for ARDS. It is crucial to distinguish predictive validation from prediction. The predictive validity analysis in the Berlin consensus conference picked between two proposed definitions of severe ARDS. As a prediction tool for mortality, the Berlin definition with three P:F strata performs poorly. A definition for ARDS incorporating age, risk factors, and other organ failures would predict mortality significantly better than the Berlin definition. So predictive accuracy is not the goal of predictive validity.

Furthermore, just because P:F was selected using a predictive validity framework does not necessarily mean it is a "better" definition; it simply means it was picked using prespecified criteria to define "better". The alternative Berlin definition for severe ARDS, which included compliance and a marker for dead space, might have been a better choice if the goal were face validity or if the goal were to encourage physicians to consider physiology more in clinical management.

Some studies incorporate predictive validity hypotheses without acknowledging them, as for example the observation that patients with AHRF, regardless of whether they meet ARDS criteria, have similar mortality. In these studies, the only criterion separating AHRF from ARDS is a compatible CXR. In the framework proposed here, we would say that these data demonstrate that CXR lacks predictive validity for mortality. Of course, this observation alone does not mean that CXR should be removed from the definition. It may be an important part of face validity, as ARDS is considered as a diffuse inflammatory process, and all of the clinical data used to arrive at this conclusion were obtained from patients with ARDS who were enrolled using a definition that incorporated the CXR criterion.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: first update [^113YNoab]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Definitions of severe and critical COVID-19 — adult criteria: Severe disease involves clinical signs of pneumonia plus one of the following thresholds or conditions — respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation < 90% on room air. Critical disease is defined by the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome or respiratory failure requiring ventilation, sepsis, or septic shock.

### Definitions, guidelines and opinions: the white, the black and the Grey [^113k46dC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Due to demographic reasons, I have had the opportunity to participate in all the international consensus conferences, up to Berlin, for the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the development of guidelines for its management. The current tendency is to simplify both the definition and the management approach, primarily focussing on oxygenation or haemoglobin oxygen saturation, whilst other physiological variables, as respiratory mechanics or haemodynamics, are downplayed or ignored. It is, therefore, worthwhile to question the real value of guidelines in defining and managing ARDS, especially today when two leading societies have issued markedly different recommendations for three key aspects: positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) selection, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) indications, and use of neuromuscular blockade. Before addressing these issues, it is crucial to reflect on the value of guidelines in managing syndromes such as ARDS, which is a collection of signs and symptoms with various causes and not a single disease.

Guidelines are a collaborative effort by experts who, through a combination of scientific evidence and personal opinions, produce recommendations. The generation of evidence relies heavily on the analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs), and methods like the Delphi technique for consensus building, culminating in a "democratic" vote. Consequently, the limitations of clinical trials become the limitations of the evidence, and the democratic process generates the majority's opinion, not necessarily the truth. The major limitations of RCTs in providing scientific evidence are clear: they typically include a small fraction of screened patients (about 10%) and overlook fundamental aspects of medicine such as patient history, age, prior health status, and comorbidities, which are theoretically neutralised by randomisation. Identical entry criteria in sepsis studies led to mortality rates ranging from 25% to 60%, in supposedly similar populations. Unfortunately, current thinking often ignores these limitations, and RCTs and meta-analyses remains "dogmatic". The production of "evidence" has become a profession and an industry, characterised by rising costs, and rules dictated by professional trialists. Consequently, common clinical sense is sometimes lost.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115b69ep]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Since publication of the 2012 Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), several developments have supported the need for an expansion of the definition, including the use of high-flow nasal oxygen, the expansion of the use of pulse oximetry in place of arterial blood gases, the use of ultrasound for chest imaging, and the need for applicability in resource-limited settings. Methods: A consensus conference of 32 critical care ARDS experts was convened, had six virtual meetings (June 2021 to March 2022), and subsequently obtained input from members of several critical care societies. The goal was to develop a definition that would 1) identify patients with the currently accepted conceptual framework for ARDS, 2) facilitate rapid ARDS diagnosis for clinical care and research, 3) be applicable in resource-limited settings, 4) be useful for testing specific therapies, and 5) be practical for communication to patients and caregivers. Results: The committee made four main recommendations: 1) include high-flow nasal oxygen with a minimum flow rate of ⩾30L/min; 2) use Pa O2 :Fi O2 ≤ 300mmHg or oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry Sp O2 :Fi O2 ≤ 315 (if oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry is ≤ 97%) to identify hypoxemia; 3) retain bilateral opacities for imaging criteria but add ultrasound as an imaging modality, especially in resource-limited areas; and 4) in resource-limited settings, do not require positive end-expiratory pressure, oxygen flow rate, or specific respiratory support devices. Conclusions: We propose a new global definition of ARDS that builds on the Berlin definition. The recommendations also identify areas for future research, including the need for prospective assessments of the feasibility, reliability, and prognostic validity of the proposed global definition.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1173QUDw]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Definitions

ARDS was first reported in a case series from Denver in 1967. The American European Consensus Conference (AECC) 1994 defined ARDS as ' an acute inflammatory syndrome manifesting as diffuse pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure that cannot be explained by, but may co-exist with, left-sided heart failure '. In 2012, the AECC definition was re-evaluated and minor alterations were proposed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine ARDS Definition Task Force. This iteration recognised 3 grades of severity depending on the degree of hypoxaemia and stipulated the application of at least 5 cmH 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure. This so-called Berlin definition was validated using retrospective cohorts and captures patients with a mortality of 24% in patients with mild ARDS, rising to 48% in the group of patients with the most severe respiratory failure.

A four-point lung injury scoring system (Murray Score or LIS) is the most widely used means of quantifying ARDS severity. It is based on the level of PEEP, the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), the dynamic lung compliance and the degree of radiographic infiltration. Although the LIS has been widely used in clinical studies and a score of > 3.0 is commonly used as a qualifying threshold for support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), it cannot predict outcome during the first 24–72 hours of ARDS. When the scoring system is used 4–7 days after the onset of the syndrome, scores of 2.5 or higher predicted a complicated course requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.

As a syndrome rather than a disease, there is no laboratory, imaging or other 'gold standard' diagnostic investigation for ARDS. Therefore like acute kidney injury (AKI), ARDS is caused by a huge range of conditions and as a consequence patients with ARDS are heterogeneous. The outcome of these patients is determined by the underlying causes of ARDS, patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, clinical management and the severity of illness.

### Risk of readmission and mortality following hospitalization with hypercapnic respiratory failure [^115brhLM]. Lung (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypercapnic respiratory failure:

- Definition: Hypercapnic respiratory failure (type II respiratory failure) is a state of reduced alveolar ventilation with subsequent respiratory acidosis (PaCO₂ > 50 mmHg).
- Pathophysiology: Hypercapnic respiratory failure is most frequently caused by drug overdose, COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and the overlap syndrome of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.
- Epidemiology: The overall prevalence of hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with severe COPD is approximately 25%.
- Disease course: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure develops rapidly (within minutes to hours). Clinical manifestations include increasing dyspnea, lethargy, hypoxemic, disorientation, tachycardia, altered mental status, hypoventilation, hyperinflation, and need for ventilatory support. The disease decreases the QoL with increased risk of readmission and longer periods of hospital stay.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Hypercapnic respiratory failure in hospitalized patients is associated with significant mortality (36%).

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117BGe46]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Grading of certainty and strength of recommendations — definitions used in this guideline are as follows: High certainty is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect". Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimate effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different". Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". For recommendation strength, Strong means "Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", whereas Conditional means "Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty".

### Acute respiratory failure in the elderly [^11472RoF]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

With the current epidemiology of a growing advanced-age population and the specificities of critical illness in elderly patients, studies on this topic are appropriate. We need more clinical trials and evaluations of diagnostic and management procedures applied in the elderly, as well as studies designed to identify prognostic factors for inhospital mortality or mortality in the intensive care unit in the elderly. Studies evaluating long-term outcomes, including quality of life and costs, are also needed to try to define realistic goals for patients, families and physicians.

### From Berlin to global: the need for syndromic definitions of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116ytVy4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Perhaps the most fundamental change in the proposed global definition of ARDS comes from allowing patients on HFNO of ⩾30 L/min to now be eligible for the diagnosis. Some say that such broadening of the definition will threaten the validity of this already heterogeneous syndrome. After all, F O 2 delivered with HFNO is imprecise, and positive end-expiratory pressure is unknown. Yet clinically, Ms. B's incipient lung injury likely was recognized when her oxygen requirements began to escalate; intubation was simply a process of care in a trajectory of progressive respiratory failure. One clinician might have chosen to initiate IMV on Day 2, reasoning that her rapid decline suggested that she would not sustain respiration on HFNO for long, whereas another chose to wait until Day 4. Should this difference in practice alter the time of her ARDS diagnosis by 2 days? Did the biological process of increased alveolar–capillary permeability, resulting in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, begin only when IMV was initiated? If not, might earlier treatment be more effective than waiting until the horse has left the barn? Before the increase in the use of HFNO spurred by the FLORALI (Clinical Effect of the Association of Noninvasive Ventilation and High Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy in Resuscitation of Patients With Acute Lung Injury: A Randomised Study) trial and then the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Ms. B would have been just as likely to receive noninvasive ventilation and qualify for ARDS under the Berlin criteria on the basis of geographical practice preferences. The pandemic also showed that the mortality of patients on HFNO who would have otherwise met the Berlin criteria for ARDS is similar to that of patients with Berlin-defined ARDS on noninvasive ventilation. Thus, although the global definition's inclusion of HFNO may broaden the population with diagnoses of ARDS to some extent, it is largely catching up to clinical practice by acknowledging that typical care has fundamentally changed since the Berlin criteria were introduced in 2012.

### In pursuit of microbiome-based therapies for acute respiratory failure [^114dmfUW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, the study by Kitsios and colleagues not only validates earlier work showing that a respiratory ecosystem that lacks microbial diversity and is dominated by host pathogens is associated with a poor clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory failure, but it also establishes a link between pulmonary dysbiosis and a hyperinflammatory state, which, in turn, is associated with worse outcomes in the critically ill, including ARDS. In the process, the authors have shown that acute respiratory failure, like many other critical illnesses, deserves more precise definitions if targeted therapies are to be identified. Indeed, future therapies for acute respiratory failure including ARDS may either be guided by dysbiosis patterns or may involve direct manipulation of the host's microbiome.

### The global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome: ready for prime time? [^116iT6Yd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Why Extend the Definition to Nonintubated Patients?

With a desire inspired by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic to intervene earlier in the course of ARDS and to include patients on a global scale, trial groups have already started to allow inclusion of patients fulfilling most of the Berlin ARDS criteria but allowing inclusion without a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 5 cm H 2 O, now coined "nonintubated ARDS". This group partly includes patients who received noninvasive ventilation or would be intubated before the widespread use of HFNC and therefore maintains the epidemiological characteristics of ARDS. Indeed, patients who were consequently intubated frequently fulfilled the Berlin ARDS criteria. Yet, HFNC is also applied in other patients with milder lung injury, who would not have progressed to require invasive ventilation. Inclusion of patients on HFNC will therefore result in increased ARDS prevalence. In settings with limited resources, the new global definition for ARDS eliminates the need for both PEEP and a minimum flow rate of oxygen, thereby contributing to an even more diluted characterization of ARDS in such environments. Interestingly, inclusion of this population is in line with the original description by Ashbaugh and colleagues of the syndrome, in which 5 out of 12 patients did not receive invasive mechanical ventilation, and the American-European consensus definition.

### Acute respiratory failure in immunocompromised adults [^111fAaqA]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute respiratory failure occurs in up to half of patients with haematological malignancies and 15% of those with solid tumours or solid organ transplantation. Mortality remains high. Factors associated with mortality include a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, older age, frailty or poor performance status, delayed intensive care unit admission, and acute respiratory failure due to an invasive fungal infection or unknown cause. In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undetermined cause, a standardised diagnostic investigation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments. Collaborative and multidisciplinary clinical and research networks are crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and causation and to develop less invasive diagnostic strategies and more targeted treatment options.

### Population-based incidence estimates of influenza-associated respiratory failure hospitalizations, 2003 to 2009 [^111wxjxv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

The incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure is unknown.

Objectives

To estimate the population-based incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure hospitalizations.

Methods

This is a cohort study from January 2003 through March 2009 using hospitalization databases for Arizona, California, and Washington from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project and influenza surveillance data for regions encompassing these states. Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was defined by International Classification of Diseases-9-CM code. We used negative-binomial regression modeling to estimate the incidence of influenza-associated events.

Measurements and Main Results

The incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure was 2.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.2–23.5), and during the influenza season, 3.8% of all respiratory failure hospitalizations were attributable to influenza. Compared with adults aged 18–49 years, the incidence rate ratio for influenza-associated acute respiratory failure was lower among children aged 1–4 (0.9) and 5–17 years (0.3); however, it was higher among adults aged 50–64 (4.8), 65–74 (10.4), 75–84 (19.9), and 85 years and older (33.7). Results were similar with more sensitive and specific outcome definitions and in a sensitivity analysis using only Arizona-specific outcome and surveillance data.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that influenza was an important contributor to respiratory failure hospitalizations during 2003–2009. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for influenza among hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness when influenza is circulating in a community. Influenza has a greater effect on respiratory failure in the elderly, for whom better prevention measures are needed.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113GYteG]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Non-invasive respiratory support has consistently shown variable efficacy across different scenarios in preventing the harmful effects of invasive ventilation and improving outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure. A thorough assessment of the patients' initial characteristics, combined with close physiological monitoring to adjust settings is essential to tailor a personalized approach and minimize the risk of harm and failure. Importantly, applying non-invasive respiratory support in critically ill patients, particularly those with de novo acute respiratory failure, demands a delicate balance between avoiding invasive ventilation and ensuring timely intubation when clinically indicated.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) clinical definition as context for experimental ALI: ARDS was "Originally described in 1967 as a case series of 12 patients" and has "evolved to the current 2012 Berlin consensus definition" emphasizing "feasibility, reliability, validity and objective evaluation of its performance". The Berlin definition specifies acute onset as "occurring within 7 days of exposure to a recognized predisposing event" and also "categorizes ARDS severity based on physiologic dysfunction or hypoxemia" with more explicit radiographic criteria. For modeling, "small animal models may not replicate all the clinical features of ARDS but are tractable systems" for mechanistic work, whereas "Large animal models are less malleable to mechanistic studies but may reproduce clinical features of ARDS and therefore serve as important models for preclinical therapeutic testing".

### Acute exacerbations of interstitial lung disease: lessons from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^114oLGZ9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD), with a focus on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), in the light of the recently revised definition of acute exacerbation-IPF. Strengths and limitations of the current definition of acute exacerbation-IPF are also discussed.

Recent Findings

Clinically, acute exacerbation-IPFs are highly relevant events with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. A 2016 working group on acute exacerbation-IPF has suggested the definition be widened to include any acute respiratory worsening with new widespread alveolar abnormality on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. Management of acute exacerbation-IPF typically includes supportive care, high-dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite the scarcity of data supporting the usefulness of these therapies. The effect of a number of novel therapeutic approaches is currently under investigation.

Summary

Acute exacerbation-IPF has recently been redefined. A standardized definition, similar to that of other chronic respiratory diseases, will likely facilitate the performance of highly needed studies in acute exacerbation of both IPF and other ILDs.

Methods

Process for Membership

The goal of the organizers of the consensus conference (M. A.M. T.T. and L.B.W.) was to convene a committee of experts representing diverse clinical, geographic, socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and gender backgrounds, as well as a patient advocate. The target committee membership was approximately 30 to ensure that it was large enough to obtain diverse perspectives and small enough to allow meaningful contributions from each member. Members were selected through an informal cascading recruitment process. The conference chairs identified subject area experts, who then recommended other members, considering the stated diversity goals. A total of 32 members were selected and agreed to participate. Only one person who was invited declined to participate. Although this process to achieve diversity and expertise has some limitations, the resulting committee was more diverse and represented more areas of the world than prior groups that developed working definitions of ARDS (see Figure E1 in the online supplement).

Formation of Working Groups and Development of Criteria for an Updated Definition

Potential topics for an expansion of the Berlin definition were proposed during an initial organizational meeting, after which an anonymous survey was distributed to committee members for their vote on which topics should be addressed. The entire committee agreed to establish working groups to address three major areas for potential revision of the Berlin definition (see Appendix E1): 1) risk factors, timing, and extrapulmonary organ involvement; 2) chest imaging; and 3) oxygenation. The committee also agreed that an updated definition of ARDS should meet several criteria: 1) identify patients with characteristics in keeping with the agreed-on conceptual framework of ARDS, 2) facilitate rapid recognition and diagnosis of ARDS for clinical care and research, 3) be applicable in resource-limited settings, 4) be useful for testing specific therapies, and 5) be practical for communication to patients and caregivers.

Data Considered

Several sources of published and unpublished data were used by the working groups on the basis of searches of the National Library of Medicine PubMed database, including recent clinical trials and observational studies (see Appendix E1) Although a formal comprehensive literature review was not completed, which is a limitation, the data considered included recent clinical trials that have influenced clinical practice.

### Severe respiratory failure: advanced treatment options [^114HaHTS]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Severe respiratory failure (including acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome) continues to be associated with significant mortality and morbidity in patients of all ages.

Objective

To review the laboratory and clinical data in support of and future directions for the advanced treatment of severe respiratory failure.

Data Sources

MEDLINE/PubMed search of all relevant primary and review articles.

Data Synthesis

Our understanding of lung pathophysiology and the role of ventilator-induced lung injury through basic science investigation has led to advances in lung protective strategies for the mechanical ventilation support of patients with severe respiratory failure. Specific modalities reviewed include low-tidal volume ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, the open lung approach, recruitment maneuvers, airway pressure release ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, prone positioning, and extracorporeal life support. The pharmacologic strategies (including corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide) investigated for the treatment of severe respiratory failure are also reviewed.

Conclusion

In patients with severe respiratory failure, an incremental approach to the management of severe hypoxemia requires implementation of the strategies reviewed, with knowledge of the evidence base to support these strategies.

### Expert consensus statements for the management of COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure using a Delphi method [^11644tne]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited. Strong evidence from high-quality clinical trials is needed to clarify the remaining uncertainties. While these expert clinical practice statements provide clinical direction with C-ARF, some of these general principles may help with the management of other viral pneumonias or future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 strain.

American College of Physicians high-flow nasal oxygen guideline — scope and target population are defined for patients hospitalized for acute respiratory failure, including those who developed acute respiratory failure while hospitalized, in hospital settings including emergency departments, hospital wards, intermediate or step-down units, and intensive care units (ICUs); the target patient population is adult patients with acute respiratory failure treated in a hospital setting, and the target audience is all clinicians. Public or patient involvement included perspectives, values, and preferences of nonphysician members representing the public and a CGC Public Panel, and the supporting evidence review and guideline each underwent a peer review process through the journal with the guideline posted online for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^115m417J]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Acute hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure — definitions and ARDS scoring tied to ECMO consideration — are outlined as follows: Acute hypoxemic failure is defined as severe arterial hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, and Murray scores are commonly used to assess the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with scores of 3 or more prompting consideration of veno-venous (VV)-ECMO use. Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure involves inadequate gas exchange with a PCO2 value of more than 50 mm Hg owing to carbon dioxide retention, and some degree of hypercapnia can also be an anticipated and acceptable consequence of a lung-protective ventilation strategy used as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment. In selected patients who are not responsive to usual management strategies and have inadequate gas exchange despite supportive measures and ventilation strategies, ECMO can be a useful modality.

### Acute respiratory failure in children [^116WNKtU]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory failure is the most common medical emergency in children. One aim of this review is to discuss the physiologic peculiarities that explain the increased vulnerability of infants and children to any pathology affecting the respiratory tract. The other aim is to highlight the importance of history taking and correct physical examination for early recognition of an impending catastrophic progression of respiratory failure. Under most circumstances, correct physical examination alone allows one to pinpoint the cause to a particular part of the respiratory system and to make the appropriate decisions for a proactive and life-saving management of the critically ill child.

Study definitions

We restricted analyses to patients with acute HRF, defined as new invasive mechanical ventilation and PaO 2 -to-FIO 2 ratio (PaO 2 :FIO 2) ≤ 300 at study enrollment. If PaO 2 :FIO 2 was unavailable, we used SpO 2 -to-FIO 2 ratio ≤ 315. (Additional file 1 has additional details.)

Patients with acute HRF were further classified as persistent or resolving. Persistent HRF was defined by ongoing need for invasive mechanical ventilation and PaO 2 :FIO 2 ≤ 300 on day 3 following ICU admission. Patients with transient improvements before day 3 (e.g. patients extubated but reintubated, or PaO 2 :FIO 2 > 300 on day 2) were still classified as persistent HRF as long as they met criteria on day 3. Patients who were extubated or who had PaO 2 :FIO 2 > 300 on day 3 were classified as resolving HRF. All PaO 2 measurements were obtained as part of clinical care, and we used the lowest value of PaO 2 :FIO 2 for each ICU day. To understand how classifying persistent HRF at different early time points altered our results, we performed sensitivity analyses redefining persistent HRF on day 2 after admission (which may fall within the eligibility period of prior trials in respiratory failure) and day 4 (which we hypothesized may better delineate differences in underlying biology). Patients who died before qualifying for persistent HRF were excluded in primary analyses but included in sensitivity analyses. They were classified as persistent HRF if they met the specified criteria on the day of death.

ARDS was defined by the Berlin criteria. Each chest radiograph was reviewed by two Critical Care physicians who came to a consensus on the presence of bilateral opacities consistent with ARDS. The primary outcome was cumulative hospital mortality 28 days following enrollment.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111Vmvvw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Oxygenation

The committee recommended creating three categories of ARDS to expand the current ARDS definition: nonintubated ARDS, intubated ARDS, and a modified category of ARDS for resource-limited settings (Table 1 and Figure 1). The committee recommended including patients who require a minimum degree of support with either NIV (as in the Berlin definition) or HFNO in the definition under the category of nonintubated ARDS. This approach, however, limits the definition to care settings in which there is access to these respiratory support devices. The committee agreed that the potential to meet diagnostic criteria for a syndrome should not be affected by resource limitations. Therefore, a formal adoption of the Kigali modification of the clinical definition of ARDS is recommended for settings in which advanced respiratory support devices are not available (full definition of the Kigali recommendation is included in Supplement E5).

Since the publication of the FLORALI trial, the use of HFNO has increased substantially. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that patients treated with HFNO may indeed have ARDS. In one study, 93% of patients with COVID-19 treated with HFNO continued to meet ARDS oxygenation criteria, including criteria for severe ARDS, after intubation and treatment with mechanical ventilation and PEEP. Although the mortality of patients treated with HFNO alone (i.e. who never progressed to invasive mechanical ventilation) was lower, it was similar to those treated with NIV alone, who currently meet the Berlin criteria for ARDS. An important advantage of including patients on HFNO in the revised definition is that ARDS may be recognized earlier, making trials of early interventions more feasible.

These updates to the current definition will allow researchers to compare treatments and outcomes for patients in each category of ARDS (nonintubated, intubated, and resource-limited). The resource-limited option will allow researchers in low-income countries to identify ARDS populations in their hospitals and to conduct clinical studies.

Methodology

Clinical questions were gathered in the PICOT (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Time) format to define the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search. Systematic electronic database searches were conducted in order to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each clinical question the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), Ovid EMBASE, EMSCO CINAHL, Ovid PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). An initial search was carried out in November 2010 using a combination of indexed and free-text terms defining the clinical questions that had been agreed by the guideline group as important in formulating guidelines in AHRF. It was limited to studies after 1990, in adults, in journals published in English and where at least an abstract was available. The searches identified a total of 582 potential papers which were subsequently supplemented by publications known to members or resulting from additional searches undertaken by the writing groups after 2010. The literature search was run again for relevant publications between 2010 and 2013 in September 2013, yielding a further 308 potentially relevant references. Additional references were subsequently included from personal collections.

Appraisal was performed using the criteria stipulated by the AGREE collaboration. Each paper was appraised by at least two reviewers. The writing lead for each section read the title and abstract of papers identified and agreed with at least one member of each writing group whether such a paper was definitely, possibly relevant or not relevant to the section. The criteria used were whether the paper addressed a clinical question, whether the study method used was satisfactory and that it was available in English. Full papers were obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts. Two members for each section independently appraised each paper using the SIGN critical appraisal checklists. An evidence level was assigned to each study using SIGN methodology (table 1) and recommendations formulated according to this evidence base (table 2).

### Pressure-controlled versus volume-controlled ventilation for acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^113yQx8G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) account for one-quarter of cases of acute respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICUs). A third to half of patients will die in the ICU, in hospital or during follow-up. Mechanical ventilation of people with ALI/ARDS allows time for the lungs to heal, but ventilation is invasive and can result in lung injury. It is uncertain whether ventilator-related injury would be reduced if pressure delivered by the ventilator with each breath is controlled, or whether the volume of air delivered by each breath is limited.

Objectives

To compare pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) versus volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) in adults with ALI/ARDS to determine whether PCV reduces in-hospital mortality and morbidity in intubated and ventilated adults.

Search Methods

In October 2014, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Isssue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 1 October 2014), the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1994 to 1 October 2014) and Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) at the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1990 to 1 October 2014), as well as regional databases, clinical trials registries, conference proceedings and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (irrespective of language or publication status) of adults with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure or acute on chronic respiratory failure and fulfilling the criteria for ALI/ARDS as defined by the American-European Consensus Conference who were admitted to an ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing pressure-controlled or pressure-controlled inverse-ratio ventilation, or an equivalent pressure-controlled mode (PCV), versus volume-controlled ventilation, or an equivalent volume-controlled mode (VCV).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification from trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

We included three RCTs that randomly assigned a total of 1089 participants recruited from 43 ICUs in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the United States. Risk of bias of the included studies was low. Only data for mortality and barotrauma could be combined in the meta-analysis. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the three mortality outcomes on the basis of serious imprecision around the effect estimates. For mortality in hospital, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; three trials, 1089 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and for mortality in the ICU, the RR with PCV compared with VCV was 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; two trials, 1062 participants; moderate-quality evidence). One study provided no evidence of clear benefit with the ventilatory mode for mortality at 28 days (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 983 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The difference in effect on barotrauma between PCV and VCV was uncertain as the result of imprecision and different co-interventions used in the studies (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.77; two trials, 1062 participants; low-quality evidence). Data from one trial with 983 participants for the mean duration of ventilation, and from another trial with 78 participants for the mean number of extrapulmonary organ failures that developed with PCV or VCV, were skewed. None of the trials reported on infection during ventilation or quality of life after discharge.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. More studies including a larger number of people given PCV and VCV may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^117DdrAK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation improves outcomes and has been recommended for patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure from acute exacerbations of COPD or patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In most prior guidelines, no specific recommendation has been made for the use of NIV for patients with AHRF from other etiologies due to insufficient evidence. Additionally, concerns have been raised about tolerance of NIV, ability to clear secretions, worsening lung injury from large tidal volumes on inspiratory pressure support (especially given the high inspiratory demand seen in AHRF), and possible harm resulting from delaying intubation.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, NIV was frequently used (up to 47% of ICU patients in Wuhan). Initial clinical practice guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Surviving Sepsis Campaign provided a weak recommendation in favor of HFNO compared to NIV for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, and for use of NIV if HFNO was not available or had failed. This recommendation was based upon data extrapolated from non-COVID-19 related AHRF, and studies in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that showed a high rate of intolerance and failure of NIV, with high mortality among those who failed NIV. In addition, concerns existed regarding the potential for increased aerosol transmission of the virus with NIV.

### Beyond the guidelines for non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: implications for practice [^1154cnW7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use and when and how it should be used has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this Series paper, we look beyond the guidelines to what is happening in everyday clinical practice in the real world, how patient selection can be refined to maximise the chances of a successful outcome, and emerging alternative therapies. Real-world application of non-invasive ventilation diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly with regard to patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes education programmes need to stress these issues and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation that is delivered needs to be monitored by regular audit.

### Walking the tightrope: characterizing acute respiratory distress syndrome in resource-and data-constrained settings [^111omcXr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute syndrome characterized by hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of clinical evidence of heart failure. Lower respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of ARDS, and global lower respiratory tract infection–related mortality is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where the infrastructure required to diagnose and treat ARDS is limited. Recent modifications to the definition of ARDS have allowed for its use in resource-constrained settings. The Kigali modification does not require positive pressure ventilation or arterial blood gases and replaces chest X-rays with lung ultrasound, whereas the more recently proposed Global ARDS definition further relaxes the requirement for a specific amount of noninvasive ventilatory support in resource-constrained settings. However, all definitions still require resources and training often not available outside of specialized urban healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, although recent work has begun to shed light on regional ARDS epidemiology and outcomes, applying a consensus definition of respiratory failure that can be operationalized within the limited healthcare infrastructure present across much of sub-Saharan Africa remains an important unmet need.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a definition of severe respiratory distress (SRD) that may mimic ARDS clinically and could thus be operationalized in healthcare settings without advanced diagnostic infrastructure. The WHO defines SRD without shock as a clinical diagnosis that requires: 1) oxygen saturation (Sp O 2) < 90% or respiratory rate > 30 breaths per minute; 2) systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg; 3) no clinical evidence of heart failure; and 4) suspected pneumonia or acute lung injury. Notably, the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging and a threshold amount of supplemental oxygen support — features of every definition of ARDS — are not components of the WHO definition, given that ultrasound and chest radiography are not often available in most healthcare settings. Thus, whether WHO-defined SRD without shock identifies a population of patients with ARDS in resource-constrained settings and whether patients with WHO-defined SRD without shock are at comparably high risk for poor outcomes is not well understood.

### Indications for mechanical ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure [^111n4eGC]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Increased understanding of the mechanisms and effects of acute respiratory failure has not been accompanied by more precise criteria by which the clinician can determine when intubation should be carried out and invasive positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) instituted in a given patient. The indications traditionally offered in reviews and textbooks have tended to be either so broad as not to be very helpful in an individual case, or of questionable clinical relevance and too cumbersome for practical use. This review updates the indications for IPPV in adult patients with acute respiratory failure by examining available evidence from clinical trials and by considering new management alternatives that have become available in the last 20 years. Indications for IPPV based on specific threshold values for P(CO2) and pH or on various indices of arterial oxygenation have generally not been validated by clinical evidence, and it is unlikely that any cutoff value would be applicable to all patients or all categories of acute respiratory failure. Stated another way, there is probably no single value for arterial P(CO2), pH, or P(O2) that by itself constitutes an indication for IPPV. Compelling face validity justifies the use of IPPV in cases of apnea or when it appears certain that respiratory arrest is about to occur. However, dyspnea, tachypnea, or the subjective impression of respiratory distress are probably not in themselves justification for emergency intubation. It should be possible to avoid IPPV and its attendant complications in many cases of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) should be the initial ventilation approach unless the patient has one of several specific exclusion criteria such as cardiovascular instability or severely impaired mental status. It may also be possible to avoid intubation through the use of NPPV in certain immunocompromised patients with early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, in other settings of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, such as acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, this has not been shown. The use of IPPV may improve outcomes in patients with severe cardiogenic shock. However, IPPV has not proven to be beneficial in traumatic brain injury and flail chest, in the absence of other indications.

### The predictive validity of the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome for patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure treated with high-flow nasal oxygen: a multicenter, prospective cohort study [^116UmeMs]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was constructed for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with consideration given to issues related to reliability, feasibility, and validity. Notwithstanding, patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) may be treated with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and may not fall within the scope of the original definition. We aimed to evaluate the predictive validity of the Berlin definition in HFNO-treated patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure who otherwise met ARDS criteria.

Design

Multicenter, prospective cohort study.

Setting

Five ICUs of five centers in Argentina from March 2020 to September 2021.

Patients

We consecutively included HFNO-treated patients older than 18 years with confirmed COVID-19-related ARF, a Pa o2 /F io2 of less than 300mm Hg, bilateral infiltrates on imaging, and worsening respiratory symptoms for less than 1 week.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We evaluated the predictive validity of mortality at day 28 using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), compared the predictive validity across subgroups, and characterized relevant clinical outcomes. We screened 1,231 patients and included 696 ARDS patients [30 (4%) mild, 380 (55%) moderate, and 286 (41%) severe]. For the study cohort, the AUC for mortality at day 28 was 0.606 (95% CI, 0.561–0.651) with the AUC for subgroups being similar to that of the overall cohort. Two hundred fifty-six patients (37%) received IMV. By day 28, 142 patients (21%) had died, of whom 81 (57%) had severe ARDS. Mortality occurred primarily in patients who were transitioned to IMV.

Conclusions

The predictive validity of the Berlin ARDS definition was similar for HFNO-treated patients as compared with the original population of invasively ventilated patients. Our findings support the extension of the Berlin definition to HFNO-treated patients with ARDS.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^112QDMNb]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and the absence of left atrial hypertension. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is believed to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting neutrophil accumulation in the microcirculation of the lung. Neutrophils damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and difficult air exchange. Most cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. It is estimated that 7.1 percent of all patients admitted to an intensive care unit and 16.1 percent of all patients on mechanical ventilation develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. In-hospital mortality related to these conditions is between 34 and 55 percent, and most deaths are due to multiorgan failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome often has to be differentiated from congestive heart failure, which usually has signs of fluid overload, and from pneumonia. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and conservative fluid therapy may improve outcomes. A spontaneous breathing trial is indicated as the patient improves and the underlying illness resolves. Patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

### Non-intubated COVID-19 patients despite high levels of supplemental oxygen [^1116srS5]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Many COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may require invasive mechanical ventilation. However, deciding whether and when a patient should be intubated is complex, especially in COVID-19 patients who commonly exhibit severe hypoxemia without clinical signs of respiratory failure (the so-called silent hypoxemia). While clinical signs of respiratory failure seem to be universally acknowledged as intubation criteria, their precise definition is lacking. Some authors have consequently used definite thresholds to guide intubation, but this approach is debated as an individualized strategy may be more adequate. In our ICU, only COVID-19 patients showing persistent signs of respiratory distress associated with profound hypoxemia were intubated.

We therefore aimed (1) to assess the proportion of our COVID-19 patients not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation despite high levels of supplemental oxygen (≥ 15L/min for ≥ 6 h) as well as (2) to describe their clinical and biological features on the day of worst clinical status.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^116j53n7]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Acute respiratory failure and ARDS prognostication for ECMO — Acute hypoxemic failure is defined as severe arterial hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, whereas acute hypercapnic respiratory failure results in a PCO2 value of more than 50 mm Hg owing to carbon dioxide retention. Murray scores are commonly used today in assessing the need for ECMO support, typically indicated by scores of 3 or more prompting consideration of venovenous (VV)-ECMO use, and the Berlin Definition of ARDS categorized severity based upon physiologic, radiographic, and gas exchange parameters and was shown to be useful in assessing risk of death. Two other scoring systems that can be used in prognosticating ARDS include the age-adjusted oxygenation index and the age, PaO2/FiO2, and plateau pressure score.

### An early PEEP / FIO2 trial identifies different degrees of lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116gku1a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Current American-European Consensus Conference definitions for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are inadequate for inclusion into clinical trials due to the lack of standardization for measuring the oxygenation defect.

Objectives

We questioned whether an early assessment of oxygenation on specific ventilator settings would identify patients with established ARDS (persisting over 24 h).

Methods

At the time of meeting ARDS criteria (Day 0) and 24 hours later (Day 1), arterial blood gases were obtained on standard ventilator settings, Vt 7 ml/kg predicted body weight plus the following positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and Fi(O(2)) settings in sequence: (1) PEEP ≥ 5 cm H(2)O and Fi(O(2)) ≥ 0.5, (2) PEEP ≥ 5 cm H(2)O and Fi(O(2)) 1.0, (3) PEEP ≥ 10 cm H(2)O and Fi(O(2)) ≥ 0.5, and (4) PEEP ≥ 10 cm H(2)O and Fi(O(2)) 1.0.

Measurements and Main Results

One hundred seventy patients meeting ARDS criteria (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) 128 ± 33 mm Hg) were enrolled. Overall hospital mortality was 34.1%. The standard ventilator settings that best identified patients with established ARDS and predicted differences in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality were PEEP ≥ 10 cm H(2)O and Fi(O(2)) ≥ 0.5 at Day 1 (P = 0.0001). Only 99 (58.2%) patients continued to meet ARDS criteria (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)), 155.8 ± 29.8 mm Hg; ICU mortality, 45.5%), whereas 55 patients were reclassified as having ALI (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)), 246.5 ± 25.6 mm Hg; ICU mortality, 20%) and 16 patients as having acute respiratory failure (Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)), 370 ± 54 mm Hg; ICU mortality, 6.3%) (P = 0.0001) on these settings.

Conclusions

Patients meeting current American-European Consensus Conference ARDS criteria may have highly variable levels of lung injury and outcomes. A systematic method of assessing severity of lung injury is required for enrollment of patients with ARDS into randomized controlled trials. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00435110).

### Predictors of survival in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): an observational study [^1147x5FE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition was commonly used by clinicians to categorize ARDS patients. But issues regarding reliability of various criteria have emerged, including a poor interobserver reliability of chest radiograph interpretation, confusing acute lung injury (ALI) /ARDS nomenclature and the inconsistency of PaO2/FiO2 ratio due to the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Those limitations have recently been tackled with the establishment of the Berlin Definition in 2012. Herein, ARDS patients are classified into three independent categories (i.e. mild, moderate and severe ARDS) and additional variables are taken into account. Several factors, such as severity of chest radiograph, a PEEP level above 5 cm H 2 O, low compliance and poor oxygenation, are now used to define severe ARDS.

The Berlin Definition addresses and clarifies some of the limitations of the AECC definition and is the first to include minimum ventilator settings. The predictive validity for mortality is only slightly better than in the AECC definition. However, it was not designed to serve as a prognostication tool. In the past, other variables of interest, such as the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the oxygenation index (OI), the influence of co-morbidities and a number of clinical scores (SAPS, SOFA), were screened in ARDS patients to prompt early prediction of outcome and to ensure more efficient resource allocation. As the ARDS is, however, a very heterogeneous syndrome with several different causes, all proposed definitions, parameters and variables did not resolve the problem adequately. For a reliable prediction of outcome and mortality in ARDS patients, comparable treatment strategies in respective hospitals are required. However, treatment algorithms applied on ARDS patients may differ significantly between different hospitals (usage of inhalative nitric oxide, ventilator settings, criteria to start lung assist devices) representing different approaches to the "state of the art" in ARDS therapy. These problems may be partly resolved in unicentric studies in specialized hospitals involving sufficiently high numbers of patients.

Outcome prediction in critically ill patients at a given point of time plays a major role (e.g. for appropriate treatment decisions and family communication). In this context, we examined the predictive values of the AECC and Berlin definition and also assessed alternative clinical parameters that are available in routine patient care.

### Interrater reliability of the 2015 pediatric acute lung injury consensus conference criteria for pediatric ARDS [^1136T8k7]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic guidelines for pediatric ARDS (PARDS) were developed at the 2015 Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC). Although this was an improvement in creating pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria, there remains potential for variability in identification of PARDS.

Research Question

What is the interrater reliability of the 2015 PALICC criteria for diagnosing moderate to severe PARDS? What clinical criteria and patient factors are associated with diagnostic disagreements?

Study Design and Methods

Patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure admitted from 2016 to 2021 who received invasive mechanical ventilation were retrospectively reviewed by two pediatric ICU physicians. Reviewers evaluated whether the patient met the 2015 PALICC definition of moderate to severe PARDS and rated their diagnostic confidence. Interrater reliability was measured using Gwet's agreement coefficient.

Results

Thirty-seven of 191 encounters had a diagnostic disagreement. Interrater reliability was substantial (Gwet's agreement coefficient, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.83). Disagreements were caused by different interpretations of chest radiographs (56.8%), ambiguity in origin of pulmonary edema (37.8%), or lack of clarity if patient's current condition was significantly different from baseline (27.0%). Disagreement was more likely in patients who were chronically ventilated (OR, 4.66; 95% CI, 2.16–10.08; P < .001), had a primary cardiac admission diagnosis (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.18–9.53; p = 0.02), or underwent cardiothoracic surgery during the admission (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 1.60–15.00; p = 0.005). Reviewers were at least moderately confident in their decision 73% of the time; however, they were less likely to be confident if the patient had cardiac disease or chronic respiratory failure.

Interpretation

The interrater reliability of the 2015 PALICC criteria for diagnosing moderate to severe PARDS in this cohort was substantial, with diagnostic disagreements commonly caused by differences in chest radiograph interpretations. Patients with cardiac disease or chronic respiratory failure were more vulnerable to diagnostic disagreements. More guidance is needed on interpreting chest radiographs and diagnosing PARDS in these subgroups.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111Mjsf9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Epidemiology and outcomes

Using the AECC definition, several population-based studies of ARDS showed a fairly consistent picture of the age, mortality and severity of illness; however, there was almost a fourfold difference in incidence, probably contributed to by differences in study design and ICU utilisation. In the United States, there are estimated to be 190 000 cases and 74 000 deaths annually from ARDS. Whereas in a third world setting, from 1046 patients admitted to a Rwandan hospital over 6 weeks, 4% (median age 37 years) met modified ARDS criteria. Only 30.9% of patients with ARDS were admitted to an ICU, and hospital mortality was 50.0%. This study used the Kigali modification of the Berlin definition: without a requirement for PEEP, hypoxia threshold of SpO 2 /FiO 2 less than or equal to 315, and bilateral opacities on lung ultrasound or chest radiograph.

The recently published LUNG SAFE trial was designed to study prospectively the performance of the Berlin definition and to reflect modern management of ARDS. To those ends, the investigators recorded admissions over 4 weeks to 459 ICUs in 50 countries over 5 continents including 29 144 patients. In total, 3022 (10.4%) cases fulfilled ARDS criteria, including almost a quarter of those supported with invasive mechanical ventilation. Despite this relatively high prevalence and the study's focus on ARDS, the syndrome was recognised in only half of the mild ARDS group. Furthermore, in a study that reported on 815 patients with at least one risk factor for ARDS who were admitted to one of 3 Spanish hospitals over 4 months, 15 out of 53 patients (28%) were not admitted to an ICU suggesting that LUNG SAFE may have underestimated both ARDS incidence and overlooked diagnoses.

Survivors commonly suffer from muscle weakness and neuropsychiatric problems, such that fewer than 50% have returned to work 12 months after leaving intensive care. However, it is unusual for ARDS survivors to be significantly limited by chronic respiratory failure. Therefore, ARDS is important both clinically and financially, because it is a not uncommon contributor to the deaths of critically ill patients of all ages and because survivors carry on suffering from the sequelae of critical illness long after they leave hospital.

AASLD practice guidance — definition and core elements of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF): We suggest that the presence of all of the following elements are minimum critical components for the definition of ACLF: (1) acute onset with rapid deterioration in clinical condition, (2) the presence of liver failure defined by elevated bilirubin and elevated INR in patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, and (3) the presence of at least one extrahepatic (neurologic, circulatory, respiratory, or renal) organ failure. Although specific criteria to define ACLF vary by region, organ failure is common to all ACLF definitions, and there are three major definitions with a fourth by the World Gastroenterology Organization; thresholds used in definitions include coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.5 or above and bilirubin cutoffs of 5–12 mg/dL. Critically ill patients with cirrhosis are at a high risk of mortality within 1–3 months.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1165S9xh]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in up to 10% of patients with respiratory failure admitted through the emergency department. Use of noninvasive respiratory support has proliferated in recent years; clinicians must understand the relative merits and risks of these technologies and know how to recognize signs of failure. The cornerstone of ARDS care of the mechanically ventilated patient is low-tidal volume ventilation based on ideal body weight. Adjunctive therapies, such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may have a role in the emergency department management of ARDS depending on patient and department characteristics.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113uAqQe]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission worldwide. From a pathophysiological perspective, ARF is characterized by hypoxemia, which may occur alongside with hypoventilation and hypercapnia due to ventilatory pump failure, or hypo-normocapnia (isolated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure -AHRF) in the context of direct or indirect lung insults. The result is a cardio-respiratory incapacity to sustain adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs and to eliminate CO 2, contributing to acid–base imbalance. Despite supplemental oxygen being sometimes sufficient to overcome these abnormalities, the increased ventilatory demands may require escalation to more advanced respiratory support.

Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) strategies can elicit a physiological response sufficient to meet patients' needs during acute illness, potentially avoiding intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). However, especially in sicker patients, delaying IMV initiation may expose the patient to excessive respiratory effort and increased oxygen consumption, further aggravating patients' condition and overall clinical outcomes. As a result, deciding whether to implement NRS, how, and for how long are key clinical decisions.

In this review, we provide an overview of the relevance and available tools for monitoring adult patients during NRS for ARF. We specifically focus on the physiological effects and main indications for NRS, importance of device/interface selection, determinants, and implications of NRS failure. Finally, we describe available tools for monitoring and how to interpret them in the clinical context to guide decisions related to adjustments of ventilator settings and timely intubation to avoid harm. NRS during awake prone positioning and post-extubation are out of the scope of this review.

### Outcomes of patients presenting with mild acute respiratory distress syndrome: insights from the LUNG SAFE study [^111pGQeQ]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with initial mild acute respiratory distress syndrome are often underrecognized and mistakenly considered to have low disease severity and favorable outcomes. They represent a relatively poorly characterized population that was only classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome in the most recent definition. Our primary objective was to describe the natural course and the factors associated with worsening and mortality in this population.

Methods

This study analyzed patients from the international prospective Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE) who had initial mild acute respiratory distress syndrome in the first day of inclusion. This study defined three groups based on the evolution of severity in the first week: "worsening" if moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were met, "persisting" if mild acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were the most severe category, and "improving" if patients did not fulfill acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria any more from day 2.

Results

Among 580 patients with initial mild acute respiratory distress syndrome, 18% (103 of 580) continuously improved, 36% (210 of 580) had persisting mild acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 46% (267 of 580) worsened in the first week after acute respiratory distress syndrome onset. Global in-hospital mortality was 30% (172 of 576; specifically 10% [10 of 101], 30% [63 of 210], and 37% [99 of 265] for patients with improving, persisting, and worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome, respectively), and the median (interquartile range) duration of mechanical ventilation was 7 (4, 14) days (specifically 3 [2, 5], 7 [4, 14], and 11 [6, 18] days for patients with improving, persisting, and worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome, respectively). Admissions for trauma or pneumonia, higher nonpulmonary sequential organ failure assessment score, lower partial pressure of alveolar oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen, and higher peak inspiratory pressure were independently associated with worsening.

Conclusions

Most patients with initial mild acute respiratory distress syndrome continue to fulfill acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria in the first week, and nearly half worsen in severity. Their mortality is high, particularly in patients with worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome, emphasizing the need for close attention to this patient population.

### An attempt to validate the modification of the American-European consensus definition of acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome by the Berlin definition in a university hospital [^116yQSLm]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Berlin definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a new proposal for changing the American-European consensus definition but has not been assessed prospectively as yet. In the present study, we aimed to determine (1) the prevalence and incidence of ARDS with both definitions, and (2) the initial characteristics of patients with ARDS and 28-day mortality with the Berlin definition.

Methods

We performed a 6-month prospective observational study in the ten adult ICUs affiliated to the Public University Hospital in Lyon, France, from March to September 2012. Patients under invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, with PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg regardless of the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level, and acute onset of new or increased bilateral infiltrates or opacities on chest X-ray were screened from ICU admission up to discharge. Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema were excluded. Patients were further classified into specific categories by using the American-European Consensus Conference and the Berlin definition criteria. The complete data set was measured at the time of inclusion. Patient outcome was measured at day 28 after inclusion.

Results

During the study period 3,504 patients were admitted and 278 fulfilled the American-European Consensus Conference criteria. Among them, 18 (6.5%) did not comply with the Berlin criterion PEEP ≥ 5 cmH2O and 20 (7.2%) had PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 200 while on noninvasive ventilation. By using the Berlin definition in the remaining 240 patients (n = 42 mild, n = 123 moderate, n = 75 severe), the overall prevalence was 6.85% and it was 1.20, 3.51, and 2.14% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively (P > 0.05 between the three groups). The incidence of ARDS amounted to 32 per 100,000 population per year, with values for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS of 5.6, 16.3, and 10 per 100,000 population per year, respectively (P < 0.05 between the three groups). The 28-day mortality was 35.0%. It amounted to 30.9% in mild, 27.9% in moderate, and 49.3% in severe categories (P < 0.01 between mild or moderate and severe, P = 0.70 between mild and moderate). In the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis ARDS stage was not significantly associated with patient death at day 28.

Conclusions

The present study did not validate the Berlin definition of ARDS. Neither the stratification by severity nor the PaO2/FiO2 at study entry was independently associated with mortality.

### We do not need mechanical ventilation any more [^113syzDv]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving treatment delivered to patients with a wide spectrum of medical and surgical diseases. However, significant limitations of the clinical application of mechanical ventilation in current practice have emerged, prompting the definition of novel therapeutic perspectives, especially concerning the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory failure. In the past few decades, there has been a consistent scientific and technologic effort to develop alternative strategies to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation. In particular, several studies have explored the feasibility and efficacy of extracorporeal oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. Furthermore, promising results on the prevention of the occurrence of severe acute respiratory failure have been provided by clinical studies on the noninvasive application of continuous positive airway pressure as well as by experimental investigations in basic science. Therefore, further development in this direction will occur only with a permanent integration and exchange of knowledge among industry, clinicians, and scientific investigators.

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

### Early identification of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the absence of positive pressure ventilation: implications for revision of the Berlin criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Akk17]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether patients breathing spontaneously under standard oxygen could be recognized early as acute respiratory distress syndrome patients according to the current Berlin definition.

Design

A post hoc analysis from two prospective studies.

Setting

Twenty-three French ICUs.

Patients

All patients admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and treated with noninvasive ventilation were analyzed. Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or hypercapnia were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was estimated at admission under standard oxygen and then under noninvasive ventilation 1 hour after initiation and within the first 24 hours. Among the 219 patients treated with noninvasive ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, 180 (82%) had bilateral infiltrates including 161 patients with PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 300mm Hg under standard oxygen. Among them, 127 were treated with positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5cm H2O, and 120 (94%) fulfilled criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome within the first 24 hours. The mortality rate of patients with bilateral infiltrates and PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 300mm Hg under standard oxygen was 29%, a rate very close to that of intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the Berlin definition.

Conclusions

Almost all patients with pulmonary bilateral infiltrates and a PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 300mm Hg under standard oxygen fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria under noninvasive ventilation within the first 24 hours. Their mortality rate was similar to that reported in the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, spontaneous breathing patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria could be identified early without positive pressure ventilation.

### Performance measure development, use, and measurement of effectiveness using the guideline on mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114h57AX]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — low tidal volume ventilation performance measure for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is anchored to the 2017 guideline recommendation stating, "We recommend that adult patients with ARDS receive mechanical ventilation with strategies that limit tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg PBW [predicted body weight]) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O) (strong recommendation, moderate confidence in effect estimates)". The indicator targets the "Proportion of ventilator settings from the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients with a diagnosis of ARDS that meet criteria as low tidal volume ventilation". The numerator is the "Number of ventilator settings in the denominator that meet tidal volume (4–8 mL/kg PBW) AND peak or inspiratory pause (plateau) pressure (< 30 cm H2O) criteria", and the denominator is the "Number of low tidal volume ventilation opportunities as defined by: Twice daily ventilator setting measures over the first 72 hours of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to a diagnosis ARDS", with data sources specified. Exclusions include "Pre-existing chronic fibrotic lung disease" and "Death within 12 hours of intubation", and subsequent exclusions of "Initiation of ECMO", "Plan to withdraw life-sustaining treatment", "Initiation of ventilator weaning", and "Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation". The page also notes that the American Thoracic Society "recommends that only 'strong' recommendations should be considered for performance measure development".

Severity definitions and conditional recommendation meaning: Severe illness is defined as patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, including patients on supplemental oxygen. Critical illness is defined as patients on mechanical ventilation and ECMO, includes end organ dysfunction as is seen in sepsis/septic shock, and in COVID-19 the most commonly reported form of end organ dysfunction is ARDS. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Respiratory failure… [^112wtU4t]. publications.aap.org (2009). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Acute respiratory failure describes any impairment in oxygenation or ventilation in which the arterial oxygen tension falls below 60 mm Hg, the carbon dioxide tension rises above 50 mm Hg and the pH drops below 7. 35, or both. For patients who have underlying chronic respiratory failure, acute hypercarbia can be diagnosed by an increase in Pco. 2 by 20 mm Hg from baseline. From a functional standpoint, respiratory failure is defined as the inability of the respiratory system to meet the metabolic needs of the tissues. The incidence of respiratory failure in pediatrics is inversely related to age. Two thirds of the cases of respiratory failure in children occur in the first postnatal year, and one half are seen in the neonatal period. The higher incidence of respiratory failure in infants has several developmental explanations. Comments

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome… [^112PkP9G]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome refers to the syndrome of lung injury characterized by dyspnea, severe hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Family physicians can play an essential role in the early recognition of ARDS and contribute to the multispecialty team required to manage this life-threatening condition. This article reviews the current understanding of the pathophysiology, management, and prognosis of ARDS. Originally referred to as traumatic wet lung, shock lung, or congestive atelectasis, ARDS was recognized in 1967 when the clinical, physiologic, radiographic, and pathologic abnormalities that were unique to a group of 12 patients were described, distinguishing them from other cases in a series of 272 patients treated for respiratory failure. 7 in 1994 and renamed it acute rather than adult respiratory distress syndrome because it occurs at all ages. The term acute lung injury was also introduced at that time.

The committee recommended that ALI be defined as "a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability that is associated with a constellation of clinical, radiologic, and physiologic abnormalities that cannot be explained by, but may coexist with, left atrial or pulmonary capillary hypertension". 7 Exclusion of left atrial hypertension as the primary cause of hypoxemia is critical to this definition, and measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure may be necessary. The distinction between ALI and ARDS is the degree of hypoxemia, 7 defined by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen concentration, as shown in Table 1. 8 ALI is defined by a ratio less than 300 mm Hg, and 200 mm Hg or less is required for ARDS. 3 Patients initially have tachypnea, dyspnea, and normal auscultatory findings in the chest. Some elderly patients may present with an unexplained altered mental status.

Patients then become tachycardic with mild cyanosis and later develop coarse rales. They progress to respiratory distress with diffuse rhonchi and signs of consolidation, often requiring positive pressure ventilatory support. Even with significant hypoxemia, these clinical findings may not be obvious, so an arterial blood gas is warranted early in patients at risk. Initial oxygenation ratios and ventilatory parameters do not reliably predict the ultimate outcome in individual patients. During the past 30 years, there has been considerable progress in standardizing the evaluation and management of this disease worldwide.
