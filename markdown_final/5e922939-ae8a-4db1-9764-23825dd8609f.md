## Question

Treatment for chronic urticaria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a stepwise treatment algorithm for chronic urticaria, preserving the reasoning flow and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the urticaria phenotype. Then, I should verify first-line therapy with second-generation H1 antihistamines and the principles of updosing. Next, I will review second-line options and their evidence, followed by third-line biologic therapy and immunosuppressants. After that, I need to consider special populations and inducible urticaria, monitoring and step-down strategies, and finally emerging therapies and cost-effectiveness considerations, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification because management hinges on getting this right; chronic urticaria is defined by wheals with or without angioedema persisting for more than 6 weeks, and I should distinguish chronic spontaneous urticaria from chronic inducible urticaria and exclude urticarial vasculitis or other mimics, using history, exam, and, when indicated, targeted labs rather than broad screening panels, and I should remember that CSU is a diagnosis of exclusion with a heterogeneous, often mast cell–driven pathophysiology, so I need to ensure I'm not missing an inducible trigger or an alternative diagnosis before committing to a stepwise pharmacologic algorithm [^117MzwNp] [^113juP2s].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy; second-generation, nonsedating H1 antihistamines are the foundation, and I need to check that I'm choosing agents with favorable safety and minimal sedation, such as cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, bilastine, or rupatadine, while avoiding QT-prolonging combinations and enzyme inhibitors that raise antihistamine levels, and I should confirm that continuous daily dosing is preferred over intermittent use for sustained control [^113rL1n5] [^117MzwNp] [^1124LK4j].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose; if standard-dose antihistamines fail after an adequate trial, I should updose up to fourfold the licensed dose because guidelines endorse this strategy and randomized data show improved control with higher doses, though I need to ensure tolerability and screen for cardiac risk or drug interactions before escalating, and I should double-check that updosing is applied to the same agent rather than prematurely switching, since consistency helps judge response [^117MzwNp] [^116fezUc].

> Wait, let me verify the role of adjuncts at this stage; I initially thought adding an H2 blocker or montelukast might help broadly, but I should confirm guideline positions — French guidance does not recommend routine H2 blockade or montelukast add-on for CSU due to limited benefit, whereas some US primary care guidance allows consideration of montelukast in select contexts, so if I add montelukast, it should be after antihistamine optimization and with shared decision-making about uncertain benefit, and I should avoid long-term systemic corticosteroids given adverse effects and lack of durable benefit [^1124LK4j] [^112t4QJw] [^116Pcsy6].

> I will now examine when to escalate; refractory disease is generally defined as inadequate control despite maximally tolerated, higher-dose second-generation H1 antihistamines, and I should confirm that timely escalation is advised to prevent prolonged undertreatment and cumulative quality-of-life impairment, with the next step being add-on biologic therapy or, in select cases, cyclosporine, guided by disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^117SCv2W] [^115B7twK] [^117SF6Fv].

> Let me consider third-line biologic therapy; omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks is the standard regimen with robust randomized evidence showing rapid, dose-dependent improvements in itch and wheals and strong real-world effectiveness, and I should confirm that I reassess at 12–16 weeks to determine response and consider personalized adjustments in dose or interval for partial responders, while remembering that higher doses or shorter intervals can be used off-label in selected refractory cases with careful monitoring [^116inEhD] [^116t2Ggg] [^11213xc6].

> But wait, what if omalizumab is unavailable, contraindicated, or declined; cyclosporine 4–5 mg/kg/day for about 3–6 months is a reasonable alternative with RCT support for efficacy in antihistamine-refractory CSU, yet I need to ensure close monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and drug interactions, and I should avoid prolonged use given nephrotoxicity and hypertension risks, reserving it for carefully selected patients after discussing trade-offs [^114UPCqt] [^1124LK4j] [^113LFFVS].

> I should double-check emerging targeted options; BTK inhibitors like remibrutinib and fenebrutinib show high efficacy in recent trials and network meta-analyses, and ligelizumab demonstrates large beneficial effects versus placebo, but I need to confirm regulatory status and long-term safety before routine use, and I should frame these as promising options for refractory disease or omalizumab nonresponders pending guideline integration and access considerations [^113gA3XR] [^115fdmon] [^113juP2s].

> Next, I should review special populations; in pregnancy and lactation, I need to ensure I favor cetirizine, levocetirizine, or desloratadine given more safety data, avoid teratogenic agents, and escalate to omalizumab only after specialist consultation if antihistamines fail, while in pediatrics, second-generation H1 antihistamines are first-line with rupatadine or desloratadine preferred if updosing is needed due to available evidence, and omalizumab is approved for ages 12 and older, with careful growth and infection surveillance during therapy [^1124LK4j] [^115B7twK] [^115tAezR].

> Hold on, I should verify management of chronic inducible urticaria; the stepwise algorithm mirrors CSU, but omalizumab has particularly useful evidence in symptomatic dermographism and some cold urticaria, and for solar urticaria, targeted phototherapy or photoprotection strategies may be considered after specialist input, so I need to tailor therapy to the specific inducible subtype and its trigger [^114TN3eP] [^113WvgaX] [^115SJBjX].

> I need to ensure robust monitoring and step-down planning; at each visit, I should assess disease activity with UAS7 and control with UCT, avoid routine laboratory screening unless history or exam suggests an underlying process, and once complete control is sustained, I should step down antihistamines gradually and, for omalizumab, extend intervals or reduce dose before discontinuation, recognizing that many patients can eventually stop after 6–12 months of control, though relapse may occur and warrants retreatment [^111oah5n] [^113FpX5x] [^11625SNn].

> Let me reconsider cost and access; omalizumab increases annual treatment costs but appears cost-effective at standard US willingness-to-pay thresholds for antihistamine-refractory CSU, and personalized dosing strategies can reduce drug exposure and cost while maintaining control, so I should discuss affordability, insurance coverage, and the incremental value of biologic therapy transparently with patients [^112ievfT] [^11213xc6].

> Finally, I should confirm that I am aligning with the overarching principle of complete symptom control using the lowest effective dose, integrating trigger avoidance such as NSAIDs when relevant, and maintaining shared decision-making throughout, because this patient-centered approach improves adherence and outcomes while minimizing overtreatment and adverse effects [^115FMgqP] [^114ngKbK].

---

The treatment of chronic urticaria follows a **stepwise algorithm** [^117MzwNp] that begins with second-generation H1 antihistamines [^113rL1n5], escalates to fourfold dosing if needed [^116fezUc], and adds omalizumab for refractory cases [^117SF6Fv]; cyclosporine is a third-line option when biologics are unavailable or contraindicated [^1124LK4j]. Systemic corticosteroids are reserved for short-term rescue only due to adverse effects [^114oHZyN] [^116Pcsy6], and emerging therapies such as BTK inhibitors [^113gA3XR] and ligelizumab [^115fdmon] are promising for refractory disease. Management should be individualized, with regular monitoring and step-down once control is sustained [^111oah5n] [^113FpX5x].

---

## First-line therapy: second-generation H1 antihistamines

- **Mechanism of action**: Competitive antagonism at H1 receptors, reducing histamine-mediated wheal and flare [^notfound].

- **Clinical evidence**: Effective in ~50% of patients at standard doses [^115B7twK].

- **Safety profile**: Favorable; minimal sedation and anticholinergic effects [^notfound].

- **Recommended agents**: Cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, bilastine, rupatadine [^notfound].

---

## Second-line therapy: dose escalation of H1 antihistamines

- **Rationale**: Up to 40% of patients require higher doses for control [^notfound].

- **Evidence**: Updosing up to fourfold improves response to ~63% [^113vBADL].

- **Safety**: Generally safe; monitor for sedation, QT prolongation, and drug interactions [^1124LK4j].

---

## Third-line therapy: omalizumab (anti-IgE monoclonal antibody)

- **Mechanism**: Binds IgE, reduces FcεRI expression, and inhibits mast cell activation [^notfound].

- **Efficacy**: ~72% complete response; rapid onset (within weeks) [^116t2Ggg] [^1145z9ca].

- **Safety**: Excellent; low adverse event rates [^115W7hq2].

- **Dosing**: 300 mg SC every 4 weeks; consider 150–600 mg or shorter intervals for partial responders [^116inEhD] [^115Jcsv8] [^11213xc6] [^116Pq47h].

---

## Fourth-line therapy: cyclosporine

Cyclosporine is indicated for **refractory cases** or when omalizumab is unavailable or contraindicated [^114UPCqt]. It provides ~60% response but has a significant adverse-effect burden, including nephrotoxicity and hypertension [^113gA3XR]. Typical dosing is 3–5 mg/kg/day for 3–6 months with close monitoring [^1124LK4j].

---

## Adjunctive and alternative therapies

- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists**: Consider in antihistamine-refractory CSU, especially with NSAID sensitivity or cold urticaria [^113Ujbhz] [^116Pcsy6].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Short-term rescue only (≤ 10 days) due to adverse effects [^114oHZyN] [^116Pcsy6].

- **Phototherapy**: NB-UVB or PUVA for symptomatic dermographism or solar urticaria [^113odjse] [^112ojnyH].

- **Alternative agents**: Dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, intravenous immunoglobulin for refractory cases [^117SCv2W] [^113tFPLY].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors**: Remibrutinib, fenebrutinib, acalabrutinib show promise in refractory CSU [^notfound].

- **Ligelizumab**: High-affinity anti-IgE antibody with superior efficacy to omalizumab in trials [^115fdmon].

- **Dupilumab**: IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor under investigation for refractory CSU [^113gA3XR].

---

## Special populations and considerations

In pregnancy, prefer cetirizine, levocetirizine, or desloratadine; **avoid cyclosporine and systemic corticosteroids**. In pediatrics, use second-generation H1 antihistamines first-line; omalizumab is approved for ages ≥ 12 years. In elderly patients, start at lower doses and monitor for sedation and cardiac effects. For autoimmune CSU, consider cyclosporine or omalizumab earlier [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and step-down strategies

Regularly assess disease activity and quality of life using UAS7, UCT, and DLQI [^115B7twK] [^116t2Ggg] [^113YaDnP]. After sustained control (≥ 6–12 months), **step down therapy** [^115cCfmk] and monitor for relapse [^116xmYpk].

---

## Unmet needs and future directions

Key gaps include a **lack of biomarkers** to predict response, limited long-term safety data for biologics, and the need for head-to-head trials comparing omalizumab, cyclosporine, and emerging agents [^111bQNPQ]. Chronic urticaria management is a **stepwise process** that balances efficacy, safety, and patient-specific factors, with omalizumab as the cornerstone for refractory disease and cyclosporine as a key alternative [^113juP2s].

### Potential therapeutic approaches for chronic urticaria: beyond H1-antihistamines and biologics [^112wcu4p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a disease that can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to function. There are effective treatment options, such as nonsedating antihistamines or biologics, but some patients do not respond to these therapies, or the therapies are not available or affordable to all patients. This review aims to summarize potential treatment strategies for patients (1) who do not respond to antihistamines and (2) cannot readily access or do not respond to biologics. The review emphasizes the importance of sound clinical practice, including correct diagnosis of chronic urticaria phenotypes, treatment of associated comorbidities, and consideration of add-on pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Although some treatments may lack high-quality evidence, they may still be justifiable in certain cases, provided that there is shared decision-making, regular reassessment, and early recognition of adverse events.

### Management of chronic spontaneous urticaria made practical: what every clinician should know [^115B7twK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its significant impact on quality of life, optimal management of chronic spontaneous urticaria remains challenging because of knowledge gaps regarding triggers, treatment response variability, and limited data for special populations. Second-generation H1-antihistamines are the first-line treatment and effective in approximately 50% of patients. For those who remain symptomatic, up-dosing up to fourfold is safe and recommended. However, prolonged ineffective antihistamine therapy should be avoided to prevent delayed disease control. In such cases, timely escalation to biologics, particularly omalizumab, is essential. Omalizumab remains the cornerstone of biologic therapy, offering rapid and sustained efficacy with an excellent safety profile. Personalized approaches involving dose escalation or interval adjustments further optimize outcomes. Cyclosporine A serves as an effective third-line option, particularly for autoimmune chronic spontaneous urticaria, but requires close monitoring because of dose-related adverse effects. Special considerations for children, pregnant individuals, and elderly people are discussed, reflecting the need for tailored approaches. Trigger avoidance, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may aid management, although evidence is limited for many suspected exacerbating factors. Regular assessment of disease activity and control using validated tools such as the Urticaria Activity Score and Urticaria Control Test is essential for guiding treatment decisions and monitoring response. Updated international guidelines are anticipated to address emerging therapies and current knowledge gaps.

### Existing and investigational medications for refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria: safety, adverse effects, and monitoring [^113LFFVS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is responsive to H1 antihistamines administered up to four times the recommended US Food and Drug Administration dose in approximately 50% of patients. However, when patients do not respond to these first-line agents, evidence-based guidelines using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology have provided direction for second- and third-line treatments that can effectively treat patients with CSU. Some patients remain refractory to these advanced treatments; therefore, alternative treatments with a lower certainty of evidence may be necessary. Regardless of the therapies used to treat CSU patients, it is essential for clinicians to be knowledgeable about the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety and monitoring recommendations of the treatments prescribed. This review provides a comprehensive review of the adverse effects and monitoring recommendations for agents in use for CSU treatment as well as those currently undergoing investigation for CSU treatment.

### Evaluation of pharmacologic treatments for H1 antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115fdmon]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The comparative benefits and harms of all available treatments for H1 antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) have not been established.

Objective

To evaluate different treatment effects of pharmacologic treatments among patients with H1 antihistamine-refractory CSU.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL from inception to April 19, 2021, with no language restrictions. Gray literature from Google Scholar, ongoing trial registers, and preprint reports was added to the searches of electronic databases.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials using validated measurement tools that investigated the benefits and harms of pharmacologic treatments among adolescent or adult patients with CSU who had an inadequate response to H1 antihistamines were screened for inclusion independently by 2 investigators.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently extracted study data according to the predefined list of interests. A random-effects model was used to calculate the network estimates reported as standardized mean differences and odds ratios with corresponding 95% CIs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes that reflect the patient's perspective included changes in urticaria symptoms from baseline and unacceptability of treatment (all-cause dropouts).

Results

Twenty-three randomized clinical trials with 2480 participants that compared 18 different interventions or dosages and placebo were included. The standardized mean differences for change in urticaria symptoms were -1.05 (95% CI, -1.37 to -0.73) for ligelizumab, 72 mg; -1.07 (95% CI, -1.39 to -0.75) for ligelizumab, 240 mg; -0.77 (95% CI, -0.91 to -0.63) for omalizumab, 300 mg; and -0.59 (95% CI, -1.10 to -0.08) for omalizumab, 600 mg. No significant differences in treatment unacceptability were observed. With respect to benefits and harms, the network estimates illustrated that the most efficacious treatments were achieved with ligelizumab, 72 or 240 mg (large beneficial effect) and omalizumab, 300 or 600 mg (moderate beneficial effect).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings in this meta-analysis suggest that the biologic agents ligelizumab, 72 or 240 mg, and omalizumab, 300 or 600 mg, can be recommended as effective treatments for patients with CSU who have had an inadequate response to H1 antihistamines. Head-to-head trials with high methodologic quality and harmonized design and outcome definitions are needed to help inform subsequent international guidelines for the management of CSU.

### Cost and cost-effectiveness of the management strategies of chronic urticaria: a systematic review [^112ievfT]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Although treatment for chronic urticaria (CU) has improved over the past decades, evidence regarding costs and net benefits associated with these treatment strategies have yet to be comprehensively characterized and synthesized.

Objective

To summarize the cost and cost-effectiveness of CU management strategies.

Evidence Review

An extensive systematic literature search of 6 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed Cochrane, Scopus, and CINAHL) and gray literature sources, without language restriction, was conducted and updated to March 23, 2024. Articles that performed cost analysis or full economic evaluation among patients with CU were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, such as annual costs of health care services or incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). All monetary values were converted and inflated to 2023 US dollars. Evidence-based synthesis for health benefit was judged using the Evidence Rating Matrix by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.

Findings

Seventeen unique studies (11 cost analysis studies and 6 full economic evaluations) were included. With the wide variation in health care resources, services that included biologic omalizumab utilization had higher annual health care cost estimations for CU management than services that did not include omalizumab prescription (median [IQR] cost, $6933 [$5988-$8717] vs $5621 [$2488-$8754]). The biologic omalizumab, 300 mg, for H1 antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) (3 studies) was found to have a median (IQR) ICER of $89 005 ($36 058-$145 694) per QALY (evidence rating as incremental or better; moderate certainty with substantial net health benefit). Routine laboratory testing among patients with CSU with otherwise normal histories and physical examination findings (1 study) had ICERs ranging from $1 427 928 to $1 950 524 per QALY (evidence rating as comparable or inferior; moderate certainty that the net health benefit is inferior).

Conclusions and Relevance

With limited evidence of cost-effectiveness, biologic omalizumab, 300 mg, for H1 antihistamine-refractory CSU was found to be cost-effective in US health care services at the willingness to pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY. Meanwhile, routine laboratory testing among patients with CSU without compelling indication was not cost-effective. Future studies in more diverse CU populations and resource settings are needed to fill evidence gaps.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of biologics and systemic immunomodulatory treatments for chronic urticaria: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113gA3XR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by itchy wheals (hives), angioedema, or both, lasting for 6 weeks or more. Beyond antihistamines, multiple systemic treatments are available, but there is uncertainty regarding their comparative effects on chronic urticaria outcomes.

Objective

We systematically synthesized the comparative benefits and harms of systemic treatments for chronic urticaria.

Methods

As part of updating the AAAAI/ACAAI JTFPP chronic urticaria guidelines, we searched Medline, Embase, Central, Chinese Biomedical Databases (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), and Wanfang from inception to February 4, 2025, for randomized trials addressing systemic immunomodulatory treatments, including phototherapy, for chronic urticaria. Paired reviewers screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Random effects Bayesian network meta-analyses addressed urticaria activity (comprising itch and wheal scores), angioedema activity, health-related quality of life, and adverse events. The GRADE approach informed certainty-of-evidence ratings (PROSPERO: CRD42023429819).

Results

We included 93 studies (n = 11,398; mostly adult and adolescent participants across 83 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies) that evaluated 42 interventions. With high certainty, standard-dose omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks) and remibrutinib are among the most effective for improving multiple patient-important outcomes. The safety profile of remibrutinib, however, is less certain. Dupilumab improved urticaria activity, but its impact on quality of life is uncertain, and no dupilumab trials addressed angioedema activity. Cyclosporine may be among the most effective for improving urticaria activity but may be among the most harmful in increasing the frequency of any adverse events. Azathioprine, dapsone, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate, sulfasalazine, and vitamin D may improve outcomes, while benralizumab, quilizumab, and tezepelumab may not differ from placebo, though the evidence is uncertain. Findings were consistent across age groups and baseline severity, and were robust to subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

Among individuals with chronic urticaria refractory to antihistamines, standard-dose omalizumab and remibrutinib are among the most effective drugs across multiple patient-important outcomes with a favorable safety profile across the studied duration. Cyclosporine may be effective but may be among the most harmful. Dupilumab improves itch and wheals, but it is uncertain whether it improves angioedema or quality of life. Lower doses of omalizumab are of intermediate effectiveness and favorable safety. The net benefit of conventional immunosuppressants is uncertain.

### Emerging therapeutics in chronic urticaria [^1115S6hF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common and long-lasting mast cell-mediated skin disease associated with psychiatric and autoimmune comorbidities, high economic costs, and considerable impact on quality of life. Available therapies show limited efficacy in many CU patients, which may be related to distinct underlying pathophysiology. Targeted and disease-modifying treatments with higher and broader efficacy are needed and are under development for CU. These novel drugs, small molecules, and monoclonal antibodies target mast cells and their receptors, signaling pathways, or mediators and other immune cells. In this article, the authors focus on the most promising emerging therapeutics in advanced development and discuss their potential place in future management of CU.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^112QZrpZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Unmet Needs, Knowledge Gaps, Future Studies

As outlined above, there are many unmet needs and knowledge gaps when it comes to the discontinuation of CSU treatment. Further studies are needed to obtain the evidence required to guide step-down decisions. Most importantly, we need to identify markers of spontaneous remission of CSU in patients with complete response to prophylactic treatment. In addition, we need to better characterize the benefits and challenges of stopping treatment all at once or by tapering, and the reasons for choosing either strategy. As the evidence and experience increase on when and how to discontinue CSU treatment, step-down recommendations should be included in future updates and revisions of the international urticaria guideline.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^112YiVpj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Why should stepping down treatment be considered in CSU patients? There are many possible reasons, such as safety concerns or issues, pregnancy or wanting to become pregnant, and economic factors. The most common reason in CSU patients who achieve complete control and freedom of signs and symptoms, is to check for spontaneous remission. The longer patients who are using treatment are in full control of their disease and have no signs and symptoms of CSU, the higher the chance of spontaneous remission of their CSU. As there are currently no biomarkers for the occurrence of spontaneous remission in treated patients without signs and symptoms, the only way to determine whether or not patients still need their treatment is to discontinue it. There are, however, no guideline recommendations or data from controlled studies on when and how to do this. Step down strategies and protocols vary widely, and looking at their pros and cons as well as the challenges linked to different strategies for stepping down therapy is important. Based on our experience and a review of the recent literature, we herein discuss strategies for discontinuation of treatment in complete responders with CSU, trying to form a better understanding and give an outline on what we know and what we don´t know.

### Therapeutic alternatives for chronic urticaria: an evidence-based review, part 1 [^113oDGN6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of alternative therapies for chronic urticaria refractory to first-line treatments in an evidence-based manner.

Data Sources

MEDLINE searches were performed cross-referencing urticaria with the names of multiple therapies. Articles were then reviewed for additional citations. Articles published after 1950 were considered.

Study Selection

All articles, including case reports, were reviewed for soundness and relevance.

Results

Experience has been reported for a wide variety of alternative therapies in the treatment of chronic idiopathic and physical urticarias. Evidence for most agents is limited to anecdotal reports. The second-line therapies reviewed are also categorized based on criteria of safety, efficacy, convenience, and cost, in relation to the first-line antihistamines.

Conclusions

Alternative agents should be considered in patients with chronic urticaria who are both severely affected and unresponsive to antihistamines. Although monitoring for toxicity is important in management with many alternative agents, safety is favorable compared with corticosteroids.

### Therapeutic alternatives for chronic urticaria: an evidence-based review, part 2 [^1143F7Me]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of alternative therapies for chronic urticaria refractory to first-line treatments in an evidence-based manner.

Data Sources

MEDLINE searches were performed cross-referencing urticaria with the names of multiple therapies. Articles were then reviewed for additional citations. Articles published after 1950 were considered.

Study Selection

All articles, including case reports, were reviewed for soundness and relevance.

Results

Experience has been reported for a wide variety of alternative therapies in the treatment of chronic idiopathic and physical urticarias. Evidence for most agents is limited to anecdotal reports. The therapies reviewed are also categorized based on criteria of safety, efficacy, convenience, and cost. The less preferred alternative agents in the second part of this review are divided between third-line therapies and others that are unable to be firmly recommended or that seem promising but lack substantial evidence.

Conclusions

Third-line alternative agents should be considered in patients with chronic urticaria who are severely affected and unresponsive to antihistamines and second-line therapies. Although monitoring for toxicity is important in management with third-line agents, safety remains favorable for most agents compared with corticosteroids.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria guidelines: what is new? [^1157LZBX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### How to manage chronic urticaria' beyond' guidelines: a practical algorithm [^111kvJmx]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a disease characterized by pruritic weals, angio-oedema or both occurring for at least 6 weeks. It encompasses spontaneous and inducible urticarias. The national and international guidelines outline the principles of treatment. Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody, has transformed the management of many severe and treatment-refractory patients. However, current UK guidance on its use does not address the needs of those with less severe disease, inducible urticarias, idiopathic histaminergic angio-oedema without weals as a presentation of CU and omalizumab non-responders. Our algorithm and a summary of the evidence to support its principles offers guidance and a more systematic targeted approach to using a range of 'off-label' agents for specific phenotypes of CU. It will be of use when guideline-recommended mast cell mediator antagonists fail to control symptoms and/or using omalizumab is ineffective, not practical or unfunded.

### Treatment of refractory chronic urticaria: current and future therapeutic options [^113tFPLY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a distressing disease that affects up to 1% of the general population at a time point in life and may severely worsen the quality of life. First-line treatment has been based on antihistamines, and presently relies on the use of non-sedating, second-generation antihistamines; following the recommendations of the recent international guidelines, in patients who do not respond to antihistamines at licensed doses, the daily dosage of these drugs can be increased up to fourfold. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients with chronic urticaria remain poorly controlled; in these cases, alternative therapeutic approaches have to be considered. This article critically reviews all of the third- and fourth-line treatment options suggested for patients whose disease is refractory to antihistamines, including systemic corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, several different anti-inflammatory drugs (dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine), various immunosuppressive drugs (calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), intravenous immunoglobulin, and newer treatment options, such as omalizumab and other biologic drugs. In addition, the article examines possible future treatment options based on recent findings about pathogenic mechanisms, and considers the treatment of antihistamine-unresponsive urticaria in special conditions such as children and pregnancy/lactation. The evidence supporting the use of several of the discussed drugs is presently limited and thus insufficient to recommend their routine use; as a consequence, such compounds should be considered only in specific cases and in adequate settings.

### Advances in the treatment of chronic urticaria [^112NcjVM]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There have been a number of exciting developments in the treatment of allergic diseases in recent years, but the development of new treatments for urticaria has lagged behind. The standard treatment for chronic urticaria (CU) involves the use of H1 antagonists. A number of small but promising studies have found potential benefit with medications that are used less often. This article reviews the established therapies for CU and the experimental evidence for the use of nonstandard and relatively unknown therapies. The potential usefulness of some of the new allergy medications for the treatment of CU also is discussed.

### Chronic urticaria: unmet needs, emerging drugs, and new perspectives on personalised treatment [^113juP2s]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a common and debilitating mast cell-driven skin disease presenting with itchy wheals, angio-oedema, or both. Chronic urticaria is classified as spontaneous (without definite triggers) and inducible (with definite and subtype-specific triggers; eg, cold or pressure). Current management guidelines recommend step-up administration of second-generation H1-antihistamines to four-fold the approved dose, followed by omalizumab and ciclosporin. However, in many patients, chronic urticaria does not respond to this linear approach due to heterogeneous underlying mechanisms. A personalised endotype-based approach is emerging based on the identification of autoantibodies and other drivers of urticaria pathogenesis. Over the past decade, clinical trials have presented promising options for targeted treatment of chronic urticaria with the potential for disease modification, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-cytokine therapies, and mast cell depletion. This Therapeutics article focuses on the evidence for these novel drugs and their role in addressing an unmet need for personalised management of patients with chronic urticaria.

### What's new in the treatment of urticaria and angioedema [^111qSgoj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria and angioedema are diseases often managed by Allergy and Immunology specialists. Recent international guidelines have outlined a stepwise approach to management of patients using dose escalation of second-generation antihistamines followed by use of omalizumab and finally cyclosporine in more refractory cases. In select patients (those with refractory chronic urticaria), nonbiologic alternative medications with anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant activity may be considered. Angioedema without wheals may have several different pathophysiologic mechanisms. Optimal management of mast cell-mediated angioedema is less clear but is often managed similar to chronic spontaneous urticaria. Drug-induced angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is a common cause of angioedema in the emergency department. Although bradykinin is thought to be a primary mediator for this type of angioedema, studies of targeted therapies have been generally disappointing. In contrast, several targeted therapies have been proven successful using acute and preventive approaches for management of hereditary angioedema. Further developments, including novel biologics, novel oral therapies, and gene therapy approaches, may hopefully continue to broaden therapeutic options to ensure optimal individual management of patients with hereditary angioedema.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^115aDTEG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), wheals, angioedema, or both appear spontaneously for > 6 weeks. Current recommended treatment options for urticaria target mast cell mediators such as histamine, or activators, such as autoantibodies. The goal of CSU treatment is to treat the disease until it is gone as effectively and safely as possible. As no cure is available for CSU as of now, the treatment is aimed at continuously suppressing disease activity, with complete control of the disease and a normalization of quality of life. To achieve this, pharmacological treatment should be continued until no longer needed. Treatment of CSU should follow the basic principles of treating as much as needed and as little as possible taking into consideration that the activity of the disease may vary. Since CSU is a disease with spontaneous remission, it is hard to tell, in patients with complete control and no signs or symptoms, when medication is no longer needed. The current international guideline for urticaria suggests that the treatment can be stepped down once a patient is free of signs and symptoms. Other reasons for stepping down the treatment of CSU patients include safety concerns or issues, pregnancy or wanting to become pregnant, and economic factors. As of now, it is unclear over which period, with what intervals and with which dosages CSU treatment should be stepped down. Guidance on this is needed for all recommended therapies: (i) standard-dosed second-generation H1-antihistamine (sgAH), (ii) higher than standard-dosed sgAH, (iii) standard-dosed omalizumab, (iv) higher than standard-dosed omalizumab, and (v) cyclosporine. However, there is a lack of controlled trials on the step down and discontinuation of these treatments. Here, we aim to provide a summary of what is known and what needs to be investigated in further studies, based on our own experience and real-world evidence.

### Treatment of chronic urticaria [^111Gd1Pt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are unquestionably the first-line treatment for chronic urticaria and can be used at higher than licensed doses if normal doses fail to control the disease. A short course of oral corticosteroids should be considered for patients not responding to antihistamines before trying other immunosuppressive drugs. Ciclosporin is effective in most antihistamine-resistant patients who require long-term corticosteroid treatments to control their disease. Omalizumab is effective in most subsets of chronic urticaria sufferers who do not respond to other treatments but its high cost represents a limitation to its widespread use.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^1124LK4j]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The working group analysed the studies (two persons independently for each intervention) by describing the effect estimates, biases and harms, then graded the level of evidence (from D – no direct research evidence, to A – several multicentric double‐blinded studies with concordant positive results and acceptable risks) after reaching unanimous consensus. The comments from the eight experts who were secondarily interviewed were incorporated into the recommendations, then the synthesis was submitted to a multidisciplinary panel of 28 reviewers, including health providers and patients, who scored each recommendation from 1 to 9.

The main points from the recommendations are as follows.
(i) A second‐generation H 1 antihistamine at a single dose is the recommended first‐line treatment for CSU. There is no evidence to favour one drug over another. Some H 1 antihistamines should be avoided in individuals who present a known increase in QT interval or those on enzymatic inhibitors.
(ii) In case of treatment insufficiency, the working group recommends a rapid increase in dosage (1 week to 2 months) until quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines, as a second‐line treatment.
(iii) The working group does not recommend the adjunction of H 2 antihistamines or montelukast to H 1 antihistamines in CSU, owing to the lack of demonstrated efficacy.
(iv) No studies assessed the efficacy or safety of systemic steroids in CSU. The working group does not currently recommend using them.
(v) As a third‐line treatment, in case of decreased QoL of individuals linked to refractory CSU, the working group recommends the adjunction of omalizumab (300 mg every 4 weeks)or ciclosporin (4–5 mg kg −1 per day during a 6‐month period) to H 1 antihistamines. Randomized controlled trials have shown that omalizumab is more effective than placebo, with good short‐term tolerance. No head‐to‐head trials have compared omalizumab and ciclosporin.
(vi) There is no evidence to indicate the optimal delay between the failure of quadruple dosage of H 1 antihistamines and initiation of omalizumab or ciclosporin; this would likely depend on the QoL of patients and the severity of the CSU.
(vii) Isolated studies of hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, high‐dose vitamin D, phototherapy and miltefosine for CSU have been published, but the working group does not recommend them because the data are too sparse.
(viii) The working group does not recommend systematic food exclusion diets because of no evidence of benefit for individuals with CSU. No prospective studies have been published to date on therapeutic education programmes and psychotherapy in CSU.
(ix) For children < 12 years old with CSU, single‐dose H 1 antihistamines can be used. The working group recommends favouring rupatadine and desloratadine in case of dosage escalation because more data are available than for other drugs. There is a real lack of evidence for third‐line treatments in paediatric populations.
(x) During pregnancy and breastfeeding, a single dose of cetirizine, levocetirizine or desloratadine is preferred because more safety data for these H 1 antihistamines are available. In case of refractory CSU, a specialized consultation is required.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^111bQNPQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, several drugs are considered effective for CSU. The impact on QoL should guide any therapeutic escalation. There is a need for randomized controlled trials (i) comparing omalizumab to immunosuppressive drugs, (ii) in paediatric individuals with CSU, and (iii) evaluating the usefulness of systemic steroids.

On behalf of the French Center of Evidence, these data led to a practical decision‐making algorithm (Figure 1) and are included on a dedicated website to provide an easy‐to‐use tool with a fast step‐by‐step navigation according to clinical situations.

### A comparison of the United States and international perspective on chronic urticaria Guidelines [^114gb3aW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous skin disorder that may be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. The European perspective is expressed in a recent international guideline and the American perspective has been based on the US Joint Task Force chronic urticaria practice parameter published in 2014. Both the international guideline (initiated by the European societies European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology [EAACI]/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network [GA 2 LEN]/European Dermatology Forum [EDF] in collaboration with the World Allergy Organization [WAO]) and the US (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology) guideline have been developed to help direct primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to developing consensus recommendations and these were then discussed in a Delphi conference including more than 250 specialists in the field and have been endorsed by more than 40 international societies. In contrast, the US Joint Task Force CU practice parameter made recommendations based on scientific evidence whenever possible; however, when there was insufficient evidence, recommendations were based on expert consensus opinion. Although both agree on most points regarding the definition, general evaluation, and treatment, there are some differences that exist between the 2 guidelines. Most of these differences pertain to recommendations based on expert opinion because of weak scientific evidence. Within this document, we compare the recommendations of these 2 groups, highlighting the key similarities and differences.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-omalizumab for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and in the paediatric population 12–17 years old [^115tAezR]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity and insufficient efficacy of classical drugs such as H 1 R-antihistamines. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of CSU, supporting the use of targeted treatment with omalizumab. However, many practical issues including selection of responders, the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based) and its cost-effectiveness still require further clarification. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of omalizumab in CSU follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome. In addition, future therapeutic approaches and perspectives as well as research priorities are discussed.

### Urticaria: a comprehensive review: treatment of chronic urticaria, special populations, and disease outcomes [^112hwX2j]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamines are considered first-line agents in the treatment of chronic urticaria because of their safety and efficacy profile. Some patients require higher doses of H 1 antihistamines alone or in combination with other classes of medications, including H 2 antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or first-generation H 1 antihistamines. One major therapeutic advance has been omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic urticaria that is unresponsive to H 1 antagonists. In addition, the second article in this continuing medical education series outlines several evidence-based alternative treatments for urticaria and the differences in recommendations between 2 major consensus groups (the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/World Allergy Organization and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force).

### Chronic urticaria [^117JkRPC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Chronic urticaria has a spectrum of clinical presentations and causes. About 50% of patients with "idiopathic" disease have histamine-releasing autoantibodies in their blood. The term autoimmune urticaria is increasingly being accepted for this subgroup of patients, in whom immunosuppressive therapies may be appropriate if conventional approaches to management are unsuccessful. This article reviews the classification, causes, and management of chronic urticaria in light of recent advances in the understanding of its etiology.

Learning Objective

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should have up-to-date knowledge of the classification, assessment, and management of chronic urticaria and understand where the concept of autoimmune urticaria fits into existing frameworks.

Antihistamines

What range of doses is more appropriate for antihistamines? Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses are the recommended first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate chronic urticaria. In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria in whom the standard dose is not effective, there is evidence that increasing the dose up to fourfold might control symptoms, without compromising the patient's safety. There have been no well-designed, randomized double-blind clinical trials comparing the efficacy of therapeutic and upgraded doses. Some studies have been performed in spontaneous chronic urticaria and in certain forms of inducible chronic urticaria using desloratadine (up to 20 mg), levocetirizine (up to 20 mg), cetirizine (up to 30 mg), fexofenadine (up to 240 mg), rupatadine (up to 20 mg) and bilastine (up to 80 mg), but they have had mixed results. Limited data are available for updosing, but considering the good safety profile of most second-generation antihistamines, it might be worth evaluating the efficacy of antihistamines at higher-than-licensed doses before switching to other therapies. Regarding the best way to apply this treatment, the guidelines advise to employ high doses of antihistamines as a second treatment step. However, as in the case of cold urticaria, a useful approach may include starting with four times higher dose, with subsequent dose reduction in the presence of a clinical response.

### The future of targeted therapy in chronic spontaneous urticaria [^113vBADL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria can be divided into 2 subsets: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with skin lesions occurring without a specific trigger and chronic inducible urticaria, which has an identified specific stimulus. The annual prevalence of chronic urticaria is 0.5% to 2.3% globally. The CSU is a self-limited disorder in most cases, with an average duration of 2 to 5 years, but symptoms persist beyond 5 years in up to 30% of patients. The first line of treatment is a daily nonsedating, second-generation H1-antihistamine. The CSU guidelines recommend using oral nonsedating antihistamines up to 4 fold in patients with CSU unresponsive to standard doses as the next step in treatment. A meta-analysis found that the rate of response in patients with CSU who responded to updosing was 63.2%. Therefore, approximately 40% of patients continue to have persistent hives and itching requiring treatment with the biologic omalizumab, based on evidence from randomized controlled trials. Although omalizumab has been shown to markedly relieve symptoms of CSU, omalizumab is not effective in all patients and has not been shown to induce long-term disease remission. Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective treatments that can lead to cure or long-term remission. In this review, we will provide an overview of new treatment targets and biologics that are under investigation for the treatment of CSU.

### Benefits and harms of omalizumab treatment in adolescent and adult patients with chronic idiopathic (spontaneous) urticaria: a meta-analysis of "Real-world" evidence [^116t2Ggg]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Omalizumab is indicated for the management of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) (also known as chronic spontaneous urticaria) in adolescents and adults with persistent hives not controlled with antihistamines. The effectiveness of omalizumab in the real-world management of CIU is largely unknown.

Objective

To quantitatively synthesize what is known about the benefits and harms of omalizumab in the real-world clinical management of CIU regarding urticaria activity, treatment response, and adverse events.

Data Sources

Published observational studies (January 1, 2006, to January 1, 2018) and scientific abstracts on the effectiveness of omalizumab in CIU were identified using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane search engines; references were searched to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

Included studies were observational in design and included at least 1 outcome in common with other studies and at a concurrent time point of exposure to omalizumab. A total of 67 articles (35.2% of those screened) were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed; independent selection and data extraction were completed by 2 observers. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were change in weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7; range, 0–42), change in Urticaria Activity Score (UAS; range 0–6) (higher score indicating worse outcome in both scales), complete and partial response rates (percentages), and adverse event rate (percentage).

Results

Omalizumab therapy was associated with an improvement in UAS7 scores (-25.6 points, 95% CI, -28.2 to -23.0; P < .001; 15 studies, 294 patients), an improvement in UAS scores (-4.7 points, 95% CI, -5.0 to -4.4, P < .001; 10 studies, 1158 patients), an average complete response rate of 72.2% (95% CI, 66.1%-78.3%; P < .001; 45 studies, 1158 patients) with an additional average partial response rate of 17.8% (95% CI, 11.7%-23.9%; P < .001; 37 studies, 908 patients), and an average adverse event rate of 4.0% (95% CI, 1.0%-7.0%; P < .001; any level of severity, 47 studies, 1314 patients).

Conclusions and Relevance

Benefits and safety of omalizumab in the real-world treatment of CIU meet or exceed results gleaned from clinical trials. These real-world data on omalizumab in CIU may help inform both clinical treatment expectations and policy decision making.

### The expanding field of biologics in the management of chronic urticaria [^116JfojX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is the occurrence of urticaria with or without angioedema for at least 6 weeks. Management has traditionally involved antihistamines as first-line therapy with various alternative therapies for refractory cases. Largely based on the success of biologics for various diseases, this class of drugs has come to the forefront of medical research. The first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic for the management of CU is omalizumab (humanized anti-IgE mAb). In the past decade, a substantial amount of research has been centered on the mechanism of action, efficacy, dosing, and safety of omalizumab. This review will focus on the data surrounding the management of CU with omalizumab, off-label use of other biologics for CU, and biologics currently under investigation for use in CU. We will also discuss management considerations and areas of interest for future research.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^112hsLtp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Background

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), a common disorder with a global prevalence of about 1%, is defined by the spontaneous occurrence of itchy wheals, angioedema or both, without any apparent reason, for > 6 weeks.

In virtually all cases, CSU is a self-limiting disorder with spontaneous remission after 2–5 years, although about 20–50% of patients have CSU for > 5 years. CSU is often debilitating, difficult to treat, and frustrating for both patients and physicians. More than half of patients have moderate-to-severe disease activity. CSU poses a substantial burden for patients, for example by markedly interfering with sleep and daily activities, thus impairing quality of life (QoL).

CSU is treated following recommendations from the international guideline on the management of urticaria. According to these recommendations, treatment should be adjusted to the patient´s individual and specific needs, to provide complete control and protection from all signs and symptoms of CSU. In the newest update of this guideline, the International EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EuroGuiDerm/APAAACI Urticaria Guideline, this treatment strategy has been supplemented with an "as much as necessary and as little as possible" approach. The treatment is to be adjusted according to how well the disease is under control, based on the outcome of the urticaria control test (UCT).

Chronic idiopathic urticaria is a rare but significantly life-altering skin disease. Recent developments in immunology have promoted our understanding of its autoimmune pathology, but treatment options have not yet developed at the same pace. When antihistamines aren't sufficient, the next steps for treatment have less evidence for support. Fortunately, a Phase III clinical trial has shown that the monoclonal antibody omalizumab, approved for use in asthma, can reduce symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria when added to maximal doses of H1-antihistamines. Therapeutic options for chronic idiopathic urticaria are reviewed.

### Cost-effectiveness of personalized omalizumab dosing for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^11213xc6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The licensed dose for omalizumab within Europe for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is 300mg every 4weeks, and is based on the most effective dose identified in clinical trials. However, many patients require longer-term treatment with omalizumab and there is limited guidance on how to manage these patients. We report on a large cohort of 357 patients with CSU who have been treated over a 10-year period on a personalized dosing regimen. Our results showed a 4% reduction in drug cost for this personalized dosing regimen compared with having all patients on the standard regimen of omalizumab 300mg every 4weeks. In addition, by increasing the dose, we were able to treat 22% of patients more effectively, using the principle aim of zero CSU symptoms; prior to this regimen, these patients had been achieving only partial response. Omalizumab doses and frequency should be adjusted depending on clinical response to allow for improved benefits for both patients and healthcare systems.

### Urticaria [^113XJdqh]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Urticaria has been known as a disease since antiquity. However, in the last decades an increasing understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis has shown the high heterogeneity of different urticaria subtypes. Clear distinction of the subtypes is required not only to choose the correct measures in diagnosis and management, but also to interpret the available data in research. The subtypes can be grouped into spontaneous urticaria, which includes acute urticaria and chronic urticaria, the physical urticarias, special types of urticaria including, e.g. contact urticaria, and diseases related to urticaria for historical reasons, e.g. urticaria pigmentosa. Most urticaria subtypes have a profound impact on the quality of life and effective treatment is thus required in case the diagnostic procedures do not reveal a cause which can be treated. Although, for symptomatic relief, nonsedating H1-antihistamines are the first choice in most subtypes of urticaria, double-blind controlled studies have shown that dosages required may exceed those recommended for other diseases, e.g. allergic rhinitis. Alternative treatments should be reserved for unresponsive patients.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: a literature review [^115PFM8Y]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurring wheals that last 6 weeks or longer without an identifiable cause. The estimated point prevalence of CSU worldwide is 1%. Furthermore, it has a significant impact on quality of life in both adults and pediatric patients and their families. Although it is most often a self-limited disease, some patients have urticaria refractory to first-line treatment: second-generation H1 antihistamines. In these patients, the use of targeted monoclonal antibodies is necessary. While omalizumab is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibody for CSU, others, including ligelizumab, dupilumab, benralizumab, and several orally administered Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are also promising therapeutics for reducing the morbidity of CSU. Novel therapies, among others discussed here, are rapidly being developed with new trials and therapeutics being released nearly monthly. Thus, we performed a scoping literature review of randomized controlled trials studying targeted therapies for CSU. We also discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and future research directions in CSU.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^116xmYpk]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stepping-down strategies differ across the five guideline-recommended treatment protocols. The latter include the use of a standard-dosed sgAH, the first-line treatment for CSU, stepping up the sgAH dose, omalizumab treatment at standard or higher than standard dose, and cyclosporine (Table 2).

Table 2
Guideline-recommended treatment options for CSU

How to Step Down and Discontinue Second-Generation H1-Antihistamine (sgAH) Treatment

In patients with complete response to daily treatment with a standard-dosed sgAH, discontinuation should be considered after 3–6 months of uninterrupted complete control and complete freedom of signs and symptoms. A standard-dosed sgAH is usually stopped all at once, but some patients benefit from taking their sgAH every other day for 1–2 weeks before they stop it for good. Re-treatment upon relapse should be maintained for 3–6 months of complete response before another attempt at treatment discontinuation is considered.

In patients who achieve complete response with a higher than standard-dose sgAH, we usually maintain that dose for 3 months before we consider reducing the dose. Dose reduction is highly individual, ranging from a reduction by one tablet every month to halving the dose every week. All step-down strategies have the common goal of finding the lowest sgAH dose that provides complete control and complete protection from CSU signs and symptoms. When the reduction of the sgAH dose results in relapse, patients are advised to recommence treatment with the last dose that provided complete response, which is then maintained until 3–6 months of continuous complete control and freedom from CSU signs and symptoms are achieved. Breakthrough wheals or angioedema that occur during this time prompt a reset (and possibly a dose escalation). After 3–6 months of complete response, patients are advised to try again to step down and eventually discontinue their sgAH treatment.

### Chronic urticaria: advances in understanding of the disease and clinical management [^112BXKxk]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common skin condition characterized by the recurrence of wheals, with or without angioedema, which lasts for at least 6 weeks. Owing to its pruritus and incurability, this disease adversely affects the patients' physical and mental health and diminishes the quality of life. CU is generally classified into two subtypes based on the relevance of eliciting factors: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), the latter of which is further divided into several subtypes. To improve the understanding and clinical management of this highly heterogeneous disorder, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline was developed and published in 2018 based on evidence and expert consensus. The diagnostic and treatment algorithms proposed by the guideline have largely facilitated dermatologists in clinical practice. However, several questions remained unsolved and have been widely investigated in the recent years. First, a better understanding of the association between chronic urticaria and its potential underlying causes or eliciting factors such as autoimmunity, infections, coagulation aberrance, and vitamin D deficiency is warranted. This would lead to updates in the diagnostic and treatment procedures of different subtypes of chronic urticaria. Secondly, treatment for recalcitrant cases, especially those resistant to or intolerant of second-generation antihistamines and (or) omalizumab, calls for novel therapeutic measures or strategies. In the present review, we summarized recent advances in the understanding and management of both CSU and CIndU, with special emphasis on their underlying causes or eliciting factors, pathogenic mechanisms, potential targets for intervention, and advances in treatment strategies.

### Omalizumab in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria: a systematic review and GRADE assessment [^115W7hq2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by the occurrence of hives, angio-oedema or both for a period of at least 6 weeks. Many patients remain symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines, even at higher doses. This systematic review assessed the quality of the evidence for the effects of omalizumab as treatment in patients with CSU. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 7 August 2014. Three review authors independently carried out study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Two review authors analysed the data. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included 1116 participants, were evaluated. All the RCTs were judged as having a low risk of bias. There was a statistically significant improvement in measures of disease activity and quality of life following treatment with omalizumab when compared with placebo [mean difference (MD) -11.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.39 to -9.77 and MD -13.12, 95% CI -16.30 to -9.95, respectively]. Complete response and partial response were more frequent after treatment with omalizumab [risk ratio (RR) 6.44, 95% CI 3.95–10.49 and RR 4.08, 95% CI 2.98–5.60, respectively]. There was no difference in the proportion of participants reporting adverse events between the omalizumab and placebo treatment groups (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96–1.16). There was high-quality evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of omalizumab 300 mg per month for the treatment of CSU for up to 6 months.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria: the devil's itch [^112mTAGF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined as the presence of urticaria for a period exceeding 6 weeks, assuming symptoms for most days of the week. It is divided into chronic inducible urticarias and chronic spontaneous urticaria, previously termed chronic idiopathic urticaria. The latter designation emphasizes that patients can experience urticaria independent of any exogenous stimulus even if one can define circumstances that may worsen symptoms. A search for such an external "cause" is fruitless because the underlying abnormality is "intrinsic", whether it is autoimmune, or some unknown process. Approximately 40% of patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria report accompanying episodes of angioedema, whereas 10% have angioedema as their primary manifestation. In most cases, it is a self-limiting disorder, persisting for 2 to 5 years in most cases, although 20% of patients suffer for more than 5 years. The treatment that has evolved is largely empiric, based on double-blind, placebo-controlled studies whenever possible, but is not yet targeted to any particular pathogenic mechanism. In this article, we review the current status regarding pathogenesis, discuss the diagnostic workup, and update the approach to treatment including consideration of published guidelines, our own experience, and guideline updates that are being prepared.

### Chronic inducible urticaria: a systematic review of treatment options [^114TN3eP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic inducible urticaria (CindU) is a condition characterized by the appearance of recurrent wheals, angioedema, or both as a response to specific and reproducible triggers.

Objective

We sought to systematically assess evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options for CindU. Results were used to inform the 2017 update of "The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis and management of urticaria".

Methods

Randomized controlled trials and controlled intervention studies were searched systematically in various databases. Included studies were evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Where possible, results from single studies were meta-analyzed, applying the Mantel-Haenszel approach by using a random-effects model (Der Simonian-Laird).

Results

We identified 30 studies that included patients with cold urticaria, symptomatic dermographism, delayed-pressure urticaria, or cholinergic urticaria. No studies on other forms of CindU were eligible. Risk of bias was often rated as unclear or high. Overall, second-generation antihistamines were more effective than placebo, and available data indicate that updosing might be effective. Omalizumab proved effective in patients with symptomatic dermographism, who did not respond to antihistamines. Detailed results are given for each type of CindU.

Conclusions

The available evidence is limited by small samples, heterogeneous efficacy outcomes, and poor reporting quality in many of the included studies. The findings are congruent with the suggested stepwise approach to treating CindUs. However, the data do not allow for drawing specific conclusions for specific subtypes of CindU.

### The burden of chronic spontaneous urticaria is substantial: real-world evidence from ASSURE-CSU [^1136FSFT]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a chronic, disabling disease with little previous research that is challenging to treat adequately. The humanistic and economic burden of CSU has been underestimated. There is considerable delay in diagnosis and specialist referral, and there is inadequate knowledge among medical staff in primary and secondary care about CSU. Incorrect treatment patterns have been identified, and the high cost of unnecessary investigations and treatments is due to poor compliance with guidelines and best practices. Additional analyses should explore these findings in detail. To address unmet needs in CSU, it will be important to promote treatment guidelines and evidence‐based practices among healthcare providers.

### Chronic urticaria: clinical aspects and focus on a new antihistamine, levocetirizine [^112f9gQ6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) involves release of histamine from mast cells and/or basophils, which in turn promotes the classic inflammatory cascade. The resultant symptoms can severely impact sufferers' quality of life and in severe cases prevent them from leading a normal existence, with consequent burdens on family and society. Rapid initiation of effective reliable therapy is important in combating CU, together with avoidance of triggers or exacerbating factors, if known. While newer immunologically-based therapies are beginning to be developed, antihistamines remain a cornerstone of effective therapy. Treatment should be tailored to individual patient circumstances, but in principle the choice of antihistamine component should be governed by the availability of evidence of rapid and prolonged efficacy specifically in CU and evidence of good tolerability and safety. Increasingly, evidence of beneficial effects on patient quality of life is also required for rational selection of an antihistamine from amongst those available. Levocetirizine is a new single-isomer antihistamine with a proven efficacy on chronic urticaria as documented in two recent clinical studies, which have included effectiveness and quality of life assessments.

### Omalizumab for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115Jcsv8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined by itchy hives, angioedema, or both for at least 6 weeks. Omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody that affects mast cell and basophil function, is a promising new treatment option. As of now, however, the efficacy and safety of different doses of omalizumab used in clinical trials for CSU have not been systematically analyzed and summarized.

Objective

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of omalizumab for the treatment of CSU in a meta-analysis of clinical trial results.

Methods

Suitable trials were identified by searching PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases and with the help of omalizumab's manufacturers. Only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies with omalizumab-treated versus placebo-treated patients with CSU were included in this analysis.

Results

We identified 7 randomized, placebo-controlled studies with 1312 patients with CSU. Patients treated with omalizumab (75–600 mg every 4 weeks) had significantly reduced weekly itch and weekly wheal scores compared with the placebo group. Omalizumab's effects were dose dependent, with the strongest reduction in weekly itch and weekly wheal scores observed with 300 mg. Rates of complete response were significantly higher in the omalizumab group (relative risk, 4.55; P < .00001) and dose dependent, with the highest rates in the 300-mg group. Rates of patients with adverse events were similar in the omalizumab and placebo groups.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis provides high-quality evidence for the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CSU and for treating these patients with 300 mg of omalizumab every 4 weeks.

### Therapy of chronic urticaria: a simple, modern approach [^1145z9ca]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the available treatment choices for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and discuss a new paradigm for treating such patients.

Data Sources

The literature regarding treatment is reviewed, including considerations of published guidelines. Attention is focused on the most recent evidence indicating particular efficacy of omalizumab.

Results

Omalizumab has been found to have considerable efficacy in phase 2 and phase 3 trials in which more than 900 patients have been studied. A response rate of 65% is seen in patients resistant to antihistamines as well as to histamine2 blockers and leukotriene antagonists, and 40% of patients are completely free of hives as long as therapy is continued. In addition, serious adverse events have not been seen. Only cyclosporine can match this response rate (excluding steroids), but the adverse effect profile (blood pressure and renal function) is substantial by comparison. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of other agents often listed as alternatives are lacking (ie, whether their success rate exceeds the 25%-30% placebo response is uncertain). The mechanism by which omalizumab works in CSU is not clear because the response rate is unrelated to the autoimmune profile and can occur rapidly (ie, within a few days).

Conclusion

Omalizumab has exceptional efficacy for antihistamine-resistant CSU with an excellent adverse effect profile.

### Guidelines for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria: recommendations supported by the centre of evidence of the French society of dermatology [^114ucG9R]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

, Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is an inflammatory disease characterized by spontaneous weals or angio‐oedema for more than 6 weeks. The natural history of the disease is resolution within several months or years, and treatment is necessary to limit flares, reduce pruritus and improve quality of life (QoL). Numerous medical drugs are available, all having suspensive effects on CSU. International guidelines from the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/UNEV were published in 2018, but practice remains heterogeneous, especially for CSU refractory to H 1 antihistamines and regarding states' official drug approval and reimbursement policies.

The Centre of Evidence of the French Society of Dermatology formulated recommendations on treatments for CSU based on evidence from the literature and on consensus expert opinion. Firstly, a multidisciplinary working group, composed of eight health professionals including a biostatistician, with no conflicts of interest regarding the pharmaceutical industry, performed systematic reviews of all interventions, except for alternative treatments. The French National Health Authority performed the research of articles, including any therapeutic prospective study published between 2000 and 2017 found on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS and PsycINFO. Articles on diets and paediatric populations were included from 1995 because they were much fewer in number. Articles on H 1 and H 2 antihistamines were included after the inclusion periods of the systematic reviews from the Cochrane Collaboration, which were thus updated.

### Cost-effectiveness of personalized omalizumab dosing for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^117SqSWi]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The licensed dose for omalizumab within Europe for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is 300 mg every 4 weeks, and is based on the most effective dose identified in clinical trials. However, many patients require longer‐term treatment with omalizumab and there is limited guidance on how to manage these patients. We report on a large cohort of 357 patients with CSU who have been treated over a 10‐year period on a personalized dosing regimen. Our results showed a 4% reduction in drug cost for this personalized dosing regimen compared with having all patients on the standard regimen of omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks. In addition, by increasing the dose, we were able to treat 22% of patients more effectively, using the principle aim of zero CSU symptoms; prior to this regimen, these patients had been achieving only partial response. Omalizumab doses and frequency should be adjusted depending on clinical response to allow for improved benefits for both patients and healthcare systems.

### Towards personalised therapy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: advancing from endotype to clinical response [^115GBvjG]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

In the emerging era of personalised medicine, early identification of the most effective treatment for an individual patient is attractive. While there has been a focus on nonresponse to high dose antihistamines in CSU, predicting treatment response to third and fourth‐line treatments and indeed newer treatments is less well understood. Furthermore, identifying which patients may require increased doses or prolonged courses of omalizumab is an important consideration. In a meta‐analysis of 67 observational studies assessing clinical response to omalizumab, the average nonresponse rate was 7% with a partial response rate of 17.8%. As treatment options for nonresponders to anti‐IgE treatments emerge, biomarkers that prospectively identify optimal treatments are essential. Here, we review the role of clinical and laboratory markers in predicting treatment response to currently available third and fourth‐line treatments as well as emerging treatments in CSU.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^117Btbxz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and initial treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria. Urticaria/angioedema with systemic signs can occur in anaphylaxis, and epinephrine should be prescribed if the diagnosis of anaphylaxis has not been excluded. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and empiric elimination diets (not guided by history and testing) are not recommended; extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution of acute urticaria and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing when significant dermatographism is present; skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases but might occasionally be useful for differentiating from other inflammatory disorders. Common causes, including medications and foods, should be identified by detailed history and eliminated if possible. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills, whereas these impairments are less evident or not evident with second-generation antihistamines as a class. In patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing an effective plan.

### From research to practice: the latest data on evolving treatments for chronic spontaneous urticaria [^112F2Whs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) should be on every dermatology practitioner's radar. CSU is a skin disorder marked by wheals, angioedema, or both for more than 6 weeks. Patients with CSU experience unexplained, itchy wheals that appear and disappear, traveling around the body and lasting less than 24 hours per area. Angioedema accompanies wheals for up to 48 hours in around half of cases. CSU is a diagnosis of exclusion, relying heavily on patient history to differentiate CSU symptoms from other causes of urticaria or angioedema. But reassuringly, CSU has a simple diagnostic algorithm and a clear initial treatment path. First-line strategies include non-pharmacologic approaches, and second-generation antihistamines (2gAH) administered up to 4 times their standard dose. Omalizumab and cyclosporine (off-label) are second- and third-line options, respectively. However, many patients will continue to have CSU symptoms despite consistent maximum-dose treatment. Novel therapies, including biologic agents and small molecule drugs targeting mast cell activation and inflammatory mediators, show promise in treating CSU refractory to standard therapy. However, further research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety in clinical practice. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23:9(Suppl 2):s5–14. Access the CME Activity.

### Stepping down treatment in chronic spontaneous urticaria: what we know and what we don't know [^116Pq47h]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

How do we step down higher than standard-dosed omalizumab treatment? Here, the aim is to first reduce the dose of omalizumab to the standard dose. We advise our patients to try this after the use of higher than standard-dosed omalizumab has provided ≥ 3 months of complete control. To this end, patients on shorter than standard injection intervals extend their interval by 1 week at a time, until they reach the standard interval of 4 weeks. Patients who treat with 450 mg or 600 mg reduce the dose by 150 mg every 1–3 months, until they reach the standard dose of 300 mg. Patients who treat with 450 mg or 600 mg omalizumab every 2–3 weeks step down their treatment by dose reduction or interval extension, not both. Once the standard dose has been achieved while maintaining complete response, we proceed as outlined above.

How to Step Down and Discontinue Cyclosporine

In patients who use cyclosporine, with or without omalizumab, we step down cyclosporine after 6 months of maximum treatment. We stop cyclosporine by reducing the dose gradually or all at once, depending on individual patient needs and expectations. When cyclosporine is reduced gradually, we recommend to reduce by 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

### Evaluation of a guidelines-based approach to the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria [^113YaDnP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

International scientific associations have made recommendations for the management of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that have been summarized in clinical guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical impact of guideline recommendations for CSU management.

Methods

A multicenter, triple-blinded, prospective, randomized study (the Urticaria Research of Tropical Impact and Control Assessment project; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01940393) was performed. Patients older than 12 years and diagnosed with CSU were recruited and treated according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization guideline recommendations. The Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) was assessed every 2 weeks. As a first line of treatment, patients received a daily oral dose of antihistamine. After 4 weeks, in those patients without clinical response (DLQI ≤ 5), a higher dose (up to 4 times) of antihistamine was administered as a second line of therapy. After 2 months of follow-up, unresponsive patients received omalizumab or cyclosporine (as add-on therapy) for 4 months as a third line of treatment.

Results

One hundred fifty patients were enrolled. After the first line of treatment, 88 patients (58.7%) reached a DLQI of 5 or less. With the second line of treatment, disease control rate was 76.7%. With the third line, 12 patients from the omalizumab group (8%) and 11 patients from the cyclosporine group (7.3%) reached a good clinical control (additional 15.3%). Control rate with line 1 treatment was superior at 1 month than at 2 weeks (P < .0001).

Conclusions

The application of these guideline recommendations for CSU led to a high rate of disease control, assessed by scoring severity and patients' perception of quality of life. These results support the usefulness of guideline recommendations.

How to Step Down and Discontinue Omalizumab Treatment

When the recommended initial dose of omalizumab (i.e. 300 mg every 4 weeks) results in complete response for at least 3 months, our first step-down measure is the reduction of concomitant sgAHs, which most patients use at higher than standard dose when they start omalizumab. Virtually all complete responders to omalizumab can discontinue their sgAH intake without losing complete control. This is usually done by reducing the sgAH by one tablet or half the dose every week, although some patients prefer to do this more slowly.

In patients with complete response to standard-dosed omalizumab monotherapy, we usually consider treatment step down and discontinuation after 1 year and virtually never before 6 months of complete response. Importantly, breakthrough attacks during this year indicate that spontaneous remission has not yet occurred and these reset our 1-year timer. After 1 year of PROM-controlled complete response, we usually advise patients to increase their omalizumab injection intervals by one week. When this results in the reappearance of CSU signs and symptoms, patients are advised to continue treatment with the longest interval that had previously provided complete response, for 1 year, before step down and discontinuation is tried again. The vast majority of patients who can extend their omalizumab treatment interval to 8 weeks without relapse can stop their treatment for good. This is supported by a recent study with 19 CSU patients with complete response to omalizumab treatment for at least 6 months, who extended their treatment interval by 1 week for each treatment and stopped omalizumab after reaching 8- to 9-week intervals. Nine of these 19 patients were able to discontinue omalizumab this way, whereas the others relapsed after extending intervals to 5 or 6 weeks. Omalizumab can also be stopped all at once, and some patients prefer this. Based on published evidence and our clinical experience, both strategies are effective, and rates of relapse are similar. One of the benefits of the interval extension strategy is the minimization of time to retreatment in patients who show relapse. More importantly, it can help patients identify their best (i.e. longest) individual injection intervals, which can be used for treatment continuation if needed. Stopping all at once, for some patients, is easier to manage than interval extension. Both strategies should see patients document their response to treatment discontinuation with the help of PROMs, so that retreatment can be started if needed.

Summary Statement 85 states "A number of alternative therapies have been studied for the treatment of CU; these therapies merit consideration for patients with refractory CU". The text notes that "as many as 50% of these patients might not achieve satisfactory control with antihistamine therapy", and alternatives are evaluated "to reduce the need for systemic corticosteroids". Summary Statement 86 adds that anti-inflammatory agents "including dapsone, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine, have limited evidence for efficacy… and some require laboratory monitoring for adverse effects", yet "are generally well tolerated, might be efficacious in properly selected patients, and can be considered for treatment of patients with antihistamine-refractory CU".

Acute urticaria and angioedema — definition, evaluation, and treatment: Urticaria and angioedema with duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, and if urticaria of less than 6 weeks' duration has features suggesting it might progress, patients should be periodically re-evaluated until a diagnosis is clarified. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness is also not required unless supported by the clinical history or physical examination, and although many cases are infectious, extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens or antiviral therapy is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. For acute urticaria, skin testing or immunoassays can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested by history, usually after resolution and after suspension of antihistamines or via serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism, and skin biopsy is not indicated in most cases though it might occasionally be useful to differentiate from other inflammatory disorders. For treatment, antihistamines are efficacious in most cases and recommended as first-line therapy; first-generation antihistamines are rapidly acting but can be associated with sedation and impaired motor skills compared with second-generation agents, patients should be warned about drowsiness or impaired performance, and in poor responders a brief course of oral corticosteroids might also be required while eliminating triggers and forming an effective plan.

### Omalizumab for the treatment of chronic idiopathic or spontaneous urticaria [^116inEhD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Many patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (also called chronic spontaneous urticaria) do not have a response to therapy with H-antihistamines, even at high doses. In phase 2 trials, omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody that targets IgE and affects mast-cell and basophil function, has shown efficacy in such patients.

Methods

In this phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic idiopathic urticaria who remained symptomatic despite H-antihistamine therapy (licensed doses). We randomly assigned 323 patients to receive three subcutaneous injections, spaced 4 weeks apart, of omalizumab at doses of 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg or placebo, followed by a 16-week observation period. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in a weekly itch-severity score (ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe itching).

Results

The baseline weekly itch-severity score was approximately 14 in all four study groups. At week 12, the mean (± SD) change from baseline in the weekly itch-severity score was -5.1 ± 5.6 in the placebo group, -5.9 ± 6.5 in the 75-mg group (P = 0.46), -8.1 ± 6.4 in the 150-mg group (P = 0.001), and -9.8 ± 6.0 in the 300-mg group (P < 0.001). Most prespecified secondary outcomes at week 12 showed similar dose-dependent effects. The frequency of adverse events was similar across groups. The frequency of serious adverse events was low, although the rate was higher in the 300-mg group (6%) than in the placebo group (3%) or in either the 75-mg or 150-mg group (1% for each).

Conclusions

Omalizumab diminished clinical symptoms and signs of chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients who had remained symptomatic despite the use of approved doses of H-antihistamines. (Funded by Genentech and Novartis Pharma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01292473.).

### Chronic inducible urticaria [^1169J6Nu]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) is characterized by the appearance of hives (urticaria) and/or angioedema in response to specific triggers or stimuli. For accurate diagnosis, anamnesis-driven specific, and if available, standardized trigger testings, as well as patient reported outcomes, should be applied. The currently recommended treatment algorithm is the same as for chronic spontaneous urticaria but is largely off-label for CIndU. New, and possibly more disease-specific, treatment options are needed for CIndU patients, who are often severely impacted by their disease. Several clinical trials are currently ongoing.

### Urticaria: a review [^111AUH2f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Urticaria is often classified as acute, chronic, or physical based on duration of symptoms and the presence or absence of inducing stimuli. Urticarial vasculitis, contact urticaria, and special syndromes are also included under the broad heading of urticaria. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria include the finding of autoantibodies to mast cell receptors in nearly half of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. These patients may have more severe disease and require more aggressive therapies. Extensive laboratory evaluation for patients with chronic urticaria is typically unrevealing and there are no compelling data that associate urticaria with chronic infections or malignancy. Pharmacologic therapy consists primarily of the appropriate use of first- and second-generation histamine H(1) receptor antihistamines. Additional therapy may include leukotriene receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents for severe, unremitting disease. Despite our greater understanding of the pathogenesis of urticaria, the condition remains a frustrating entity for many patients, particularly those with chronic urticaria.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^114eW7b7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

What's already known about this topic?

The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for management of urticaria recommends second-generation 'nonsedating' H 1 -antihistamines as first-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).
However, it is common practice to add a sedating H 1 -antihistamine, such as hydroxyzine, at night in the belief that it will reduce itch and improve the quality of sleep.

What does this study add?

This study compared 5-day treatment of CSU with the second-generation H 1 -antihistamine, levocetirizine (20 mg daily), with levocetirizine (15 mg daily) plus hydroxyzine (50 mg nightly).
The treatments were equally effective in decreasing symptoms and night-time sleep disturbances and increasing quality of life, but the addition of night-time hydroxyzine significantly increased daytime somnolence.
The belief that addition of a night-time sedating H 1 -antihistamine is of benefit in the treatment of CSU is unfounded.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a relatively common condition, with 0.5–1.0% of the population suffering from it at any single time. Of the symptoms of this condition, pruritus is the most bothersome, particularly at night when it causes sleep disturbances. These disturbances in sleep lead to chronic fatigue, with a direct impact on quality of life (QoL) and physical and emotional well-being, which may be assessed for chronic urticaria using specifically designed questionnaires such as the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q 2 oL). In addition, it has been reported that pruritic skin diseases impair workplace productivity, classroom productivity and daily activity by 39%, 45% and 42%, respectively.

Because chronic urticaria has such a profound impact on QoL, effective treatment is required. The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/World Allergy Organization guideline for management of urticariarecommends second-generation 'nonsedating' H 1 -antihistamines as first-line treatment. It also states that if standard dosing is not effective, increasing the dosage up to fourfold is recommended. This recommendation is reiterated in other, newer international guidelines.

### Treatment of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria [^111a4FbV]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) involves reducing symptoms with the least invasive therapy and carefully balancing risk and benefit. The mainstay of therapy is the use of antihistamines with or without the use of intermittent pulses of corticosteroids. Alternative therapies to chronic corticosteroids include leukotriene antagonists, plasma-phoresis, dapsone, stanazolol, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, and warfarin. A practical approach to CIU bases treatment and severity on the patients' previous response to therapy. Therapy goals are to reduce symptoms until spontaneous resolution occurs. Management of CIU patients can be both frustrating and rewarding.

### Efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids for urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114oHZyN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Short courses of adjunctive systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to treat acute urticaria and chronic urticaria flares (both with and without mast cell-mediated angioedema), but their benefits and harms are unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating acute urticaria or chronic urticaria flares with versus without systemic corticosteroids.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM databases from inception to July 8, 2023, for randomized controlled trials of treating urticaria with versus without systemic corticosteroids. Paired reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and appraised risk of bias with the Cochrane 2.0 tool. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of urticaria activity, itch severity, and adverse events. We assessed certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

Results

We identified 12 randomized trials enrolling 944 patients. For patients with low or moderate probability (17.5%-64%) to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improve urticaria activity by a 14% to 15% absolute difference (odds ratio [OR], 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.43–3.31; number needed to treat [NNT], 7; moderate certainty). Among patients with a high chance (95.8%) for urticaria to improve with antihistamines alone, add-on systemic corticosteroids likely improved urticaria activity by a 2.2% absolute difference (NNT, 45; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may improve itch severity (OR, 2.44; 95% CI: 0.87–6.83; risk difference, 9%; NNT, 11; low certainty). Systemic corticosteroids also likely increase adverse events (OR, 2.76; 95% CI: 1.00–7.62; risk difference, 15%; number needed to harm, 9; moderate certainty).

Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids for acute urticaria or chronic urticaria exacerbations likely improve urticaria, depending on antihistamine responsiveness, but also likely increase adverse effects in approximately 15% more.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^113QwphX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

In spite of being an old disease and apparently easy to diagnose, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is still perceived as an uncontrollable and difficult to manage disease. The perception of the patient is that his/her condition is not well understood and that is suffering from a disorder with hidden causes that doctors are not able to tackle. Sometimes patients go through a number of clinicians until they found some CSU expert who is familiar with the disease. It is surprising that myths and believes with no scientific support still persist. Guidelines are not widely implemented, and recent tools to assess severity are infrequently used. European and American recent guidelines do not agree in several key points related to diagnosis and treatment, which further contributes to confusion. With the aim to clarify some aspects of the CSU picture, a group of allergists and dermatologists from the Spanish Dermatology and Allergy societies developed a Frequent Asked Questions leaflet that could facilitate physicians work in daily practice and contribute to a better knowledge of common clinical scenarios related to patients with CSU.

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria remission definition and therapy stepping down: World Allergy Organization position paper [^115cCfmk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no global agreement on the definition of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) remission.

Objective

Our aim was to generate a consensus for clinical definitions of CSU-related terms focused on remission.

Methods

The World Allergy Organization Urticaria Committee systematically reviewed current available longitudinal articles. On the basis of this review, a consensus agreement was reached for the definition of the term CSU remission. In addition, a scheme specifying when and how therapeutic de-escalation should be performed was constructed.

Results

Almost all of the groups that have carried out longitudinal studies to evaluate the frequency of CSU remission agreed to use the term CSU remission if the patient remains without urticaria signs and symptoms without pharmacologic treatment (omalizumab, cyclosporine, antihistamines, or systemic corticosteroids). According to our systematic review, the available evidence does not specify the best time to consider CSU remission. However, current evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in CSU relapse between 6- and 12-month periods of remission. So far, no evidence exists to propose any biomarkers for defining inflammatory or mechanistic remission in CSU or identifying patients with a high probability of cure. It can be reasonable to consider a reduction of treatment after 6 months of CSU control, with evaluation 2 to 6 months after stepping down treatment.

Conclusion

The World Allergy Organization Urticaria Committee proposes defining CSU clinical remission based on the total resolution of urticaria signs and symptoms without pharmacotherapy for at least 6 months. The implications of this definition in clinical practice must be evaluated and validated in future studies.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^1172t6Qk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

### EAACI / GA2LEN / EDF guideline: management of urticaria [^1133Gurw]. Allergy (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the second International Consensus Meeting on Urticara, Urticaria 2004, a joint initiative of the EAACI Dermatology Section and GA2LEN. Urticaria has a profound impact on the quality of life, and effective treatment is therefore required. The recommended first line treatment are nonsedating H1 antihistamines. They have proven to be effective in double-blind controlled studies, but dosages increased up to fourfold over the recommended doses may be necessary. However, for different urticaria subtypes and in view of individual variation in the course of the disease and response to treatment, additional or alternative therapies may be required. Immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A and corticosteroids are not recommended for long-term treatment due to unavoidable severe adverse effects. This guideline was, in addition, accepted by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and formally approved by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^116C6tnp]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) step‑care algorithm — treatment proceeds from Step 1 to Step 4 with defined actions and general principles. Step 1 is monotherapy with a second‑generation antihistamine with avoidance of triggers (e.g. NSAIDs) and relevant physical factors if physical urticaria/angioedema syndrome is present. Step 2 includes dose advancement of the second‑generation antihistamine used in Step 1, adding another second‑generation antihistamine, adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist, and adding a first‑generation antihistamine to be taken at bedtime. Step 3 is dose advancement of a potent antihistamine (e.g., hydroxyzine or doxepin) as tolerated. Step 4 adds an alternative agent such as omalizumab or cyclosporine, with other anti‑inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, or biologics as options. The figure further states to begin treatment at the step appropriate for the patient's level of severity and previous treatment history, that at each level of the step‑approach medication(s) should be assessed for patient tolerance and efficacy, and that step‑down in treatment is appropriate at any step once consistent control of urticaria/angioedema is achieved.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment… [^116Pcsy6]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

TREATMENT OF ACUTE URTICARIA AND ANGIOEDEMA If symptoms are not sufficiently controlled with second-generation H 1 antihistamines, H 2 antihistamines such as cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine may be added. 18 In severe cases, corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone may be added for three to 10 days to control symptoms. 2, 4, 9, 19. or more of the following additional strategies: the second-generation H 1 antihistamine can be titrated up to two to four times the usual dose 23; a different second-generation H 1 antihistamine can be added; first-generation H 1 antihistamines may be added at nighttime; H 2 antihistamines may be added 18; and leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, can also be added, especially in patients with NSAID intolerance or cold urticaria.
24.

If symptomatic control is still not achieved, the third step is addition and titration of high-potency antihistamines as tolerated, such as hydroxyzine or the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin. The fourth step is referral to a subspecialist for use of immunomodulatory agents. There are a number of such agents, but the data on the effectiveness in chronic urticaria for most are weak at best. 25, 26 The two agents with the most robust data are omalizumab and cyclosporine. 2, 4, 9 For controlling flare-ups in chronic urticaria, a three- to 10-day burst of corticosteroids is sometimes used; long-term use is not recommended because of adverse effects. Potent topical corticosteroids may have a benefit in localized delayed-pressure urticaria.
27. Once symptoms are adequately controlled, physicians should consider stepping down treatment sequentially.

Empiric elimination diets are not recommended. If an underlying cause of chronic urticaria is identified, the condition should be treated or the patient referred to an appropriate subspecialist.

### Urticaria: evaluation and treatment… [^115zobhE]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The centerpiece of treatment is avoidance of known triggers. It is also recommended that patients avoid aspirin, alcohol, and possibly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use because these may worsen urticarial symptoms. When avoidance is impossible, no trigger is identified, or symptomatic relief is still required despite avoidance, antihistamine medications are first-line pharmacotherapy. A variety of additional medications can be used when first-line antihistamines are not adequate. Addition of histamine H 2 blockers to therapy with H 1 blockers has been shown to be modestly beneficial for acute symptoms. 18 H 2 blockers include cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine. Limited data suggest that adding corticosteroids to antihistamines may yield a more rapid improvement and resolution of symptoms 19; as such, prednisone or prednisolone may be added for three to seven days, usually in a tapered dosage, especially for patients with severe symptoms. 13, 19. If symptoms remain uncontrolled, there are several options. The patient can be switched to a different second-generation H. A three- to 10-day tapered burst of oral corticosteroids is sometimes used to get control of symptoms, although corticosteroids do not directly prevent mast cell degranulation, 7, 16, 21 and long-term use is not recommended because of adverse effects. There are data on the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria, especially in patients with cold urticaria or intolerance to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and a leukotriene receptor antagonist may be added if first-line agents are insufficient.

If sufficient control still is not achieved, second-line agents including cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, tacrolimus, and dapsone have shown some benefits. However, referral to a subspecialist for prescribing such medications may be preferred, depending on the physician's comfort level and experience with their administration. 21 After symptoms are controlled adequately, patients should be maintained on the regimen for at least three months before considering titrating down and discontinuing medications.

### Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach… [^111A3hee]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

4, 9 Angioedema has been reported in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 5 Patients with a rare inherited or acquired disorder linked to C1 esterase deficiency or autoimmune consumption may present with recurrent angioedema without urticaria. Approach to Therapy Treatment of urticaria should be directed at avoiding known triggering agents and alleviating associated symptoms. Patients should be advised to avoid alcoholic drinks and over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs because they may aggravate the condition. 2, 4 Step therapy guidelines for pharmacotherapeutic management of chronic urticaria is given in Figure 3. The mainstay of therapy for acute urticaria is a long-acting, nonsedating histamine H. 1-receptor antagonist such as fexofenadine, desloratadine, or loratadine.

5, 8, 13, 14 Cetirizine also is effective but may be mildly sedative and should be taken at night. The additive effect of a first-generation H 1-receptor antagonist, such as hydroxyzine, with a second-generation H 1-receptor antagonist is beneficial for its soporific effects and to alleviate nocturnal pruritus. 11 Because of the adjunctive effect of blocking both histaminic receptors, the addition of a histamine H 2-receptor antagonist has shown benefit in the management of urticaria in controlled clinical studies. 2 Either cyproheptadine or the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin in titrated dosages is beneficial as supplemental therapy for nocturnal pruritus and the associated anxiety that is common in patients with chronic urticaria and angioedema.
9.

16 Patients with unresponsive urticaria or angioedema should be referred to an allergist or dermatologist and may require a short-term course of oral glucocorticoids. Investigative treatment using immunomodulatory therapies such as cyclosporine, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been shown to be beneficial in autoimmune chronic urticaria. 17–19.
