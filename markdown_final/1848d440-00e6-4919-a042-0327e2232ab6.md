## Question

Which medication is used for otitis externa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is used for otitis externa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and likely pathogens. Then, I should confirm first-line therapy and when to avoid systemic antibiotics. Next, I will decide which topical agents to choose and how tympanic membrane status affects that choice. After that, I need to specify dosing and administration details, including aural toilet or wick use. Finally, I should consider duration, follow-up, safety, special scenarios like fungal disease or treatment failure, and summarize practical regimens.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis framework and microbial targets. Acute otitis externa is a diffuse inflammation of the external auditory canal, classically presenting with otalgia, canal edema and erythema, and tenderness with tragal or pinna movement, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus as predominant pathogens, so our empiric therapy must cover these organisms [^116ZLvWP].

> I should confirm initial treatment modality before selecting a drug. Guidelines recommend topical therapy as first-line for diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa and to avoid systemic antibiotics initially unless there is extension beyond the canal or specific host factors; also, choose a non-ototoxic topical agent if the tympanic membrane may be nonintact, including tympanostomy tubes [^115o9R8F] [^113YUrtu] [^114C4PPy].

> Wait, let me verify comparative efficacy among topical options. High-quality evidence shows topical antimicrobials are highly effective and broadly similar in clinical cure, so the choice hinges on TM status, cost, dosing convenience, and adherence rather than major differences in cure rates, which supports a pragmatic selection approach here [^113zxUG2] [^11228YG5].

> For specific agents, my initial thought is to use neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone given its historical use and low cost. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the TM status and ototoxicity risk because aminoglycosides can be ototoxic if they access the middle ear through a perforation; guidelines direct us to select a non-ototoxic topical when there is a known or suspected TM perforation, so in uncertain TM status I should favor a fluoroquinolone otic preparation instead [^114C4PPy] [^111eixAi] [^111DSBU5].

> Let me now specify fluoroquinolone options and indications. Ofloxacin 0.3% otic is FDA-indicated for otitis externa in adults and children 6 months and older and covers P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, making it a good default, especially when the TM status is unknown or nonintact due to its non-ototoxic profile relative to aminoglycosides [^1157U72e]. Ciprofloxacin otic, with or without a corticosteroid, is also indicated for acute otitis externa; Cetraxal (ciprofloxacin) is effective versus neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone, and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is an established combination option [^114K65fw] [^116pSEFW] [^1164iA57].

> I need to check dosing to provide concrete regimens. Ofloxacin otic for adult otitis externa can be dosed as 10 drops once daily for 7 days; ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone can be given as 4 drops twice daily for 7 days; ciprofloxacin otic (Cetraxal) has been studied twice daily for 7 days with favorable outcomes, which aligns with typical practice patterns for quinolone drops in AOE [^116gKAbP] [^116bNuHN] [^116pSEFW].

> Administration technique matters for treatment success, so I should confirm supportive measures. When the canal is obstructed from edema or debris, perform or arrange aural toilet and consider placement of an ear wick to improve drop penetration; also counsel on proper drop administration to ensure adequate contact with the canal epithelium, as emphasized by the AAO-HNSF guideline [^11228YG5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing analgesia and duration. Pain control should be assessed and treated proactively, and typical topical antibiotic duration is 7 to 10 days with re-evaluation if not improving within 48 to 72 hours, which aligns with patient instructions emphasizing adherence and keeping the ear dry during treatment [^112Zd43B] [^11228YG5] [^113A8jH6].

> I should confirm when systemic antibiotics enter the plan. Systemic therapy is generally not recommended initially, but I need to add it if there is cellulitis extending beyond the canal or host factors like diabetes, immunocompromise, prior head and neck radiotherapy, or if topical therapy cannot be delivered, and I should screen for these modifying factors during assessment [^113YUrtu] [^116rKZJv].

> Next, I will examine what to do if treatment fails or there is atypical progression. If there is persistent pain, granulation tissue, or cranial neuropathy in an older diabetic, I must consider malignant otitis externa and be mindful of fluoroquinolone-resistant Pseudomonas trends, prompting culture-directed systemic antipseudomonal therapy and imaging as appropriate; rare fungal causes like Aspergillus can mimic or complicate disease and warrant topical antifungals or boric acid with meticulous canal cleansing when suspected [^116gccEq] [^115HtKMF] [^115N9TDv].

> Let me consider safety more carefully. Although topical quinolones are well tolerated and non-ototoxic in pediatric use, I should counsel about minor local adverse effects and still avoid potentially ototoxic agents like aminoglycosides when there is a perforation or tube to reduce the risk of cochlear or vestibular toxicity, consistent with human and animal literature and guideline cautions [^116WFAap] [^111YbZwZ] [^111eixAi] [^114C4PPy].

> I should also verify comparative add-on steroid questions. Evidence suggests that adding a corticosteroid to antibiotic drops may speed symptom relief, and recent RCT data indicate ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone outperforms steroid alone in AOE, supporting the common practice of using antibiotic-steroid combinations when inflammation is prominent, provided TM status is appropriately considered [^111qDrVB] [^112WQcci].

> Putting this together, my recommended medication approach is as follows. For uncomplicated diffuse AOE, start a topical fluoroquinolone: ofloxacin 0.3% 10 drops once daily for 7 days, or ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone 0.3%/0.1% 4 drops twice daily for 7 days; ensure aural toilet and consider a wick if edema blocks delivery, provide analgesia, keep the ear dry, and reassess in 48 to 72 hours if not improving; avoid systemic antibiotics unless there is extension or high-risk host factors, and choose non-ototoxic drops if the TM may be nonintact [^116gKAbP] [^116bNuHN] [^116ZLvWP] [^113YUrtu] [^114C4PPy] [^11228YG5].

Topical antibiotics are the first-line treatment for otitis externa, with **ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin** preferred for their broad-spectrum activity, safety with tympanic membrane perforation, and low ototoxicity risk [^115o9R8F] [^1157U72e]. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone is effective but should be avoided if perforation is suspected because of **ototoxicity risk** [^114C4PPy]. Acetic acid 2% is an alternative for **mild cases** or when antibiotics are contraindicated. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for **severe cases** with extension beyond the ear canal or for **immunocompromised patients** [^113YUrtu]. Treatment duration is typically 7–10 days, and patient education on proper drop administration and ear care is essential to support adherence and prevent recurrence [^116ZLvWP].

---

## First-line topical antibiotic treatments

Topical antibiotics are the primary treatment for otitis externa, with **ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin** preferred for their broad-spectrum activity, safety with tympanic membrane perforation, and low ototoxicity risk [^114K65fw] [^1157U72e].

| **Medication** | **Spectrum of activity** | **Clinical efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Ciprofloxacin | - Pseudomonas aeruginosa <br/> - Staphylococcus aureus | High efficacy; clinical cure rates ~70% [^116pSEFW] | Low ototoxicity; safe with tympanic membrane perforation | First-line; especially with suspected perforation |
| Ofloxacin | - Pseudomonas aeruginosa <br/> - Staphylococcus aureus | High efficacy; equivalent to ciprofloxacin [^117TkkCm] | Low ototoxicity; safe with tympanic membrane perforation | First-line; especially with suspected perforation |
| Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone | - Broad-spectrum antibacterial <br/> - Anti-inflammatory | Effective; clinical cure rates ~60% [^116pSEFW] | Ototoxicity risk; avoid if perforation suspected | First-line if tympanic membrane intact |

---

## Alternative topical treatments

Use **alternative topical treatments** when first-line antibiotics are contraindicated or ineffective.

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Clinical efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Acetic acid 2% | Mild bacterial infections; antibiotic contraindications | Effective in mild cases [^11228YG5] | Minimal ototoxicity; safe with perforation | Mild cases or antibiotic contraindications |
| Clotrimazole | Fungal infections (otomycosis) | Effective against Candida and Aspergillus | Minimal ototoxicity | Fungal infections |

---

## Systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are reserved for severe cases with extension beyond the ear canal or for immunocompromised patients [^113YUrtu].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Clinical efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Ciprofloxacin (oral) | Severe infections; immunocompromised patients | Effective against Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus | Gastrointestinal upset; tendonitis risk | Severe cases; immunocompromised patients |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | Severe infections; immunocompromised patients | Effective against Staphylococcus and other bacteria | Gastrointestinal upset; allergic reactions | Severe cases; immunocompromised patients |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **topical therapy as the initial treatment**, with systemic antibiotics reserved for severe or complicated cases [^113YUrtu] [^115o9R8F]. Key recommendations include:

- **Topical therapy**: First-line for uncomplicated otitis externa [^115o9R8F].
- **Systemic antibiotics**: Reserved for severe cases or immunocompromised patients [^113YUrtu].
- **Patient education**: Proper administration of topical drops and ear care [^116ZLvWP].

---

## Patient adherence and outcomes

Patient adherence **significantly impacts treatment outcomes**. Factors influencing adherence include:

- **Ease of administration**: Once-daily dosing improves adherence [^117TkkCm].
- **Side effects**: Minimal side effects improve adherence [^117TkkCm].
- **Patient education**: Proper instruction improves adherence and outcomes [^116ZLvWP].

---

## Emerging treatments and novel drug delivery systems

Emerging treatments and novel drug delivery systems **show promise** in improving outcomes and adherence, such as **foam-based ciprofloxacin** — an effective and safe alternative to traditional formulations [^113E8enP] — and **sustained-release ciprofloxacin hydrogel**, which allows single-dose administration with sustained release and has been effective in preclinical models [^111MhMmb].

---

## Conclusion

Topical antibiotics are the **primary treatment** for otitis externa, with **ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin** preferred for their broad-spectrum activity, safety with tympanic membrane perforation, and low ototoxicity risk. Systemic antibiotics are reserved for severe cases or immunocompromised patients. Patient adherence and education are critical to achieving successful outcomes, and emerging treatments may further improve management.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^117H1e88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, a possible treatment for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). However, the effects of topical antiseptics for CSOM remain unclear. This is an update of a review last published in 2020, with one new study added. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The date of the latest search was 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agents of any class.

### Animal ototoxicity of topical antibiotics and the relevance to clinical treatment of human subjects [^111DSBU5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on animal ototoxicity from ototopical medications. A secondary objective was to assess the relevance of animal data to the use of ototopical drops in clinical situations involving humans.

- **Study design**: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature using appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles, which were reviewed, summarized, and tabulated.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-three articles were reviewed; 61 articles were appropriate to the study question and were further analyzed.

- **Conclusions**: Virtually all studies demonstrate that aminoglycoside antibiotics, when applied topically into the middle ear space, are ototoxic in experimental animals.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was March 16, 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal.

### Scedosporium apiospermum: A rare cause of malignant otitis externa [^115HtKMF]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented with left-sided otalgia. Initially diagnosed with simple otitis externa, he was discharged with topical drops. He represented two months later with worsening otalgia and discharge. A diagnosis of malignant otitis externa was made based on clinical and radiological findings. Intravenous Tazocin and Gentamicin were administered based on previous bacterial culture from ear swabs. The patient's condition failed to improve, and he developed left-sided facial nerve palsy.

His condition stabilized following a change in antimicrobial therapy, and his management continued in the community on intravenous Meropenem with twice-weekly aural toilet. Repeated nuclear medicine imaging failed to demonstrate resolution. A bony sequestration was removed from the external auditory canal in the outpatient clinic, which, following extended culture, grew Scedosporium apiospermum. His management was subsequently changed to oral Voriconazole, leading to rapid clinical improvement and disease resolution over a six-week period.

### Determination of ototoxicity of common otic drops using isolated cochlear outer hair cells [^1118mB5W]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Otic drops are commonly used not only for otitis externa, but also for otorrhea in the presence of tympanostomy tubes or tympanic membrane perforations. Many studies have demonstrated the ototoxicity of common otic preparations, such as Cortisporin otic drops (Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, TN). The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ototoxicity of common otic preparations by direct exposure to isolated cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs).

- **Methods**: OHCs from adult chinchilla cochlea were exposed to standard bathing solution (control), acetic acid, Acetasol HC (Alpharma USPD Inc, Baltimore, MD), Gentacidin (CIBA Vision Ophthalmics, Atlanta, GA), and Tobradex (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX). The cells were observed using an inverted microscope, and the images were recorded in digital still-frame and video, and analyzed on the Image Pro-Plus 3.0 program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).

- **Results and conclusions**: As measured by time to cell death and change in morphology of OHCs, acetic acid, with or without hydrocortisone, was most toxic to OHCs. Cortisporin was more cytotoxic than gentamicin and Tobradex.

### Otitis externa [^116B25Sr]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotizing forms. It may be associated with eczema of the ear canal and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, individuals with the absence of ear wax or narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications [^111dsHrJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question: "Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic-resistant organisms?"

- **Study design**: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.

	- **Ototopical antibiotics and treatment**: "ototopical antibiotics", "ototopical drops", "topical antibiotics and otitis externa", "otitis externa and treatment", "otitis externa and antibiotic drops", "otitis externa and ototopical drops"
	- **Otitis media**: "otitis media", "otitis media and treatment", "otitis media and antibiotic drops"
	- **Chronic suppurative otitis media**: "chronic suppurative otitis media", "chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment", "chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops"
	- **Antibiotic resistance**: "antibiotic resistance", "otitis externa and resistant organisms", "otitis media and resistant organisms", "chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms"
	- **Ophthalmic and otorrhea conditions**: "ophthalmic antibiotic drops", "draining ear", "P.E. tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and treatment", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy"

After an initial screening of over 2,500 articles, 38 articles were selected for further analysis.

### The pH of commonly used topical ear drops in the treatment of otitis externa [^113penoG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Healthy ear canal skin has an acidic pH. Evidence suggests that reacidification of the ear canal may lead to the resolution of otitis externa. The pH of 15 commonly prescribed topical ear drop preparations used in the treatment of otitis externa was measured using a Jenway 3020 pH meter with temperature compensation at 37.5 °C. The pH values ranged from 2.89 to 7.83. Two-thirds of the preparations tested were of acidic pH, while the remaining one-third were alkaline. Reacidification of the ear canal may help in the treatment of otitis externa.

### Otitis media and its consequences: beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and pediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists in pediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease. Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries.

The group aimed to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media and to propose actions to clinicians and public health officials that could reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and microbial antibiotic resistance resulting from antibiotic use. Defining acute otitis media and ensuring diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who could benefit from antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children. This reflects the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies. The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics.

### Evolving resistant pseudomonas to ciprofloxacin in malignant otitis externa [^116gccEq]. The Laryngoscope (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether there has been an increase in ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas in malignant otitis externa and if this has increased the morbidity of the disease.

- **Study design**: Retrospective.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Twenty-eight patients over 13 years.

- **Results**: The records of 28 patients admitted between 1988 and 2001 with the diagnosis of malignant otitis externa were reviewed. Seven patients had ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas, as determined by their hospital culture and sensitivity tests. Notably, five of the seven resistant cases appeared in the last three years, while two appeared in the preceding ten years. Our series indicates a significant trend over time of pseudomonas resistance to ciprofloxacin treatment. However, there was no increased morbidity or mortality in the ciprofloxacin-resistant group compared to those sensitive to ciprofloxacin.

- **Conclusions**: Resistance to ciprofloxacin in patients with malignant otitis externa is increasing. This may affect the previously successful outpatient treatment over the past decade. In response, a return to inpatient or outpatient intravenous treatment with third-generation cephalosporins/antipseudomonal penicillins and more frequent debridement may be necessary for these patients.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1164Rbhw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is characterized by chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, leading to ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics are used to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection; these can be used alone or in combination with other CSOM treatments, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning ('aural toileting'). Antibiotics are often prescribed in preparations combined with steroids. This review is part of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM and represents the first update of the original review published in 2020.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and five other databases on 15 June 2022. Additionally, we explored ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving participants (adults and children) with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge continued for more than two weeks, with participants followed up for at least one week.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111Cda28]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

We were unable to determine the non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics. However, our findings in a small group of children, which require confirmation, suggest that oral antibiotics may be more effective in resolving symptoms and shortening the duration of ear discharge than antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children with acute otitis media with ear discharge (AOMd). This must be balanced against the findings that eardrops are associated with reasonable symptom control, fewer total oral antibiotic courses, and less systemic side effects, should non-inferiority be proven.

As we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics in children with AOMd, guidelines recommending that clinicians consider oral antibiotics in this group of children are not unreasonable. However, such recommendations must be weighed against the major public health threat of antibiotic resistance.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114FpdgU]. Pediatrics (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute otitis media, particularly concerning systemic antibiotics, the AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend administering an antibiotic with additional β-lactamase coverage for patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **Receipt of amoxicillin**: In the last 30 days.
- **Presence of purulent conjunctivitis**: Indicates potential bacterial resistance.
- **History of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM)**: Unresponsive to amoxicillin.

### Ototoxicity of ototopical antibiotic drops in humans [^111eixAi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the incidence of injury to the cochlea or vestibular system from the use of ototopic antibiotic ear drops.

- **Study design**: A MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present was conducted using search terms such as "ototopic antibiotics", "ototopic drops", and "antibiotic resistance" to identify pertinent articles. These articles were reviewed and graded according to evidence quality. Out of 44 articles found, 27 were deemed appropriate for review, with 14 warranting further extensive review. These 14 articles directly evaluated either hearing loss or changes in vestibular function after the use of ototopic ear drops. Studies not considering hearing or vestibular function were eliminated, and only articles in English addressing the ototoxicity of ototopical ear drops were considered.

- **Results**: Most articles reviewed fell into the level 3 to 3b category, while two articles were in the 1b category, indicating evidence-based studies. Included in this study was an article reviewing case reports of ototopical ototoxicity and a survey article.

- **Conclusion**: The review uncovered a total of 54 cases of gentamicin vestibular toxicity; in 24 patients, cochlear toxicity was also documented. Additionally, 11 cases of cochlear and 2 cases of vestibular toxicity were found in neomycin-based ear drops.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^111ngono]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops.

### Otitis externa [^114G4LxB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. It may be associated with eczema of the ear canal and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013. (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

- **Results**: Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

### Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa [^113zxUG2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa, a systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups was conducted. This allowed for one or more of the following comparisons: antimicrobial vs. placebo, antiseptic vs. antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic vs. nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial vs. antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid vs. steroid.

Twenty trials met the inclusion criteria, and data from 18 of these trials were suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval, 29% to 63%) and increased bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences were noted in clinical cure rates for other comparisons, except that steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but the rates of clinical cure and adverse events were statistically equivalent.

In conclusion, topical antimicrobial therapy is highly effective for acute otitis externa, with clinical cure rates of 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences in comparative efficacy were observed, but the broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes render these differences of questionable clinical significance.

Summary estimates from the 13 meta-analyses can facilitate evidence-based management recommendations and clinical practice guideline development.

### Trends in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children with acute otitis media in the United States, 1998–2004 [^1175DRA5]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). High credibility.

The study explores the patterns of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for children diagnosed with acute otitis media in the United States between 1998 and 2004. It examines the implications of these trends on public health and the pediatric population, highlighting concerns about antibiotic resistance.

- **Study design and methodology**: The research involved a comprehensive analysis of prescription data to evaluate trends over the specified period. The study aimed to determine the factors influencing broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions and their impact on treatment outcomes.

- **Findings and implications**: The findings suggest an increase in broad-spectrum antibiotic use, raising alarms about potential over-prescription and the subsequent risk of antibiotic resistance. The study underscores the need for guidelines to optimize antibiotic prescribing practices and suggests further research to assess long-term impacts on pediatric health.

Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of antibiotic prescribing trends and advocates for improved practices to ensure effective and safe treatment for children with acute otitis media.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge.

The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such an approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge, and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

- **Search strategy**: Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT, and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication, or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa, and furunculosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

- **Main results**: Nineteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops (OR 11, 95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates.

### Auritidibacter ignavus, an emerging pathogen associated with chronic ear infections [^116gaMeF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Ciprofloxacin ear drops are commonly prescribed in clinical practice. Although minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) allow only limited conclusions on the clinical effectiveness of local antimicrobial drug therapy, we suggest that patients experiencing therapeutic failure after empiric topical treatment with ciprofloxacin ear drops should be assessed for A. ignavus using microbiological tests. The clinical suspicion should be reported to the microbiology laboratory because there is a serious risk of overlooking A. ignavus due to its morphologic similarity to bacterial species belonging to the residential skin flora.

No specific request for an in-depth analysis was made by the treating clinicians in the cases we describe. Increased awareness among clinical microbiologists was prompted by the repeated receipt of ear swab specimens from patients presenting with otorrhea and bacterial growth presumed to be physiologic flora in large quantities. This led to a lower threshold for submitting bacterial colonies to additional testing for species identification. Finally, the absence of A. ignavus in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry databases poses an additional threat to accurate identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory, as has been reported for other pathogens.

In conclusion, A. ignavus is a novel, potentially underrecognized pathogen that seems to be associated with a distinct clinical pattern in patients with ear infections. A high level of disease awareness and accurate microbiological diagnostics are required for correct identification.

### Intratympanic lipopolysaccharide elevates systemic fluorescent gentamicin uptake in the cochlea [^1156x25e]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Clinically, topical treatment of otitis media (OM) with aminoglycosides, such as neomycin, is effective but also controversial. Many otolaryngologists are concerned that aminoglycoside eardrops may be ototoxic if they enter the middle ear through a ruptured tympanic membrane (TM). Scientific evidence for this specific concern is scarce, so clinicians often take precautionary measures and adhere to best practices by avoiding the ototopical use of aminoglycosides. The present study provides the necessary justification to support the concern of ototoxicity when selecting drugs for OM treatment in the presence of a TM perforation or when a tympanostomy tube allows ototoxic ear drops to reach the middle ear.

### Otitis externa: Review and clinical update [^114tQTwk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can present in either an acute or chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 individuals annually, whereas the chronic form affects 3% to 5% of the population. The acute condition is commonly caused by bacterial (90% of cases) or fungal (10% of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal exposed to excess moisture or local trauma. Chronic cases often relate to broader dermatologic or allergic issues.

- **Symptoms**: Early acute and most chronic cases present with pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute cases may progress to include canal edema, discharge, pain, and potentially extra-canal manifestations.

- **Treatment**: The early stage of the disease usually responds well to the topical application of an acidifying solution. For later-stage acute disease, an antimicrobial-containing ototopical is preferred. Oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced cases or those who are immunocompromised.

- **Prevention**: Preventive strategies focus on reducing recurrences by minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to substances that trigger local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### Ototopical ciprofloxacin in a glycerin vehicle for the treatment of acute external otitis [^114Rntmu]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). High credibility.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study of 33 patients to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new glycerin formulation of ototopical 0.3% ciprofloxacin with that of a conventional aqueous formulation of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute external otitis.

Outcome measures were resolution of discharge, swelling, pain, redness, and the incidence of adverse side effects. Patients were examined on three occasions: on the day of enrollment (visit 1), 48 to 72 hours later (visit 2), and 7 days after enrollment (visit 3).

At visit 2, the patients in the glycerin group showed a significantly greater resolution of discharge. We observed the same pattern with respect to swelling, pain, and redness, which resolved more quickly in the glycerin group, although not significantly so. All patients were cured by visit 3, and the two treatments were equally well tolerated.

On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the glycerin formulation of ototopical 0.3% ciprofloxacin appears to be at least as effective as the aqueous form in the treatment of acute external otitis — and in the case of otorrhea, more so.

### Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone superior to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^115xCujW]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

This study was a comparison of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial. It involved topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension versus amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension in 80 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes. Adverse events (greater than 3%) related to ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension included ear pain (5.1%), while those related to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid suspension were not fully documented in the text.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa executive summary [^116SLoNd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The eight recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE), the use of oral and topical antimicrobials, and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Bacterial eradication in the treatment of otitis media [^115awQah]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Drugs differ in their ability to eradicate various pathogens from the middle-ear cavity during acute otitis media (AOM), and these differences clearly affect clinical outcome. The outcome is derived from differences in the association between concentrations of the drugs at the site of infection and the antimicrobial effect, termed pharmacodynamics. These differences are even more marked in the present era of antimicrobial resistance. However, since AOM is a self-limiting disease in most cases, differences in clinical outcome are more difficult to ascertain than bacteriological outcomes, which are measured within 3–5 days.

A favorable clinical outcome, regardless of the bacteriological effect of the drug, can result in false optimism when less-effective antibiotic drugs are used. Inappropriate study design and manipulation of clinical results add to this confusion. This review attempts to highlight the evidence regarding the bacteriological response to antibiotics in AOM and to draw attention to potential flaws that may mislead clinicians.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112zH3x1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), often referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and frequently polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or with other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and is part of a suite of seven reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search was conducted on 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials with at least one week of follow-up involving adults and children with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy of foam-based versus solution-based ciprofloxacin for acute otitis externa [^113E8enP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

To compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of a foam-based antibiotic formulation in the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE) with the more conventional solution-based formulation.

- **Study design**: Phase 2, open-label, randomized controlled trial.
- **Setting**: Multicenter.
- **Subjects and methods**: Sixty-three eligible adult patients with unilateral AOE were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: an experimental 0.3 percent foam-based ciprofloxacin (FoamOtic Cipro) or 0.3 percent solution-based ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan). All patients received the same dosage regimen, twice daily for 7 days. The primary efficacy variable was the response to therapy (cure) during the test-of-cure visit. Secondary variables included improvement of disease symptoms such as otalgia, tenderness, edema, and otorrhea.

Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study; however, seven patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis due to major deviations from the protocol. Per-protocol analysis (n = 57) showed that cure was achieved in all the patients (P = 1.000). No significant differences were found between groups for symptomatic relief, resolution of otic discharge, or onset of pain reduction. Both treatments were found to be highly efficacious and safe, demonstrating the noninferiority of the experimental drug.

In conclusion, foam-based ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective new treatment for AOE.

### Ofloxacin [^113A8jH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for the full duration prescribed, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **Missed doses**: In patients with an ear canal infection ("swimmer's ear"), it is important to take the drops every day. If you miss a dose that was scheduled earlier in the day (for example, 8 AM), take that day's dose as soon as possible and then return to your regular daily dosing schedule. For middle ear infections, if a dose of ofloxacin otic solution is missed, administer it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and return to the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless instructed by the doctor. If the infection does not improve after one week, consult your doctor. If you experience two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended to see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **Activities to avoid while using ofloxacin otic solution**: Keep the infected ear(s) clean and dry. Avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet while bathing, and refrain from swimming unless instructed otherwise by your doctor.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial, however, was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform, and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines in Dutch primary care: An analysis of national prescription data on ear and respiratory tract symptoms and conditions among 384 general practices [^113AyrfG]. Family Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is treated in just over 30% of cases with a macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotic, regardless of whether there is an uncertain or no indication for an antibiotic. For patients with otitis externa for whom an antibiotic was uncertain and who did receive an antibiotic, the prescribed antibiotic was a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in fewer than half of the cases. Acute otitis media was treated with macrolides or broad-spectrum antibiotics in fewer than 10% of the cases. When an antibiotic was prescribed for patients with acute otitis media with an uncertain or certain indication for an antibiotic, prescribers chose a first-, second-, or third-choice antibiotic in over 90% of the cases.

- **Figure 2**: Type of antibiotics for ear symptoms and conditions as a percentage of all prescriptions for a specific indication. Macro = macrolides that are not mentioned in the appropriate guidelines, broad = broad-spectrum antibiotics that are not mentioned in the guidelines, top3 = total of first-, second-, and third-choice of antibiotic according to the guideline, O.E. = otitis externa, O.M. A. = otitis media acute. Insufficient data were available to calculate practice variation. No = no indication to prescribe an antibiotic, Uncertain = uncertain indication to prescribe an antibiotic, Certain = certain indication to prescribe an antibiotic. For otitis externa, there is no group for which there is a certain indication to prescribe an antibiotic.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: A randomized clinical trial [^112WQcci]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The study titled "Ototopical ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone in AOE (ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone vs. fluocinolone)" was published in 2022 by Laurence Chu and colleagues in the journal JAMA Network Open. This study focuses on the treatment of acute otitis externa. The primary question addressed was whether the combination of ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide is superior to fluocinolone acetonide alone in patients with acute otitis externa.

The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population consisted of 297 patients, with 153 females and 144 males. The inclusion criteria encompassed both adult and pediatric patients aged over 6 months with acute otitis externa. Key exclusion criteria included a previous episode of acute otitis externa within 4 weeks or more than one episode within 6 months, tympanic membrane perforation, otitis media, and malignant otitis externa.

- **Interventions**:
	- N = 197 received ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide (ciprofloxacin 0.3% plus fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution, BID for 7 days).
	- N = 100 received fluocinolone acetonide alone (fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% otic solution, BID for 7 days).

### Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in children with acute otitis media and ear discharge: A systematic review [^1143rHg1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections and a leading cause of doctor consultations and antibiotic prescribing worldwide. Around 15%–20% of children with AOM present with acute onset ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (AOMd). In contrast to widespread beliefs, children with AOMd have similar levels of ear pain and feel less well at presentation than those without ear discharge (AOMwd). Additionally, children with AOMd have a higher disease burden, with higher rates of ear pain and/or fever at 3–7 days and more AOM recurrences and hearing problems at 3 months compared with children without ear discharge. Antibiotics are more effective in children with AOMd than in those with AOMwd; the number needed to treat to achieve resolution of ear pain and/or fever at days 3 to 7 is 3 versus 8, respectively. AOM guidelines, therefore, recommend clinicians consider immediate antibiotic prescribing in children with AOMd, in contrast to AOMwd, for which a watchful waiting approach is recommended for otherwise healthy children with nonsevere unilateral disease.

It has been suggested that the differences in clinical picture and disease course between AOMwd and AOMd might be attributed to differences in causative pathogens. A 2016 systematic review including 38 published reports on the microbiology of children with AOMwd found that Streptococcus pneumoniae (average detection rate of 27.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (23.1%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.0%) are the most common bacteria associated with AOMwd globally. Streptococcus pyogenes…

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote the appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. They further recommended that clinicians should:

1. Distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal.
2. Assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management, such as a nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, and prior radiotherapy.
3. Use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE. Systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113KJ5fL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers up to 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112z3DZy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, one of the possible treatments for CSOM, inhibit the microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Antiseptics or their application can cause irritation of the skin of the outer ear, manifesting as discomfort, pain, or itching. Some antiseptics, such as alcohol, may have the potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with a possible increased risk of causing sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness, or tinnitus.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched several databases including the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^113ikDaj]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The main findings show that three months' use of topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children seems to be no better than placebo in improving clearance of effusions of otitis media at one, three, and nine months, or in improving important symptom-related outcomes. This is an important and under-researched area of child health, as evidence for the use of promising non-surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion is lacking. Otitis media with effusion is a common chronic problem seen in primary care, for which no effective treatment exists in this setting and which often leads to referral and surgery.

This UK-wide primary care study is the largest double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with otitis media with effusion from any health setting; it is larger than the only previous randomized controlled trial from primary care that evaluated antibiotics. Follow-up rates were high, and we did not impute missing results (which would provide even more conservative findings than this analysis so would not alter the inferences). The results should thus be both relevant and generalizable to most children seen in the NHS.

This study used an objective outcome that evaluated efficacy in clearing bilateral effusions at one month. Although several small studies have suggested efficacy for topical nasal steroids, and they are often used off-license for this condition, efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated in the literature. The risk difference (measured in children rather than ears) was…

### Potential ototopical antiseptics for the treatment of active chronic otitis media: An in vitro evaluation [^114NFFvQ]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of different antiseptic agents versus quinolone drops against the common organisms of chronic otitis media. The secondary objective was to examine the possible role of pH on the antimicrobial activity of the antiseptic solutions.

- **Methods**: Three antiseptic powders (boric acid, iodine, and a 1:1 combination of these two) and four solutions (2% boric acid, 2% acetic acid, 3.25% aluminum acetate, and 5% povidone iodine) were tested against five bacteria and two fungi common in chronic otitis media, using both agar plates and the modified broth dilution method. These results were compared with the antimicrobial activity of quinolone drops. The potential role of pH of solutions was tested by reducing the acidity of the agents and repeating the broth dilution.

- **Results**: Of the powders, iodine, and iodine/boric acid combined are very effective against all organisms. Boric acid powder showed moderate effectiveness against all organisms. All solutions performed poorly on the agar plates. The 5% povidone iodine has good effectiveness when tested with the broth dilution method. The 3.25% aluminum acetate had the best activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

- **Conclusion**: Boric acid powder and 5% povidone iodine solution show promise for clinical use. Boric acid powder has proven clinical effectiveness. The 5% povidone iodine requires further clinical research. Although very effective in vitro, iodine powder is toxic to tissues and cannot be recommended for clinical use. The pH of solutions does not seem to play a significant role in their antimicrobial activity.

### Topical analgesia for acute otitis media [^1171uw5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a spontaneously remitting disease for which pain is the most distressing symptom. Antibiotics are now known to have less benefit than previously assumed.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of topical analgesia for AOM.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May Week 3, 2006), EMBASE (1990 to December 2005), and LILACS (1982 to September 2005) without language restriction, and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Double-blind randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus placebo, or an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus any other otic preparation with an analgesic effect, in adults or children presenting at primary care settings with AOM without perforation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Potential studies were screened independently, and trial quality was assessed by three authors; differences were resolved by discussion. Data was then independently extracted from the trials selected by two authors. We contacted the authors of three trials to acquire additional information not available in published articles.

- **Main results**: Our searches yielded 356 records; four trials met our criteria. One trial with 54 participants compared treatment with anesthetic ear drops versus an olive oil placebo immediately at diagnosis.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

- **Objectives**: To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

- **Search strategy**: Sources include The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, and entered data into RevMan. Two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts and inputted where there was ambiguity. Investigators were contacted for clarifications.

- **Main results**: Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears) were included. CSOM definitions and severity varied; some trials included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; reports were generally poor, follow-up was short, and handling of bilateral disease was inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1138CiiD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM and aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically, and can be used alone or alongside other treatments for CSOM, such as ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is the first update of a review published in 2021. The update found no new studies. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics with systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics.

### Provider and patient drivers of ototopical antibiotic prescription variability [^112wGEL4]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine if providers prescribe more affordable topical antibacterial therapy for patients who are economically disadvantaged or come from economically disadvantaged communities, we conducted a prescription drug database review. This study took place in a large academic hospital network and involved analyzing ototopical prescription records of 2,416 adults and children presenting with acute and chronic otologic infections from 2009 to 2013. We examined various prescription, patient, provider, and institution variables, including diagnosis, prescription type, demographics, health insurance status, and healthcare provider type and setting.

The results showed that otitis externa and acute otitis media were the most common diagnoses. It was found that non-OHNS (Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery) providers served 82% of all patients. OHNS providers prescribed proportionally less fluoroquinolone and more brand-name antibiotics compared to non-OHNS providers. Adults were more likely to receive a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a generic prescription versus pediatric patients. Patients who self-identified as 'white' ethnicity received proportionally more fluoroquinolone prescriptions than patients who identified as 'non-white', though there was no difference in provider type. The proportion of fluoroquinolone prescriptions was notably higher in patients from low-poverty counties; however, poverty level was not associated with patients seeing a particular provider type. Most patients had commercial insurance, followed by Medicaid, with Medicare patients having the lowest proportion of fluoroquinolone prescriptions.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^114pRRqk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute otitis externa, specifically in terms of assessment, AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend distinguishing diffuse acute otitis externa from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal.

### Clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the clinical resolution of AOE.

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote the appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient population is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. While differential diagnosis will be discussed, recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. It is applicable in any setting where patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

### Ofloxacin [^111YbZwZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

What are some of the possible side effects of ofloxacin otic solution?

During the testing of ofloxacin otic solution in external ear infections, the most common side effect was discomfort upon application, occurring in 7% of patients. If the pain is severe, the medication should be stopped, and you should contact your doctor. Other side effects included itching (1%), earache (0.8%), and dizziness (0.4%).

During testing in middle ear infections, the most common side effect was a bitter taste, which occurred in 7% of patients with a middle ear infection. This may happen when some of the drops pass from the middle ear to the back of the mouth. This side effect is not serious, and there is no need to stop the medicine if this occurs. Other side effects found in 1% of the patients included earache, itching, abnormal sensation, rash, and dizziness.

Call your doctor about these or other side effects if they occur. If a rash or an allergic reaction to ofloxacin otic solution occurs, stop using the product and contact your doctor.

DO NOT TAKE OFLOXACIN OTIC SOLUTION BY MOUTH.

If ofloxacin otic solution is accidentally swallowed or an overdose occurs, call the doctor immediately. This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription. Use only as directed. Do not use this medicine if outdated.

If you wish to learn more about ofloxacin otic solution, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Complete prescribing information is printed on the reverse side.

### Clinician adherence to the clinical practice guideline: Acute otitis externa [^112qWgkL]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Low credibility.

Over 10 years have passed since the Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa (CPG-AOE) was first published, and it has been several years since its update. We sought to assess clinicians' adherence as well as referral patterns.

A 23-question survey was distributed to regional primary care clinicians evaluating demographic data, perception of the clinical practice guideline (CPG), adherence, and details of specialist referral. Statistical analysis was performed to compare adherence and referral patterns using the Fisher exact test or the χ² test.

One hundred seventeen clinicians completed the survey. Fifteen respondents (12.8%) had reviewed the CPG. The recommendations with the least reported adherence were pain management (39.1%) and accounting for prior radiotherapy as a modifying factor (43.0%). The recommendations of prescribing ototopical therapy and avoiding systemic antimicrobials in uncomplicated acute otitis externa had adherence of 94.0% and 83.8%, respectively. When analyzed by provider type (e.g. resident, nurse practitioner/physician assistant), there were no significant differences in adherence. No significant differences in adherence were observed based on previous review of the CPG. When reporting frequency of specialist referral, the majority of respondents selected rarely (53.9%). The most favored reason for referral was symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks (86.3%).

Of the providers who responded, very few had reviewed the CPG-AOE. Despite the added emphasis on pain management in the CPG, adherence remains low.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one microorganism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single or combination of topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural treatment.

### Ofloxacin [^116WFAap]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in pediatric patients of the following ages for the listed indications:

- **Six months and older**: Otitis externa with intact tympanic membranes.
- **One year and older**: Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes.
- **Twelve years and older**: Chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membranes.

Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below these ages have not been established. Although no data are available on patients less than age 6 months, there are no known safety concerns or differences in the disease process in this population that will preclude the use of this product.

No changes in hearing function occurred in 30 pediatric subjects treated with ofloxacin otic and tested for audiometric parameters. Although quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals after systemic administration, young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution for one month showed no systemic effects, quinolone-induced lesions, erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy.

### Oto-201: Nonclinical assessment of a sustained-release ciprofloxacin hydrogel for the treatment of otitis media [^111MhMmb]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

OTO-201 can provide sustained release to the middle ear and effectively treat otitis media when compared with FDA-approved ciprofloxacin otic drop formulations.

- **Background**: There is an unmet medical need for antibiotic therapy that can provide a full course of treatment from a single administration by an otolaryngologist at the time of tympanostomy tube placement, thus obviating the need for twice daily multiday treatment with short-acting otic drops.

- **Methods**: Studies in guinea pigs and chinchillas were conducted. OTO-201 was administered as a single intratympanic injection and was compared with the twice-daily multi-day treatment with Ciprodex or Cetraxal otic drops.

- **Results**: OTO-201 demonstrated sustained release of ciprofloxacin in the middle ear compartment from several days to approximately 2 weeks, depending on the dose. The substantial C(max) values and steady drug exposure yielded by OTO-201 were in contrast to the pulsatile short-lasting exposure seen with Ciprodex and Cetraxal. OTO-201 was also effective in a preclinical chinchilla model of Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced otitis media. The degree of cure was comparable to that afforded by Ciprodex and Cetraxal. Furthermore, there was no evidence of middle or inner ear pathology in guinea pigs treated with OTO-201, unlike Ciprodex and Cetraxal, which both demonstrated mild cochlear ototoxicity. No adverse effects of the poloxamer 407 vehicle were noted.

- **Conclusion**: Intratympanic injection of OTO-201 constitutes an attractive treatment option compared to twice daily multiday dosing with ciprofloxacin ear drops for the treatment of otitis media.

### Acute otitis externa: Rapid evidence review [^11228YG5]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin and other otic preparations for otitis externa [^117TkkCm]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Ofloxacin otic is as effective in curing otitis externa in children (under 12 years of age) as the preparation combining polymyxin/neomycin plus hydrocortisone, as well as ciprofloxacin otic. Furthermore, ofloxacin otic requires less frequent dosing, which is likely to encourage greater patient adherence and consequently achieve a better cure rate than both of these treatment options. Because many cases of otitis externa are complicated by an undiagnosed tympanic membrane perforation, the lack of ototoxicity associated with ofloxacin otic makes it a particularly safe option for use in these patients.
