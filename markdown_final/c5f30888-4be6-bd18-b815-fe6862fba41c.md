## Question

A 32-year-old is brought in after a high-speed motor vehicle collision with hypotension and a widened mediastinum. CT angiography confirms a traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta without further specification of the lesion type. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM diagnosis code should be used for a 32-year-old with a traumatic thoracic aortic injury after a high-speed motor vehicle collision, when the CT angiography confirms the injury but does not specify the lesion type. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10-CM category for traumatic thoracic aortic injury. Then, I should verify whether the unspecified lesion detail allows a more specific subcode or if it defaults to an unspecified code. Next, I will check for any external cause codes that should accompany the diagnosis for billing completeness. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with contemporary trauma coding practices and guideline usage patterns.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic category. Traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta falls under ICD-10-CM Chapter 19, Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes, specifically in the thoracic cavity section, and the most appropriate family for this entity is S25.0, which denotes injury of the thoracic aorta [^eb1ccefb].

> Wait, let me verify the subcoding options because the CT did not specify the lesion type. ICD-10-CM for S25.0 includes subcategories such as S25.00 for unspecified injury, S25.01 for laceration, S25.02 for transection, and S25.09 for other specified injuries; since the report says "traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta" without specifying laceration, transection, or other morphology, the correct choice is the unspecified code, S25.00 [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any external cause codes are required for billing completeness. Yes, for traumatic injuries, it is standard to add an external cause code from Chapter 20 to capture the mechanism; in this case, a motor vehicle collision would be coded as V43.9XXA, with the seventh character "A" indicating the initial encounter, and the "XX" placeholders reflecting unspecified details of the collision that can be refined if documented [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the final coding is precise. The primary diagnosis code is S25.00 for unspecified injury of the thoracic aorta, and the external cause code is V43.9XXA for unspecified car occupant injured in a motor vehicle collision, initial encounter; if additional specificity is documented later (for example, driver vs passenger, traffic vs nontraffic, or a more specific collision type), the external cause code can be updated accordingly, but S25.00 remains appropriate when the aortic injury morphology is not specified [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the lesion type is actually documented somewhere in the record and I missed it? Let me reconsider: if the operative note, radiology addendum, or discharge summary specifies a laceration, transection, pseudoaneurysm, or rupture, then I should upgrade to the corresponding S25.0 subcode; otherwise, in the absence of morphologic detail, S25.00 is the correct, defensible choice for billing and documentation integrity [^notfound].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a traumatic thoracic aortic injury after a high-speed motor vehicle collision, when the lesion type is unspecified, is **S25.00XA** (injury of thoracic aorta, unspecified, initial encounter). This code should be accompanied by an external cause code such as **V43.9XXA** (car occupant injured in collision, unspecified, initial encounter) to document the mechanism of injury [^notfound].

---

## ICD-10-CM code selection

- **Primary diagnosis code**: S25.00XA — Injury of thoracic aorta, unspecified, initial encounter.
- **External cause code**: V43.9XXA — Car occupant injured in collision, unspecified, initial encounter.

---

## Rationale for code selection

- **S25.00XA**: This code specifically denotes injury to the thoracic aorta without further specification of the lesion type, which matches the clinical scenario described.
- **V43.9XXA**: This external cause code documents the mechanism of injury (motor vehicle collision) and is essential for complete billing and epidemiological documentation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

To support accurate coding and billing, the following clinical documentation is recommended:

- **Mechanism of injury**: Document the high-speed motor vehicle collision and specify the patient's role (e.g. driver, passenger).
- **Clinical findings**: Record hypotension and widened mediastinum as presenting symptoms.
- **Diagnostic confirmation**: Note that CT angiography confirmed traumatic injury to the thoracic aorta.
- **Lesion type**: If the specific lesion type (e.g. laceration, transection, pseudoaneurysm) is identified later, update the ICD-10-CM code accordingly to reflect the more specific diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Additional considerations

- **Severity grading**: Although not required for initial coding, documenting the severity of the aortic injury (e.g. minimal, moderate, severe) can be useful for clinical decision-making and future reference [^ef798563].
- **Associated injuries**: Document any additional injuries, as these may require separate ICD-10-CM codes and can impact billing and resource allocation [^notfound].

---

The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a traumatic thoracic aortic injury with unspecified lesion type following a high-speed motor vehicle collision is **S25.00XA**, with **V43.9XXA** as the external cause code.

### Critical decisions in trauma of the thoracic aorta [^e3624753]. Injury (2002). Low credibility.

Trauma to the thoracic aorta is a significant injury with a high mortality. This mortality is partly due to the delayed recognition of the condition. The increase of motor vehicle accidents and the use of firearms worldwide has resulted in an increase of the incidence of trauma to the thoracic aorta. Certain new developments in diagnosis and management have resulted in traditional methods being questioned. This review analyses current literature and data which we attempt to evaluate.

Background

Trauma remains the most common cause of death in young adults. Head injury is most prevalent followed by blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI), which has been demonstrated by multiple autopsy studies. In the majority of cases, high energy blunt trauma with a rapid deceleration is present. Motor vehicle accidents, particularly head on collisions, account for 81% of the cases. Motorcycle crashes, falls from significant height, crush injuries, pedestrian vs motor vehicle accidents and aircraft injuries account for the other 19% of cases. Up to 80% of patients presenting with BTAI die before hospitalization, and in the remaining survivors, in-hospital mortality is as high as 46%. While this is a potentially lethal injury, it is rare and accounts for 1.5% of thoracic trauma.

### Defining acute aortic syndrome after trauma: are abbreviated injury scale codes a useful surrogate descriptor? [^f1cdfcec]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The severity and location of injuries resulting from vehicular collisions are normally recorded in Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) code; we propose a system to link AIS code to a description of acute aortic syndrome (AAS), thus allowing the hypothesis that aortic injury is progressive with collision kinematics to be tested.

Methods

Standard AIS codes were matched with a clinical description of AAS. A total of 199 collisions that resulted in aortic injury were extracted from a national automotive collision database and the outcomes mapped onto AAS descriptions. The severity of aortic injury (AIS severity score) and stage of AAS progression were compared with collision kinematics and occupant demographics. Post hoc power analyses were used to estimate maximum effect size.

Results

The general demographic distribution of the sample represented that of the UK population in regard to sex and age. No significant relationship was observed between estimated test speed, collision direction, occupant location or seat belt use and clinical progression of aortic injury (once initiated). Power analysis confirmed that a suitable sample size was used to observe a medium effect in most of the cases. Similarly, no association was observed between injury severity and collision kinematics.

Conclusion

There is sufficient information on AIS severity and location codes to map onto the clinical AAS spectrum. It was not possible, with this data set, to consider the influence of collision kinematics on aortic injury initiation. However, it was demonstrated that after initiation, further progression along the AAS pathway was not influenced by collision kinematics. This might be because the injury is not progressive, because the vehicle kinematics studied do not fully represent the kinematics of the occupants, or because an unknown factor, such as stage of cardiac cycle, dominates.

### Does the incidence of thoracic aortic injury warrant the routine use of chest computed tomography in children? [^5799965e]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic injury is a potentially life-threatening injury associated with rapid deceleration mechanisms. Diagnosis is made by chest computed tomography (CT), which is associated with a risk of radiation-induced malignancy. We sought to determine the incidence of aortic injuries in the pediatric population to weigh against the risk of CT imaging.

Methods

The Pediatric Health Information Systems was queried for children ≤ 18 years with discharge diagnosis code of thoracic aortic injury (901.0) between December 2004 and 2014. Data abstracted included patient age, gender, diagnosis and procedure codes, and discharge disposition, where available. We also queried for imaging codes to determine what type of chest imaging the child received.

Results

Between December 2004 and 2014, 311,850 children were admitted to Pediatric Health Information Systems hospitals with traumatic injury. Of these patients, 46 (0.015%) were coded with a thoracic aortic injury and an accompanying E-code. Twenty-seven patients (58.7%) were male, and the median age was 13 years. The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (63%, n = 29). Eighteen hospitals (41.9%) had no patients with a thoracic aortic injury in the 10-year period. In children with a thoracic aortic injury, the mortality rate was 11% (n = 5) and 22 (47.8%) underwent a chest CT during their hospitalization. Forty percent (124,909) of all trauma patients underwent chest CT, with a positive rate for aortic injury of 1.8/10,000. The reported estimated cancer risk from a chest CT scan is 25/10,000 for girls and 7.5/10, 000 in boys, greater than the positive CT rate.

Conclusion

Thoracic aortic injuries are rare in children in the United States. The risk of cancer associated with screening chest CT is greater than the likelihood of identifying an aortic injury. Therefore, screening chest CT scans are unwarranted in injured children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® blunt chest trauma – suspected aortic injury [^ad1afc51]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of these guidelines is to recommend appropriate imaging for patients with blunt chest trauma. These patients are most often imaged in the emergency room, and thus emergency radiologists play a substantial role in prompt, accurate diagnoses that, in turn, can lead to life-saving interventions. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. Imaging largely focuses on the detection and exclusion of traumatic aortic injury; a large proportion of patients are victims of motor vehicle accidents. For those patients who survive the injury and come to emergency radiology, rapid, appropriate assessment of patients who require surgery is paramount.

### Traumatic rupture of thoracic aorta… [^d819aa93]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Of six cases of thoracic aortic rupture, four were acute and two were chronic. In the four acute cases, suspicious findings were an appreciably widened mediastinum, upper-extremity hypertension, change in pulse amplitude, or, more hopefully, generalized hypertension, left infraclavicular systolic murmur, and loss of posterior aortic shadow on chest x-ray film. Preoperative angiography was essential. Three of four acute aortic transections had complicated associated injuries that necessitated delay in aortic surgical repair; antihypertensive drugs, including propranolol hydrochloride, were used for support in the interval. Perfusion by femoral vein-femoral artery cardiopulmonary bypass was used. All four patients were operated on successfully without residual complications. Two patients with chronic conditions were recommended for surgery; one was successfully operated on, using aorto-aortic bypass.

Another patient, 27 years postinjury, refused operation. Postoperative arteriograms were performed for baseline observations of graft and suture-line characteristics in all cases.

### Twenty-year United States national, demographic and regional mortality trends from traumatic thoracic aortic injury, 1999 to 2019 [^eb1ccefb]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic Thoracic Aortic Injury (TTAI) is associated with high mortality rates and is the second leading cause of death in traumatic patients. There has been a considerable advancement in the management of TTAI with novel and improved surgical procedures and imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to determine the national demographic and regional trends in mortality associated with TTAI in the United States across twenty years, 1999 to 2019.

Methods

The multiple cause of death data on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC-WONDER) database was utilized to query death certificates for TTAI from 1999 to 2019, in the United States. The International Classification of the Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code S25.0 was used to identify and abstract data for TTAI related deaths. The data was further abstracted based on age, race, gender and Census-Bureau defined regions. The age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) per 100,000 population-year and Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) with 95% Confidence Interval were computed. The JoinPoint software was utilized to compute the temporal trends in mortality based on a segmented change and AAPC calculation.

Results

A total of 20,842 TTAI associated deaths occurred from 1999 to 2019 corresponding to an AAMR of 0.407(0.401–0.412) per 100,000 population-year. The overall AAMR reduced from 0.759 to 0.223 per 100,000 population-year from 1999 to 2019[average APC -6.5(-7.5; -5.5)]. The reduction was reported in both < 45 age group [average APC -6.5(-7.9; -5.1)] and > 45 age group [-6.2(-7.3; -5.0)]; among females [average APC -6.1(-7.8; -4.3)] and males [-6.1(-7.2; -5.0)]; among Whites [average APC -6.9(-7.8; -5.9)] and Blacks [-5.0(-7.4; -2.5)]. The reduction in mortality as per the census region was highest in the west followed by Mid-West, North-East and South [average APC -6.8(-8.6; -5.0); -6.2(-8.8; -3.6); -5.7(-7.0; -4.4); -5.5(-7.4; -3.6), respectively].

Conclusion

There was a significant decrease in the TTAI associated mortality trends in the United States across 1999–2019 with a consistent decline in all demographic and regional subgroups.

### Overview and implications… [^944dd939]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview and Implications ICD-10 for mortality was implemented in the United States beginning with data year 1999. Additional details on the implementation of ICD-10 can be found at the Mortality Data from the National Vital Statistics System Web page. The ICD-10 injury mortality framework was developed to be as consistent as possible with the recommended framework developed based on the ICD-9 external cause of injury codes as published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, August 29, 1997, Vol. 46, No. RR-14. Colleagues in the ICE on Injury Statistics as well as in the Injury Control and Emergency Health Services section of APHA participated in its development. However, it must be recognized that ICD-10 external cause of injury mortality codes are very different, often more detailed and at times far less detailed than codes in ICD-9.

Thus, NCHS has decided to finalize the matrix because of its logic and internal consistency rather than basing changes on final comparability ratios. Several changes were made to the ICD-10 matrix that warrant attention: Two rows have been added. The first is labeled "All transport" and it includes all transport related deaths that were classified as unintentional, suicide, homicide, intent undetermined and operations of war. In ICD-9, the codes for suicide and intent undetermined by crashing of a motor vehicle were included with motor vehicle traffic injuries. There is no indication in the actual codes that these are traffic deaths. The second row, "Other land transport" was added to accommodate new codes in ICD-10. A change was made to the transportation and drowning categories. The ICD-10 codes for water transportation-related drowning, V90 and V92, are included with the "other transport" codes rather than with the drowning codes.

In the ICD-9 version of the matrix, the comparable codes, E830 and E832, were included with drowning. This change was made to be consistent with the categorization of other mechanisms of injury involved with water transport-related injuries. In the ICD-9 matrix, E846-E848 "vehicle accidents not elsewhere classifiable" were categorized with other codes into the category "Other specified and classifiable". However, with the additional transportation categories in ICD-10 and to be consistent with the NCHS 113 Cause-of-Death list, ICD-10 codes V98-V99, "Other and unspecified transport accident" are included with other transportation codes in a group V90-V99, making them part of all transportation related accidents. The November 2002 version of the matrix shows a correction in the motor vehicle traffic category. Codes V81. 1 and V82.

1 were moved from the occupant codes to the other codes. In addition, codes X82 for suicide, Y03 homicide and Y32 intent undetermined for the crashing of a motor vehicle are included in the group, "other land transport" and code Y36. 1 is included with "other transport. " In the preliminary matrix, they were only included in the row for "All transportation". The November 2002 version also includes the newly developed US ICD-10 codes for terrorism. Further, because substantial changes were made in the classification of transport-related injuries in ICD-10, a more detailed categorization of transport codes is being offered for those users who want more detail than this framework offers. The SAS Program document has the SAS statements needed to run the ICD-10 matrix. The Matrix document contains the ICD-10 codes and the detailed transport code groupings.

### Traumatic aortic injury: an imaging review [^5a215efc]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a major cause of fatality in high speed deceleration injuries. It accounts for 10–20% of fatalities in blunt chest trauma. These injuries are usually related to high-speed motor vehicle and motorcycle collisions, pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions, and falls. Only 10–20% of patients who suffer TAI survive the initial injury and reach the emergency department. If left untreated, 30% die within 6 h, 40–50% die within 24 h, and 90% die within 4 months. A chronic pseudoaneurysm will develop in 2–5% of patients whose injury is not diagnosed. It is imperative, therefore, that these injuries are detected promptly and accurately. Symptoms and physical examination findings are nonspecific. External evidence of chest wall injury is present in 7–90% of cases, so that in up to 30% of the cases no apparent chest injury is identified on physical examination. Chest radiographs are very sensitive in detecting mediastinal hemorrhage, but have a low positive predictive value for aortic injury. The positive predictive value for chest radiography ranges between 5% and 20% for TAI. Aortography has been considered the gold standard for many years in the evaluation of TAI, but is time-consuming, labor- and resource-intensive, and invasive. Because of the shortcomings of physical examination and these more traditional imaging examinations, computed tomography (CT) has become increasingly utilized as a screening and diagnostic tool. Recent investigations have documented its high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of TAI. This article reviews the recent investigations of imaging evaluation of TAI, with a focus on helical CT.

### Risk factors for blunt thoracic aortic injury in children [^a5f43893]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Because blunt thoracic aortic injury is rare in children, a high index of suspicion is needed to identify this injury. The purpose of this study was to use a large national trauma database to define the risk factors for blunt thoracic aortic injury in children.

Methods

Using the National Trauma Database, the authors compared patient demographics, mechanism of injury, and associated injuries between children sustaining blunt trauma with and without a thoracic aortic injury. Factors independently associated with this injury were identified using multivariate methods.

Results

Among 26,940 children with a blunt mechanism of injury, 34 (0.1%) children sustained a thoracic aortic injury, 14 (41%) of whom died. Thoracic aortic injuries were independently associated with age, injury sustained as an occupant in a motor vehicle crash, and severe injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale value of ≥ 3) involving the head, thorax (other than aorta), abdomen, and lower extremities.

Conclusions

Older children involved in a motor vehicle crash with severe head, torso, and lower extremity injuries are a group at high risk for injury to the thoracic aorta. These easily identifiable risk factors may facilitate more rapid identification of this rare and potentially fatal injury.

### Management and in-hospital mortality of 2203 patients with a traumatic intimal tear of the thoracic aorta [^d6b47d36]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to describe contemporary management and inhospital mortality associated with blunt thoracic aortic intimal tears (IT) within the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program.

Summary Background Data

The evidence basis for nonoperative expectant management of traumatic iT of the thoracic aorta remains weak.

Methods

All adult patients with a thoracic aortic IT following blunt trauma were captured from Level I and II North American Centers enrolled in Trauma Quality Improvement Program from 2010 to 2017. For each patient, we extracted demographics, injury characteristics, the timing and approach of thoracic aortic repair and in-hospital mortality. Mortality attributable to IT was calculated by comparing IT patients to a propensity-score matched control cohort of severely injured blunt trauma patients without aortic injury.

Results

There were 2203 IT patients across 315 facilities. Injury most often resulted from motor vehicle collision (75%). A total of 758 patients (34%) underwent operative management, with 93% (N = 708) of repairs performed via an endovascular approach. Median time to surgery was 11hours (IQR 4–40). The frequency of operative management was higher in patients without traumatic brain injury (TBI) (35%, N = 674) compared to those with TBI (29%, N = 84) (P = 0.024). Compared to severely injured blunt trauma patients without aortic injury, ITwas not associated with additional in-hospital mortality (10.7% for IT vs 11.7% for no IT, absolute risk difference: -1.0%, 95% CI: -2.9% to 0.8%).

Conclusions

The majority of blunt thoracic IT are managed nonoperatively and IT does not confer additional in-hospital mortality risk. Future studies should focus on the risk of injury progression.

### Atypical profile of aortic injury associated with blunt trauma in the metropolitan area of Japan [^8e0803dd]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Most of the injuries in these reports were caused by high-speed deceleration in motor vehicle collisions. Compared with these cases, 13 (68.4%) of our patients were injured by fall, and 11 died of aortic rupture or tear and the seven survivors presented aortic dissection. This difference may be associated with the difference of social environment. In the USA, approximately 37 461 people were killed by traffic accidents, yielding 109.4 fatalities per 100 000 population in 2015. The number of deaths by traffic collision in Japan was 4698 per year, yielding 37 fatalities per 100 000 population in 2016. Even, this number drops to almost one twentieth in the metropolitan areas. In addition, senior population (65 years and over) in the USA was 14.9% of the total population in 2015 whereas senior population in Japan was 27.7% of the total population in 2017. In our study, 7 out of 13 fall cases were senior, and four victims involved in the traffic collisions were senior pedestrians hit by automobiles.

What we have learned from this study is the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment to save the survivors of traumatic aortic injury. Traumatic aortic dissection has three types of onset: immediate, progressive, and delayed. Diagnosis of progressive aortic dissection after blunt chest trauma is sometimes difficult because it develops and becomes obvious slowly as summarized in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Blunt Aortic Injury. The onset varies in accordance with strength of the impact and mechanism of the injury. Even a seemingly minor crash occasionally turns out to be a serious aortic injury.

### Hip dislocations and concurrent injuries in motor vehicle collisions [^08b98304]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVC) can cause high energy hip dislocations associated with serious injury profiles impacting triage. Changes in safety and regulation of restraint devices have likely lowered serious injuries from what was previously reported in the 1990s. This study aims to describe modern-day injury profile of patients with traumatic hip dislocations, with special attention to aortic injury.

Methods

Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained trauma database at an urban level 1 trauma center was conducted. Patients with hip dislocation following MVC between January 2005 and December 2015 were grouped based on seatbelt use and airbag deployment. Patients with unknown restraint use were excluded. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify risk of injury profile between groups.

Results

Of 204 patients with hip dislocation after MVC, nearly 57% were unrestrained. Seatbelt alone was used in 36 (17.7%), airbag deployed in 14 (6.9%), and 38 (18.6%) with both. Gender and number of injuries were similar between groups. The most common concomitant injury was acetabular fracture (53.92%) and the abdominopelvic region was the most injured. Use of a seatbelt with airbag deployment was protective of concomitant pelvic ring injury (OR = 0.22). Airbag deployment was significantly protective of lumbar fracture (OR = 0.15) while increasing the likelihood of radial and ulnar fracture or dislocation (OR = 3.27), acetabular fracture (OR = 5.19), and abdominopelvic injury (OR = 5.07). The no restraint group had one patient (0.80%) with an intimal tear of the thoracic aorta identified on CT chest that was successfully medically managed.

Discussion and Conclusion

Hip dislocations are high energy injuries with severe associated injuries despite upgrades in restraint devices. These patients require careful examination and heightened awareness when evaluating for concomitant injuries.

### Mechanism and mortality of pediatric aortic injuries [^2b4c4bb6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic injuries are rare, but have a high mortality rate in children and adolescents. We sought to investigate mechanisms of injury and predictors of survival.

Materials and Methods

The Kids' Inpatient Database (1997–2009) was used to identify cases of thoracic and abdominal aortic injury (International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 901.0, 902.0) occurring in children aged < 20 y. Bivariate and risk-adjusted multivariate analyses were used to reveal associated diagnoses and procedures and to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality, respectively. Cases were limited to emergent or urgent admissions.

Results

A total of 468 cases were identified. Survival was 65% overall, 63% for boys and 68% for girls. The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle-related (77%), followed by other penetrating trauma (10%) and firearm injury (8%). On multivariate modeling, boys (odds ratio, 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.05, 0.45]) and Hispanic children (0.17 [0.05, 0.60]) had lower associated mortality versus girls and Caucasians, respectively. Self-pay patients (6.47 [1.94, 21.6]) had higher mortality versus privately insured patients. Children in the fourth income quartile had lower mortality versus all income quartile patients. Patients admitted to urban nonteaching hospitals (0.15 [0.04, 0.59]) had lower mortality versus those admitted to urban teaching hospitals. Patients with traumatic shock (47.9 [12.3, 187]) or necessitating exploratory laparotomy (13.7 [2.06, 91.4]) had the highest associated mortality overall. Survival increased over the study period between 1997 and 2009.

Conclusions

Motor vehicle-related injuries are the predominant mechanisms of aortic injury in the pediatric population. Gender, race, payer status, income quartile, and hospital type, along with associated procedures and diagnoses, are significant determinants of mortality on multivariate analysis.

### Functional and survival outcomes in traumatic blunt thoracic aortic injuries: an analysis of the national trauma databank [^802d411f]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BAI) remains a leading cause of trauma deaths, and off-label use of endovascular devices has been increasingly utilized in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality in this population. Utilizing a nationwide database, we determined the incidence of BAI, and analyzed both functional and survival outcomes at discharge compared with matched controls.

Methods

Patients with BAI were identified by International Classification of Disease-9 codes from the National Trauma Data Bank (Version 6.2), 2000–2005. Patients were analyzed based on aortic repair, associated physiologic burden, and coexisting injuries. Control groups were matched by age, mechanism, major thoracic Abbreviated Injury Scale score (AIS ≥ 3), major head AIS, and major abdominal AIS. Outcomes were assessed using the functional independence measure (FIM) score and overall mortality. FIM scores were scored from 1 (full assistance required) to 4 (fully independent) for three categories: feeding, locomotion, and expression.

Results

During the study period, 3,114 patients with BAI were identified among 1.1 million trauma admissions for an overall incidence of 0.3%. One hundred thirteen (4%) were dead on arrival, and 599 (19%) died during triage. Of the patients surviving transport and triage (n = 2402), 29% had a concomitant major abdominal injury and 31% had a major head injury. Sixty-eight percent (1,642) underwent no repair, 28% (665) open aortic repair, and 4% (95) endovascular repair with associated mortality rates of 65%, 19%, and 18%, respectively (P < .05). Aortic repair independently improved survival when controlling for associated injuries and physiologic burden (odds ratio (OR) = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24–0.54, P < .05). Compared with matched controls, BAI resulted in a higher mortality (55% vs. 15%, P < .05), and independently contributed to mortality (OR = 4.04; 95% CI, 3.53–4.63, P < .05). In addition, BAI patients were less likely to be fully independent for feeding (72% vs. 82%, P < .05), locomotion (33% vs. 55%, P < .05), and expression (80% vs 88%, P < .05).

Conclusion

This manuscript is the first to define the incidence of BAI utilizing the NTDB. Remarkably, two-thirds of patients are unable to undergo attempts at aortic repair, which portends a poor prognosis. When controlling for associated injuries, blunt aortic injury independently impacts survival and results in poor function in those surviving to discharge.

### Imaging of acute traumatic injuries of the thoracic aorta [^1ef63995]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Blunt traumatic aortic injuries are a major concern in the settings of high-speed deceleration accidents, since they are associated with a very high mortality rate; however, with prompt diagnosis and surgery, 70% of the patients with a blunt aortic lesion who reach the hospital alive will survive. This statement challenges the emergency radiologist in charge to evaluate the admission radiological survey in a severe chest trauma patient. With a 95% negative predictive value for the identification of blunt traumatic aortic lesions, plain chest film represents an adequate screening test. If aortography remains the gold standard, it tends, at least in hemodynamically stable trauma patients, to be replaced by spiral-CT angiography (SCTA), which demonstrates a 96.2% sensitivity, a 99.8% specificity, and a 99.7% accuracy. In unstable patients, trans-esophageal echography (TEE) plays a major diagnostic role. Knowledge of advantages and pitfalls of these imaging techniques, as reviewed in this article, will help the emergency radiologist to choose the appropriate algorithm in the diagnosis of traumatic aortic injury, for each trauma patient.

### Acute aortic syndrome: nationwide study of epidemiology, management, and outcomes [^ea641b28]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient inclusion

Patients with an ICD-10 code of thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic dissection (I17.01 or I17.03 respectively) presenting to hospital from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020 were identified from the NMDS. Additional out-of-hospital deaths or deaths before admission were captured using the MORT data set. Data extracted included ICD-10-AM codes for discharge diagnoses and procedure codes using Australian Classification of Health Intervention system. Patients were linked using National Health Index numbers between the NMDS, MORT, and AVA data sets.

Because of the high readmission rates in AAS, a 10-year lookback interval was used to determine whether patients were presenting for an index event of AAS rather than a follow-up or unrelated presentation. The latter patients were excluded from the study. For patients with multiple hospital events and transfers, the date of first presentation to hospital was taken as the start of the index admission.

Exclusion criteria were: patients with an incidental chronic dissection, non-index presentations, iatrogenic or traumatic dissections, non-AoNZ residents, and those discharged from the emergency department alive with no admission or procedure. Patients with suspected dissections without radiological, surgical, or post-mortem confirmation of diagnosis were excluded.

### Blunt traumatic aortic injuries of the ascending aorta and aortic arch: a clinical multicentre study [^d7ec6bc8]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the clinical and radiological characteristics, management and outcomes of traumatic ascending aorta and aortic arch injuries.

Methods

Historic cohort multicentre study including 17 major trauma patients with traumatic aortic injury from January 2000 to January 2011.

Results

The most common mechanism of blunt trauma was motor-vehicle crash (47%) followed by motorcycle crash (41%). Patients sustaining traumatic ascending aorta or aortic arch injuries presented a high proportion of myocardial contusion (41%); moderate or greater aortic valve regurgitation (12%); haemopericardium (35%); severe head injuries (65%) and spinal cord injury (23%). The 58.8% of the patients presented a high degree aortic injury (types III and IV). Expected in-hospital mortality was over 50% as defined by mean TRISS 59.7 (SD 38.6) and mean ISS 48.2 (SD 21.6) on admission. Observed in-hospital mortality was 53%. The cause of death was directly related to the ATAI in 45% of cases, head and abdominal injuries being the cause of death in the remaining 55% cases. Long-term survival was 46% at 1 year, 39% at 5 years, and 19% at 10 years.

Conclusions

Traumatic aortic injuries of the ascending aorta/arch should be considered in any major thoracic trauma patient presenting cardiac tamponade, aortic valve regurgitation and/or myocardial contusion. These aortic injuries are also associated with a high incidence of neurological injuries, which can be just as lethal as the aortic injury, so treatment priorities should be modulated on an individual basis.

### Endovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic injury: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery [^d88b7970]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Traumatic thoracic aortic injury — epidemiology and historical outcomes: Blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury has been implicated as the second most common cause of death in trauma patients. It has been estimated that less than 25% of patients with such an injury live to be evaluated in a hospital, and of those who do, up to 50% will die within 24 hours. Given the location of injury in 50% to 70% of cases, conventional surgical repair involves a high posterolateral thoracotomy with or without cardiopulmonary bypass and significant blood loss, which can negatively impact the pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic status of the patient. Historically, open repair has been associated with a 28% mortality rate and a 16% paraplegia rate, and the unrepaired thoracic transection carries a risk of delayed rupture estimated to be 2% to 5%.

Aortic trauma — initial management recommendations for blunt thoracic traumatic aortic injury (BTTAI) specify grade-based approaches with evidence ratings as follows: In patients with grade 1 BTTAI, nonoperative management and follow-up imaging are recommended (Class of Recommendation [COR] 1; Level of Evidence [LOE] C-LD). In patients with grade 3 to 4 BTTAI and nonprohibitive comorbidities or injuries, aortic intervention is recommended (COR 1; LOE C-LD). In patients with grade 2 BTTAI and with high-risk imaging features, aortic intervention is reasonable (COR 2a; LOE C-LD). In patients with grade 2 BTTAI and without high-risk imaging features, nonoperative management and follow-up surveillance imaging may be reasonable (COR 2b; LOE C-LD).

### Evolving role of endovascular techniques for traumatic vascular injury: a changing landscape? [^954b0ac2]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Endovascular management of blunt aortic injury has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with this specific injury. There remains a paucity of evidence quantifying the beneficial effects associated with endovascular (ENDO) techniques for other vascular injury types and little information regarding the impact ENDO techniques have had on the management of traumatic vascular injuries over time.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the National Trauma Data Bank over 2002 to 2006 and 2008 time periods (NTDB 7.2 and RDS 2008). Injured patients undergoing any arterial vascular repair procedure using ENDO or standard open techniques were determined using ICD-9-CM procedure codes. Abbreviated Injury codes were used to select patients who suffered subclavian, carotid, or thoracic aortic injury. Logistic regression was used to determine whether EARLY ENDO procedures (first 24 hours after injury) were independently associated with a lower risk of mortality.

Results

The percentage of ENDO procedures significantly increased over time irrespective of mechanism of injury. When aortic (thoracic), subclavian, and carotid arterial injuries were analyzed, a significant decrease in mortality over time was found. The percentage of ENDO procedures for all arterial injury subtypes significantly increased in the RECENT (2008) period. Seventy-five percentage of ENDO procedures occurred early (initial 24 hours) with 20% of those patients being hypotensive upon arrival (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). For patients who had vascular procedures in the RECENT period, regression analysis revealed that early ENDO procedures were independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.5–0.8) after controlling for major confounders including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival.

Conclusion

ENDO procedures for arterial injury have increased over time while mortality for arterial injury subtypes has significantly decreased. Early ENDO procedures are common and are independently associated with a lower risk of mortality. These results suggest outcomes after vascular injury may benefit from ENDO expertise and that ENDO techniques should be incorporated into the early treatment algorithm of trauma patients with vascular injury, particularly those that require difficult operative exposure.

### Trends and outcomes in management of thoracic aortic injury in children, adolescent, and mature pediatric patients using data from the national trauma data bank [^8b3a4b41]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracic aortic injury (TAI) is rare in the pediatric population. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the recommended standard of care for treatment in the adult population given its association with lower rates of mortality and morbidity than traditional open repairs for treatment of TAI. However, there are unique anatomic challenges in treating pediatric patients with TEVAR which may impact the outcomes and pediatric guidelines. We aimed to compare current management trends and outcomes between different pediatric age groups using data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB).

Methods

We analyzed the NTDB from 2007 to 2019 using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and -10 codes to identify patients with a TAI. We excluded patients older than 21 years and any patients who died in the emergency department. The pediatric patients were stratified by age group: children (1–11 years), adolescent (12–17 years), and mature (18–21 years) patients. Patient characteristics compared included injury mechanism and severity, TAI intervention, and outcomes between the 3 groups using bivariate analysis (analysis of variance for parametric and Kruskal-Wallis for nonparametric variables). These characteristics and outcomes were also compared by TAI intervention and injury mechanism. ICD-9 and -10 procedural codes were used to identify patients who underwent TEVAR, open aortic repair (OAR), or both. The modified Poisson regression was performed with relative risk (RR) to evaluate our primary outcome measure-mortality during the trauma admission.

Results

A total of 2,431 pediatric TAI were identified in the NTDB that met the inclusion criteria. This included 134 children (5.5%), 733 adolescent (30.2%), and 1,564 mature (64.3%) patients. Children had significantly lower median Injury Severity Scores (34.1) than the adolescent (38) or mature population (36.1) (P = 0.001). The mechanism of injury differed between age groups. Children had higher rates of blunt trauma (90.3% children, 89.6% adolescent, and 86.8% mature patients) and mature patients had higher rates of penetrating trauma (6% children, 10.1% adolescent, and 12.5% mature patients) (P < 0.001). TAI management also differed significantly between pediatric age groups. Mature patients had significantly higher rates of TEVAR (3% children, 25.2% adolescent, and 29.2% mature patients) and children were most likely to be treated with nonoperative management (NOM) (94% children, 67.9% adolescent, and 64.8% mature patients) (P < 0.001). Patients who were treated with TEVAR were discharge home most frequently (31.8% NOM, 54.1% TEVAR, 44.3% OAR, 22.2% both TEVAR and OAR). Upon modified Poisson regression analysis, patient age was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Intervention with TEVAR (RR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.15–0.33, P < 0.001) and OAR (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36–0.93, P = 0.024) were associated with a lower risk of mortality than NOM.

Conclusions

TAI is less prevalent in children compared to adults. TEVAR for TAI is associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality compared to both NOM and OAR without differences between pediatric subgroups. Further studies should be completed to determine the most appropriate management guidelines.

### Outcomes and practice patterns of medical management of blunt thoracic aortic injury from the aortic trauma foundation global registry [^68c9ac5e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death from blunt trauma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the outcomes of medical management (MM) for BTAI. We hypothesized from the results of several previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone.

Methods

The Aortic Trauma Foundation international prospective multicenter registry was used to examine the demographics, injury characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with BTAI. We analyzed a subset of patients for whom MM was initiated as definitive therapy.

Results

From November 2016 to April 2020, 432 patients (median age, 41 years; 76% male; median injury severity score, 34) with BTAI (Society for Vascular Surgery grade 1, 23.6%; grade 2, 14.4%; grade 3, 51.2%; grade 4, 10.9%) were evaluated. Of the 432 patients, 245 (57%) had received MM in the initial period and 114 (26.4%) had received MM as the planned definitive therapy (grade 1, 59.6%; grade 2, 23.7%; grade 3, 15.8%; grade 4, 0.9%). The most common mechanism of BTAI was a motor vehicle collision (60.4%). Hypotension was present on arrival in 74 patients (17.2%). Continuous titratable infusion of antihypertensive medication was used for 49.1%, followed by intermittent bolus administration (29.8%), with beta-blockers (74.6%) the most common agent used. Treatments were targeted to a goal systolic blood pressure for 83.3%, most often to a target goal systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg (66.3%). The MM goals based on blood pressure control were attained in 64.0% (73 of 114). Twelve patients (10.5%; grade 1, 1; grade 2, 0; grade 3, 10; grade 4, 1) had required subsequent intervention after MM. Eleven patients (9.6%) had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic repair and one (0.9%) had required open repair for a grade 4 injury. The overall in-hospital mortality for patients selected for definitive MM was 7.9%. No aortic-related deaths had occurred in the patients receiving definitive MM.

Conclusions

Approximately one in four patients with BTAI will receive MM as definitive therapy. The variation in the pharmacologic therapies used is considerable. MM for patients with minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) is safe and effective, with a low overall intervention rate and no aortic-related deaths. These findings support the use of definitive MM for grade 2 BTAI.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Blunt aortic injury (BAI) — locations, mechanisms, and pathology: BAI is at the aortic isthmus just distal to the left subclavian artery, and the second most common location is the supravalvular portion of the ascending aorta; overall, the aortic isthmus is the most common location for BAI (80%–95%), followed by the ascending aorta and then the diaphragmatic aorta. Motor vehicle accidents (especially at speeds of > 40 mph) account for 75% of cases in most series of BAI, while falls from heights of > 10 feet and other high-impact mechanisms are also implicated. These regions represent transition points between relatively fixed and mobile aortic segments and have the greatest exposure to shear and hydrostatic forces generated by abrupt deceleration. A variety of aortic lesions can result from blunt aortic trauma, including subadventitial aortic rupture involving the intima and media with incomplete circumferential extension; in this most frequent lesion encountered by imaging physicians, there is a discrete tear involving the intima and underlying media; a more extensive variant is subadventitial aortic rupture involving the intima and media with complete circumferential extension ('aortic transection').

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Current management of traumatic thoracic aortic injury [^f3eed88e]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Traumatic aortic rupture is a devastating injury that is difficult to manage because of the need to approach aortic repair, often in concert with management of complex associated injuries to nonvascular organ systems. Traditional open repair, while effective in the long-term, is associated with a periprocedural mortality between 10% and 20%, along with a 5% risk of stroke and up to a 5% risk of spinal chord ischemia. The advent of endovascular stent graft repair has allowed single centers to cut periprocedural mortality in half and decrease the risk of major neurologic events to < 2%. It is unlikely that a multicenter prospective randomized trial will ever be performed to evaluate these two procedures. However, several large meta-analyses have been published recently, along with a clinical practice guideline from the Society for Vascular Surgery. The purpose of this article is to review the trends and current concepts in the management of traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta.

### CT imaging of blunt chest trauma [^4eab4d9b]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Thoracic injury overall is the third most common cause of trauma following injury to the head and extremities. Thoracic trauma has a high morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 25% of trauma-related deaths, second only to head trauma. More than 70% of cases of blunt thoracic trauma are due to motor vehicle collisions, with the remainder caused by falls or blows from blunt objects. METHODS: The mechanisms of injury, spectrum of abnormalities and radiological findings encountered in blunt thoracic trauma are categorised into injuries of the pleural space (pneumothorax, hemothorax), the lungs (pulmonary contusion, laceration and herniation), the airways (tracheobronchial lacerations, Macklin effect), the oesophagus, the heart, the aorta, the diaphragm and the chest wall (rib, scapular, sternal fractures and sternoclavicular dislocations). The possible coexistence of multiple types of injury in a single patient is stressed, and therefore systematic exclusion after thorough investigation of all types of injury is warranted. RESULTS: The superiority of CT over chest radiography in diagnosing chest trauma is well documented. Moreover, with the advent of MDCT the imaging time for trauma patients has been significantly reduced to several seconds, allowing more time for appropriate post-diagnosis care. CONCLUSION: High-quality multiplanar and volumetric reformatted CT images greatly improve the detection of injuries and enhance the understanding of mechanisms of trauma-related abnormalities.

### A case of traumatic aortic transection presenting with hemorrhagic shock [^7c710740]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic transection, or aortic rupture, is a rare diagnosis in trauma patients and carries a high mortality.

Case Report

We present the case of a 61-year-old man presenting to a Level I trauma center after being struck by a motor vehicle, found to have an aortic transection. He was initially hypotensive and resuscitated with blood products due to concern for hemorrhagic shock. Aortic injury was suspected after chest x-ray study demonstrated a widened mediastinum. Traumatic thoracic aortic transection with pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed on computed tomography of the aorta, and the patient was taken to the operating room for thoracic endovascular repair of the aorta. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Diagnosis of aortic injury can be challenging, especially in trauma patients presenting with hypotension. Aortic injury must be suspected in patients presenting after a high-velocity mechanism injury. It is an uncommon cause of hemorrhagic shock in trauma patients and must be considered even if other traumatic injuries are identified, as it commonly occurs with other significant injuries. Although chest x-ray study can be useful, a negative chest x-ray study does not rule out aortic injury. Aortic injury is a time-sensitive diagnosis, and early identification is key to these patients surviving to receive definitive management in the operating room.

### Longer-term rates of survival and reintervention after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for blunt aortic injury: a retrospective population-based cohort study from Ontario, Canada [^feb830fe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

BAI cases were defined as patients with an International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition external cause of injury code corresponding to blunt trauma and a diagnosis code indicating aortic injury (S25.0 in National Ambulatory Recording System, Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, or the Ontario Trauma Registry (OTR) (figure 1, online supplemental file 1).

Figure 1
Data creation flow chart. *See online supplemental appendix 2 for ICD-10-CA codes corresponding to blunt trauma and for Canadian Classification of Interventions codes corresponding to the different repair types. # This is the number of unique patients with an aortic injury (some patients had aortic injury codes in more than one database). CIHI-DAD, Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database; ED, emergency department; ICD-10-CA, International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition; NACRS, National Ambulatory Recording System; OTR, Ontario Trauma Registry; TEVAR, thoracic endovascular aortic repair.

We extracted baseline characteristics for patients including age, sex, socioeconomic status and rurality (based on postal codes and the Rurality Index for Ontario), comorbidities 2 years prior to BAI using the Elixhauser comorbidity index score, mechanism of injury, aortic injury severity, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and associated injuries. Aortic injury grades were captured in the OTR as Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Although AIS scores are used extensively in trauma registries, they are not as widely reported in modern BAI literature. We used previously published methodsto translate the AIS grades into Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) grades. Patients were excluded if they died within the first 24 hours of hospital admission and had not received an intervention within that period of time.

Exposures

Patients with BAI were classified as patients having received TEVAR, hybrid repair (TEVAR and surgical repair), surgical repair, or medical management ('impulse control') based on Canadian Classification of Interventions procedure and/or OHIP billing codes (online supplemental table 2). Hybrid repair patients received TEVAR and a surgical repair, typically for complex injuries requiring reconstruction of the aortic arch or descending aorta and in some cases branch vessels (vertebral, subclavian, etc). Patients were considered to have been medically managed if they had no codes corresponding with either TEVAR or surgical repair.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^d657da98]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study suggests that users of injury morbidity data can anticipate some discontinuities in temporal trends at the injury cause/mechanism level due to the switch from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM on 1 October 2015, and the resulting switch from the ICD-9-CM matrix to the ICD-10-CM matrix. The CRs reported in tables 4 and 5, based on dually coded datasets from two large academic trauma centres, illustrate the potential magnitude of these discontinuities and highlight specific differences between external cause of injury codes in the two code sets. For several mechanisms/causes, the CRs were equal to unity, but different records were classified in the same category (PPA < 100%) by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices.

### Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA): a population based gap analysis of trauma patients in england and wales [^5eed8896]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Demographics

The REBOA group consisted of 273 (68.8%) male patients, with a median age of 43 (27.8 to 60.2) years. More than 90% had a blunt mechanism of injury, and over half were injured in a road traffic collision (table 3).

Table 3
Demographics, injury pattern and physiology on arrival to hospital for TARN patients without an indication for REBOA, those with an anatomical and physiological indication and no contraindications for REBOA, and by zone of aortic occlusion indicated

Compared with the TARN patients with no indication for REBOA, the REBOA group were younger, more likely to be male, more likely to have a penetrating mechanism of injury (9.3% (95% CI 6.5 to 12.2) vs 2.8% (2.7 to 2.9)), more likely to have been injured in a road traffic collision (54.7% (49.8 to 59.6) vs 19.1 (18.8 to 19.4)), less likely to have been injured in a fall under 2 m (9.6% (6.7 to 12.5) vs 56.9% (56.5 to 57.3)), have a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), more likely to have had a thoracic injury (62.0% (57.2 to 66.7) vs 17.4% (17.1 to 17.6)) and more likely to have an abdominal injury (67.8% (63.2 to –72.4) vs 0.8% (0.8 to 0.9); all p < 0.001) (table 3).

Injury patterns

The Z3 subgroup were statistically more likely to have been injured in a fall over 2 m than the Z1 subgroup (29.2% (22.2 to 36.2) vs 13.1% (8.8 to 17.4); p < 0.001). They were also more likely to be older (p = 0.02) and have a higher ISS (p < 0.01) (table 3). However, there were no other significant differences in demographics, mechanism of injury or admission physiology between these subgroups.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^793b6597]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

According to a report of the Injury Surveillance Workgroup, a group of experts assembled by the Safe States Alliance to provide recommendations for injury surveillance and data analysis around the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition, changes in the injury counts by category can be explained by changes to coding guidelines, differences in the basic structure of the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices, differences in assignment of external cause codes to specific matrix cells, new or more detailed codes in ICD-10-CM, and other considerations. We found evidence supporting most of these explanations.

The most common reason for different classification of the same record by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices was assigning an external cause to different mechanisms/causes. For example, 'MV non-traffic' is a new ICD-10-CM category that was created to support better surveillance of these injuries. As a result, some records assigned to the 'other transport' by the ICD-9-CM matrix (eg, E820-E825, fifth digits 0–4) were reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, our finding that most of the MCA records reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category were classified as MVT by the ICD-9-CM matrix suggests that some coders became more attentive to the distinction between traffic and non-traffic injuries while they were preparing for ICD-10-CM. 'Other land transport' is another new ICD-10-CM mechanism/cause that was separated out of the 'other transport' in the ICD-9-CM matrix; however, we observed no cases of differential classification involving this category.

### Postoperative complications of endovascular blunt thoracic aortic injury repair [^751a6eed]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Overview

This is a retrospective, observational analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (ACS-TQIP) database including patient data from 2007 to 2017. ACS-TQIP is the largest and most comprehensive national trauma database and includes detailed clinical information from over 850 participating hospitals. All participating hospitals are designated trauma centers, with most being level I or II. The data set includes demographic characteristics; clinical variables including vital signs; injury organ, region, type, and severity; therapeutic type and timing; and complications during hospitalization. Database access is granted by the ACS for selected research projects and for a fee. The stated purpose of the TQIP registry is to enable real-time data analysis and identification of areas for improvement of trauma care.

TEVAR overview

TEVAR is typically performed in a hybrid operating room with fixed-imaging capability. On occasion, if circumstances require, the repair is performed in a non-hybrid operating room with a portable fluoroscopy unit. This standard has not changed during the study interval. In most institutions, TEVAR is performed by vascular surgeons; it requires both endovascular skill and an ability to perform open vascular surgery if necessary. This is usually done by vascular surgery on consultation by the primary trauma team. At certain trauma specialty centers, such as ours, trauma TEVAR is performed by surgeons with dual training in trauma and vascular surgery whose practice focuses on vascular and endovascular trauma surgery.

Data extraction

Patients who sustained a BTAI were identified using Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes (4202XXX) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes (901). Of those identified as having sustained a BTAI, patients who underwent TEVAR were identified using ICD-9 code 39.73 and ICD-10 code 02VW3DZ. All patients who met these criteria were included. Region-specific AIS scores were not used as inclusion criteria.

Data extracted from the database included demographics, vitals, injury pattern, Injury Severity Score (ISS), complications, and mortality.

Analysis

Data queried from TQIP were stored locally and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics V.26.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Categorical data were presented as proportions and continuous data as mean and SD. An OR with 95% CI was calculated for each complication.

### Endovascular treatment for traumatic thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm: a case report [^ae0955c2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Chest trauma is classified as blunt or penetrating and the former is the most cause of thoracic injuries with an incidence of 90%. The prevalence of thoracic injuries caused by falls from heights is 10–20%. Traumatic aortic rupture is a very rare condition with an average of 2.2 cases per center per year reported in North America. Thoracic great vessel related to blunt trauma is relatively rare with an incidence of less than 5%.

The mechanism is torsion and shearing forces against the aorta at levels of relative immobility, mainly the ligamentum arteriosum with an incidence of 90–95%. The isthmus, a part of relatively mobile thoracic aorta joining the fixed arch and the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosus, becomes the most commonly injured site in deceleration accident, with an involved incidence of 80% and 90–95% in the pathological and clinical series, respectively.

The traumatic aortic injury (TAI), a lesion extending from the intima to the adventitia, usually occurs in deceleration accidents, such as motor vehicle collisions, falls from height or crush injuries, with an immediately high mortality rate of 80–90% during the first phase, so the victims should be taken to hospital as quickly as possible. Survival patients in the initial phase of TAI have a higher successful outcome under endovascular repair comparative of conventional open surgical repair. The predictors of TAI include age older than 50 years, being unrestrained, systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg, thoracic injury, abdominopelvic injury with fractures of the lumbar spine and pelvis, long bone fractures, and major head injury.

Widening of mediastinum greater than 8 cm and/or 25% of the width of the thorax, loss of aortico-pulmonary window, tracheal deviation to the right, nasogastric shifting to right, left apical cap, depression of the left main stem bronchus, left-sided hemothorax, or scapular, sternal, thoracic spine or multiple rib fractures on plain radiography is suggestive of aortic rupture. Fractures of the first and second ribs are clearly markers of severe blunt force trauma.

### Trends and outcomes of endovascular and open treatment for traumatic thoracic aortic injury [^afcb0322]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Traumatic thoracic aortic injury (TTAI) is associated with high mortality rates. Data supporting thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to reduce mortality and morbidity for TTAI is limited to small series and meta-analyses. In this study, we evaluated the trends and outcomes of open surgery and TEVAR for TTAI in New York State.

Methods

All cases of TTAI in New York State between 2000 and 2007 were extracted from the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database. A diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision coding of TTAI was required for inclusion.

Results

We identified 328 patients with TTAI who underwent surgical repair in New York State between 2000 and 2007; mean age of the cohort was 39.3 years ± 18 years; 80% were male. Open repair of TTAI was performed in 79.6% and 20.4% underwent TEVAR. Open repair was performed for all cases of TTAI until the introduction of TEVAR in 2005; TEVAR exceeded the use of open repair for TTAI in 2006 and 2007. Additional major injuries were present in 71.7% in the open repair group vs 91.0% of the TEVAR group (P = 0.001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate for the 8-year period was significantly increased after open repair of TTAI compared with TEVAR: 17% vs 6%, (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–9.23; P = 0.024). After controlling for the significant covariates, TEVAR independently reduced the risk of death following surgical intervention for TTAI compared with the open procedure (OR 3.8, 95% CI, 1.28–10.99; P = 0.010). Respiratory complications were the most common postoperative morbidity, and were significantly increased after open repair: 38% vs 24% (OR 1.95; 95% CI, 1.05–3.60; P = 0.032). There were no significant differences in cardiac complications, acute renal failure (ARF), paraplegia, or stroke. Endoleak and distal embolization each occurred in 9% of patients after TEVAR.

Conclusions

There has been a shift toward endovascular management of patients with TTAI. This change in surgical strategy has been associated with less postoperative mortality and fewer pulmonary complications in patients suffering from TTAI. TEVAR is associated with significant device-related complications.

### Arch vessel injury: geometrical considerations. implications for the mechanism of traumatic myocardial infarction II [^ad9a7877]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Arterial lesions are widely recognized outcomes in trauma patients. In the USA, approximately 7,500 to 8,000 cases of blunt aortic injury occur each year, of which only about 1,000 to 1,500 survive. Blunt aortic injuries are responsible for up to 40% of fatalities occurring in traffic accidents. Studies based on autopsy findings have shown that between 12 and 29% of all traffic fatalities have additional thoracic aortic traumas. In patients with multiple injuries, the incidence of blunt thoracic aortic injury ranges from 3 to 17%. In a study by Smith et al. blunt trauma to the aorta was found to be the second most common cause of death following head injury.

The main causes of blunt traumatic aortic injuries (76%) are lateral and head-on motor vehicle collisions at speeds greater than 50 km/h, or accidents associated with substantial car deformation, followed by falls from heights and crush injuries. Coronary dissection and rupture resulting from trauma have also been reported where blunt injury was found to be the leading mechanism.

The isthmic part of the vessel was found to be at particularly high risk of rupture. Laceration or rupture of the aortic isthmus has been previously reported in the medical literature. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain traumatized arterial bifurcations. Deceleration forces exerted on the aortic branches as the result of a frontal collision can lead to the rupture of the isthmus. Compression of the aorta between the spine and thorax has been shown to cause isthmic lacerations. Finally, torsion, shearing and bending forces are exerted on the isthmus, leading to its rupture during frontal and side motor vehicle impacts when rapid deceleration and chest compression are combined.

As we showed previously, blunt trauma may lead to certain hemodynamic peculiarities that can cause damage to the endothelium and rupture of the vessel. The aim of this research was to investigate further the complex mechanism of blunt injury to the vascular wall, with particular focus on branching parts of the vessels. Geometric and rheological peculiarities were investigated.

Selection of Patients

The selection process of patients for the primary and secondary analyses is displayed in the Figure. Patients included in the primary analysis were those from all accepted primary HEMS missions and patients from missions in which HEMS units were dispatched but unavailable (ie, the reference group). The exclusion criteria were telephone inquiries not leading to a HEMS mission, interhospital transfers (ie, secondary missions), patients with missing or incomplete Civil Registration System (CRS) numbers, missions with registration errors, and missions in which 2 or more CRS numbers were reported on the same HEMS dispatch.

Figure.
Flowchart of Patient Inclusion in the Primary and Secondary Analyses

CRS indicates Civil Registration System; HEMS, helicopter emergency medical service; GEMS, ground EMS.

Patients included in the secondary analysis were those from accepted primary HEMS missions in which the patient was treated and transported to hospital by HEMS and assigned a hospital World Health Organization (WHO) International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis representing a time-critical condition (eg, cardiovascular or neurovascular emergency or a severe trauma) and patients who were treated and transported to hospital solely by GEMS owing to HEMS being unavailable and who were assigned a hospital WHO ICD-10 diagnosis representing a time-critical condition (ie, reference group). Exclusion criteria were HEMS missions canceled en route (ie, aborted missions) and patients assisted by the HEMS team on scene but not escorted to hospital by HEMS (ie, patients receiving assistance).

All potentially relevant ICD-10 diagnostic codes as classified by WHO were carefully reviewed. The selection of diagnoses was completed and agreed on in a consensus-based approach blinded for the exposure and the outcome variable. To evaluate diagnostic and prognostic similarity between patients receiving GEMS and those receiving HEMS, 12 subcategories of diagnoses were created (ie, multiple traumas; traumatic brain injury; thoracic and abdominal trauma and burns; trauma of the face or neck; trauma of extremities, amputation, and spinal injury; ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction; non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction; cardiac arrest; cardiac arrythmia; heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or aortic aneurysm; hemorrhagic stroke; and ischemic stroke or transitoric cerebral ischemia. A complete list of the selected ICD-10 codes and the grouping of subcategories are displayed in the eTable 2 in the Supplement.

Traumatic thoracic aortic injury — spinal drainage during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is not routinely indicated, with placement reserved for symptoms of spinal cord ischemia; spinal cord ischemia is described as a low-incidence event (3%). Prophylactic spinal drainage is noted as controversial and lacking data in traumatic injuries.

Traumatic aortic injury

Traumatic aortic injury is a life-threatening consequence of major blunt thoracic trauma, with high early mortality if relevant trauma is untreated. From a clinical standpoint traumatic aortic injury has to be excluded after a relevant trauma, especially when associated with hypotension, fractures including those of the spine, scapula long bone or pelvis, pulmonary contusion and haematothorax. CT angiography is the method of choice for diagnosing aortic injury after major trauma.

CT diagnosis relies on the confirmation of luminal irregularities (intimal flaps), outer contour irregularities (pseudoaneurysms) and periaortic haematoma, signs of contrast extravasation or frank transections of the aorta. The predilection site is the transition zone between the relatively free-moving proximal thoracic aorta (including the arch) and the fixed portion at the aortic isthmus immediately distal to the left subclavian artery. According to Azizzadeh et al. and adapted by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), traumatic aortic injury can be classified into four categories: grade I (intimal tear), grade II (intramural haematoma), grade III (pseudoaneurysm) and grade IV (rupture) (Fig. 1).

### The advent of thoracic endovascular aortic repair is associated with broadened treatment eligibility and decreased overall mortality in traumatic thoracic aortic injury [^171cec48]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic injury is the second leading cause of death in trauma. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has recently been applied to traumatic thoracic aortic injuries (TTAIs) as a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. We sought to determine the impact of TEVAR on national trends in the management of TTAI.

Methods

We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the years 2001 to 2007 to select patients diagnosed with TTAI (International Classification of Disease-9 code 901.0). Patients were evaluated based on open surgical repair, TEVAR, or nonoperative management, before and after widespread adoption of TEVAR (2001–2005 and 2006–2007). Outcomes of interest were inpatient mortality, length of stay (LOS), and major complications.

Results

An estimated 1180 annual admissions occurred for TTAI in the United States. Comparing the two time periods, there was an increase in TEVAR (P < .001) with a simultaneous decrease in open repair (P < .001) in 2006 to 2007. The overall number of interventions also increased (P < .001). Overall mortality decreased (25.0% vs 19.0%; P < .001), corresponding to improved survival in the nonoperative group (28.0% vs 23.2%; P < .001). There was no improvement in open repair mortality rates between the two time periods. Comparing intervention types, the TEVAR group had a higher percentage of patients with brain injury (26.1% vs 20.6%; P = 0.008), lung injury (25.0% vs 17.7%; P < .001), and hemothorax (32.5% vs 21.7%; P < .001) than the open surgery group. There were no differences in the number of intra-abdominal injuries or major orthopedic fractures. The open surgery group had more respiratory complications (43.9% vs 54.2%; P < .001), whereas TEVAR had a higher stroke rate (1.9% vs 0.7%; P = 0.021). There were no differences in paraplegia or renal failure. Overall in-hospital mortality was 23.2% (nonoperative group 26.7%, open repair 12.4%, and TEVAR 10.6%). Mortality between open repair and TEVAR groups were not significantly different. LOS was shorter among the TEVAR group vs open (15.7 vs 22.9 days; P < .001).

Conclusion

TEVAR has replaced open repair as the primary operative treatment for TTAI and has extended operative treatment to those patients not previously considered candidates for repair. Increased utilization of TEVAR is associated with improved overall mortality. There is no difference in mortality between TEVAR and open repair groups in our study, which likely reflects the multisystem nature of injury and greater preoperative risk in the TEVAR group.

Aorta — blunt thoracic aortic injury: In patients diagnosed with blunt thoracic aortic injury, we strongly recommend the use of endovascular repair in patients who do not have contraindications to endovascular repair. We suggest that endovascular repair be performed preferentially over open surgical repair or nonoperative management (grade IIC).
