## Question

Diagnosis of prostate cancer in high risk patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing prostate cancer in high-risk patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "high-risk" using validated criteria. Then, I should verify the initial screening approach, including PSA thresholds and the role of digital rectal exam. Next, I will examine pre-biopsy risk refinement with MRI and risk calculators. After that, I need to check the biopsy strategy, including systematic versus targeted cores and the implications of negative MRI. Then, I will review staging imaging for high-risk disease. I should also consider molecular biomarkers and germline testing. Finally, I will integrate special populations, shared decision-making, and a concise diagnostic algorithm, while continuously verifying each step against guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition of high-risk prostate cancer, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. The most commonly used frameworks classify high-risk as PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, Gleason score 8–10 (Grade Group 4–5), or clinical stage ≥ T3a, with very-high-risk including T3b–T4 or multiple high-risk features; this aligns with NCCN and is echoed in contemporary reviews and guidelines, though I should note that heterogeneity within "high-risk" is well recognized and influences prognosis and management choices [^914b4222] [^589e4487] [^63b9c117].

> Wait, let me verify the initial screening step before jumping to biopsy. For men at increased risk — Black ancestry, strong family history, or germline mutations — guidelines recommend starting PSA-based screening at age 40–45 years, with shared decision-making emphasized; importantly, there is no universal PSA cutoff, and decisions should integrate age, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with many guidelines historically using 4.0 ng/mL as a reasonable threshold while acknowledging that lower thresholds may be considered in high-risk men [^911b41af] [^2a7468c6] [^f501cdd4] [^85798bd1].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of digital rectal exam alongside PSA. The AUA/SUO guideline advises considering DRE with PSA to better estimate the risk of clinically significant cancer, and repeating a newly elevated PSA before proceeding to secondary tests or biopsy; this helps mitigate transient elevations and unnecessary procedures, especially in higher-risk men where false positives can drive overtreatment [^1018b63c] [^7d477cdf].

> Next, I should review pre-biopsy risk refinement. Multiparametric MRI is recommended to triage biopsy in men with elevated PSA, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving detection of clinically significant disease; risk calculators such as the ERSPC or PCPT models, incorporating PSA, age, DRE, family history, and prostate volume, can further refine risk and guide the need for biopsy, aligning with ESMO and EAU guidance [^04a994b8] [^8e8e094c].

> I will now examine the biopsy strategy, and I need to ensure I distinguish systematic from targeted approaches. When MRI shows a suspicious lesion, combining MRI-targeted biopsy with systematic sampling increases detection of high-grade cancer while reducing low-grade diagnoses; if MRI is negative but clinical risk remains high, systematic biopsy remains indicated because MRI can miss significant disease, and patients should be counseled about the possibility of low-risk diagnoses that may be suitable for active surveillance rather than immediate treatment [^d2509782] [^4cfee307] [^bb0eab3a].

> Let me think about staging imaging once high-risk disease is confirmed, because understaging is common. For high-risk localized disease, guidelines recommend a bone scan and either pelvic mpMRI or CT to assess for metastases; mpMRI is preferred for local staging to evaluate extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion, though sensitivity is modest and specificity is high, so negative imaging does not exclude occult disease [^678469de] [^c5cc5f4d] [^2d1e67d6].

> But wait, what if conventional imaging is negative and suspicion for metastasis remains high? I should confirm the role of next-generation imaging. ASCO suggests that PET/CT or PET/MRI with PSMA radiotracers, or whole-body MRI, may add clinical benefit in high-risk patients with negative conventional imaging, though prospective data are limited and access varies; this can alter staging and management, so use should be individualized and, when possible, contextualized within clinical trials [^c8d72c78] [^df629eeb] [^4ec0ab1a].

> I need to check the role of molecular biomarkers and germline testing, because these can refine risk and guide therapy. NCCN supports considering tissue-based molecular assays such as Decipher or Prolaris in unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk patients with life expectancy ≥ 10 years, and recommends germline testing for men with strong family history or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry; these tools can inform the likelihood of systemic disease and the intensity of local and systemic therapy, though they should be integrated with clinicopathologic factors [^914b4222] [^52002c39].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers of risk, because thresholds and urgency may shift. Black men have higher incidence and mortality and may benefit from earlier screening and lower PSA thresholds for evaluation; men with BRCA1/2 mutations have higher risks of aggressive disease and should be considered for earlier PSA testing and germline counseling; conversely, men with limited life expectancy should generally avoid aggressive diagnostics and treatment, with watchful waiting favored when appropriate [^0b363d77] [^911b41af] [^18c49c68].

> I should double-check the balance of benefits and harms and ensure shared decision-making is explicit. PSA-based screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality and metastatic disease but increases overdiagnosis and overtreatment; counseling should cover these trade-offs, the possibility of low-risk diagnoses amenable to surveillance, and the risks of biopsy and treatment, aligning with USPSTF, AUA, and ACS positions emphasizing individualized decisions in the 55–69 age range and careful consideration outside it [^b914aef3] [^3e259c0f] [^d58080e4].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and verify it aligns with guidelines. Start with baseline PSA and consider DRE in high-risk men beginning at 40–45 years; if PSA is elevated, repeat to confirm and use mpMRI and/or a risk calculator to refine biopsy indication; perform combined MRI-targeted and systematic biopsies when indicated; if high-risk features are confirmed, stage with bone scan and pelvic mpMRI or CT, and consider next-generation imaging if conventional studies are negative but suspicion persists; integrate molecular biomarkers and germline testing when results will change management, all within a shared decision-making framework that accounts for life expectancy and patient preferences [^911b41af] [^04a994b8] [^678469de] [^914b4222].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI could replace systematic biopsy in all cases, but I should correct that. Even with a negative MRI, if clinical risk is high, systematic biopsy remains indicated because MRI sensitivity for clinically significant cancer is imperfect; thus, the safest approach is to combine targeted and systematic cores when MRI is positive and to maintain a low threshold for systematic biopsy when clinical suspicion remains high despite negative imaging [^d2509782] [^bb0eab3a].

Diagnosis of prostate cancer in high-risk patients relies on **PSA testing with risk-adapted thresholds** [^0b363d77] and **multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)** [^04a994b8] to guide targeted biopsy, which improves detection of clinically significant cancer and reduces unnecessary biopsies [^fdb13c1f]. Conventional staging with bone scan and cross-sectional imaging is essential for high-risk disease [^678469de], and **next-generation imaging (PSMA PET/CT)** [^c8d72c78] is increasingly used when conventional imaging is negative but suspicion remains high [^df629eeb]. Molecular biomarkers (e.g. Decipher, Prolaris) [^914b4222] and germline testing [^52002c39] are recommended to refine risk stratification and guide management [^notfound]. Shared decision-making is critical to balance benefits and harms, especially given the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^975eef6f].

---

## Risk stratification and initial assessment

High-risk prostate cancer is typically defined by **PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥ 8, or clinical stage ≥ T3a** [^914b4222]; these features correlate with increased risks of locally advanced disease, metastasis, and biochemical recurrence [^e5550a9a]. Initial assessment should include a detailed family history, ethnicity, and germline mutation status (BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, HOXB13) [^0b363d77] to guide screening and counseling [^notfound].

---

## Screening and diagnostic tools

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing

- **PSA testing remains the cornerstone** of early detection, but individualized thresholds are recommended for high-risk patients [^a5041184].
- **Lower PSA thresholds (e.g. 2.5 ng/mL)** may be considered in high-risk men, such as those of African ancestry or with strong family history [^302aa3b6].
- **Repeat PSA testing** is advised before proceeding to biopsy to confirm persistence of elevation [^7d477cdf].

---

### Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)

- **mpMRI is recommended** for high-risk patients to localize suspicious lesions and guide targeted biopsies [^notfound].
- **mpMRI significantly improves detection** of clinically significant cancer and reduces unnecessary biopsies [^fdb13c1f].
- **Negative mpMRI** does not exclude cancer; systematic biopsy may still be required if clinical suspicion remains high [^d2509782].

---

### Prostate biopsy

- **Targeted biopsy** guided by mpMRI is recommended to maximize detection of significant cancer [^notfound].
- **Systematic biopsy** should be performed in addition to targeted biopsy to avoid missing lesions not visible on MRI [^d2509782].
- **Patients should be counseled** on the possibility of detecting low-risk disease suitable for active surveillance [^4cfee307].

---

## Imaging for staging

Accurate staging is critical in high-risk patients to guide therapy. Conventional imaging — bone scan and either pelvic mpMRI or CT — is recommended for high-risk patients [^678469de] [^c5cc5f4d]. Next-generation imaging with **PSMA PET/CT** [^c8d72c78] is increasingly used when conventional imaging is negative but suspicion for metastasis remains high [^df629eeb].

---

## Molecular and genetic testing

Molecular biomarkers such as Decipher and Prolaris are recommended to refine risk stratification and guide treatment decisions in high-risk patients [^914b4222]. Germline testing is advised for patients with strong family history or specific ethnic backgrounds (e.g. Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry) [^52002c39] to identify hereditary cancer syndromes [^notfound].

---

## Challenges and controversies

- **Overdiagnosis and overtreatment** remain significant concerns, particularly in high-risk patients who may harbor indolent disease [^c2895fcc].
- **Balancing aggressive diagnostic strategies** with patient preferences and life expectancy is essential [^8e8e094c].
- **Disparities in access to advanced imaging** and biomarkers may limit optimal diagnosis and management in underserved populations [^notfound].

Diagnosis of prostate cancer in high-risk patients requires a **multimodal approach**, integrating PSA testing, mpMRI, targeted biopsy, and advanced imaging, with molecular and genetic testing to refine risk stratification. Shared decision-making is essential to balance the benefits of early detection with the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### High-risk prostate cancer: from definition to contemporary management [^297945c8]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

High-risk prostate cancer (PCa) is a potentially lethal disease. It is clinically important to identify patients with high-risk PCa early on because they stand to benefit the most from curative therapy. Because of recent advances in PCa management, a multimodal approach may be advantageous.

Objective

Define high-risk PCa, and identify the best diagnostic and treatment patterns for patients with clinically localized and locally advanced disease. A critical analysis of published results following monomodal and/or multimodal therapy for high-risk PCa patients was also performed.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of the literature was performed using the Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Evidence Synthesis

High-risk PCa accounts for ≤ 15% of all new diagnoses. Compared with patients with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, patients with high-risk PCa are at increased risk of treatment failure. Unfortunately, no contemporary randomized controlled trials comparing different treatment modalities exist. Evaluation of the results published to date shows that no single treatment can be universally recommended. Most often, a multimodal approach is warranted to optimize patient outcomes.

Conclusions

A significant minority of patients continue to present with high-risk PCa, which remains lethal in some cases. Outcomes following treatment of men with high-risk tumors have not substantially improved over time. However, not all high-risk patients are at the same risk of PCa progression and death. At present, a multimodal approach seems the best way to achieve acceptable outcomes for high-risk PCa patients.

### Defining high-risk prostate cancer [^589e4487]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

High-risk prostate cancer often represents a lethal disease requiring timely diagnosis and effective therapy. Standardized criteria that define high-risk prostate cancer have yet to be established, rendering the discrimination of high-risk from nonhigh-risk patients a challenge. This review summarizes the contemporary definitions of high-risk prostate cancer and their clinical utility.

Recent Findings

As currently defined, high-risk prostate cancer constitutes a heterogeneous group of tumors with varying pathological features and inconsistent outcomes. Some high-risk patients may harbor systemic disease and relapse after local definitive therapy, whereas a substantial proportion have localized cancers and may be cured by surgery alone. If properly identified, these high-risk patients should be deemed candidates for curative treatment and spared the morbidity of systemic therapy. Additional information derived from systematic prostate biopsy, magnetic resonance findings, and, possibly, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen kinetics may be incorporated into the currently available models to yield a better prediction and to allow more informed decision-making.

Summary

The quandary of how to define high-risk prostate cancer is pertinent. Various contemporary definitions of high-risk prostate cancer are available, most of which lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. Patients with high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer, by any of the current definitions, should not be uniformly disqualified from local definitive therapy with curative intent.

### High-risk prostate cancer-classification and therapy [^63b9c117]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Approximately 15% of patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high-risk disease. However, the current definitions of high-risk prostate cancer include a heterogeneous group of patients with a range of prognoses. Some have the potential to progress to a lethal phenotype that can be fatal, while others can be cured with treatment of the primary tumour alone. The optimal management of this patient subgroup is evolving. A refined classification scheme is needed to enable the early and accurate identification of high-risk disease so that more-effective treatment paradigms can be developed. We discuss several principles established from clinical trials, and highlight other questions that remain unanswered. This Review critically evaluates the existing literature focused on defining the high-risk population, the management of patients with high-risk prostate cancer, and future directions to optimize care.

### Advances in the multimodality management of high-risk prostate cancer [^c295e39e]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with marked variability in its natural progression and response to therapeutic interventions. It is the most commonly diagnosed visceral cancer of men living in western countries, yet it is life-threatening in only a minority of cases. Thus, appropriate patient selection for treatment based on tumor as well as patient characteristics is essential to achieve optimal outcomes. The combination of early cancer detection and technical improvements in local treatment has led to a reduction in disease burden and an increase in cancer survivorship. However, treatment failure remains common among high-risk cases.

Currently, numerous systems exist for the identification of high-risk prostate cancer, but few of these systems can guide treatment strategies. A new stratification tool that uses common diagnostic factors can help to predict outcomes after radical prostatectomy. The tool aids physicians in the identification of appropriate candidates for aggressive, local treatment.

What are the future research needs?

The past few years have provided important new information on prostate cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Several key research endeavors are needed to close important knowledge gaps.

Firstly, we need to develop and evaluate novel research methods that can be used to obtain comparative effectiveness data in a timely and cost efficient manner but are adaptive to the incremental technological changes that occur over the lifetime of a study. Such studies may include designs that feature point of care enrolment and use of cohort multiple RCT methods. Recent findings show that RCTs are vital for accurately assessing the benefits and harms of prevention, detection, and treatment strategies.

Secondly, we need better methods for population screening and diagnostic strategies that avoid diagnosing men with clinically insignificant prostate cancer but still identify those with clinically important disease. Few, if any, biomarkers have been identified that could replace or complement PSA. One strategy that could be readily evaluated is the impact of using higher PSA thresholds (such as 6–10 ng/mL) to define abnormality, trigger prostate biopsy, and recommend early treatment. The current strategy of using transrectal biopsy or histologic outcomes from surgery as a means to validate new biomarkers is probably flawed because of the inherent spectrum and selection biases that result. Biomarkers require validation against a reference standard that can be applied to all men at risk. The target condition for detection should focus on clinically significant cancers. Imaging research that allows the targeting (for biopsy or treatment) of clinically significant lesions has shown promise and requires additional study.

### Prostate cancer screening and the management of clinically localized disease [^e5550a9a]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

What is the prognosis for men with clinically localized prostate cancer?

The long term prognosis for most men with clinically localized prostate cancer is excellent, even with no early treatment. This is particularly true for men with prostate cancer that is detected by PSA screening and not palpable (most men diagnosed currently); in men with PSA values of 10 ng/mL or less; or those with "low risk disease" defined by PSA levels (≤ 10 ng/mL), tumor stage (T1 or T2a), and histologic grade (Gleason score < 6). Prostate cancer mortality over at least 15 years in these men treated with observation is 5% or less. Nonetheless, prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer related morbidity and mortality. Men with PSA values greater than 10 ng/mL or with high risk disease (PSA > 20 ng/mL; tumor stage > T2b; Gleason score 8–10) have a worse prognosis. Their 15 year risk of prostate cancer mortality when managed expectantly is 20% or more. In this group surgery seems to reduce overall and disease mortality and bone metastases. Patients, their families, physicians, and the public seek answers to reduce the physical, social, and financial costs of this disease. We need better markers of prognosis, determinants of treatment effectiveness, and methods to effectively communicate and implement prognostic information. We need safer and more effective strategies and more rational use of existing options.

### Imaging and evaluation of patients with high-risk prostate cancer [^2766f45e]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Approximately 15% of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have high-risk disease. Imaging is critically important for the diagnosis and staging of these patients, and also for the selection of management. While established prostate cancer staging guidelines have increased the appropriate use of imaging, underuse for high-risk prostate cancer remains substantial. Several factors affect the utility of initial diagnostic imaging, including the variable definition of high-risk prostate cancer, variable guideline recommendations, poor accuracy of existing imaging tests, and the difficulty in validating imaging findings. Conventional imaging modalities, including CT and radionuclide bone scan, have been employed for local and metastatic staging, but their performance characteristics have generally been poor. Emerging modalities including multiparametricMRI, positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and PET-MRI have shown increased diagnostic accuracy and could improve accuracy in staging patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

### Approach to the patient with high-risk prostate cancer [^a008c81b]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Men classified as having high-risk prostate cancer warrant treatment because durable outcomes can be achieved. Judicious use of imaging and considerations of risk factors are essential when caring for men with high-risk disease. Radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy all play pivotal roles in the management of men with high-risk disease, and potentially in men with metastatic disease. The optimal combinations of therapeutic regimens are an evolving area of study and future work looking into therapies for men with high-risk disease will remain critical.

### Recent advances in the management of high-risk localized prostate cancer: local therapy, systemic therapy, and biomarkers to guide treatment decisions… [^914b4222]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Defining High-risk Disease There are multiple definitions used to categorize individuals with high-risk prostate cancer. Pretreatment parameters, including clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score, are established predictors of disease recurrence and have historically been used in high-risk disease classifications. 8The National Comprehensive Cancer Network defines high risk as clinical T stage cT3a, Gleason score of at least 8, or PSA of at least 20 ng/mL, and it defines very high risk as T3b or T4 disease. 9Although these definitions do not integrate disease extent within the gland, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score considers the percent of biopsy cores positive for cancer in risk stratification, along with age, clinical T stage, and Gleason score, to predict prostate cancer–specific mortality independent of treatment.

Although previous guidelines panels have recommended consideration of the use of any of these four assays for initial risk stratification in patients with low or favorable-intermediate risk of prostate cancer, the most recent 2020 NCCN guidelines expand the use of biomarkers into more aggressive patient populations, stating that "Men with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk disease and life expectancy ≥ 10 years may consider use of Decipher and Prolaris tumor-based molecular assays". Biomarkers to Guide Therapy Selection for Localized Prostate Cancer The use of biomarkers to guide treatment approaches in high-risk prostate cancer is evolving, as evidenced by recent changes in NCCN guidelines.

In the 2019 guidelines, biomarkers were not recommended for initial risk stratification within high-risk populations, but the most recent 2020 guidelines advocate for consideration of the Decipher and Prolaris tumor-based molecular assays in men with high-risk disease and life expectancy of at least 10 years. To date, Decipher is the most extensively studied biomarker assay within the high-risk population. Large studies have demonstrated that the addition of Decipher to clinicopathologic variables improves the estimation of risk of distant metastases compared with risk stratification by NCCN groups alone. As a consequence of these retrospective studies demonstrating the benefit of biomarkers, a large, prospective, biomarker-driven phase III clinical trial is being initiated for patients with high-risk prostate cancer.

In this study, patients with high-risk disease, by NCCN criteria, will undergo biomarker testing of their tumor sample with the Decipher assay.

### Defining high risk prostate cancer – where do we set the bar? A translational science approach to risk stratification [^1d56a4c6]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Risk stratification is commonly used in patients with prostate cancer but this effort has had no demonstrable effect on patient decision making for initial therapy. We propose new risk strata for clinically localized prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

We examined current stratification methods for prostate cancer and their impact on prostate cancer therapy.

Results

Three risk strata for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer are proposed. Stratum 1 includes patients in whom active surveillance is associated with a low risk of disease progression. Stratum 2 includes patients in whom monotherapy, including external beam, interstitial radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, is generally successful. Stratum 3 includes patients at high risk for recurrence with monotherapy in whom multimodal therapy may be superior.

Conclusions

Risk stratification systems for prostate cancer should harmonize the needs of researchers to develop comparable groupings of patients, of patients who seek guidance on optimal therapy and of clinical trialists who seek to advance therapy for this disease. Our new stratification system provides such a structure.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^4ec0ab1a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Advanced prostate cancer imaging — Clinical question 3: It is recommended when choosing an imaging modality that disease states and clinical scenarios are taken into consideration because the imaging modality may guide treatment or change clinical treatment decisions, with Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong. Prostate cancer frequently recurs despite negative conventional imaging, there is an unmet need for accurate diagnosis of metastatic disease for accurate staging, appropriate counseling, and adequate treatment planning for all stages of the disease, and improved and more accurate diagnosis of disease outside of the prostate or subclinical metastatic disease offers the potential to modulate or change treatment. In patients presenting with high-risk, including locally advanced, prostate cancer, the prevalence of metastases is reported to be between 30% and 50% of patients, and for the detection of metastatic bone disease the combination of bone scans and CT perform suboptimally compared with whole-body MRI and various PET/CT radiopharmaceuticals; given wide geographic variation in availability of NGI technologies, when available, they should be considered in the context of a clinical trial so that generalizable data can be recorded.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^fdb13c1f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### Screening for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^ee0849b4]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

In summary, existing evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support the routine use of screening for prostate cancer, though screening probably aids in earlier diagnosis and helps to detect prostate cancer at an earlier stage. This early detection, which has not been shown to have a significant impact on mortality, comes at the price of additional testing, the risk of overtreatment and downstream adverse effects, and impaired quality of life that currently cannot be precisely quantified. Patients need to be informed about the existing uncertainties; individual patients' values and preferences are key factors in deciding whether to offer screening. At the individual level, it is conceivable that some patients would value early detection, while others might want to avoid the risk of overdiagnosis. Until further evidence accumulates, this systematic review should serve as a basis for the development of evidence based clinical practice guidelines by relevant stakeholder organisations and prompt an update of such guidelines that continue to actively promote routine prostate cancer screeningeven in the absence of reliable evidence, as reflected by our study findings.

American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations for higher-risk men — The ACS continues to recommend that African American men and men who have a family history of a first-degree relative with prostate cancer be provided information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits surrounding prostate cancer screening beginning at age 45 years. For men who have multiple first-degree relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years, this discussion should take place beginning at age 40 years. For men who choose to be screened, the ACS recommends integrating established risk factors into an individualized risk assessment, particularly when PSA levels fall into what currently would be considered the high-normal range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL.

### The epidemiology of high-risk prostate cancer [^dc802fdb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Concern for over and under-treatment of men with prostate cancer has led to an increased focus on the identification and selective treatment of men with high-risk features. The purpose of this review is to summarize the epidemiology, risk factors, and treatment trends of men with high-risk prostate cancer.

Recent Findings

Findings from recent trials on prostate-specific antigen-based screening suggest that screening has substantially reduced the incidence of high-risk prostate cancer. Men with high-risk disease tend to be older at diagnosis than those with low-risk disease. There is marked variation in the treatment of men with high-risk features; contemporary studies favor multimodal therapy, but high-risk disease is often under-treated with androgen deprivation alone, particularly among older men.

Summary

Variations in the incidence, mortality, and treatment of men with high-risk prostate cancer may reflect heterogeneity among studies in the definition of high-risk disease. Future research should attempt to standardize definitions of high-risk prostate cancer to allow better comparison between studies and provide a more homogeneous assessment of natural history.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^975eef6f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How this recommendation was created

Our international panel included patient partners (men at risk of prostate cancer), general practitioners, general internists, urologists, epidemiologists, methodologists, and statisticians. They determined the scope of the question that the recommendation should address and what outcomes are most important to patients considering screening.

No person had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel identified eight critical outcomes needed to inform the recommendations: all-cause mortality; prostate cancer mortality; incidence of prostate cancer diagnoses (all stages); incidence of localised cancer (stage I and II); incidence of advanced cancer (stage III and IV); complications from biopsies (such as bleeding, pain, infections, and hospital readmissions), complications from prostate cancer treatment (such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction); and quality of life. The panel also identified three additional patient-important outcomes: false positive rates (men with elevated PSA levels who will have negative biopsy); false negative rates (men with a normal PSA result who will subsequently be diagnosed with cancer), and the anxiety and uncertainty related to concerns about having prostate cancer. The panel asked that potential subgroups effects be explored according to age, screening interval, family history, being of African descent, and being of lower socioeconomic level. They also asked for a sensitivity analysis of the effect of screening restricted to trials at lower risk of bias.

To inform the recommendation, the panel members requested two systematic reviews, on the following questions:

What are the benefits and harms of PSA screening versus no screening?
What evidence describes the values and preference of men considering PSA screening?

Two parallel teams conducted these systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication.

The panel met to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. They followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including use of the GRADE approach to interpret the evidence and create recommendations (see appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of PSA screening; the quality of the evidence for each outcome; and typical and expected variations in patient values and preferences, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Although the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening since the 1990s has led to increased early diagnoses, the most recent studies are in conflict about the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screening. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the use of the PSA test to lower mortality, but there is still concern that over-diagnosis may lead to over-treatment of cancers that would not significantly affect patients' health for several years. This article describes the results of important recent prostate cancer screening trials, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Cancer Society screening guidelines, and discusses the implications for clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

Prostate cancer is a complex disease to manage because of its very variable clinical course. In many cases, a diagnosis of prostate cancer will not result in mortality or morbidity from the disease. Hence, understanding the risks posed from a prostate cancer diagnosis is critical to its management. All too often however, this understanding is poor amongst clinicians and leads to recommendations that can result in both over treatment and under treatment. To aid these discussions, the use of risk and prognostic models have become essential in practice. Until about 15 years ago, the main risk models used were based on the first iteration described by D'Amico nearly 30 years ago. Crucially, the notion of "risk" was based on the chance of biochemical relapse thus assuming that treatment was an inevitable requirement in prostate cancer. It is now well established that many men especially with localised disease do need treatment and surveillance is an important management option. Despite this, many national and international guidelines still recommend classifications that are iterations or derivatives of the now out-dated three-tier low, intermediate and high-risk model.

### Point: active surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer [^f631678b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

Active surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer has become increasingly popular in populations where prostate cancer screening is widespread, because of evidence that prostate cancer screening results in the detection of disease that is not clinically significant in many patients (i.e., untreated, would not pose a threat to health). This approach is supported by data showing that patients who fall into the category of clinically insignificant disease can be identified with reasonable accuracy, and that patients who are initially classified as low-risk who reclassified over time as higher-risk and are treated radically are still cured in most cases. Active surveillance means 1) identifying patients who have a low likelihood of disease progression during their lifetime, based on clinical and pathologic features of the disease, and patient age and comorbidity; 2) close monitoring over time; 3) developing reasonable criteria for intervention, which will identify more aggressive disease in a timely fashion and not result in excessive treatment; and 4) meeting the communication challenge to reduce the psychological burden of living with untreated cancer. This article reviews the results of active surveillance, the criteria for patient selection, and the appropriate triggers for intervention.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |

### Management of high-risk populations with locally advanced prostate cancer [^94530c6b]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer that extends beyond the confines of the prostatic gland on clinical and/or radiographic assessment, without evidence of lymph node or distant metastases, is regarded as locally advanced. The locally advanced prostate cancer patient population consists of a heterogeneous group of men, some of whom have tumors that may be amenable to primary curative intent with local definitive therapy associated with acceptable long-term cancer control rates. In order to optimally manage this group of patients, it is important to be able to recognize who is at a high risk of tumor recurrence after primary local therapy. In this brief review, we discuss the factors that contribute to the prediction of high risk in populations with locally advanced disease and the treatment options available.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^dc278201]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer early detection — PSA thresholds and shared decision-making are outlined as follows: we continue to recommend that men who are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages — African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives — should be provided the opportunity for informed decision-making at a younger age than men who are at average risk. Recognizing that lowering the PSA threshold for biopsy will increase the rate of overdiagnosis, we consider the traditional PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL to be a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. Acknowledging that there is no true PSA cutoff point that distinguishes cancer from noncancer, we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when PSA levels fall in the indeterminate range between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, particularly in men who are at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-PSA risk factors. Until that time, however, it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men with the opportunity to decide whether they wish to pursue early detection of prostate cancer.

### Clinically localized prostate cancer: AUA / ASTRO guideline, part I: introduction, risk assessment, staging, and risk-based management [^8c6f6786]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Clinically localized prostate cancer guideline methodology — evidence sources, study selection, screening, and abstraction — is described as follows: The Localized Prostate Cancer Guideline Panel was created in 2019 by the American Urological Association (AUA); searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE (September 2021), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (August 2021), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (September 2021). The target population included clinically localized prostate cancer defined as up to clinical stage T3 by digital rectal examination without nodal or distant metastasis (N0M0) on conventional imaging, and studies of low-, intermediate-, or high-risk disease were included. For prognostic factors, eligible evidence comprised primary studies and systematic reviews that reported risk estimates, controlled for confounders, evaluated patients who did not undergo curative treatment or who underwent radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, and recruited patients in or after 1990; for prognosis, OHSU restricted inclusion to large (n > 1,000) studies unless no such studies were available, and this sample-size criterion was only applied to studies of prognosis. For diagnosis, included evidence reported diagnostic accuracy or discrimination, and for treatments/management OHSU focused on randomized trials, with recent, large cohort studies included when randomized trials were unavailable and confounders were controlled. Exclusions were uncontrolled treatment studies, case reports, narrative reviews, non-English language articles, in vitro and animal studies, and all articles had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Screening used two investigators and a two-phase method for screening full-text articles; OHSU utilized systematic reviews that addressed Key Questions, were higher quality, and published within the last five years, and the second phase identified primary studies for Key Questions not sufficiently answered by prior systematic reviews and new studies published after those reviews. Data abstraction for primary studies captured study design, year, setting, country, sample size, eligibility criteria, dose and duration of the intervention, and population characteristics including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, plus results and funding; for systematic reviews, OHSU abstracted characteristics of included studies, population criteria, interventions, methods, ratings for risk of bias, synthesis methods, and results.

### Ethnicity and prostate cancer: the way to solve the screening problem? [^4213f97a]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, and the second leading cause of cancer death" is perhaps the most frequently used first sentence in any article reporting on prostate cancer today. Although it sounds a bit like a cliché, the true importance of this first statement should not be overlooked. The data on incidence, and especially mortality, were the driving force for many to search for ways to prevent the occurrence of prostate cancer deaths at an early stage. This ultimately culminated (at the end of the previous century) in the start of some of the largest population based screening studies ever conducted. Now, two decades after the start of these trials, we know from the largest trial, the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC,), that we are able to reduce the number of men that suffer from metastatic disease by 30% and men that die of prostate cancer by roughly 20% on a population-based level. On an individual basis, the prostate cancer mortality reduction can increase up to 51% when comparing a man choosing to be regularly screened versus a man not screened at all. However, this reduction comes at a considerable cost, i.e. substantial over diagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancers that were never destined to cause complaints let alone kill (indolent prostate cancer). On a population-based level, these harms of prostate cancer screening are judged not to outweigh the benefits. Much research is therefore currently done into new markers (e.g. blood, urine, or tissue markers) and technologies (e.g. MRI) to enable the selective detection of aggressive prostate cancers and thereby reduce the harms. However, until truly better markers and technologies become (widely) available, improving the current screening strategies by risk-stratifying men into high risk (and thus potentially a better harm-to-benefit ratio) and low risk (and thus potentially a poorer harm-to-benefit ratio) based on currently available data, seems the best way to go. In addition, instead of offering screening to the entire population, most major guidelines now advise to discuss screening on an individual level, starting only if individual potential benefits are judged to weigh against the potential harms of, and by, the individual. In this light, Lloyd et al. recently published in BMC Medicine a manuscript that aimed to provide individual men with the so needed easy to grasp lifetime risks of prostate cancer diagnosis and prostate cancer death. They go even further by risk-stratifying men into high and low risk of prostate cancer death, based on race, suggesting a better harm-to-benefit ratio for some ethnicities as opposed to others. Based on the presented UK-based data, they hope to help men make a better informed decision on prostate cancer screening. However, the question is whether there really is a true difference between race and prostate cancer mortality that should trigger screening in the one and not the other, and, if so, is this difference the most optimal way to risk-stratify men for screening?

Key Points

Question

What characteristics among physicians and patients are associated with choosing active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer within a research framework?

Findings

In this cohort study that included 852 patients with low-risk prostate cancer, the proportion of patients choosing active surveillance was 82% and increased over time. A multidisciplinary discussion and a review of the diagnostic biopsy were associated with this choice.

Meaning

These findings suggest that this research framework was associated with a large diffusion of active surveillance in clinical practice and high acceptance among patients.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^2c14bfa8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiologically, screening is justified by the importance of the disease and the lack of prospects for primary prevention, but evidence from natural history is unhelpful since men are more likely to die with, rather than from, prostate cancer. The available screening tests do not always detect men whose lesions could result in future morbidity or mortality. Evidence is limited for the benefits of treatment for localised cancers detected through screening, whereas the evidence for harm is clear. Observational evidence for the effect of population screening programmes is mixed, with no clear association between intensity of screening and reduced prostate cancer mortality. Screening for prostate cancer cannot be justified in low-risk populations, but the balance of benefit and harm will be more favourable after risk stratification. Prostate cancer screening can be justified only in research programmes designed to assess its effectiveness and help identify the groups who may benefit.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### Newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer in an era of rapidly evolving new imaging: how Do we treat? [^7283c30a]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

1 At diagnosis, a serum PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥ 8, and/or clinical stage T3 or greater disease define a high-risk group of patients with a 10-year PSA and disease relapse rate of 50%-75% after primary therapy. Positron Emission Tomography Imaging The drive for a more sensitive imaging modality for assessment of newly diagnosed disease and recurrent PC ushered the development of multiple positron emission tomography radiotracers. These include radiolabeled fluciclovine and bone scans versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT to assess comparative accuracy in identifying pelvic nodal or distant metastasis. Unless three or more distant metastases were identified, patients crossed over to the other imaging. Among 302 men, PSMA PET-CT had 27% greater accuracy than CIM underwent PET imaging with 18F-DCFPyL to determine correspondence of PET findings with lesional status based on pathologic sampling, other correlated imaging, or PSA response. Treat the patient. We, as a multidisciplinary group, recommend that although PET imaging should be considered, patient management should move forward, guided mainly by established principles and existing level I, evidence-based standard of care. As a start and in line with other diagnostic studies, PET data may be used to paint a more complete picture of the disease extent; however, treatment should remain guided by existing oncologic principles with inclusion of shared decision making. Impact on clinical trials.

With the early adoption and increased availability of PSMA PET and with some patients even traveling internationally for such scans, there has been resultant stage migration and potential impact on current clinical trial eligibility and enrollment. This is likely to affect studies examining multiple PC scenarios. Patients suspected of having high- or very high–risk localized PC but who are N0M0 on CIM are being identified as N1 or even M1 on PET imaging.

5 Conclusions

APCCC provides a unique opportunity to gather the opinions of recognised prostate cancer experts who meet to discuss and vote on open questions that are not fully addressed by the existing literature and therefore remain topics with weak evidence, including in guidelines. APCCC also identifies priority areas where research should focus to help fill critical gaps in knowledge. In a field that is rapidly changing, such as the management of locally advanced and biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, it is important to recognise that the voting at APCCC reflects what experts currently think based on their experience and knowledge of the literature and existing evidence. For the majority of questions, it was assumed that all diagnostic and therapeutic options were available without restrictions. However, experts with little or no experience with newer tests and modalities, such as next-generation imaging or genomic classifiers, may hesitate to vote for answers that include such options. As mentioned in our report of the APCCC 2019, expert opinion statements may be criticised, which remains a limitation of a consensus approach. APCCC has worked to address these issues by considerably expanding the number of voting panel members from 61 experts in 2019 to > 105 experts in 2022.

Finally, although this report captures what experts in the field think today, it should be interpreted and integrated into clinical practice with the same scrutiny that any other major paper would receive, and with the knowledge that consensus does not constitute or substitute for evidence.

### Risk-based prostate cancer screening [^cbe0a565]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Widespread mass screening of prostate cancer (PCa) is not recommended because the balance between benefits and harms is still not well established. The achieved mortality reduction comes with considerable harm such as unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses, and overtreatment. Therefore, patient stratification with regard to PCa risk and aggressiveness is necessary to identify those men who are at risk and may actually benefit from early detection.

Objective

This review critically examines the current evidence regarding risk-based PCa screening.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of the literature was performed using the Medline database. Further studies were selected based on manual searches of reference lists and review articles.

Evidence Synthesis

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to be the single most significant predictive factor for identifying men at increased risk of developing PCa. Especially in men with no additional risk factors, PSA alone provides an appropriate marker up to 30 yr into the future. After assessment of an early PSA test, the screening frequency may be determined based on individualized risk. A limited list of additional factors such as age, comorbidity, prostate volume, family history, ethnicity, and previous biopsy status have been identified to modify risk and are important for consideration in routine practice. In men with a known PSA, risk calculators may hold the promise of identifying those who are at increased risk of having PCa and are therefore candidates for biopsy.

Conclusions

PSA testing may serve as the foundation for a more risk-based assessment. However, the decision to undergo early PSA testing should be a shared one between the patient and his physician based on information balancing its advantages and disadvantages.

### Risk stratification in prostate cancer screening [^f9daa537]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial topic within the field of urology. The US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial did not demonstrate any difference in prostate-cancer-related mortality rates between men screened annually rather than on an 'opportunistic' basis. However, in the world's largest trial to date — the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer — screening every 2–4 years was associated with a 21% reduction in prostate-cancer-related mortality rate after 11 years. Citing the uncertain ratio between potential harm and potential benefit, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended against serum PSA screening. Although this ratio has yet to be elucidated, PSA testing — and early tumour detection — is undoubtedly beneficial for some individuals. Instead of adopting a 'one size fits all' approach, physicians are likely to perform personalized risk assessment to minimize the risk of negative consequences, such as anxiety, unnecessary testing and biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. The PSA test needs to be combined with other predictive factors or be used in a more thoughtful way to identify men at risk of symptomatic or life-threatening cancer, without overdiagnosing indolent disease. A risk-adapted approach is needed, whereby PSA testing is tailored to individual risk.

### Consensus on prostate cancer treatment of localized disease with very low, low, and intermediate risk: a report from the first prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries (PCCCDC) [^9062774f]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common cancer that affects men. The incidence of the disease has been increasing globally in recent years. Global Cancer Observatory: Cancer Today data showed that PCa was the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality among men worldwide in 2012. Over the last 20 years, an increasing trend has been observed in the new cases and deaths from different cancers worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In the Americas, PCa is the most common cancer in males, with approximately 413,000 new cases and 85,000 deaths each year.

PCa can be managed with curative intent when it is still localized and can respond to treatments even in metastatic cases. Tumor growth rates vary by type of tumor, stage, and response to therapy. A US study showed that 5-year survival of localized and locally advanced tumors was 100% and the metastasis rate was 28.7%. However, when screening for PCa, one of the goals is to identify localized high-risk PCa that can be successfully treated, thereby decreasing complications associated with advanced or metastatic PCa.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels historically correlate with the presence of PCa, this test provides little information regarding disease location and extent of cancer and has both potential benefits and harms. Screening with PSA leads to overdiagnosis. Treatment of these men often results in adverse events including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms, therefore providing no benefit. Follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20%-50% of men diagnosed with PCa through screening may be overdiagnosed. In men with 70 years and older, overdiagnosis increases rates, related to competing causes of death. The US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend screening for PCa. After informed and understanding the risks, the preference of the patient could be evaluated.

Although early detection of PCa by PSA screening remains controversial, changes in PSA threshold, frequency of screening, and addition of other biomarkers have potential to minimize overdiagnosis associated with PSA screening.

CONCLUSIONS

Prostate cancer encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, ranging from low‐risk disease, in which treatment can only harm and not extend life, to a fatal disease, which still claims too many lives globally. Appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment are keys to good management. Emerging data and new therapies will continue to refine therapeutic paradigms and improve outcomes for individuals with prostate cancer.

Although observational studies and simulation models have shed some interesting light on many of the uncertainties surrounding prostate cancer screening, well-done clinical trials provide the best evidence on screening among the extremes of age, the most appropriate interval to screen, and the best complement of tests to use. Enthusiasm for screening is temporized by the acknowledgment that overdetection leads to frequent overtreatment despite evidence supporting the safety of active surveillance in many men with low-risk disease.

### Is tumour volume an independent predictor of outcome after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer? [^920ea9fb]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that TV measured in histopathological specimens is significantly associated with oncological outcomes following radical prostatectomy for high risk prostate cancer. However, its prognostic value when combined with known predictive variables such as pGG, pT stage and margin status is limited.

Whilst risk stratification tools for identifying low, intermediate and high-risk disease are common, exact definitions for high-risk disease are debated and outcomes may vary considerably. In certain patients, radical prostatectomy can effectively treat high-risk disease with high metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates. Various attempts have been made to identify factors that may predict outcomes in high-risk localised prostate cancer. Historically criteria set by D'Amico have been widely used although it is increasingly recognised that especially for high-risk patients, the categories may be too broad. Further systems have been promoted such as the NCCN classification used in this study. The aim of all such systems is accurately predict a specific patient's treatment specific prognosis. In order to do so, they mostly incorporate all available prognostic information.

Various studies have refined the predictions offered by these standard models. Further subdivision of high-risk patients using the existing parameters of T stage, PSA and GG has been shown to be predict BCR and survival. Other studies have recommended the use of other factors such as PSAD or percentage of positive cores. These approaches come with a number of limitations. Accurate diagnosis in prostate cancer remains a considerable challenge despite advances in imaging modalities and biopsy technique. Previous studies have shown that even in high-risk prostate cancer, grade group may change in almost 50% of patients on final histology. Results from our study reflect this uncertainty. With long-term follow up data, no preoperative factors accurately predicted either BCR or failure free survival on regression analysis. This discrepancy is likely due to the select high-risk cohort of patients.

### Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update [^a5041184]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide current information on the use of PSA testing for the evaluation of men at risk for prostate cancer, and the risks and benefits of early detection.

Materials and Methods

The report is a summary of the American Urological Association PSA Best Practice Policy 2009. The summary statement is based on a review of the current professional literature, clinical experience and the expert opinions of a multispecialty panel. It is intended to serve as a resource for physicians, other health care professionals, and patients. It does not establish a fixed set of guidelines, define the legal standard of care or pre-empt physician judgment in individual cases.

Results

There are two notable differences in the current policy. First, the age for obtaining a baseline PSA has been lowered to 40 years. Secondly, the current policy no longer recommends a single, threshold value of PSA, which should prompt prostate biopsy. Rather, the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be based primarily on PSA and DRE results, but should take into account multiple factors including free and total PSA, patient age, PSA velocity, PSA density, family history, ethnicity, prior biopsy history and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Although recently published trials show different results regarding the impact of prostate cancer screening on mortality, both suggest that prostate cancer screening leads to overdetection and overtreatment of some patients. Therefore, men should be informed of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening before biopsy and the option of active surveillance in lieu of immediate treatment for certain men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### A modified Delphi study to develop a practical guide for selecting patients with prostate cancer for active surveillance [^bb0eab3a]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer incidence globally is increasing and prostate cancer specific mortality is decreasing, in part due to an increase in the diagnosis of low-risk prostate cancer. The risk of disease progression in men with localised prostate cancer at diagnosis is mainly determined by the Gleason grade, a histopathological prostate cancer grading system. Patients with localised Gleason grade 3 + 3 prostate cancer have almost no risk of metastatic progression, and the risk increases with higher Gleason grades. Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for patients diagnosed with localised prostate cancer with low-risk of disease progression. AS involves proactive, regular monitoring to defer or avoid radical treatments that have significant associated morbidity, such as prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Large single centre studies, multicentre AS cohorts, and a large randomised controlled trial of active monitoring versus radical treatment have shown that the risk of disease progression and prostate cancer mortality is very low in men with low-risk disease after long-term follow-up. These findings were relatively consistent, despite each study employing different AS eligibility criteria and protocols.

A major challenge for urologists and prostate cancer multidisciplinary teams in identifying appropriate patients for AS is the accurate diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer. The traditional diagnostic pathway using prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing followed by transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (TRUS), which published AS studies to date have largely relied upon, is known to over-detect low-grade prostate cancer and under-detect high grade prostate cancer. The limitations of the traditional pathway can be seen in the rates of diagnoses in men with previous negative biopsies undergoing repeat TRUS biopsies and the reclassification of 25–33% of patients on AS to higher grade disease after initial diagnosis in cohort studies. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), which is a relatively new imaging modality that can be used in the pre-biopsy setting to detect lesions in the prostate and guide targeted biopsy, is a more accurate test whose role in AS is still being defined. Numerous biomarkers and genetic mutations have been identified as potentially being useful for prostate cancer risk stratification and prognostication, but the evidence base remains heterogeneous and weak.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Conclusion Introduction 1This percentage may be higher in developing countries, especially where multidisciplinary care is limited to few academic medical centers and there are major access barriers from screening to confirmation diagnosis. This article will summarize the recommendations of a large panel of physicians from developing countries, specializing in PCa, regarding the treatment of patients presenting with high-risk PCa both with and without contemplating the restrictions of limited resources in the decision-making process, with the objective of providing guidance in clinical practice and policy development and modification. Radiotherapy 2, 3EBRT is the most used type of radiation treatment, in particular IMRT.

The enhanced conformity of IMRT allows for dose escalation to the prostate while reducing the dose to the bladder and rectum, and trials have demonstrated reduced toxicity with IMRT; however, reimbursements for IMRT were higher, leading to increased costs in the overall care for PCa. 4When comparing different radiotherapy strategies, including three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with IMRT, IMRT was found to be cost effective in one Australian study, demonstrating an approximate 1. 1 million dollars in savings per 1, 000 patients.

There are no randomized clinical trials completed comparing surgery versus radiation. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding what the best approach is focusing on efficacy, toxicity, and quality of life. A retrospective German analysis including 910 men with localized disease treated with surgery, 292 with radiation, and 124 with active surveillance concluded that surgery was associated with more life-years gained. However, because of the high inpatient costs of the initial surgery, radical prostatectomy had €11, 000 in Euros higher total per capita costs than radiation or active surveillance. 13The length of RT compared with surgery may also present an issue in patients with limited transportation and/or access to the health centers.

### Structured population-based prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: the European Association of Urology position in 2019 [^8e8e094c]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the first three causes of cancer mortality in Europe. Screening in asymptomatic men (aged 55-69yr) using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is associated with a migration toward lower staged disease and a reduction in cancer-specific mortality. By 20yr after testing, around 100 men need to be screened to prevent one PCa death. While this ratio is smaller than for breast and colon cancer, the long natural history of PCa means many men die from other causes. As such, the nonselective use of PSA testing and radical treatments can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The European Association of Urology (EAU) supports measures to encourage appropriate PCa detection through PSA testing, while reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. These goals may be achieved using personalized risk-stratified approaches. For diagnosis, the greatest benefit from early detection is likely to come in men assessed using baseline PSA levels at the age of 45yr to individualize screening intervals. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as well as risk calculators based on family history, ethnicity, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume should be considered to triage the need for biopsy, thus reducing the risk of overdiagnosis. For treatment, the EAU advocates balancing patient's life expectancy and cancer's mortality risk when deciding an approach. Active surveillance is encouraged in well-informed patients with low-risk and some intermediate-risk cancers, as it decreases the risks of overtreatment without compromising oncological outcomes. Conversely, the EAU advocates radical treatment in suitable men with more aggressive PCa. Multimodal treatment should be considered in locally advanced or high-grade cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: Implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening should be considered at a population level. Men at risk of prostate cancer should have a baseline PSA blood test (eg, at 45yr). The level of this test, combined with family history, ethnicity, and other factors, can be used to determine subsequent follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and novel biomarkers should be used to determine which men need biopsy and how any cancers should be treated.

Overview — Screening and management considerations state that use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for early detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer, together with imaging and consideration of risk calculators and/or biomarkers to improve screening specificity, should decrease the risk of overdetection. Reduced overdetection along with use of active surveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment AND preserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^fc7d2247]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — estimate of net benefit from decision analysis: Conclusions consistent with randomized trials and cohort studies suggest that more aggressive strategies, particularly those using a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold for biopsy than generally used in the United States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death from prostate cancer; however, these strategies are also associated with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of overdiagnosis, and options to reduce overdiagnosis include lowering the age at which to stop screening, extending the interval between screenings, and using higher PSA thresholds for biopsy. Decision analysis models confirm that the overall benefit of PSA-based screening is sensitive to the values of individual men, and the magnitude of net benefit depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

Background

Prostate cancer has a high incidence but a relatively low mortality rate. To date, screening studies have failed to show a clear benefit of survival against the counter-balances of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. While this paradigm has been improved with the introduction of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) pre-biopsy, it remains the case that many men need to be tested and referred to a tertiary centre before scans and biopsies are done to confirm or refute if a significant cancer is present. Indeed, it is estimated that for every man diagnosed with a significant cancer, up to 2 others will have unnecessary referral and investigations. Natural history studies have shown that almost all men will develop cancer foci in the prostate with age but relatively few go onto cause morbidity. Our understanding of what is a prognostically important cancer has also evolved greatly and the concept of not detecting cancers too early is now widely accepted.

Current approaches to early detection have tended to view men as a group from which the one at risk needs to be picked out and referred. The key conundrum is the balance between detecting cancer too early for which treatment is not (or will ever be) needed and hence confer no survival gain but, on the other hand, not detecting it too late when curative treatment is not possible, all within the context of a naturally growing prostate gland and ageing male. Whatever the approach, cost and cost–benefit and linking with survival outcomes are going to be key for any prostate cancer early detection programme in an ever more expensive health care environment. These aspects argue strongly for a more rational and tiered strategy to the use of investigations and referrals.

Hitherto, groups working in early detection have generally fallen into separate camps, e.g. using SNP baseline population testing, bio-marker panels or imaging tests to visualise lesions. None have gained traction to replace the simple PSA test. Thus, PSA will likely remain the first and most important baseline test, and this is the case in many current renewed efforts to re-evaluate screening. Here, we tested the incremental value of different types of biomarkers in addition to PSA to detect significant cancer and how performance may vary depending on the definition of 'clinical significance'. Our goal was to derive the optimal sequence or testing tiers to (i) reduce the overall investigated population in men with a raised PSA, (ii) refine or reduce use of imaging and/or biopsies and (iii) explore the impact of using different definitions of clinically significant disease.

There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^26f0a78a]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^302aa3b6]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society prostate cancer screening — PSA 2.5–4.0 ng/mL risk assessment: It is reasonable to offer men the opportunity for individualized risk assessment at PSA values between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, and multiple studies have demonstrated that greater than 20% of men in this range have prostate cancer on biopsy. Although individualized risk assessment can be time-consuming, only about 10% of men who choose to be screened will have values that fall in the 2.5 ng/mL to 4.0 ng/mL range, and some men with PSA levels below 2.5 ng/mL will harbor prostate cancer but these are less likely to be high-grade and are likely to be detected on serial PSA. The PCPT risk calculator has been updated to include PCA3, a urinary biomarker associated with prostate cancer risk, and the online calculator allows entry of this value. In summary, for men with PSA 2.5–4.0 ng/mL, the ACS recommends that health care providers consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors for prostate cancer, particularly for high-grade cancer, which may be used for a biopsy or referral recommendation.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

Given this relative safety, the Panel believes the benefits of aggressive treatment do not outweigh treatment-related harms for most low-risk patients, although select patients may elect definitive local therapy after informed discussion; clinicians may offer immediate treatment to fully informed patients with low probability of risk reclassification on active surveillance (e.g., high-volume cancer, higher PSA density) or with other risk factors (e.g., family history of lethal prostate cancer, germline mutation associated with adverse pathology). Patients choosing active surveillance should be informed of the importance of regular cancer surveillance to avoid missing the window of curability.

### National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of prostate cancer [^f19dcf1e]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of prostate cancer issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network provide a basis for rational treatment decisions. These guidelines represent consensus recommendations by a panel of experts that are evidence based and are designated according to the degree of consensus within the expert panel. The initial stratification point is the patient's life expectancy (> 5 or < 5 years). If life expectancy is > 5 years, the recommended intervention is based on clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score, as well as the presence of symptoms. These assessments establish the patient's risk of recurrence after therapy. Specific initial therapies are then recommended according to whether the risk category is low, intermediate, high, or very high. The guidelines also describe the appropriate use of observation ("watchful waiting") versus active intervention in certain patients. After definitive therapy, patients should be monitored with PSA determinations, digital rectal examination, and bone scans, as outlined in the guidelines. Patients who exhibit increasing PSA levels after prostatectomy are candidates for salvage therapy with androgen ablation, radiotherapy, or observation. If PSA levels begin to increase after radiotherapy, surgery may then be an additional option. Systemic salvage therapy generally consists of androgen ablation; the benefit of total androgen blockade versus initial monotherapy remains controversial. Relapse after initial androgen ablation is treated with an antiandrogen, if none had been administered previously. Patients refractory to further hormonal manipulations are observed or receive palliative therapy, including chemotherapy. The treatment of prostate cancer is complex. Optimal treatment is risk-adapted to the specific characteristics of the cancer and the expected longevity and personal preferences of the patient.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^3e259c0f]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The guideline purpose is to provide the urologist with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average risk men.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies that addressed the predefined outcomes of interest (prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy and harms of testing). In addition to the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) rather than having a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age group in years (age < 40; 40 to 54; 55 to 69; ≥ 70).

Results

Except prostate specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening, there was minimal evidence to assess the outcomes of interest for other tests. The quality of evidence for the benefits of screening was moderate, and evidence for harm was high for men age 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefit, but the harms of screening, including over diagnosis and overtreatment, remained. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more may be preferred to reduce the harms of screening.

Conclusions

The Panel recommended shared decision-making for men age 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a routine could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

In 2009, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee began the process of a complete update of recommendations for early prostate cancer detection. A series of systematic evidence reviews was conducted focusing on evidence related to the early detection of prostate cancer, test performance, harms of therapy for localized prostate cancer, and shared and informed decision making in prostate cancer screening. The results of the systematic reviews were evaluated by the ACS Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee, and deliberations about the evidence occurred at committee meetings and during conference calls. On the basis of the evidence and a consensus process, the Prostate Cancer Advisory Committee developed the guideline, and a writing committee drafted a guideline document that was circulated to the entire committee for review and revision. The document was then circulated to peer reviewers for feedback, and finally to the ACS Mission Outcomes Committee and the ACS Board of Directors for approval. The ACS recommends that asymptomatic men who have at least a 10-year life expectancy have an opportunity to make an informed decision with their health care provider about screening for prostate cancer after they receive information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits associated with prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer screening should not occur without an informed decision-making process. Men at average risk should receive this information beginning at age 50 years. Men in higher risk groups should receive this information before age 50 years. Men should either receive this information directly from their health care providers or be referred to reliable and culturally appropriate sources. Patient decision aids are helpful in preparing men to make a decision whether to be tested.

### Overdetection in screening for prostate cancer [^c2895fcc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe mechanisms behind and extent of overdetection in prostate cancer screening as well as possible ways to avoid unnecessary overdiagnosis.

Recent Findings

Overdetection and overtreatment is common in many areas of modern medicine. Current prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has resulted in a marked stage shift to early stages, which, together with improvements in treatment, has resulted in a substantial decrease in prostate cancer mortality. However, nonselective, widespread PSA-testing followed by liberal biopsy criteria has resulted in a high rate of overdiagnosis, which constitutes one major obstacle to introducing population-based screening.

Summary

Several steps are needed to decrease overdetection: do not screen elderly men unlikely to benefit, do not biopsy without a compelling reason, differentiate screening interval according to risk, work-up benign prostate disease by using reflex tests and/or complementary biomarkers, and focus on screening men at high risk for a life-threatening disease, for example evaluate men with above-median PSA levels in midlife. Recent results indicate that use of MRI to select men for biopsy and using only lesion-directed biopsies may be one way forward. However, more studies are needed before firm recommendations can be made. When the diagnosis is made, treat only those who need treatment. Tailor treatment to tumor biology and patient characteristics, and offer active surveillance to eligible men with low-risk tumors, especially small-volume disease, as the first management.

Conclusions

In HICs, relying on opportunistic informed choice-based testing of PSA and symptomatic presentation of disease for diagnosis results in over-testing in older men and under-testing in younger men at high risk. However, too many men still present with advanced disease, especially if from socioeconomically deprived backgrounds. Targeted PSA testing focused on younger men (ie, aged 45–69 years in Black populations and 50–69 years in other populations) linked to education and outreach programmes could reduce overdiagnosis in older men and increase diagnosis in high-risk subgroups of younger men. MRI-based assessment before biopsy referral reduces over-diagnosis and overtreatment while detecting potentially lethal disease.

In LMICs, too many men present with advanced disease — a major societal problem causing suffering, early death, and financial hardship for families. Additionally, prostate cancer is just one of a range of diseases, including other cancers, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, that are set to become substantially more prevalent in LMICs in the near future. Holistic solutions enabling early detection of all these conditions should be prioritised.

Raising awareness of prostate cancer plays a central role in effective early detection. To improve diagnosis and management of prostate cancer globally (especially in LMICs) and reduce morbidity and mortality, education is crucial and needs to adapt to novel digital approaches. We summarise our key recommendations related to prostate cancer diagnosis in panel 3.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^b914aef3]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of PSA-based screening from randomized trials — Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened and may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population, and there is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years. Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^52002c39]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Prostate cancer — initial risk stratification and staging workup notes that tumor-based molecular assays and germline genetic testing are other tools that can assist with risk stratification. In asymptomatic patients in low- and intermediate-risk groups with life expectancy ≤ 5 years, no imaging or treatment is indicated until the patient becomes symptomatic, after which imaging can be performed and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) should be given. For intermediate-risk categorization, the percentage of positive cores is based on biopsies that include systematic biopsies with or without targeted MRI-guided biopsies, and the Panel considers biopsies from a single region of interest (ROI) to count as a single sample. Additionally, bone imaging should be performed for any patient with symptoms consistent with bone metastases. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Newly diagnosed or previously untreated prostate cancer — risk stratification and when to use focal/ablative therapy: Pathologic confirmation of prostate cancer and risk stratification is required prior to consideration of ablative or FT. Active surveillance is the preferred treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, and ablative and focal therapies are discouraged in this population. The Panel also believes that ablative FT should be discouraged in patients with high- or very-high-risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer outside of a clinical trial. For intermediate-risk disease, there is currently insufficient comparative effectiveness evidence for FT to be recommended, and therefore ablative and focal therapies in this population should be utilized only in the context of a clinical trial.

### Advances in prostate cancer research-NCI… [^eb0f0ca5]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Studying Early Detection for Men at High Risk Men with certain inherited genetic traits are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer. Examples of such traits include inherited BRCA gene mutations and Lynch syndrome. No clear guidelines exist for when or how — or if — to screen men at high genetic risk for prostate cancer. NCI researchers are using magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in men at high risk of developing prostate cancer to learn more about how often and how early these cancers occur. They're also testing whether regular scans in such men can detect cancers early, before they spread elsewhere in the body. Using MRI and ultrasound. Scientists at NCI have developed a procedure that combines magnetic resonance imaging with TRUS for more accurate prostate biopsies. MRI can locate potential areas of cancer within the gland but is not practical for real-time imaging to guide a prostate biopsy.

The procedure, known as MRI-targeted biopsy, uses computers to fuse an MRI image with an ultrasound image. This lets doctors use ultrasound guidance to take biopsy samples of areas of possible cancer seen on MRI. NCI researchers have found that combining MRI-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy can increase the detection of high-grade prostate cancers while decreasing detection of low-grade cancers that are unlikely to progress. Testing machine learning. Researchers are testing the use of machine learning, also called artificial intelligence, to better recognize suspicious areas in a prostate MRI that should be biopsied. AI is also being developed to help pathologists who aren't prostate cancer experts accurately assess prostate cancer grade. Cancer grade is the most important factor in determining the need for treatment versus active surveillance. NCI researchers are testing whether PSMA-PET imaging can also identify men who are at high risk of their cancer recurring.

Such imaging may eventually be able to help predict who needs more aggressive treatment — such as radiation therapy in addition to surgery — after diagnosis. Research teams are also looking at:

- whether certain patterns seen on PSMA-PET tests taken over time may indicate an increased risk of recurrence after initial treatment
- how small metastases discovered with PSMA change over time, with or without treatment. These changes may make men with metastatic prostate cancers candidates for what are called "basket" clinical trials of new drugs. Such trials enroll participants based on the changes found in their cancer, not where in the body the cancer arose. In the NCI-MATCH trial, a high percentage of enrolled men with advanced prostate cancer had genetic changes that could potentially be targeted with investigational drugs.
