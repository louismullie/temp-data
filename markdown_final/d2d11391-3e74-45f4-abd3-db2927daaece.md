## Question

prevention of in-stent thrombosis on ibuprofen alone as anti-platelet therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ibuprofen alone can prevent in‑stent thrombosis after coronary stent implantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the established post‑PCI antithrombotic standard of care and guideline recommendations. Then, I should verify ibuprofen's pharmacology and whether it provides clinically meaningful antiplatelet activity. Next, I will check for pharmacodynamic interactions between ibuprofen and aspirin. After that, I need to assess the cardiovascular risk profile of NSAIDs. I will then consider the platelet‑driven pathophysiology of stent thrombosis and the role of dual pathway inhibition. Finally, I should review clinical evidence for or against NSAID strategies in stented patients, reconcile nuances about DAPT versus monotherapy sequencing, and synthesize a risk‑benefit conclusion with a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care after coronary stent placement. Current European Society of Cardiology 2024 chronic coronary syndromes guidance recommends dual antiplatelet therapy as default after PCI with aspirin 75–100 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily, generally for up to 6 months when there is no competing indication for oral anticoagulation, with shorter courses considered in lower‑risk patients based on bleeding and ischemic risk trade‑offs, including selective early aspirin discontinuation strategies in specific contexts [^116h995y] [^1119qHzu].

> Now, I need to check what ibuprofen actually does at the platelet level. Ibuprofen is a nonselective NSAID that reversibly inhibits COX‑1 and COX‑2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and producing analgesic and anti‑inflammatory effects, but it does not provide sustained, irreversible platelet inhibition like aspirin and it is not indicated for prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events or stent thrombosis, which already raises a red flag for adequacy as antithrombotic monotherapy in a stented patient [^114yK5Kz].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacodynamic interaction with aspirin because this is often overlooked but clinically pivotal. Controlled studies in healthy volunteers show that ibuprofen 400 mg given 2 hours before immediate‑release aspirin 81 mg blunts aspirin's antiplatelet effect substantially, with only about 53% inhibition of serum thromboxane B2 at 24 hours, whereas administering ibuprofen 2 hours after aspirin preserves aspirin's effect, highlighting a timing‑sensitive antagonism that can leave patients under‑protected if not meticulously managed, which is impractical and risky in real‑world post‑PCI care; case reports further describe thrombotic events plausibly related to this interaction in settings where aspirin's platelet effect is needed for coronary protection [^114yK5Kz] [^113Xv3k5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I review the cardiovascular safety profile of NSAIDs themselves. Multiple FDA‑vetted labels consistently warn that nonselective NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and related agents, increase the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, with risk emerging as early as the first weeks of therapy and most consistently at higher doses, and importantly there is no consistent evidence that concomitant aspirin mitigates this risk, which is particularly concerning in patients with established coronary disease and recent stenting [^111trqds] [^113cBALG] [^113QRnNm].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis to ensure the mechanistic rationale is sound. Stent thrombosis is predominantly platelet driven, with thrombin and ADP‑mediated activation pathways central to thrombus formation on the stent scaffold, which is precisely why dual pathway inhibition with aspirin for COX‑1–thromboxane A2 and a P2Y12 inhibitor for ADP signaling is the cornerstone to reduce risk; aspirin or a reversible, weak COX inhibitor alone does not address P2Y12‑mediated platelet activation, and inadequate platelet inhibition is a recognized substrate for stent thrombosis with high morbidity and mortality [^114XhivE] [^116FKiyD] [^115MRqP3].

> I will now examine whether any clinical evidence supports ibuprofen monotherapy to prevent stent thrombosis. Let me think about this carefully: there are no guideline endorsements or randomized data supporting NSAID monotherapy for prevention of in‑stent thrombosis, and available regulatory and clinical documents instead emphasize increased bleeding when NSAIDs are combined with antiplatelet drugs and increased cardiovascular thrombotic risk with NSAIDs overall, with a published pediatric cardiology case illustrating a plausible ibuprofen‑aspirin antagonism culminating in thrombotic occlusion, all of which argue against any protective role of ibuprofen in this setting [^115QQySf] [^111trqds] [^113Xv3k5].

> But wait, what if someone argues that monotherapy can sometimes be acceptable after an initial DAPT period and therefore ibuprofen could be considered as a "single antiplatelet" substitute. I should double‑check the actual monotherapy evidence because earlier I almost implied that monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel is uniformly inferior to DAPT in high‑risk patients, which is too broad; in fact, HOST‑EXAM compared clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy after event‑free DAPT and showed differences between the two monotherapies, not monotherapy versus continued DAPT, and per‑protocol and randomized data like ARCTIC‑Interruption and other analyses suggest DAPT duration and sequence should be individualized, often with P2Y12‑focused strategies, but none of this substitutes an NSAID for an antiplatelet agent or supports ibuprofen for stent protection [^112wW2ed] [^114pmkh7] [^115yzqcT].

> Let me synthesize and ensure the logic is internally consistent. Ibuprofen alone cannot prevent in‑stent thrombosis because it provides only weak, reversible COX‑1 inhibition without P2Y12 blockade, can attenuate aspirin's irreversible antiplatelet effect if timing is suboptimal, and carries an inherent increase in cardiovascular thrombotic risk per boxed warnings; using ibuprofen in place of guideline‑directed DAPT deviates from evidence‑based care and may be harmful in a recently stented coronary patient [^116h995y] [^114yK5Kz] [^111trqds].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical clinical recommendation and any caveats. Patients with coronary stents should receive guideline‑directed DAPT for the indicated duration, after which antiplatelet strategy may be de‑escalated based on ischemic and bleeding risk, while ibuprofen should be avoided for antithrombotic purposes and, if absolutely necessary for analgesia, used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration with attention to dosing separation from aspirin to minimize pharmacodynamic interference, ideally administering ibuprofen at least 2 hours after aspirin and only with cardiology oversight given the NSAID‑associated cardiovascular risk profile [^116h995y] [^114yK5Kz] [^111trqds].

---

Ibuprofen alone is not effective for preventing in-stent thrombosis because it provides only **reversible, incomplete platelet inhibition** and does not block ADP-mediated aggregation [^114yK5Kz]. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) [^116h995y] after stenting is **standard care** [^1119qHzu]. Ibuprofen is **not recommended** as sole antiplatelet therapy and may increase cardiovascular risk [^113cBALG]. If DAPT is contraindicated, consider anticoagulation or alternative antiplatelet strategies, but not ibuprofen alone [^111trqds].

---

## Pharmacological limitations of ibuprofen as an antiplatelet agent

Ibuprofen inhibits COX-1/COX-2, reducing thromboxane A2 and platelet aggregation; however, the effect is **reversible and short-lived** (4–6 hours), unlike aspirin's irreversible COX-1 blockade [^111KRNQD] [^114yK5Kz]. It does not inhibit ADP-mediated aggregation — a key pathway in stent thrombosis — making it **inadequate for stent protection** [^116vvggv].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of ibuprofen monotherapy to prevent in-stent thrombosis. Current guidelines recommend **DAPT** [^116h995y] (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) after PCI to reduce stent thrombosis [^111tvh5p] and ischemic events [^1119qHzu]. Ibuprofen is not included in any guideline as a sole antiplatelet therapy.

---

## Risks associated with ibuprofen use in cardiovascular patients

Ibuprofen carries an **increased cardiovascular risk**, including myocardial infarction and stroke, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors [^113cBALG] [^113vHG3Z]. It can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, and hypertension, further limiting its use in this population.

---

## Alternative antiplatelet strategies

When **DAPT** is contraindicated, consider **alternative strategies**:

- **Anticoagulation**: Warfarin or DOACs may be used when antiplatelet therapy is contraindicated.
- **Alternative antiplatelet agents**: Cilostazol [^112Bumdn] or dipyridamole [^1141Qzpv] may be considered in specific cases, though evidence is limited.
- **Short-term bridging therapy**: Short-acting agents (e.g. eptifibatide) [^115QQySf] may be used perioperatively when antiplatelet therapy must be temporarily discontinued [^115dBTdK].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Using ibuprofen alone after stenting would likely increase **stent thrombosis risk**, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. It also raises bleeding risk — particularly gastrointestinal bleeding — and may interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet effect, further increasing thrombotic risk [^113cBALG] [^114yK5Kz].

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Current recommendations are **clear**:

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is standard after PCI [^116h995y].
- **Ibuprofen not recommended**: Ibuprofen alone is not recommended for preventing in-stent thrombosis.
- **Alternative strategies**: Use anticoagulation or alternative antiplatelet agents when DAPT is contraindicated [^11567pdj].

---

Ibuprofen alone is **not effective** for preventing in-stent thrombosis due to reversible, incomplete platelet inhibition [^114yK5Kz] and lack of ADP pathway blockade [^116vvggv]. Use standard DAPT or appropriate alternatives when indicated [^116h995y].

### Licart [^115Nip2J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, conducted over durations of up to three years, have demonstrated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. It remains unclear whether the risk for CV thrombotic events is consistent across all NSAIDs based on available data. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline, conferred by NSAID use, appears similar in both individuals with and without known CV disease or risk factors. However, those with known CV disease or risk factors exhibited a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to an increased baseline rate. Some observational studies have observed that the elevated risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. This increase in CV thrombotic risk has been most consistently observed at higher doses.

To minimize the potential adverse CV event risk in patients treated with NSAIDs, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should stay vigilant for any adverse events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Additionally, patients should be informed about serious CV event symptoms and the appropriate steps to take should they occur.

There is no consistent evidence suggesting that the concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, does not reliably diminish this risk.

### Caldolor [^114yK5Kz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ibuprofen possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Caldolor, similar to other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Ibuprofen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. During therapy, the concentrations of ibuprofen reached have shown effects in vivo. Prostaglandins play a role in sensitizing afferent nerves and enhancing the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models, and they are mediators of inflammation. Therefore, ibuprofen's mode of action may be attributed to the reduction of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In a study involving healthy volunteers, ibuprofen 400 mg administered once daily, 2 hours prior to immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) for 6 days, showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin, as measured by the percentage of serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2) inhibition 24 hours after the day-6 aspirin dose, resulting in 53% inhibition. An interaction, still observed but minimized, occurred when ibuprofen 400 mg was given once daily, 8 hours prior to the immediate-release aspirin dose, with an inhibition of 90.7%. However, no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin was observed when ibuprofen 400 mg, administered once daily, was given 2 hours after (but not concomitantly, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes after) the immediate-release aspirin dose, resulting in 99.2% inhibition.

In another study, immediate-release aspirin 81 mg was administered once daily with ibuprofen 400 mg given three times daily.

### Zorvolex [^113dXN2n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, over durations of up to three years, have demonstrated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. It is unclear, based on available data, if the risk for CV thrombotic events is consistent across all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline caused by NSAID use appears similar in individuals with and without known CV disease or risk factors. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors have a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their elevated baseline rate. Some observational studies suggest that the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events may begin as early as the first weeks of treatment. This risk increase is most consistently observed at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk of adverse CV events in NSAID-treated patients, it is recommended to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Both physicians and patients should be vigilant for the emergence of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even if previous CV symptoms are absent. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the actions to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that the concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and another NSAID, such as diclofenac, does not consistently alter this risk.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy following dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving a drug-eluting stent: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^114pmkh7]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Relevant data from the publications were extracted independently by two reviewers. If discrepancies in interpretation could not be resolved, a third reviewer was consulted to reach a consensus. Data extraction included study characteristics, interventions, patient characteristics, and the safety and effectiveness outcomes of interest. Baseline patient characteristics included age, sex, comorbidities, and type of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). When outcome data were not available in the publication, study investigators were contacted for additional information. Specifically, information on the number and proportion of ACS patients who experienced Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3/5 bleeding in the HOST-EXAM trial at 24 months was kindly provided by the clinical trial investigators.

Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2) for randomized trials and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for non-randomized studies. Following reconciliation between the decisions of the two reviewers, a third reviewer intervened to reach consensus if there were any unresolved conflicts.

Before the meta-analysis, a full feasibility assessment was completed to determine whether a quantitative analysis could be conducted. Following this assessment, two analyses were conducted to study the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy. The effectiveness analysis was a pairwise meta-analysis on the data collected.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy following dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving a drug-eluting stent: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^1146sXfL]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Both observational studies reported a treatment duration of 12 months for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation before switching to monotherapy. In the HOST-EXAM, the duration of DAPT was between 6 to 18 months (i.e. 12 ± 6 months). The median time from randomization to monotherapy in HOST-EXAM was 382 days. In all three studies, included patients were event-free throughout DAPT, and those who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE), repeat revascularization, or major bleeding were excluded from the subsequent monotherapy comparison.

- **Duration of DAPT and subsequent monotherapy**: The included studies were more heterogeneous in terms of treatment duration and follow-up for monotherapy following DAPT. The duration of clopidogrel or aspirin as monotherapy ranged from 12 to 36 months. It is noteworthy that the HOST-EXAM extension trial reported a treatment duration of a median of 5.8 years for monotherapy.

- **Loading dose and maintenance therapy**: Clopidogrel loading dose was only reported in the HOST-EXAM trial. In patients who previously received DAPT with ticagrelor, the subsequent clopidogrel monotherapy loading dose was 600 mg. Previous prasugrel DAPT users randomized to subsequent clopidogrel monotherapy switched to clopidogrel maintenance therapy without a loading dose. Following DAPT, the maintenance dose of clopidogrel was administered as 75 mg once daily.

### Brilinta [^1175aaL1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes and secondary prevention after myocardial infarction

- **PLATO study**: PLATO (NCT00391872) was a randomized double-blind study comparing BRILINTA (N = 9333) to clopidogrel (N = 9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapies, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who presented within 24 hours of the onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The study's primary endpoint was the composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI, excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke.

- **Patient criteria and exclusions**: Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. However, patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past six months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Additionally, patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from the study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent.

- **Dosage and treatment regimens**: All patients randomized to BRILINTA received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at the investigator's discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75–100 mg was recommended.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy following dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving a drug-eluting stent: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112wW2ed]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Study eligibility criteria for the systematic review were defined using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies evaluating the effectiveness or safety of clopidogrel versus aspirin as monotherapy following any duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in adults with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non‐STEMI (NSTEMI), or unstable angina, post‐drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation.

- **Effectiveness outcomes of interest**: MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events) and its components such as myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, or mortality; stent thrombosis; coronary revascularization; and hospitalization due to unstable angina.

- **Safety outcomes of interest**: Bleeding events (total, major, minor, or fatal); adverse events (AEs); treatment‐related AEs; serious AEs; study withdrawal; and drug discontinuation or treatment switching after 1 year of DAPT.

Studies on children, adolescents, or those involving ACS patients who received non-urgent DES implantation (received 1+ years after the ACS event) or other P2Y12 inhibitors such as ticagrelor or prasugrel were excluded. Non‐English publications were also excluded.

Two independent reviewers were responsible for evaluating all abstracts according to the PICO criteria. Abstracts deemed eligible for inclusion advanced to a full‐text screening phase, where they were screened in duplicate by the same reviewers. All records deemed eligible after full‐text screening were included in the review. Any discrepancies between reviewers at each stage were resolved through discussion.

### The hypercoagulable profile of patients with stent thrombosis [^114XhivE]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary stent thrombosis is a rare but severe complication after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. This complication manifests as myocardial infarction (80%) and cardiac death (12%–40%). Furthermore, stent thrombosis is associated with a high recurrence rate of around 15%. The incidence of stent thrombosis is approximately 0.5%–4%, despite optimal dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an ADP-receptor antagonist.

Multiple factors underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of stent thrombosis. Platelets play a major role in thrombus formation in the coronary stent. This is highlighted by the fact that the most important risk factor is the early discontinuation of clopidogrel. It is unclear whether the coagulation system, which is closely related to the haemostatic effects of platelets, is also involved in the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis. In the coagulation process, thrombin is the key enzyme regulating a diversity of procoagulant and anticoagulant responses. Moreover, thrombin is involved in atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis through the activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs).

By activating PAR-1 and PAR-4 on human platelets, thrombin serves as a platelet agonist, stimulating platelet secretion and aggregation. Given the central position of thrombin in haemostasis, useful information about the prothrombotic tendency of a patient can be provided by the potential of the patient's plasma to generate thrombin. In this study, we hypothesized that plasma thrombin generation is enhanced in patients with stent thrombosis.

### Brilinta [^114Q1dez]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, and use of drug-eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to determine if they could account for regional differences. However, with one exception — aspirin maintenance dose — these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome.

- **Aspirin dose**: The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator. Use patterns were different in U.S. sites compared to sites outside the U.S. Approximately 8% of non-U.S. investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg. In contrast, 57% of patients in the U.S. received doses above 100 mg, and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall, results favored Brilinta when used with low maintenance doses (≤ 100 mg) of aspirin. Results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the U.S. and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose, and Figure 12 shows results by region and dose.

Figure 12 – CV death, MI, stroke by maintenance aspirin dose in the U.S. and outside the U.S. (PLATO)

Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern. The pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint: CV death and non-fatal MI.

### Acute multi-vessel coronary stent thrombosis [^113gaTUc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coronary artery stent thrombosis is a rare but often fatal complication associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using both bare-metal stents and drug-eluting stents. Although strict adherence to dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) minimizes this risk, stent thrombosis will still occur in rare patients, leading to acute, subacute, or late life-threatening acute coronary syndromes.

- **Objectives**: To present a rare case of acute stent thrombosis involving multiple vessels to increase awareness of this life-threatening condition among emergency physicians, and to review the guidelines for anti-platelet therapy in this patient population.

- **Case report**: A 52-year-old man who underwent PCI using drug-eluting stents in two separate coronary vessels presented to the Emergency Department within 2 hours of discharge from the hospital with chest pain, dynamic electrocardiogram changes, and elevated cardiac markers. Despite compliance with the recommendations for post-PCI anti-platelet therapy, urgent repeat catheterization revealed total thrombotic occlusion of both stents, requiring urgent repeat intervention.

- **Conclusion**: Despite patient compliance with the currently recommended anti-platelet regimen after stent therapy for coronary artery disease, acute stent thrombosis remains a rare but life-threatening risk in both the immediate and delayed post-intervention period. In addition, premature cessation of this anti-platelet therapy stands as the greatest risk factor for such thrombotic events. This case is presented to inform emergency physicians of this critical risk.

### Stent thrombosis is associated with an impaired response to antiplatelet therapy [^116FKiyD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to evaluate the response to antiplatelet therapy in patients with stent thrombosis (ST). Stent thrombosis is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. An impaired response to antiplatelet therapy might be related to an increased risk for ST.

Eighty-two patients were included in the present study: 23 patients with previous ST, 50 matched controls (coronary stenting without ST), and 9 healthy volunteers. Platelet aggregation (PA) was studied using optical aggregometry under monotherapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg daily for one month, followed by dual therapy with ASA 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily (loading dose 300 mg) for another month.

Maximal (5 and 20 micromol) adenosine diphosphate-induced PA was significantly higher in patients with ST compared with controls (5 micromol, p < 0.01; 20 micromol, p < 0.01). Aspirin resistance (> 20% aggregation with 0.5 mg/ml arachidonic acid) was more prevalent in patients with ST (48%) compared with control patients (32%, p = NS) and volunteers (0%, p = 0.01). Clopidogrel significantly reduced PA in all three groups, but intergroup differences persisted. Clopidogrel resistance (< 10% relative change) was similar in patients with ST, control patients, and volunteers (4%, 6%, and 11%, respectively, all p = NS). However, combined ASA and clopidogrel resistance was more prevalent in patients with ST (52%) compared with controls (38%, p = NS) and volunteers (11%, p < 0.05).

### Accelerated thrombotic occlusion of a medium-sized coronary aneurysm in Kawasaki disease by the inhibitory effect of ibuprofen on aspirin [^113Xv3k5]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The fate of coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) caused by Kawasaki disease depends mainly on their initial size and shape. Small to medium-sized CAAs are known to regress to normal size or decrease in size, with a good outcome. A patient with Kawasaki disease is reported who had a medium-sized CAA prematurely occluded with thrombi during regression, resulting in myocardial ischemia. This event was probably due to the simultaneous use of aspirin and ibuprofen. Thus, the concomitant use of ibuprofen should be avoided when aspirin is given as an antiplatelet agent because ibuprofen blocks the platelet inhibition induced by aspirin.

### Late thrombosis following treatment of in-stent restenosis with drug-eluting stents after discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy [^116eP9zN]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2005). Low credibility.

Drug-eluting stent usage has become commonplace for the percutaneous treatment of de novo coronary lesions, but the safety and efficacy profile for their evolving usage in restenotic lesions is largely unknown. We report three cases of angiographically confirmed drug-eluting stent thrombosis following treatment of restenotic lesions that occurred late (193, 237, and 535 days) and shortly after interruption of antiplatelet therapy. All three patients suffered ST elevation myocardial infarction, and there was one death. Further studies are necessary to better define the associated risk and ideal duration of antiplatelet therapy necessary in this cohort of patients with restenotic lesions.

### Ticagrelor with or without aspirin after PCI: The TWILIGHT platelet substudy [^112mkwuK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

An evolving strategy in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involves the withdrawal of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), or aspirin, while maintaining P2Y 12 inhibition. However, the pharmacodynamic effects of this approach on blood thrombogenicity and platelet reactivity remain unknown.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to compare the antithrombotic potency of ticagrelor alone versus ticagrelor plus ASA among high-risk patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents.

- **Methods**: This was a mechanistic substudy within the TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) trial, which randomized patients undergoing PCI to ticagrelor plus placebo versus ticagrelor plus ASA following 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy. Substudy participants were enrolled after randomization, at which time ex vivo assays to quantify thrombus size under dynamic flow conditions and platelet reactivity were performed. Pharmacodynamic assessments were repeated 1 to 6 months thereafter. The primary endpoint was thrombus size at the post-randomization visit, with platelet reactivity following stimuli to arachidonic acid, collagen, adenosine diphosphate, and thrombin as secondary endpoints. Results were analyzed using analysis of covariance.

- **Results**: A total of 51 patients were enrolled, among whom 42 underwent perfusion assays at baseline and follow-up with a median time between studies of 1.5 months. The adjusted mean difference in post-randomization thrombus area was similar between groups.

### Late in-stent thrombosis following carotid angioplasty and stenting [^114E94AB]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute in-stent thrombosis is a well-known complication of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) and is often due to resistance to or inadequate treatment with platelet-inhibiting agents. The authors report three cases of delayed in-stent thrombosis occurring more than a week but less than three months after CAS. In all cases, the postprocedural antiplatelet regimen was discontinued to enable the treatment of a relevant comorbidity.

### New anti-platelet agents: The end of resistance [^112aeKus]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Despite improved clinical outcomes from dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin plus the CYP12 ADP receptor antagonist clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary revascularization, ex vivo platelet function testing consistently reveals a proportion of patients with apparent resistance or non-response to clopidogrel loading and maintenance therapy who are at increased risk of coronary thrombosis. Treatment regimens using the newer CYP12 antagonists prasugrel and ticagrelor demonstrate improved ex vivo platelet inhibition and superior clinical efficacy in large-scale clinical trials — even in patients demonstrating clopidogrel resistance. However, improved efficacy comes at the cost of an increased overall risk of bleeding for both drugs.

Further analysis of the outcomes from large-scale clinical studies suggests that individual patient sub-groups differ both in their likelihood of bleeding with newer anti-platelet agents and with regard to efficacy outcomes. Therefore, when deciding anti-platelet regimens in suspected acute coronary syndrome, particular consideration must be given to the patient's risk of thrombosis (STEMI, previous stent thrombosis), the procedure (complex PCI, thrombus in situ, strategy of pre-treatment), and factors affecting safety (patient age, patient weight, previous stroke, likelihood of surgical revascularization).

Focusing on individualized patient risk-benefit assessment with appropriate use of platelet function testing when indicated, in combination with the ongoing assessment of prasugrel and ticagrelor in larger numbers of patients, should be prioritized.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events [^117JHWpt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may provide additional benefits for people at high risk and those with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a review previously published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To review the benefits and harms of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or who are at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but do not have a coronary stent.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches in CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017), and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal and hand-searched reference lists. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies that included only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, and major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the p.

### Effects of cilostazol for in-stent restenosis after carotid artery stenting: a meta-analysis [^112Bumdn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is the primary treatment for stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery. Intima-media thickness (IMT) events mainly occur within one year after CAS and are primarily due to arterial elastic retraction, thrombosis, intimal hyperplasia, and arterial wall remodeling. Cilostazol has been shown to be an effective preventative measure against the occurrence of ISR. Among the nine studies included in this meta-analysis, six studies supported this conclusion. Two studies did not report in-stent restenosis (ISR) as an outcome, while another study indicated that, although no significant difference was observed between the cilostazol group and the control group, a downward trend in ISR risk was evident.

The protective effect of cilostazol can be achieved mainly through the following mechanisms:

- **Inhibition of intimal proliferation**: Intimal hyperplasia is one of the core mechanisms of ISR. Stent implantation has been demonstrated to cause damage to the vascular endothelium, with platelets adhering to the injured site and releasing the related components of platelet α particles, such as the chemotactic and mitotic factors of vascular smooth muscle cells, like PDGF. These factors have been shown to promote intimal hyperplasia and vascular lumen stenosis, which in turn, increase the risk of ISR.

In addition, cilostazol has been shown to upregulate tumor suppressor genes P53, P21, and hepatocyte growth factor by affecting cAMP levels. The increase in p53 protein can block the cell cycle and induce smooth muscle cell apoptosis, thereby contributing to the prevention of ISR.

The management of patients with recent coronary artery stents presenting for noncardiac surgery has become a major topic of interest and concern for all perioperative caregivers. This review updates recent reports, new guidelines, and recommendations. Based on the available literature, experts recommend avoiding premature discontinuation of antiplatelet drug therapy, if possible, except for a few surgical procedures. Drug-eluting stents obviously carry more risks than bare-metal stents.

### Risk factors and outcomes of recurrent drug-eluting stent thrombosis: Insights from the REAL-ST registry [^112CscAq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

- **Study design**: This study is a post hoc analysis of REAL-ST, a retrospective multicenter registry (unique identifier, UMIN000025181) of patients with definite stent thrombosis (ST) after first- and second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation at 46 Japanese percutaneous coronary intervention institutions. The study design and main results have been reported elsewhere. In brief, we retrospectively attempted to enroll patients who fulfilled the following criteria: (1) those who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with first-generation DES from April 2004 to December 2013 or second-generation DES from May 2009 to December 2016; or (2) those who had definite ST of first- or second-generation DES from April 2004 to March 2017. A total of 655 patients with ST (first-generation DES thrombosis [G1-ST], n = 342; second-generation DES thrombosis [G2-ST], n = 313) were enrolled in the registry.

For this study, we evaluated recurrent ST (RST) events after the index ST occurrence. Patients with cardiac arrest and final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 0 at the time of ST were excluded from this study. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees at all participating centers and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent has been waived due to the retrospective study design.

- **Definitions and study end points**: Definite ST was defined according to the Academic Research Consortium criteria, and ST was categorized accordingly.

### Triple oral antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery stenting [^116Gy85J]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation who experience an acute coronary syndrome are indicated for oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy, which includes aspirin and a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor, following coronary artery stenting. The use of all three agents, known as triple oral antithrombotic therapy, significantly increases the risk of bleeding. At the time of writing, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal combination and duration of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents for patients who require both therapies. Consequently, clinical practice has primarily been guided by expert opinion, resulting in significant variation among clinicians.

In this review, the latest evidence concerning the risks and benefits of triple oral antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation after coronary artery stenting is summarized. We discuss the clinical risk scores that are useful in guiding predictions of stroke, bleeding, and stent thrombosis. Additionally, the review highlights the areas where further evidence is needed to determine the appropriate balance of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in this patient population.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People taking antiplatelet agents are at an increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery due to these indications. However, antiplatelet therapy introduces additional risk for surgery patients, as it increases the likelihood of bleeding. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this bleeding risk, but it could increase the likelihood of thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anaesthesia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of adults taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy for at least two weeks and scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthesia.

### Ticagrelor monotherapy or dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation: Per-protocol analysis of the GLOBAL LEADERS trial [^116BonJ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The methods and intention-to-treat results of the trial have been reported previously. This per-protocol analysis was designed to quantify the treatment effect of the randomly allocated antiplatelet strategies among patients who fulfilled all enrollment criteria and did not deviate from medication decisions as planned in the study protocol — the per-protocol treatment effect. To determine patients' eligibility, study inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed, and patients were excluded if any violation had occurred. As we anticipated the potential of an unblinded study in terms of drug adherence, medications were dispensed at 3-month intervals during direct patient contact. Adherence was assessed by direct pill counts and self-reporting at discharge, 30 days, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Adherence counseling by the study team was the default strategy to improve adherence.

The investigators systematically collected reasons for nonadherence at 30 days and at months 12 and 24. Two trained clinicians blinded to assignment group and outcomes independently reviewed adherence data, classified reasons for nonadherence following a hierarchical approach, and categorized the time to protocol deviation on a monthly basis according to the clinical information available in the electronic case report forms. In the case of controversy, senior investigators were invited to arrive at a consensus. Certain changes in medications for medical reasons were anticipated in the study protocol and were not classified as protocol deviations.

### More, more, more: Reducing thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes beyond dual antiplatelet therapy-current data and future directions [^115fqxFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying the right patient involved reviewing trials that assessed triple therapy (TT) in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and at least one additional risk factor. Several risk stratification scores, such as GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), PURSUIT (Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy), and TIMI scores, exist to assess the risk of ischemic events in ACS patients. However, none of these scores were used specifically to identify and target those ACS patients who are truly at high risk. Platelet function tests can identify patients on clopidogrel at increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stent thrombosis, and cardiovascular death. However, altering pharmacotherapy based on the results of platelet-function testing did not reduce ischemic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), including for ACS. Guidelines do not support platelet-function testing.

Patients undergoing complex PCI, defined as the composite of at least three stents implanted, at least three lesions treated, bifurcation with two stents implanted, total stent length greater than 60 mm, and chronic total occlusion as the target lesion, or those with prior stent thrombosis are clearly at increased risk of thrombosis. Although consideration may be given to a longer total duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) treatment in these patients, the option of TT has not been specifically evaluated. The increased risk of bleeding is a significant concern with more effective antithrombotic agent combinations. Some of this excess bleeding could potentially be mitigated, at least in part, by careful patient selection and management.

### Bioresorbable stents: Is this where we are headed [^117BUPPF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Drug-eluting stents (DES) have shown excellent safety and efficacy in various clinical settings. However, the presence of a permanent metallic scaffold remains an Achilles' heel, with concerns for late stent thrombosis and the need for prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy. The bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BRS) has been termed the fourth revolution in interventional cardiology, with the ability to not only treat the coronary lesion but also restore endothelial function after complete absorption. The absence of a permanent scaffold months after implantation has the potential to overcome the shortcomings of metallic DES and markedly impact interventional cardiology practice around the world. This review article focuses on the history, development, and clinical studies on various BRS and attempts to predict how this technology could impact future cardiology practice.

### Caldolor [^111trqds]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, lasting up to three years, have demonstrated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear whether the risk for CV thrombotic events is the same for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline due to NSAID use appears similar in individuals with or without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors experience a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies indicate that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events may begin as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk is most consistently observed at higher doses.

	- To minimize the potential risk of adverse CV events in NSAID-treated patients, it is recommended to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain vigilant for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the actions to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.

### Dual-antiplatelet treatment beyond 1 year after drug-eluting stent implantation (ARCTIC-Interruption): a randomised trial [^115yzqcT]. Lancet (2014). High credibility.

The optimum duration of dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) after coronary stenting remains uncertain, due to the unknown efficacy-to-safety ratio of extended treatment leading to discrepancies between international guidelines and clinical practice. This study assessed whether DAPT continuation beyond 1 year after coronary stenting is beneficial.

- **Methods**: This analysis was a planned extension of the previously published ARCTIC-Monitoring trial. In this trial, 2440 patients were randomly allocated to a strategy of platelet function testing with antiplatelet treatment adjustment or a conventional strategy after coronary stenting with drug-eluting stents (DES). Patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled for planned DES implantation, were recruited at 38 centers in France. After 1 year of follow-up, patients without contraindications to the interruption of DAPT were eligible for a second randomization in this phase of the study (ARCTIC-Interruption). Using a computer-generated randomization sequence (1:1; stratified by center), patients were allocated to a strategy of DAPT interruption (thienopyridine was interrupted, and single aspirin antiplatelet treatment was maintained) or DAPT continuation for 6–18 months. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization, analyzed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00827411.

### Prolonged high-dose bivalirudin infusion reduces major bleeding without increasing stent thrombosis in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention: Novel insights from an updated meta-analysis [^111tvh5p]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

This increase in early stent thrombosis may be caused by residual thrombin activity after the discontinuation of the short-acting bivalirudin at the end of the procedure and by having low platelet inhibition with oral agents at this time of transition.

- **Early stent thrombosis**: Whether the rate of acute stent thrombosis could be diminished by prehospital initiation of novel P2Y12 blockers and prolonged infusion of bivalirudin at the end of the procedure was assessed in the EUROMAX trial. However, there remained an increased rate of acute stent thrombosis in patients receiving bivalirudin compared with heparin (1.1% versus 0.2%, P = 0.007).

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy**: Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of stent thrombosis, and the potent third-generation P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor have been shown to reduce stent thrombosis in comparison with clopidogrel in STEMI patients even more. However, recent data highlighted that even for novel P2Y12 inhibitors, the time interval to achieve maximal platelet inhibition is significantly delayed in STEMI patients, not reaching peak pharmacodynamic efficacy for 4 to 6 hours, and nor do prasugrel and ticagrelor reduce stent thrombosis in comparison to clopidogrel within the first 24 hours. Therefore, unsurprisingly, given that oral antiplatelets in EUROMAX were administered 50 minutes (interquartile range 37–66) before the procedure, the patients did not have P2Y12 blockade to prevent acute stent thrombosis, which occurred on average 2.3 hours (interquartile range 1.8–2.8) after stent placement.

### The pCONUS HPC: 30-day and 180-day in vivo biocompatibility results [^114DiBqn]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

One problem of both the aneurysm remodeling techniques, such as T-stenting, and specifically designed stent-like devices is the requirement for adequate anti-platelet medication to prevent thrombosis of the stent, which can cause problems particularly in the acute scenario.

Use of stents or stent-like structures such as the pCONUS in the acute situation is thought to increase the risk of bleeding-related complications if interventions such as the insertion of an EVD (extra-ventricular drain) are required. This increased risk is believed to be principally due to the requirement for concomitant anti-platelet medication.

- **Systematic review**: Bodily et al. performed a systematic review of the literature to analyze the risks associated with the use of stents with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms. They identified 17 articles and 339 patients and a total hemorrhagic complication rate of 8% (27/339); however, 1/3 (n = 9) of these patients were hemorrhage related to the EVD and nearly half (n = 12) were intra-procedural rupture of the aneurysm. Similarly, they reported clinically significant thromboembolic events in 6% of cases with available data.

- **Publication findings**: In the publication of Kung et al, symptomatic and radiographic hemorrhage was seen in 32% of cases for patients on DAPT compared to 14.7% for those not on anti-platelet medications.

Although the pCONUS device has been used in the acute setting, it is not without risk, and there is a need to develop strategies to allow the use of adjunctive devices while minimizing the risk of both hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. One avenue is the development of improved medical protocols and device designs.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, conducted over durations of up to three years, have indicated an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on the available data, it is unclear if the risk for CV thrombotic events is consistent across all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline, conferred by NSAID use, appears similar in individuals with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with pre-existing CV disease or risk factors experienced a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their elevated baseline rate. Some observational studies suggest this increased risk begins as early as the first weeks of treatment. The rise in CV thrombotic risk is observed most consistently at higher doses.

	- To minimize the potential risk for adverse CV events in NSAID-treated patients, it is recommended to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Both physicians and patients should remain vigilant for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even if there are no prior CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the appropriate steps to take if they occur.

	- There is no consistent evidence that the use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The combined use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, does not demonstrate a reduction in this risk.

### Antiplatelet therapy after implantation of drug-eluting stents: duration, resistance, alternatives, and management of surgical patients [^117A8zxJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

The routine off-label use of drug-eluting stents (DESs) has been associated with a higher prevalence of stent thrombosis in clinical practice than was suggested in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) preapproval studies. Consequently, the early identification of patients at risk for stent thrombosis has become a major goal in cardiology. Although a number of factors may be involved in DES thrombosis, the biologic cascade begins with local platelet activation and culminates in platelet aggregation, the generation of coagulation factors, the formation of a fibrin network, and the creation of a stable occlusive thrombus. Data show that the premature discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy is an important risk factor for DES thrombosis, but the occurrence of stent thrombosis in patients adhering to this drug regimen suggests that some patients are nonresponsive to clopidogrel therapy, primarily because of functional and genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Patients with high platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) during dual-antiplatelet therapy may be at increased risk for adverse ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Using a point-of-service assay, Price et al. measured platelet function in patients treated with DESs and demonstrated that 75% of patients who developed stent thrombosis were in the lowest quartile of platelet inhibition and the highest quartile of platelet reactivity. Data from the authors' center suggest that there may be a threshold of platelet reactivity, as measured by light-transmittance aggregometry after ADP.

### Effects of clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor on prevention of stent thrombosis in patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention: A network meta-analysis [^1131ioT3]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Our literature search returned 1730 studies. After elimination of duplicate results, 910 studies were reviewed. After exclusion of 874 studies by title and/or abstract, 36 articles were reviewed in full-text. Finally, 14 studies that met all criteria were included in our meta-analysis, with 46,983 participants. The duration of follow-up was 11.1 ± 2.9 months, ranging from 6 to 15 months. As shown in Table 1, the majority of included studies were based in Asia, and the minority was from America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. Most studies included more males than females. Eight of 14 studies were multicenter studies. Six studies compared the incidence of stent thrombosis (ST) between clopidogrel and ticagrelor, while four studies compared clopidogrel and prasugrel, and three studies compared ticagrelor with prasugrel. Only one study compared all three agents.

- **Study quality**: The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used for assessing the methodological quality. Of the 14 studies included in this meta-analysis, only four studies applied the blinding method, while six studies had potential risk of bias due to lack of blinding for participants. In addition, nine studies lacked a clear statement of allocation concealment.

### Principles of optimal antithrombotic therapy for iliac venous stenting (POATIVES): A national expert-based Delphi consensus study [^114pQZ92]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

In the present study, a two-round modified Delphi survey was conducted with Chinese experts specializing in venous disease. Statements related to antithrombotic therapy following venous stenting for non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL), acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) were gathered. Consequently, a consensus was reached on all 17 statements regarding antithrombotic drug selection, dosage, and course. The majority of the statements about antithrombotic agent selection received a high consensus strength.

The majority of the experts on the panel agreed that anticoagulation should be the primary treatment for patients undergoing venous stenting, which was consistent with the previous international consensus that anticoagulation was preferable to antiplatelets for the first 6 to 12 months following stenting for NIVL. Practices for the management following venous stenting are mainly drawn from experiences in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) without endovascular interventional therapy. Venous thrombosis occurs during low shear flow and predominantly around intact endothelial walls, leading to the belief that anticoagulants should be used to treat venous disease. Based on the experience with antithrombotic therapy after arterial stenting, some of the experts believed that concomitant anticoagulation or subsequent use of antiplatelet agents were reasonable regimens. Following a systematic review of 56 studies, it was observed that treatment in 77% of the studies involved warfarin as a base anticoagulant, with or without antiplatelet agents. Meissner et al. argued that antip

### Drug-eluting stent thrombosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: Is it always a problem [^112knUpi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Recent publications have reported a high incidence of perioperative complications in patients with drug-eluting stents (DES). The recommendations for bare-metal stents (BMS) are not applicable to DES. In fact, large evidence-based studies are lacking on which to base a consensus for the perioperative management of patients with DES. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the postoperative cardiac risk associated with DES.

- **Methods**: Prospectively collected data were examined for the rate of postoperative cardiac complications in 96 consecutive patients with DES who underwent digestive, urologic, orthopaedic, or vascular surgery. The average delay between revascularization and non-cardiac surgery was 14 (11) months (extremes 1 week and 36 months). The occurrence of postoperative troponin release (troponin I ≥ 0.15 ng/ml) and the rate of in-stent thrombosis were analyzed.

- **Results**: Twelve patients (12%) presented a postoperative troponin release, without EKG abnormalities in 10 cases (83%). Two patients (2%) developed an in-stent thrombosis. None of the patients had excessive postoperative blood loss.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with DES are at higher risk of postoperative cardiac complications. Nevertheless, the specific thrombotic complications of the DES were uncommon in this series, which contrasts with previous alarming reports. A balanced perioperative management of anti-platelet agents, considering both the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombotic complications in patients with DES, is associated with a low risk of thrombosis postoperatively.

### Questions and answers on proper peri-operative management of antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation to prevent stent thrombosis [^116dUSLq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Stent thrombosis (ST) is a rare but life-threatening complication of coronary artery stenting. Although dual-antiplatelet therapy is an effective management strategy for reducing the risk of ST, some patients may need to interrupt their regimens due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the requirement for surgery. This case presentation highlights pertinent issues related to ST, including its risk factors, the perioperative management of antiplatelet agents, and treatment for ST.

### Coronary stent thrombosis and mortality: Does the relationship stand the test of time [^115MRqP3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The advances in coronary stent technology have been tremendous in the past decade, and practicing interventional cardiologists now enjoy the benefits of the generation devices. These include excellent deliverability across tortuous vessels, ease of deployment, and significantly reduced rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Combined with perfected interventional techniques for lesion preparation and a background of excellent medical therapy, consisting of antiplatelet agents and statins, we have been able to provide many patients with a durable therapeutic option that is well tolerated. In particular, the incidence of stent thrombosis has been low (≈0.5%) in recent years. In fact, the guidelines for coronary revascularization allow for a shorter duration of postintervention dual-antiplatelet therapy in patients with increased bleeding risk.

Stent thrombosis, however, still carries a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. No one can argue against this, and the data are clear. Clinical trials have reported mortality rates as high as 50% in patients with early (within 1 month of the procedure) stent thrombosis. The sudden development of thrombosis, vastly without clear warning signs, is one of the main drivers of poor outcomes. This is typically associated with an acute coronary syndrome event that portends a poor prognosis, even when promptly treated.

### Clopidogrel-induced qualitative changes in thrombus formation correlate with stent patency in injured pig cervical arteries [^112ERAco]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Thienopyridines, such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel, alone or combined with aspirin, are the reference antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation. To better understand the high efficacy and low risk of bleeding with these agents, we tested clopidogrel alone or with aspirin in an acute ex vivo flow chamber model and in a subacute in vivo arterial thrombosis model. Clopidogrel induced a dose-dependent increase in bleeding time (BT), inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, and in the flow chamber reduced thrombus size. It changed thrombus structure to a broad-based structure composed of nondegranulated, loosely attached platelets, contrasting with the tight clumps of degranulated platelets seen without clopidogrel.

The in vivo model involved angioplasty and stenting at the site of a preinduced arterial lesion and thrombosis in pig carotid arteries. Clopidogrel alone or with aspirin (but not aspirin alone) decreased the number of stented vessels occluded for more than 24 hours and conversely reduced the number of occluding thrombi. At 96 hours after stenting, 100% and 90% of the arteries were patent with clopidogrel/aspirin and clopidogrel alone, respectively, compared to 67% and 44% with aspirin and saline, respectively. Clopidogrel destabilizes thrombus without completely abolishing platelet reactivity.

### Profenal [^112uBcMQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2006). Low credibility.

Warnings about the use of Profenal indicate a potential for cross sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Therefore, caution should be taken when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs.

Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs carries the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. Reports indicate that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause an increased bleeding tendency of ocular tissues, particularly in conjunction with ocular surgery.

### Endovascular treatment of visceral artery and renal aneurysms (VRAA) using a constant mesh density flow diverting stent [^113rCdUB]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

We advocate for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent in-stent thrombosis when using flow diverting stents for peripheral aneurysms. Both patients were administered dual antiplatelet therapy for one week prior to the procedure (100 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel) and planned to continue this for six months post-procedure, at which point clopidogrel is ceased. Most studies evaluating flow diverting stents have used similar regimens, and premature cessation of clopidogrel has been linked with a higher risk of stent thrombosis, even at three months [De Vries et al.]. An alternative regimen is to load the patients with higher doses of aspirin and clopidogrel in the hours prior to the procedure [Lv et al.].

We encountered no complications in the treatment of our patients. Foreseeable complications include rapid in-stent thrombosis, which can be attenuated with the use of systemic heparin and administration of intra-arterial antiplatelet agents (e.g. tirofiban) immediately following stent deployment. Importantly, the Surpass flow diverter is limited to use in smaller vessels with a maximum vessel diameter of 5.3 mm with the 5 mm device. Consideration should also be given to material costs compared to conventional endovascular methods.

### Zontivity [^113i7w1c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Take one tablet of Zontivity 2.08 mg orally once daily, with or without food. Use Zontivity with aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to their indications or standard of care. There is limited clinical experience with other antiplatelet drugs and none with Zontivity as the only antiplatelet agent.

- **Coadministration with other antiplatelet drugs**: There is no experience with the use of Zontivity alone as the only administered antiplatelet agent. Zontivity has been studied only as an addition to aspirin and/or clopidogrel. Use Zontivity with aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to their indications or standard of care [see Clinical Studies (14)]. There is limited clinical experience with other antiplatelet drugs.

- **Increased bleeding risk with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents**: Some published studies with omega-3 fatty acids have demonstrated a prolongation of bleeding time. Monitor patients receiving Vascepa and concomitant anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents for bleeding.

The prolongation of bleeding time reported in those studies has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes. Therefore, it is important to monitor patients receiving Vascepa along with anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet agents for any signs of bleeding.

### Efficacy and safety of high potent P2Y inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor in patients with coronary heart disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy: A sex-specific systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113LRgn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Our protocol is published on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018082179). The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its online supplementary files.

- **Literature search**: We developed a search strategy to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy and safety of aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors compared with aspirin, aspirin plus placebo, or clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with the latest search performed in June 2018. For full search strategies, see Table S1. Additionally, reference lists from eligible trials were reviewed to identify potentially relevant studies.

- **Population**: We considered studies of participants assigned to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for cardiovascular prevention following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without coronary stent placement, or after admission for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Studies focusing on the use of DAPT in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were excluded, as the efficacy and safety of DAPT in these patients are complex and dependent on pretreatment with PCI.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Studies were eligible if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) original full‐text article; (2) RCT or double‐blind, single‐blind, or open‐label design; (3) DAPT treatment as secondary prevention after either PCI following documented CAD or a diagnosis of CAD with a high risk of events, such as a previous myocardial infarction (MI); (4) DAPT treatment longer than one month; and (5) analysis on both cardiovascular outcomes.

### Drug-eluting stent-induced left anterior descending coronary artery aneurysm: Repair by pericardial patch — where are we headed [^116BXPgW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The deployment of drug-eluting stents has been associated with late thrombosis and restenosis upon withdrawal of antiplatelet agents. We report a complication involving inflammation and localized coronary artery aneurysms immediately adjacent to the stent, occurring four years post-implantation. Late chronic inflammatory responses may evolve for up to four years after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation and can lead to weakening, erosion, and aneurysm formation in the coronary arteries.

### Hydrophilic stent coating inhibits platelet adhesion on stent surfaces: Initial results in vitro [^114AFpvb]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The development of clots on the surface of stents implanted in arterial structures could have significant clinical consequences, such as acute thromboembolic stroke. To prevent this, the standard approach has been to use anti-platelet agents that inhibit the formation of organized clots on the stent surfaces. The necessity for a stringent dual anti-platelet treatment (DAPT), typically involving aspirin and clopidogrel prior to stent implantation, has been advocated to reduce thromboembolic complications. It is generally accepted that effective inhibition of platelet function can be achieved through DAPT. However, even with optimized dosage of anti-aggregant medication, the risk of thrombosis remains between 0.5% and 15% after stenting of the supra-aortic branches or vessels of the cerebrovascular circulation, being about seven times higher in intracranial vessels than in the coronary circulation.

Despite numerous scientific efforts, especially in cardiology, it has not yet been possible to develop optimized anti-thrombogenic vascular implants. Regardless of several promising results in vitro, these coatings have not yet been successfully transferred to endovascular devices. Although the coating materials used at the time for stents and flow diverters have bio-compatible and hemo-compatible properties, DAPT is still necessary. Approaches from other medical fields, such as the ProBIO ® coating of cardiovascular stents from Biotronik or coatings used on catheters, contact lenses, or in the field of molecular diagnostics, continue to be explored.

### Flurbiprofen [^112N3dnX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular thrombotic events**: Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs, conducted over durations of up to three years, have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear whether the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline, conferred by NSAID use, appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that the concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as flurbiprofen, is not consistently shown to reduce this risk.

### Anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic approaches in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^116vvggv]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Low credibility.

Over the past three decades, there has been a significant increase in the use of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for treating patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. However, PCI disrupts atherosclerotic plaque and denudes the endothelium, leading to stimulation of platelet aggregation and activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore, anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic agents play a crucial role as adjuncts before, during, and after PCI to minimize the risk of procedural ischemic complications such as myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and various degrees of myonecrosis.

The article presents a comprehensive review of the evolution of anti-platelet and anticoagulation regimens used in PCI. It begins with a summary of the coagulation process, along with platelet activation and aggregation. The review then focuses specifically on individual anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic drugs, including their mechanism of action and the scientific evidence leading to their use in PCI. Finally, we present summary recommendations from the AHA/ACC guidelines for individual anticoagulant and anti-platelet regimens administered peri-PCI.

### Safety of dental extractions in coronary drug-eluting stenting patients without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents [^111FG9vf]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The risk of excessive bleeding often prompts physicians to stop multiple antiplatelet agents before minor surgery, which can put coronary stenting patients at risk for adverse thrombotic events.

We hypothesized that most dental extractions can be carried out safely without stopping multiple antiplatelet agents. All dental extraction patients who had undergone coronary stenting and who were on oral multiple antiplatelet agents therapy were enrolled. One hundred patients underwent dental procedures without stopping antiplatelet agents. All wounds were sutured and followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after the procedure. There were 2,233 patients who had not taken oral antiplatelet agents from a health promotion center and had teeth extracted by the same method. After performing propensity-score matching for the entire population, a total of 100 matched pairs of patients were created.

- **Primary outcome**: A composite of excessive intraextraction blood loss, transfusion, and rehospitalization for bleeding.

- **Secondary outcome**: A composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and stent thrombosis within 1 month after the procedure.

Results showed there were two excessive intraextraction bleeding cases that continued at the extraction site for 4 and 5 hours, respectively, in the coronary stenting patients, and one excessive intraextraction bleeding case that continued for 3 hours in the control patients. There were no cases of transfusion, rehospitalization for bleeding, or major cardiovascular events.

### Aspirin in children; are there not two sides of the same coin [^1143LRbD]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

This study clearly indicates that irreversible and complete platelet inhibition in vitro is dose-dependent and may also be age-dependent. However, what implications do higher doses have, particularly concerning the lower baseline ADP/TRAP percent PA in neonates and infants, as well as the dose-dependent pharmacological effects of aspirin on vascular PGI2 production, including its role as a dose-dependent arterial duct constrictor?

The implication that all neonates/infants should receive aspirin for thrombosis prophylaxis at a potentially anti-inflammatory (COX1 + COX2-inhibiting) dosage of 5 mg/kg/day raises several questions regarding differential therapy: Should the "empirical" neonatal aspirin treatment of 1–2 mg/kg daily, based on holistic medical considerations, be entirely replaced by aspirin monotherapy of 5 mg/kg/day, even in specific clinical constellations? In these constellations, will we combine clopidogrel in a daily dosage of 0.2 mg/kg with aspirin (1–2 mg/kg/day) to achieve high anti-thrombotic effectiveness while minimizing vascular side effects? Should aspirin (5 mg/kg/day) be administered regardless of whether a non-endothelialized surgical (PTFE) shunt requires protection from thrombus formation or if a viable arterial duct is to be stented for pulmonary/systemic blood flow supply? Did the authors consider or exclude the vasoconstrictive effects of aspirin, particularly its ductal constricting effects, at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day?

In answering these specific questions, it is crucial to clarify the basis with additional information supporting the.

### Coronary stent thrombosis and mortality: Does the relationship stand the test of time [^115Z6PiJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Kaplan‐Meier estimates indicate a significant risk of death associated with angiographically confirmed stent thrombosis (ST) compared to matched controls. These findings have direct implications for clinical practice. Stent thrombosis is a major event with a high immediate mortality rate. This increased risk persists during the early period for survivors undergoing coronary angiography and intervention. However, beyond the first few months, there appears to be no increased risk of mortality over up to 10 years of follow-up.

Survivors of stent thrombosis should be closely monitored in the initial months after the event and treated aggressively with medical therapy, including continued dual-antiplatelet therapy. It is crucial to balance thrombosis and bleeding risks. Beyond the early phase, therapy might be scaled down to a single antiplatelet agent, following a shared decision-making process that includes a thorough discussion of risks and benefits. Patients should be followed up according to the prevailing standard of care, including holding antiplatelet therapy when necessary before noncardiac procedures.

As more data becomes available regarding stent thrombosis events with the Generation devices, more concrete recommendations can be developed for managing these patients.

### Perioperative management of a patient with recently placed drug-eluting stents requiring urgent spinal surgery [^115dBTdK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Patients receiving drug-eluting coronary stents (DES) require antiplatelet therapy for at least 12 months to prevent stent thrombosis (ST), a potentially calamitous event. Since the interruption of antiplatelet therapy is the greatest risk factor for ST, it is imperative that the decision to discontinue these agents be based on an accurate assessment of the patient's risk for bleeding complications. Individuals who are regarded as being at high risk are those undergoing intracranial, spinal, or intraocular surgeries. These patients require alternative agents during the perioperative period to minimize both their risk of perioperative thrombosis and intraoperative hemorrhage.

We report the case of a woman who required spinal surgery three months after she underwent the placement of two drug-eluting stents. The patient's clopidogrel was stopped five days prior to surgery, and an infusion of eptifibatide was used to "bridge" antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period. Postoperatively, anticoagulation therapy was reinstituted using aspirin with clopidogrel. This case serves as a successful example of bridging therapy using a short-acting glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor as a means of maintaining antiplatelet therapy during the perioperative period to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis and the risk of intraoperative bleeding.
