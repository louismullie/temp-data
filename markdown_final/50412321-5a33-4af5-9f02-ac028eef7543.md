## Question

May clonazepam and methadone be prescribed together

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clonazepam and methadone can be prescribed together, and if so, under what conditions and with what safeguards. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic interaction and the magnitude of risk. Then, I should verify what regulatory authorities and major guidelines say about withholding versus cautious co-prescribing. Next, I will examine the evidence on outcomes, including overdose risk and treatment retention. After that, I need to outline a risk–benefit framework and concrete mitigation strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable recommendation with monitoring and documentation requirements.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and risk profile. Methadone is a long-acting opioid with pronounced respiratory depressant effects, and clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that depresses respiration via GABAergic mechanisms. Together they produce synergistic CNS and respiratory depression, with risks including profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death, which is why the FDA carries boxed warnings for both classes when combined [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F] [^113dfoG3].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic signal to calibrate risk. Observational data show that concurrent benzodiazepine–opioid exposure increases overdose risk substantially; for example, a large case-cohort study found a near-quadrupling of overdose death risk with concurrent prescriptions, and other analyses show 2–10 fold increases in overdose risk depending on dose and context, which underscores the clinical gravity of this combination [^117Jx6bS] [^111Dk73k] [^113iw4LZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about withholding treatment. I need to check what regulators and guidelines actually recommend. The FDA explicitly advises that methadone or buprenorphine should not be withheld solely because a patient is taking benzodiazepines, because the harms of untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh the risks of concomitant use; instead, clinicians should mitigate risk through careful management, education, and monitoring [^115LGNhc] [^1116iGKZ] [^1158e4Nc].

> Next, I should review professional society guidance. ASAM's national practice guideline states that benzodiazepine use should not be a reason to suspend methadone treatment, and that a risk–benefit analysis with enhanced support and monitoring is appropriate. The CDC's 2022 opioid guideline similarly emphasizes caution and individualized decisions rather than categorical avoidance, especially when benzodiazepine exposure is stable and low-dose [^1156iydH] [^116S7vKf] [^111Dk73k].

> I will now examine outcome data to balance risks and benefits. Let me consider treatment retention and illicit use patterns: a population-based cohort found that prescribed benzodiazepine use during methadone maintenance was not associated with worse retention, whereas nonprescribed benzodiazepine use predicted a twofold higher odds of treatment discontinuation, suggesting that prescribed, monitored co-use may be safer than unsanctioned use. However, I should double-check that this is observational and not a license for routine co-prescribing [^11696T1w].

> Now, I need to ensure the risk–benefit framework is explicit. Co-prescribing is generally not recommended and should be reserved for scenarios where alternatives are inadequate, such as refractory anxiety or seizure disorders, and only after confirming the diagnosis, attempting non-benzodiazepine options, and documenting that benefits outweigh risks; if co-prescribed, use the lowest effective doses, minimize duration, and reassess frequently, ideally every 3 months or at each prescription renewal [^116i2r8F] [^111VNcNe] [^112sTsvK].

> Let me think about concrete mitigation steps. I should confirm that all patients co-prescribed methadone and clonazepam receive naloxone with education, that prescribers coordinate care and check the PDMP to avoid duplicative sedatives, and that urine drug testing includes benzodiazepine metabolites to detect illicit use. If a patient is sedated at dosing, I need to check the cause and consider delaying or omitting methadone that day, and I should avoid arbitrary methadone dose caps, which are not evidence-based [^114qbesg] [^113q6TCo] [^1123yNmc].

> But wait, what if the patient is using nonprescribed benzodiazepines or designer benzos. I should double-check that standard immunoassays can miss clonazepam and novel benzodiazepines, so definitive testing and harm-reduction counseling are important. If tapering is indicated, I need to ensure a gradual, individualized plan because abrupt cessation can precipitate seizures or destabilize mental health, and I should integrate SUD treatment throughout the taper [^113S2bvy] [^112axjPD] [^112CfVqG].

> Let me reconsider the practical prescribing approach. If, after shared decision-making and risk mitigation, co-prescription proceeds, I should start low and go slow for both agents, document the rationale, counsel on overdose signs and when to seek emergency care, and arrange close follow-up. I should also plan for non-benzodiazepine alternatives for anxiety or insomnia and consider referral to addiction psychiatry or pain specialists for complex cases [^116i2r8F] [^111VNcNe] [^114bTsdh].

> In summary, I should confirm that clonazepam and methadone can be prescribed together only when there is a compelling, indication-specific rationale and when robust risk mitigation is in place. Otherwise, the combination should be avoided given the well-documented increases in overdose risk, and treatment for opioid use disorder must never be withheld solely due to benzodiazepine exposure [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F] [^1156iydH].

Clonazepam and methadone can be co-prescribed only when **absolutely necessary** and with **strict monitoring**, as the combination significantly increases the risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and overdose [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F]. Co-prescribing should be reserved for cases where alternatives are inadequate, using the **lowest effective doses**, minimal duration, and close monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F]. Naloxone should be prescribed, PDMP checks and urine drug testing are essential, and patients must be educated on the risks of mixing these medications with other CNS depressants [^113fVDfe] [^113S2bvy] [^111uGba9]. If sedation occurs at dosing, evaluate and consider delaying or omitting methadone [^1123yNmc]. Avoid abrupt benzodiazepine withdrawal to prevent seizures; taper gradually if discontinuation is needed [^112axjPD].

---

## Pharmacological interactions and risks

- **Respiratory depression**: Both clonazepam and methadone depress the CNS, and their combined use can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F].

- **Overdose risk**: Concurrent use markedly increases overdose risk, including fatal overdose, due to synergistic CNS depression [^111Dk73k] [^115w5gvn].

- **Sedation and cognitive impairment**: The combination can cause significant sedation, cognitive impairment, and motor impairment, increasing accident risk [^112Jkbhm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Reserve for necessity**: Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatments are inadequate [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F].

- **Lowest effective doses**: Use the lowest effective doses and shortest duration, with close monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F].

- **Naloxone provision**: Clinicians should prescribe naloxone for overdose reversal and educate patients and caregivers on its use [^113fVDfe] [^114qbesg].

- **Avoid abrupt withdrawal**: Benzodiazepines should not be abruptly discontinued due to seizure risk; taper gradually if discontinuation is needed [^112axjPD].

---

## Monitoring and safety measures

- **Regular assessment**: Conduct frequent risk–benefit assessments at every clinical encounter or prescription renewal, at least every 3 months [^111z8wZY] [^112sTsvK].

- **Urine drug testing**: Implement regular urine drug testing to monitor adherence and detect non-prescribed benzodiazepine use [^116hnAYG] [^1123yNmc].

- **PDMP checks**: Regularly check prescription drug monitoring programs to identify concurrent CNS depressant prescriptions [^111Dk73k] [^113fVDfe].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on overdose risk, signs of respiratory depression, and the dangers of mixing medications with alcohol or other CNS depressants [^111uGba9] [^113inZfZ].

---

## Clinical scenarios and considerations

Clonazepam may be considered for patients with co-occurring anxiety or seizure disorders when alternatives are ineffective, but **careful monitoring is essential** [^116i2r8F]. For patients with substance use disorders, use extreme caution, coordinate care, and consider tapering benzodiazepines when feasible [^112CfVqG] [^117F7RW2]. In pain management, avoid or minimize benzodiazepine co-prescribing with methadone; if necessary, use the lowest effective doses and monitor closely [^111VNcNe] [^116i2r8F].

---

## Alternative medications and strategies

- **Non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics**: Consider buspirone, SSRIs, or SNRIs for anxiety management [^notfound].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Use cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and other behavioral therapies for anxiety and insomnia [^114bTsdh].

- **Gabapentin or pregabalin**: Consider for anxiety or insomnia, but monitor for sedation and respiratory depression [^111Dk73k].

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with substance use disorders — clinicians "should consider more frequent assessments of the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing for patients with co-occurring SUDs and/or other co-occurring addictions", "should manage the underlying SUD concurrently with the BZD taper", and after the taper "should continue to monitor and treat any underlying SUDs or refer patients to an appropriate level of care for continuing care"; clinicians also "should offer patients harm reduction services or provide them with referrals to access these services", including to "offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) and provide or refer patients for related education", and they "can consider providing or referring patients to community services for drug checking or other safe use supplies (e.g., fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, sterile syringes) and related education" (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation for the "should" statements; Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation for the "can consider" statement).

Integrating SUD treatment with BZD tapering — if tapering is indicated, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD in parallel, should refer to an appropriate level of care, and some SUD programs may take over BZD tapering; patients with OUD should typically be initiated and stabilized on medications for OUD (MOUD) prior to a BZD taper and the MOUD dose should be kept stable; clinicians should provide psychosocial interventions alongside pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines and other sedative–hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend methadone or buprenorphine; and monitoring during and after tapering is a key aspect of successful discontinuation with strategies that include ongoing treatment of underlying SUDs and co‑occurring conditions.

### Association between preoperative benzodiazepine use and postoperative opioid use and health care costs [^115e7DY8]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was whether patients continued to use opioids during postoperative days 91 to 365 and, if so, the mean daily dose prescribed. Secondary outcomes included the average daily dose of opioid prescribed during postoperative days 0 to 90 and total health care costs during the first 30 days after surgery. The time windows for postoperative opioid use were chosen to differentiate between treatment of acute postoperative pain and pain that persists beyond the expected recovery period. Health care costs were calculated as the sum of the amount billed to the patient's insurer.

For our opioid analyses, we included prescriptions for codeine, dihydrocodeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Each prescription was converted to an average daily dose in oral morphine equivalents (MMEs) using the prescription date, generic name, strength, number of units dispensed, and number of days supplied provided in the database.

Exposure

The independent variable of interest was whether the patient used benzodiazepines in the year before surgery. Patients using benzodiazepines were classified as either long-term users (defined as having ≥ 10 prescriptions filled or ≥ 120 days prescribed in the year before surgery) or intermittent users (defined as > 0 and < 10 prescriptions filled or > 0 and < 120 days prescribed). These patients were compared with patients who had no benzodiazepines prescribed in the year before surgery.

For our benzodiazepine analyses, we included prescriptions for alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, quazepam, temazepam, and triazolam. While oral MMEs are a well-studied and commonly used tool for clinical practice and research use, evidence describing benzodiazepine equivalence has been limited, with some inconsistencies between studies. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services Center for Substance Abuse Treatment has published a protocol that aggregates these data and provides conversions for the major oral benzodiazepines prescribed in the US. Using these data, we developed a tool — oral diazepam milligram equivalents (DMEs) — to approximately quantify benzodiazepine use and converted each prescription in the data to an average daily dose of benzodiazepine in DMEs (eTable 2 in the Supplement).

### FDA drug safety podcast: FDA urges caution about withholding… [^113TeGBX]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Welcome to the FDA Drug Safety Podcast for health care professionals from the Division of Drug Information. On September 20, 2017, based on additional review, the FDA advised that the opioid addiction medications buprenorphine and methadone should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other drugs that depress the central nervous system. The combined use of these drugs increases the risk of serious side effects; however, the harm caused by untreated opioid addiction can outweigh these risks. Careful medication management by health care professionals can reduce these risks. We are requiring this information to be added to the buprenorphine and methadone drug labels along with detailed recommendations for minimizing the use of medication-assisted treatment drugs and benzodiazepines together. Many patients with opioid dependence may also use benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, either under a health care professional's direction or illicitly.

Although there are serious risks with combining these medicines, excluding patients from MAT or discharging patients from treatment because of use of benzodiazepines or CNS depressants is unlikely to stop them from using these drugs together. Buprenorphine and methadone help people reduce or stop their abuse of opioids, including prescription pain medicines and heroin. Methadone and buprenorphine have been shown to be effective in reducing the negative health effects and deaths associated with opioid addiction and dependency. These medications are often used in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, and patients can be treated with them indefinitely. Buprenorphine and methadone work by acting on the same parts of the brain as the opioid that the patient is addicted to. The patient taking the medication as directed generally does not feel high, and withdrawal does not occur. Buprenorphine and methadone also help reduce cravings.

Health care professionals should take several actions and precautions and develop a treatment plan when a MAT drug, such as buprenorphine or methadone, is used in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. In August 2016, we issued a Drug Safety Communication warning about the combined use of opioid-containing medicines with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. Review of a published study and other drug use data showed that buprenorphine and benzodiazepines have frequently been prescribed for the same patient, by the same prescriber dispensed by the same pharmacy.

Regarding specific circumstances for benzodiazepine use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with concomitant substance use disorder, AAFP/AAN/AANP/AAPA/AAPP/ACMT/ACOG/AGS/APA/ASAM 2025 guidelines recommend to offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication, such as naloxone, for all patients co-prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids.

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^111VNcNe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of methadone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids).

For Patients Being Treated for Pain

Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).

### Rates of physician coprescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines after the release of the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines in 2016 [^113rf3dv]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Rates of opioid prescribing and deaths attributed to prescription opioid overdose have quadrupled in the United States over the past 20 years. One-quarterto one-halfof opioid-related deaths also involve a benzodiazepine, which is consistent with the known risks of adverse events when these 2 drug classes are used concomitantly. In particular, the risk of overdose increases when people take opioids and benzodiazepines at the same time. Coprescribing of opioids and benzodiazepines in the United States has previously been shown to be common. One studyfound that, in 2013, 17% of prescription opioid users also used a benzodiazepine. Recognizing the risk of coprescribing, in 2016 the US Food and Drug Administrationissued a warning to patients and clinicians about the potential risks of combined opioid and benzodiazepine use.

In March 2016, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released guidelinesintended to help primary care clinicians treat patients with chronic non–cancer-related pain. These guidelines specifically included a category A recommendation to avoid coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines "whenever possible". The panel writing the guidelines noted that there may be clinically appropriate situations where the drugs may be used together, giving the example of a person taking a stable low dose of a benzodiazepine who experiences acute pain. However, the overall recommendation in the context of long-term opioid use was to avoid benzodiazepines if possible, given patient needs.

To better understand the association of the CDC opioid guidelines with coprescribing, changes in extent of coprescribing of benzodiazepines among patients newly initiating long-term opioid therapy were compared before and after release of the guidelines in a large population of commercially insured patients and Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries. The primary outcomes were the extent and intensity of coprescription of opioids and benzodiazepines. Because of the well-recognized racial differences in opioid prescribing practices, changes in coprescribing by race and ethnicity were also analyzed.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^1136Dxdr]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Sedative withdrawal recommendations — treatment should not be delayed based on the potential timeline for release, and patients who have been taking sedatives should be converted to an equivalent dose of long-acting benzodiazepine, with clonazepam described as having a long half-life, being well-tolerated and easy to administer, and as the preferred medication for treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal for most patients. Dose equivalencies for clonazepam will not hold for all patients and must be individualized according to the patient's response, and adequate dosing of clonazepam will control sedative withdrawal symptoms including increased heart rate, sweating, and hand tremor. Benzodiazepines should be tapered over a period of weeks or months with taper duration based on agent of choice, dose, frequency and duration of use, comorbid physical or mental health conditions, and treatment setting; in patients who are not hospitalized, the medication should not be tapered any more rapidly than 25 percent per week, and as the taper nears the end it may be necessary to taper more slowly if anxiety or insomnia develop, with these symptoms continuing for many months, and comorbid conditions should be monitored throughout withdrawal to inform the taper schedule. If withdrawal symptoms increase, medication dosage should be stabilized or even increased for a period of days, and signs and symptoms of sedative withdrawal may last beyond the period of acute withdrawal, may take months or years to resolve, and should be treated with evidence-based interventions. If the patient is experiencing both sedative and opioid withdrawal, provide methadone or buprenorphine to stabilize withdrawal from opioids before tapering the dose of the sedative, and if the patient has been using multiple sedative substances or a sedative and alcohol, withdrawal should be handled by using an equivalent or longer-acting agent than the longest-acting agent used by the patient.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^113N22Qq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data

We conducted a cross-sectional study of UDT results from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, from patient specimens submitted for testing by health care professionals (HCP) as part of routine care based on medical necessity. Specimens were collected from health care practices from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. A single specimen for each patient was selected based on the earliest collection date to remove repeated measurements. The study used a convenience sample of 2 million randomly selected adult patient specimens with test orders for definitive UDT for methamphetamine by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS testing method is a laboratory-developed test with performance characteristics determined by Millennium Health, San Diego, California, which is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and accredited by the College of American Pathologists for high-complexity testing. Millennium Health performed all LC-MS/MS testing for the study. In addition to methamphetamine, the following drugs and/or drug classes were tested for in a subset of patient specimens (analytes and metabolites tested in parentheses): cocaine (benzoylecgonine), fentanyl (fentanyl, norfentanyl), heroin (6-MAM), alcohol (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate), marijuana (cTHC), methadone (methadone, EDDP), buprenorphine (buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine), other opioids (codeine, hydrocodone, norhydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, noroxycodone, oxymorphone), and benzodiazepines (alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, 7-amino-clonazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam). If any parent analyte or metabolite within a drug class was detected, the drug or drug class was considered positive for that specimen. All analytes/metabolites in the analysis were ordered and had valid test results for the specimen. When ordering UDTs, HCPs report a patient's prescribed medications. All results consistent with a patient's prescribed medications were excluded; only results for nonprescribed drugs were included.

The study protocol was approved by the Aspire Independent Review Board and includes a waiver of consent for the use of deidentified data. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.

### Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US veterans receiving opioid analgesics: case-cohort study [^114fRzJn]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Benzodiazepine types included were alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, oxazepam, quazepam, and triazolam. The most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines were those on the VHA drug formulary, which consisted of alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam. The other benzodiazepines included in the study were prescribed during the study period but at lower rates. Benzodiazepine dose was calculated as diazepam equivalents, according to previously published conversion tables. Benzodiazepine schedule was classified as regularly scheduled, as needed, or simultaneous regularly scheduled and as needed. Opioid analgesics included in this study were codeine, morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, propoxyphene, and methadone. We limited methadone prescriptions in this study to those prescribed to treat pain by excluding prescriptions in which dosing instructions indicated the methadone was prescribed for maintenance, oral or effervescent methadone formulations unless the dosing schedule indicated more than once a day dosing, or the dosing schedule was once a day unless the instructions indicated the methadone was prescribed for pain. Buprenorphine is not currently indicated for pain treatment in the VHA and was not included in this analysis. Opioid analgesic dose was calculated as morphine equivalents.

Both benzodiazepine and opioid analgesic dose were measured with an "as prescribed" approach, which assumes that patients took their benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics according to the prescribers' instructions. Patients were assumed to be taking the maximum amount described in the prescription, including for "as needed" prescriptions. We calculated dose by adding all diazepam or morphine milligram (mg) equivalents in each prescription and dividing by the number of days' supply. This dose represented the maximum daily dose prescribed and not necessarily the amount actually consumed. If there was an overlap between two prescriptions of the same drug at the same dose and schedule, we assumed that the first prescription was finished before the second prescription was started rather than assuming a higher amount of drug was taken during the overlap. If the overlapping drugs were of a different type, dose, or schedule, than we assumed the second prescription to have started on the date it was filled. Both benzodiazepine and opioid analgesic dose were treated as time varying.

### Co-prescription of opioids with benzodiazepine and other co-medications among opioid users: differential in opioid doses [^113WtQbQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Although co-prescriptions of opioid with other medications may assist in the management of chronic pain, certain co-prescribing patterns increase potential harm and are associated with high risk of drug interactions and adverse events. A report from the US demonstrated that the rate of death from opioid overdose has quadrupled in the last 15 years, and the most common additional agents found among the opioid overdose death were benzodiazepines, followed by antidepressants, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics.

Benzodiazepines, apart from being the main additional agent in the opioid overdose death, were also associated with increased rates of sedation, respiratory depression, cognitive dysfunction and sleep apnea.–Patients who were co-prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines for chronic pain were also reported to be prescribed with a high dose of opioid for long term. This increases the risk of opioid overdose, specifically with opioid doses of > 100 mg morphine equivalents per day. The practice of combining benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics has been recognized as both ubiquitous and substantial. The extent to which clinicians have cautioned patients against the concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opiates is unclear, but their co-prescribing presents a serious safety concern and is not well characterized.

Given these uncertainties, this study was prompted to address the patterns of opioid co-prescribing with benzodiazepine and other co-medications among opioid users. The daily opioid dose per patient in each type of opioid co-prescribing was also examined. We believe that this study will be an important first step to better understand opioid co-prescribing at an outpatient tertiary hospital setting in Malaysia and will help to improve the safety of opioid prescribing.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1143PETW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder — treatment setting and co-prescribed sedatives: The venue in which treatment is provided should be carefully considered, with methadone only provided in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and acute care settings (under limited circumstances), buprenorphine prescribed by waivered clinicians in any setting, including OTPs and office based opioid treatment (OBOT) in accordance with the Federal law (21 CFR §1301.28), and naltrexone prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe medication; clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining which treatment setting is most appropriate. Patients with active co-occurring alcohol use disorder or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, or who are in treatment for a substance use disorder involving use of alcohol or other sedative drugs, including benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists, may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting, and persons who are regularly using alcohol or other sedatives, even if they do not meet the criteria for diagnosis of a specific substance use disorder related to that class of drugs, should be carefully monitored. The prescribing of benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with extreme caution in patients prescribed methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of an opioid use disorder, and a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted when deciding whether to co-prescribe these medications; methadone is recommended for patients who may benefit from daily dosing and supervision in an OTP, or for patients for whom buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder has been used unsuccessfully in an OTP or OBOT setting.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114bTsdh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long-term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient's care team, as appropriate. In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. As emphasized in an FDA advisory, buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system. Whereas the combined use of these medications increases risks, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks.

If risks are determined to outweigh benefits of continuing opioids for pain and benzodiazepine therapy at current dosages, decisions about tapering medications (e.g. whether to taper opioids first, taper benzodiazepines first, or consider carefully transitioning from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine before tapering benzodiazepines) should be individualized and reevaluated over time. Considerations include patient priorities, the patient's clinical considerations, the patient's response to therapeutic changes, consultation with other clinicians managing the patient's care, and, consultation with other specialists (e.g. an addiction specialist) if needed. Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. Tapering rates should be individualized. Examples of benzodiazepine tapers and tips for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal are available. Cognitive behavioral therapy increases tapering success rates and might be particularly helpful for patients struggling with a benzodiazepine taper. If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered. Clinicians should communicate with mental health professionals managing the patient to discuss the patient's needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

Recommendation 12

Clinicians should offer or arrange treatment with evidence-based medications to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Detoxification on its own, without medications for opioid use disorder, is not recommended for opioid use disorder because of increased risks for resuming drug use, overdose, and overdose death (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 1).

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^111mX8je]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 3: Treating Opioid Withdrawal

Using medications for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids. Abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings, which can lead to continued use.

Patients should be advised about risk of relapse and other safety concerns from using opioid withdrawal management as standalone treatment for opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method.

Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal.

Opioid withdrawal management in cases in which methadone is used to manage withdrawal symptoms must be done in an inpatient setting or in an OTP. For short-acting opioids, tapering schedules that decrease in daily doses of prescribed methadone should begin with doses between 20 and 30 mg per day, and should be completed in 6–10 days.

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

The use of combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to manage withdrawal and facilitate the accelerated introduction of extended-release injectable naltrexone has shown promise. More research will be needed before this can be accepted as standard practice.

The Guideline Committee recommends, based on consensus opinion, the inclusion of clonidine as a practice to support opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not US FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, but it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine may be used orally or transdermally at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily to assist in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a delay in response using transdermal clonidine that may require oral supplementation on day 1. Its hypotensive effects often limit the amount that can be used. Clonidine can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, and ondansetron or other agents for nausea.

Opioid withdrawal management using anesthesia – ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD) – is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be a well tolerated and effective approach, but should be used only by clinicians experienced in this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation is not being employed.

### Thresholds for adjunctive medication usage and probability of initiating injectable naltrexone [^112hvNji]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To estimate the effectiveness of different thresholds for administering opioid withdrawal medications (clonidine and clonazepam) on the probability of successfully initiating extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) among participants with opioid use disorder (OUD) during medically managed withdrawal.

Design

Secondary analysis of a multisite clinical trial comparing a rapid vs. standard approach for XR-NTX initiation, 2021–2022.

Setting

Six community inpatient addiction treatment units in the United States.

Participants

English-speaking adults seeking treatment for DSM-5 OUD and expressing interest in XR-NTX treatment (n = 415).

Measurements

We estimated the extent to which the following thresholds for adjunctive medication administration would affect the probability of initiating XR-NTX over time: 1) where adjunctive medications were given in response to at mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms or greater [Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score ≥ 5), 2) where adjunctive medications were given in response to minimal withdrawal symptoms or greater (COWS score ≥ 3) and 3) where adjunctive medications were given regardless of withdrawal symptoms. Using a longitudinal sequentially doubly robust estimator, we estimated the cumulative probability of XR-NTX initiation under each of these three treatment regimes while accounting for dropout and initiation of other medications as competing events.

Findings

The estimated probability of initiating XR-NTX by day 14 was 50.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.8–58.9) under the no-threshold regime, 43.9% (95% CI = 39.1–48.7) under the regime of waiting for minimal withdrawal symptoms and 38.5% (95% CI = 34.3–42.6) under the regime of waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms. Probability of XR-NTX initiation was a statistically significant 11.9 percentage points higher (95% CI = 3.6–20.2) under the no-threshold regime versus the mild-to-moderate threshold regime, and a non-statistically significant 6.4 percentage points (95% CI = -0.8 to 13.7) higher under the no-threshold regime versus the minimal threshold regime.

Conclusions

Providing clonidine and clonazepam daily during the first five days of medically managed opioid withdrawal appears to statistically significantly increase the likelihood of initiating extended-release naltrexone treatment compared with waiting for mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms to administer adjunctive medications. To improve initiation rates, providers may consider lowering the threshold at which they provide adjunctive medications, giving these medications preemptively or to manage even minimal withdrawal symptoms.

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^115TGZ5j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING:
SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF METHADONE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS

A ddiction, Abuse, and Misuse

Because the use of methadone hydrochloride tablets exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death, assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing and reassess all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)].

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of methadone hydrochloride tablets, especially during initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of methadone hydrochloride tablets are essential [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

Accidental Ingestion

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of methadone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of methadone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of methadone hydrochloride tablets and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3), DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

### Evaluating the impact of prescribed versus nonprescribed benzodiazepine use in methadone maintenance therapy: results from a population-based retrospective cohort study [^117Xstvk]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major healthcare issue in North America, and opioid-related overdose is the primary preventable cause of death in both urban and rural regions of the continent. For patients with OUD, opioid substitution therapy including methadone-assisted treatment is the standard of care. MAT is a harm reduction model of care where opioid agonists (e.g. methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone) are substituted in place of more harmful opioids, including oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is a maintenance and stabilization model of care that can improve patients' psychosocial functioning as patients stabilize and reduce use of nonprescribed opioids in treatment.

It is common for patients who are receiving MAT to use other prescribed or nonprescribed substances while in treatment, and for this reason, frequent urine screening is performed in concert with MAT administration. One such substance that is often screened for is benzodiazepines (BZDs) — a pharmaceutical class that is used by as many as 66% of patients on MAT. BZD class molecules (eg, diazepam, clonazepam, lorazepam) act on the GABAergic system and are respiratory depressants. BZDs generally provide sedative-like effects and have a high potential for abuse and dependence. Due to compounding respiratory depressant actions, BZD use during MAT drastically increases patients' risk of overdose-related death. Approximately 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths in Ontario involve BZD. However, when managed in a controlled treatment setting, the available evidence suggests patients may benefit from BZD maintenance with little risk of increased mortality.

Benzodiazepines are indicated to manage acute behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Due to the abuse potential of BZDs, clinical guidelines generally advocate for short-term BZD prescribing. Long-term prescribed BZD use among a minority of MAT patients with mental health issues may have therapeutic potential. The evidence suggests that BZD use during MAT has a negative impact on treatment outcomes; however, an important caveat to these studies is whether patients were using prescribed or nonprescribed BZD. It is not yet clear whether prescribed BZD use during MAT can improve outcomes for patients with co-occurring mental health disorders, where BZD may be clinically indicated.

In this study, we evaluate the impact of prescribed versus nonprescribed BZD use during MAT in patients with OUD, using 1-year treatment retention as a primary outcome.

### Primary care providers can prescribe with confidence… [^11615bTT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of medications used to treat OUD and who can prescribe them The FDA has approved three medications for treatment of OUD: buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. The most commonly prescribed medications used to treat OUD in outpatient primary care settings are buprenorphine-containing products, which are available in a film or tablet for sublingual or buccal use. There are also long-acting injectable forms of buprenorphine. Physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who have a current Drug Enforcement Administration registration with authority to prescribe controlled substances can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, though some states may have additional requirements to do so. New or renewing DEA registrants must meet DEA requirements to continue prescribing. A DATA waiver, long considered a barrier preventing health care providers from prescribing buprenorphine, is no longer required.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has more information about waiver elimination. Injectable naltrexone can also be prescribed by any provider with the authority to prescribe medication. Methadone used to treat OUD can only be dispensed by opioid treatment programs, except in very limited circumstances. You can find OTPs and other treatment programs at FindTreatment. gov. A podcast from the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry discusses how to Navigate the New 8-Hour Training Requirement for SUDs: What Prescribers Should Know. Ingestion by a child may cause respiratory depression that can result in death. Advise people to seek medical attention immediately if a child is exposed to one of these products. Refer to FDA's Remove the Risk Campaign and the PROTECT Initiative. Naloxone: Naloxone is a lifesaving emergency treatment that reverses opioid overdose. Discuss the availability of naloxone and strongly consider prescribing it.

People receiving medicines to treat OUD have a lower risk of opioid overdose than those with OUD who are not being treated; however, even when being treated with MOUD, there is still a risk of return-to-use and opioid overdose.

### Factors associated with mortality in Scottish patients receiving methadone in primary care: retrospective cohort study [^116oG8qL]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Each record of a prescription for methadone contained details on the patient's Community Health Index number; the date of prescription; the dose, quantity, strength, and type of methadone; and the general practitioner and practice where the prescription was issued. We calculated the length of methadone treatment from the number of days between the first and last prescriptions and the coverage of the last prescription. We calculated the mean dose of methadone from the total days' coverage for each person (number of days at prescribed amount for each prescription) and the total amount prescribed. We categorised people as overusing methadone if the length of treatment was shorter than the total coverage of the prescribed prescriptions. We flagged patients as "on treatment" if their last methadone prescription was within three months of their date of death or the end of the study period. We defined a "break" in methadone treatment if a discontinuation in prescription of methadone of 90 days or more occurred. In accordance with UK prescribing recommendations, we categorised people who were below, within, and above the recommended methadone maintenance range of 60 mg to 120 mg daily, and fitted this as a binary variable with ≥ 60 mg as the cut-off point.

We examined prescribing records for other drugs and recorded any patient who was prescribed a drug from the hypnotic or anxiolytic class as receiving benzodiazepines. We recorded drugs used for psychoses and related disorders as antipsychotics and also recorded use of antidepressants and opioid analgesics.

We calculated the total number of prescriptions issued from each practice from the prescribing records. We then grouped practices into quarters on the basis of the number of methadone prescriptions issued and assigned each person the value for the last practice to issue methadone. We included this variable in the survival analysis to represent the volume of methadone prescribing by practice.

Our main outcome measure was all cause mortality recorded on the General Registry Office death certificate or on the Community Health Index number register held by Tayside Health Board.

Benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics during methadone or buprenorphine treatment: The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine; while the combined use of these medications increases the risk of serious side effects, the harm caused by untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks, and a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted with greater support including careful medication management to reduce risks.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113grPG8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Opioid risk mitigation when co-prescribing during benzodiazepine care — if opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, carefully evaluate benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks; the CDC recommends that clinicians use the lowest effective dose of BZDs and follow CDC guidelines for minimizing risks related to opioid prescribing; this includes minimizing opioid doses where possible and optimizing non-opioid interventions for managing pain; the CDC guideline and the joint US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense Guideline on Chronic Pain Prescribing also recommend that clinicians consider using buprenorphine to manage pain in patients at risk of withdrawal or overdose, including those who are co-prescribed BZDs; patients at risk of opioid overdose should be provided with or prescribed opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone).

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^117Jx6bS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department opioid co-prescribing with benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics — evidence and guidance emphasize overdose risk and avoidance: Emergency physicians have observed increasing rates of overdoses and drug-related deaths related to the combination of opioids and benzodiazepines, and population-based studies have identified a substantial increased risk of death when these agents are co-prescribed, with rates of death 3- to 10-fold higher compared with opioids alone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a black box warning in 2016 to both opioids and benzodiazepines recommending against co-prescribing these agents. Although the literature search yielded no directly applicable primary research study of at least a Class III level of evidence assignment, the committee reached consensus to develop the recommendation against routinely combining these therapies for patients being discharged from the emergency department (ED) after being treated for an acute episode of pain, and the summary states that co-prescribing of these 2 classes of medications should be done with caution, and, when possible, avoided.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111GFJKH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression, and patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines may be given but should be used with caution and only in facilities with close monitoring, and patients receiving opioid agonist therapy with concomitant alcohol withdrawal should be admitted and managed in a hospital setting or other setting with the resources to manage increased risk of respiratory depression and other complications. Patients who are using sedative-hypnotic medication are at higher risk of major complications and may exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and require dose adjustment, and these patients should be monitored closely.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113inZfZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone patient counseling — Patients should use other CNS depressants (especially benzodiazepines) with caution and only as directed by a healthcare provider, and should only use methadone in combination with other opioids as prescribed by a healthcare provider. The use of illicit drugs and/or alcohol with methadone may be fatal. Pain relief builds gradually and usually takes 5–7 days to see the full effects of a particular dose. Patients should tell all medical providers that they are taking methadone; adding medications or changing dosing of other medications can affect methadone and should be coordinated with the methadone prescriber. Patients should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination (such as driving or using machinery) until the effects of methadone are realized, typically a week or longer, and should rise slowly from a sitting/supine position, as methadone may cause dizziness. Methadone, like other opioids, can cause significant constipation, and patients should take a prescribed laxative as directed. Patients should report any of the following symptoms immediately and/or seek urgent/emergent care: dizziness or lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat (palpitations), falls or near falls, chest pain/pressure, and shortness of breath. Patients should avoid abrupt discontinuation of methadone without first consulting a healthcare provider.

### Methadone at tapered doses for the management of opioid withdrawal [^116oPutv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use in many countries the evidence of tapered methadone's efficacy in managing opioid withdrawal has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of tapered methadone compared with other detoxification treatments and placebo in managing opioid withdrawal on completion of detoxification and relapse rate.

Search Strategy

We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), EMBASE (January 1988 to December 2004), PsycINFO (January 1985 to December 2004), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which focus on the use of tapered methadone versus all other pharmacological detoxification treatments or placebo for the treatment of opiate withdrawal.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed the included studies. Any doubt about how to rate the studies were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Study quality was assessed according to the criteria indicated in Cochrane Reviews Handbook 4.2. (Alderson 2004)

Main Results

Sixteen trials involving 1187 people were included. Comparing methadone versus any other pharmacological treatment we observed no clinical difference between the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment, relative risk (RR) 1.12; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.34 and results at follow-up RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.92. It was impossible to pool data for the other outcomes but the results of the studies did not show significant differences between the considered treatments. These results were confirmed also when we considered the single comparisons: methadone with: adrenergic agonists (11 studies), other opioid agonists (four studies), chlordiazepoxide (study). Comparing methadone with placebo (one study) more severe withdrawal and more drop outs were found in the placebo group. The results indicate that the medications used in the included studies are similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to duration, design and treatment objectives, impairing the application of meta-analysis. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use.

### Factors associated with mortality in Scottish patients receiving methadone in primary care: retrospective cohort study [^112kPZkJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

The unique nature of this dataset in terms of record linkage provides evidence that recommendations on best practice improve patients' outcomes and that the improvements that have taken place in terms of the delivery of methadone maintenance programmes in the UK are likely to reduce the risk of death in this vulnerable group of people. This study also provides evidence about subgroups of people, particularly those with a history of psychiatric admission, who have a higher risk of death. Similarly, for general practitioners who are prescribing methadone, monitoring of urine and avoidance of co-prescribing of benziodiazepines should be implemented. The findings from this study emphasise the need for a psychosocial perspective in relation to ongoing management of people enrolled in methadone maintenance programmes. In some situations, people at higher risk (history of psychiatric illness, poor engagement with services including urine testing) might be more appropriately managed in a specialist, rather than a generalist, environment.

To avoid methadone related deaths and improve the quality of methadone prescribing, the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has produced guidelines that recommend a structured delivery of service with clear roles and responsibilities, particularly for the prescribing doctor, alongside psychosocial care. By providing clear and explicit recommendations about the prescribing and dispensing of methadone, in conjunction with an organised system of delivery, drug related mortality and morbidity are expected to be reduced. However, commentators acknowledge that many of the recommendations in the guidelines are "very loosely evidence-based", and quality markers associated with the prescribing and delivery of methadone need to be validated and related to individual outcomes. The results of this cohort study provide evidence of the value of stabilised prescribing, regular monitoring of urine, and avoidance of co-prescribing of benzodiazepines when possible.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113deT9a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — indications, contraindications, cautions, and interactions: Methadone is frequently used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder. Methadone is contraindicated for patients with known hypersensitivity to methadone hydrochloride, those experiencing respiratory depression in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings, patients with acute bronchial asthma or hypercapnia (also known as hypercarbia), and patients with known or suspected paralytic ileus. Methadone should be used with caution in patients with decompensated liver disease (e.g., jaundice, ascites) due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, concomitant substance use disorders — particularly sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders — because interactions may be life-threatening, a current psychiatric diagnosis that may impair their ability to maintain daily attendance at an OTP, and in patients with low levels of physical dependence to opioids who should be started with low doses of methadone. Significant medication interactions include that methadone may prolong the QT interval and should be used in caution with other agents that may also prolong the QT interval, including class I or class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers, some antipsychotics, and some antidepressants, and that methadone is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway with many agents interacting with this pathway including alcohol, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and macrolide antibiotics.

ASIPP opioid guideline — co-administration with other drugs: In non-cancer pain patients on opioids, concomitant medications may cause harm, including "over sedation and drug overdose due to synergistic effect and alteration of drug metabolism". Benzodiazepines with opioids "negatively affect respiration", and in Medicare part D data "from 71,248 patients… during the first 90 days, concurrent benzodiazepine use is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of opioid-related overdose". In "patients who are chronic opioid abusers and on maintenance therapy with buprenorphine and methadone" there was a "high risk of overdose" without tolerance to benzodiazepine respiratory depression. Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) "can potentiate the respiratory depressant effects of opioid including overdose", and in a retrospective study "in 295 patients" their use "increases the risk of opioid related adverse effects"; patients taking opioids who were "65 years or older", female, post–orthopedic surgery, with specified comorbidities, or receiving patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioids were "more likely to require reversal with naloxone".

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^112igbYS]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Minimizing risk for poisoning and overdose — There is an increased risk of opioid overdose when adolescents and adults are co-prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines or other sedating and/or respiratory depressant medications, and concomitant use of opioids and sedating medications can lead to significant sedation, respiratory depression, and death. This danger drove the FDA to add a boxed warning to the drug labeling of opioids and benzodiazepines in 2016, and in 2022 the CDC recommended that clinicians who care for adults should use caution when coprescribing opioids and benzodiazepines. In rare pediatric cases, concomitant prescribing may be appropriate. Clinicians should, however, exercise caution and also coprescribe naloxone when coprescribing opioids and sedating medications to children and adolescents, and individuals (including adolescents) who have an OUD and may need buprenorphine or methadone should, nonetheless, receive these medications even if they are already receiving benzodiazepines but that care should be used when coprescribing these medications.

### Vital signs: variation among States in prescribing of opioid pain relievers and benzodiazepines-United States, 2012 [^112EFgyi]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data on prescribing in 2012 come from IMS Health's National Prescription Audit (NPA). NPA provides estimates of the numbers of prescriptions dispensed in each state based on a sample of approximately 57,000 pharmacies, which dispense nearly 80% of the retail prescriptions in the United States. Prescriptions, including refills, dispensed at retail pharmacies and paid for by commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, or cash were included. *

CDC used the numbers of prescriptions and census denominators to calculate prescribing rates for OPR, subtypes of OPR, and benzodiazepines. The OPR category included semisynthetic opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, and synthetic opioids, such as tramadol. It did not include buprenorphine products used primarily for substance abuse treatment rather than pain, methadone distributed through substance abuse treatment programs, or cough and cold formulations containing opioids. LA/ER OPR were defined as those that should be taken only 2 to 3 times a day, such as methadone, OxyContin, and Opana ER. High-dose OPR were defined as the largest formulations available for each type of OPR that resulted in a total daily dosage of ≥ 100 morphine milligram equivalents when taken at the usual frequency, for example, every 4–6 hours. Benzodiazepines included alprazolam, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, estazolam, flurazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, quazepam, temazepam, and triazolam.

CDC calculated prescribing rates per 100 persons for the United States, each census region, and each state. CDC described the distribution of state rates using mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) (SD divided by the mean), the interquartile ratio (IQ) (75th percentile rate divided by the 25th percentile rate), and the ratio of the highest/lowest rates. Rates were transformed into multiples of the SD above or below the mean state rate of each drug.

We examined analyte/metabolite results consistent with either illicit or nonprescribed substance use. All specimens were tested for buprenorphine (and its metabolite, norbuprenorphine). The following drugs and/or drug classes were tested for in a subset of patient specimens based on a clinician's determination of medical necessity(with analytes and metabolites tested in parentheses): cocaine (benzoylecgonine), methamphetamine, fentanyl (fentanyl, norfentanyl), heroin (6-monoacetylmorphine), alcohol (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate), marijuana (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid), methadone (methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine), gabapentin, tramadol (tramadol, N-desmethyl-tramadol, O-desmethyl-tramadol), hydrocodone (hydrocodone, norhydrocodone), oxycodone (oxycodone, noroxycodone), and benzodiazepines (alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, 7-amino-clonazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, lorazepam). If any parent analyte or metabolite within a drug class was detected, the drug or drug class was considered positive for that specimen. However, we excluded positive results for medications that were reported by clinicians to be currently prescribed to patients: 6348 of the 150 000 samples (4.23%) had reported medications for at least 1 of the 12 analytes and were removed from the analysis. Because not all specimens were tested for each analyte, we calculated rates out of all specimens tested for the analyte. (The number of positive tests and positivity rates for each analyte are shown in Table 1.)

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Opioids are commonly prescribed for two indications: analgesic indications and agonist treatment in patients with illicit opioid use. As an analgesic, opioids have a place in acute and cancer-related pain. However, continued long-term use for chronic non-cancer pain may induce adverse events, such as elevated pain, mood disorders and reduced quality of life, without clear benefits as an analgesic. In these cases, opioid discontinuation should be initiated as early as possible as nearly 5% of patients develop an opioid use disorder. Patients with chronic non-cancer pain and an opioid use disorder discontinuing their opioids have a relapse rate of 23% after 1 year. In patients on opioid agonist treatment (methadone or buprenorphine), the aim is to reduce opioid-related harm. These patients generally had several previous failed attempts to stop illicit opioid use. Patients with illicit opioid use disorder who use agonist treatment have a relapse rate of 71% within 1 month after discontinuation of agonist treatment. Treatment goals for these patients should be more toward harm reduction with opioid agonist therapy (i.e. methadone or buprenorphine) instead of tapering. Only in a subset of individuals who have a wish to taper or discontinue their agonist treatment, and have improved psychological or social conditions, such as improvement on co-occurring mental disorders or housing situations, tapering or discontinuation can be considered.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Opioid discontinuation in patients with chronic pain reduces pain severity and improves quality of life. Increased pain and craving can occur in some patients in short term, particularly at higher doses. In patients on agonist treatment, discontinuation of agonist treatment has been associated with increased craving levels, and reduced quality of life. Discontinuation of prescription opioids is usually accompanied by DS after more than 3 weeks of use. Typical opioid DS include dysphoria, anxiety, agitation, nausea, muscle ache, rhinorrhea, sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever, and insomnia. Higher opioid doses and long-term use result in more severe DS, while long-acting opioids (methadone or buprenorphine) cause less severe DS. Among patients with opioid use disorders, acute discontinuation or rapid tapering of opioids may lead to withdrawal that requires medical care. In individuals discontinuing opioids after long-term use for chronic pain, suicidal ideation and self-directed violence may occur. Overdose-related morbidity is more likely in the first month after discontinuation, due to decreased tolerance to original doses following relapse. Opioid discontinuation may result in illicit opioid use, including heroin and illegally manufactured fentanyl.

### Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines: evaluation of prescription drug monitoring by a United States laboratory [^116hnAYG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Since 2000, the rate of opioid deaths in the United States has tripled. Drug overdose deaths rose to the highest level ever recorded in 2015 and may have risen since. Over 63% of the 52,404 drug overdose deaths in 2015 involved heroin and opioid pain reliever medications, and nearly half of these deaths involved prescription medications. A number of risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of adverse events related to opioids, including concurrent use of benzodiazepine medications and other central nervous system depressants. The cumulative and synergistic drug effects from combining benzodiazepines and opioids depress the central nervous system's medullary controls for respiration; benzodiazepines through the gamma-aminobutyric-acid receptors and opioids through mu (μ) and delta (δ) receptors. Some patients and individuals with substance use disorder may combine opioid and benzodiazepine drugs to increase the subjective peak strength of drug effects and sedation, whereas others may use each drug therapeutically. In 2010, over 30% of opioid-related deaths in the United States also involved benzodiazepines. Of interest, among United States military veterans who were prescribed opioids and who subsequently died of a drug overdose, approximately half involved concurrent prescriptions for benzodiazepines.

Federal agencies in the United States continue to make efforts to combat the opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. In August 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a "boxed warning" on both prescription opioids and benzodiazepines alerting prescribers to the dangers of concurrent use. In March 2016, the CDC released the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016. Two key recommendations are that clinicians "should use urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy and consider urine drug testing at least annually to assess for prescribed medications as well as other controlled prescription drugs and illicit drugs". Drug testing prior to starting therapy with a controlled substance provides baseline information of current drug use. Subsequent drug tests monitor for both adherence with prescribed medications and abstinence from use of non-prescribed or illicit drugs. Drug testing patients who are prescribed opioids can reveal potentially dangerous drug combinations, including concurrent use of benzodiazepines, which can inform and affect clinicians' treatment decisions.

Clonazepam Tablets

for oral use

What is the most important information I should know about clonazepam tablets?

Clonazepam tablets are benzodiazepine medicine. Taking benzodiazepines with opioid medicines, alcohol, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (including street drugs) can cause severe drowsiness, breathing problems (respiratory depression), coma, and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens:
shallow or slowed breathing
breathing stops (which may lead to the heart stopping)
excessive sleepiness (sedation)
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how taking clonazepamtablets and opioids affects you.
Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. There is a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction with benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death.
Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets. These serious side effects may also include delirium, paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side effects.
You can develop an addiction even if you take clonazepam tablets as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
Take clonazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider prescribed.
Do not share your clonazepamtablets with other people.
Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place and away from children.
Physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. Clonazepam tablets can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions.
Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms.
Some people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months, including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears.
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction.
Do not take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed.
Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This may get better over time.
Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you.
Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up.
Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse.
Like other antiepileptic drugs, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500.
Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you:

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1169kqWT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with SUD — abrupt cessation of BZDs is dangerous; the CGC recommends clinicians develop gradual tapering strategies that are individualized based on a patient's response; if more rapid tapering is indicated due to imminent safety risks or unsuccessful alternate treatments, clinicians can consider use of very long-acting agents; and clinicians should consider patients' psychosocial concerns and co-occurring disorders when determining the timing of BZD tapering.

### Identifying clinically relevant drug-drug interactions with methadone and buprenorphine: a translational approach to signal detection [^114oXvui]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methadone and buprenorphine have pharmacologic properties that are concerning for a high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We performed high-throughput screening for clinically relevant DDIs with methadone or buprenorphine by combining pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacokinetic approaches. We conducted pharmacoepidemiologic screening via a series of self-controlled case series studies (SCCS) in Optum claims data from 2000 to 2019. We included persons 18years or older who experienced an outcome of interest during target drug treatment. Exposures were all overlapping medications (i.e., the candidate precipitants) during target drug treatment. Outcomes were opioid overdose, non-overdose adverse effects, and cardiac arrest. We used conditional Poisson regression to calculate rate ratios, accounting for multiple comparisons with semi-Bayes shrinkage. We explored the impact of key study design choices in analyses that varied the exposure definitions of the target drugs and the candidate precipitant drugs. Pharmacokinetic screening was conducted by incorporating published data on CYP enzyme metabolism into an equation-based static model. In SCCS analysis, 1,432 events were included from 248,069 new users of methadone or buprenorphine. In the primary analysis, statistically significant DDIs included gabapentinoids with either methadone or buprenorphine; baclofen with methadone; and benzodiazepines with methadone. In sensitivity analysis, additional statistically significant DDIs included methocarbamol, quetiapine, or simvastatin with methadone. Pharmacokinetic screening identified two moderate-to-strong potential DDIs (clonidine and fluconazole with buprenorphine). The combination of clonidine and buprenorphine was also associated with a significantly increased risk of opioid overdose in pharmacoepidemiologic screening. These DDI signals may be the most important targets for future confirmation studies.

Managing taper when BZDs are obtained illicitly — tapering can be complicated by counterfeit or novel synthetic BZDs that may evade standard testing; determining an equivalent starting dose is difficult; in general, clinicians should titrate the BZD dose to the minimum dose necessary to control withdrawal symptoms and taper from that point; clinicians should consider residential treatment if after-hours clinical monitoring or medical management is needed; counterfeit pills may contain fentanyl, so clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and counsel on harm reduction medications such as naloxone.

### Association between benzodiazepine use with or without opioid use and all-cause mortality in the United States, 1999–2015 [^113Ef1Fa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepines are among the most widely used medications worldwide and are prescribed for common problems such as anxiety and insomnia. Up to 13% of US adults have reported benzodiazepine use in the last year, with ambulatory benzodiazepine prescriptions more than doubling in the last decade.

Increasing benzodiazepine prescriptions have clinical relevance amid declining life expectancies and a global epidemic of opioid overdoses. When benzodiazepines are taken alone, long-term use is associated with falls, cognitive impairment, and life-threatening withdrawal. When taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines can further suppress breathing, a common cause of death from opioid overdose. The danger of benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment is thus a timely issue, as 20% to 30% of all benzodiazepine recipients in the US are estimated to have an opioid coprescriptionand more than 30% of opioid overdose deaths are found to involve benzodiazepines. Despite a recent plateau in overall opioid use in the US, benzodiazepine-opioid coprescriptions continue to increase. It is tempting to infer elevated mortality risk attributable to benzodiazepines alone or in combination with opioids, but this topic has proven challenging to study. To date, it is not well understood if benzodiazepine use — whether with or without opioids — is associated directly with mortality, as opposed to serving as a marker for unmeasured underlying conditions that are the true factors associated with excess deaths.

In the case of benzodiazepine use without opioids, data on its long-term mortality risks are marked by inconsistent findings. Although some studies have found substantial mortality associated with benzodiazepine use without opioids, such that the hazards of taking benzodiazepines more than 30 times per month were akin to smoking 1 to 2 packs of cigarettes per day, other studies have not supported these findings, with several analyses suggesting that benzodiazepine-associated mortality may vary based on age or follow-up time. Furthermore, these studies have often been limited to employed, middle-aged populations in commercial insurance databases, which may exclude individuals with a heavier comorbidity burden who initiate benzodiazepines.

In the case of benzodiazepine-opioid cotreatment, the literature base is similarly limited. Although recent data have depicted an increased risk of emergency department visitsand opioid overdose deaths in patients with such coprescriptions, these findings have often been limited to patients surviving opioid overdoses, subpopulations such as veterans, and short-term follow-up.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113fVDfe]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use and use validated tools or consult with behavioral specialists to screen for and assess mental health and substance use disorders.
When considering initiating long-term opioid therapy, clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression and other mental health conditions is optimized, consulting with behavioral health specialists when needed.
Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients at increased risk for overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use disorder, patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients taking higher dosages of opioids (e.g. ≥ 50 MME/day), patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11), and patients at risk for returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g. patients undergoing tapering or recently released from prison).
Practices should educate patients on overdose prevention and naloxone use and offer to provide education to members of their households.
Naloxone coprescribing can be facilitated by clinics or practices with resources to provide naloxone training, by collaborative practice models with pharmacists, or through statewide protocols or standing orders for naloxone at pharmacies.
Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care and emergency department settings can be found through Prescribe to Prevent at. Additional resources are at.
In part because of concerns about cost of naloxone and access for some patients and reports that purchasing of naloxone has in some cases been required to fill opioid prescriptions, including for patients without a way to afford naloxone, this recommendation specifies that naloxone should be offered to patients. To that end, clinicians, health systems, and payers can work to ensure patients can obtain naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment.
Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep-disordered breathing when possible to minimize risk for respiratory depression.
When making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy, clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks. For pregnant persons already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if tapering is being considered because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5).
For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 12).
Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and for patients aged ≥ 65 years. Clinicians should implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid therapy among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk assessment for falls, and patient monitoring for cognitive impairment.
For patients with jobs that involve potentially hazardous tasks and who are receiving opioids or other medications that can negatively affect sleep, cognition, balance, or coordination, clinicians should assess patients' abilities to safely perform the potentially hazardous tasks (e.g. driving, use of heavy equipment, climbing ladders, working at heights or around moving machinery, or working with high-voltage equipment).
Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose.
Clinicians should provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients are provided or receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see Recommendation 12).
Although substance use disorders can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 12, Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder for additional considerations specific to these patients.)
If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain for patients with substance use disorder, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone [see Offering Naloxone to Patients] and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).
If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use disorder and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and to discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids.
If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with previous opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).

Co-administering opioids and benzodiazepines can have deleterious effects on ventilation. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms leading to hypoventilation.

### The growing problem of co-treatment with opioids and benzodiazepines [^113iw4LZ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Concern about concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines led two US government agencies to act in 2016. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on opioid prescribing urge clinicians to avoid concurrent prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now requires black box warnings (the highest level of alert) on product labels and patient focused medication guides for opioids and benzodiazepines, recognizing the adverse outcomes associated with their concurrent use.

Warnings and guidelines, while important to defining problematic practice, are not likely to change clinical behavior, at least not quickly. Performance metrics used by payers could prove a key lever for change. In the US and the UK, payers hold clinicians and facilities accountable for basic quality. But we found no example of performance metrics targeting hazardous drug combinations. Optimal use of safety alerts in electronic health records could prove effective, but only if they appropriately notify prescribers of hazardous combinations and only if prescribers are held accountable for over-riding warnings. Guidelines provide explicit definitions of best practice, but, as with all else in healthcare, the challenge is in effective implementation and incentives sufficient to motivate changes in the system.

Although implementation of expanded quality metrics, incentives, and systems that facilitate safer prescribing practice around drug combinations will take time, Sun and colleagues provide evidence that can be of immediate use. For example, the risk of overdose was 71% higher in chronic users who concurrently used a benzodiazepine compared with chronic users who did not (5.36% v 3.13%). Clinicians caring for patients using opioids chronically need to be especially cautious. Research shows that opioids are prescribed by multiple providers, a situation more common in deaths from overdose when both opioids and benzodiazepines were being taken. Providers can incorporate such evidence into practice rapidly with the right systems in place.

Unless systems are set up to push information to providers, however, busy clinicians will struggle to keep up with their patients' use of different prescriptions. For example, current state monitoring programs for prescription drugs in the US require separate computers with separate authentication, one of many reported barriers to use.

A multi-pronged effort from both regulators and experts writing clinical guidelines, along with extensive expansion in warnings about the hazards of drug-drug interactions, are essential to reduce low value, potentially dangerous care.

Benzodiazepine–opioid co-prescribing — core recommendations: Because all patients co-prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal and at least every 3 months (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risks, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid analgesic medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions to manage pain.

Life-Threatening R espiratory Depression

Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, have been reported during initiation and conversion of patients to methadone, and even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Proper dosing and titration are essential and Methadone Hydrochloride should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Methadone Hydrochloride or following a dose increase. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak pharmacologic effect, especially during the initial dosing period.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, is a risk factor for respiratory depression and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants in patients in methadone treatment to those for whom alternatives to benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are inadequate.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation and consider delaying or omitting daily methadone dosing.

Substance use disorder (SUD) and unregulated benzodiazepine exposure management indicates that some patients with SUD may report nonmedical use of prescribed BZDs or use of nonprescribed BZDs, making daily dose determination difficult; the CGC recommends that clinicians refer these patients for assessment of potential SUD, and unless contraindicated, these patients should typically be transitioned to a long-acting agent due to the uncertainty regarding the strength of the BZDs they are taking.

Adult restless legs syndrome — opioid therapy risk, efficacy, and selection. While there is a risk of abuse and/or overdose with opioids, evidence regarding long-term use of low-dose opioids in appropriately screened adults suggests these risks are relatively low and observational studies show only small dose increases over extended periods (2–10 years). The task force notes the benefit is likely a class effect, with many different opioids used effectively and methadone being the most common, allowing selection tailored to side effect profile and pharmacokinetics. Two oral long-acting opioids commonly used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS), methadone and buprenorphine, are also used as long-term maintenance therapy in opioid use disorder. Concomitant nervous system inhibitory drugs that may increase respiratory depression (sedative hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and alpha-2 delta ligands) may already be part of a regimen when opioids are considered.

5.2 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants with Methadone

Concomitant use of methadone and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to methadone treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, or alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at admission to methadone treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in methadone-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of methadone dosing, ensure that a medically-trained healthcare provider evaluates the cause of sedation and delays or omits the methadone dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in methadone treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's methadone treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in methadone treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking the medications prescribed and not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^11163UwT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients prescribed both opioids and BZD comprise a high-risk population. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and BZDs concurrently and consider whether the risks of concurrent use of opioids with other CNS depressants outweigh the benefits. It is important to note that use of BZDs is not a reason to withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD; see " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders ").

As discussed in Recommendation 1, the CGC recommends that clinicians review the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing for patients who take both opioids and BZDs at least every 3 months or at every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal, whichever is sooner. Clinicians should conduct more frequent risk–benefit assessments for patients who have additional risk factors for adverse events. The Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) is a tool that can be used for this purpose (see Box 7). According to the RIOSORD, the most significant risk factors include having an SUD, a bipolar spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia and/or taking fentanyl, morphine, or methadone.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111Dk73k]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Supporting Rationale

Benzodiazepines and opioids both cause central nervous system depression, and benzodiazepines can potentiate opioid-induced decreases in respiratory drive. Epidemiologic studies find concurrent benzodiazepine use in large proportions of opioid-related overdose deaths. The clinical evidence reviews identified three cohort studies that found an association between concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids versus opioids alone and increased risk for overdose. A case-cohort study found concurrent benzodiazepine prescription with opioid prescription to be associated with a near-quadrupling of risk for overdose death compared with opioid prescription alone. The clinical evidence reviews did not find studies evaluating the effectiveness of avoiding coprescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids on risk for overdose. The clinical evidence reviews identified three observational studies that found an association between concurrent use of gabapentinoids and opioids versus opioids alone and increased risk for overdose, with higher risks at increased gabapentinoid doses.

Experts from OWG noted that rather than necessarily being a direct cause of overdose, benzodiazepines might serve as a marker of risk for overdose because of underlying conditions, in specific situations benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and that stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing. In addition, experts noted that long-term, stable use might be safer than erratic, unpredictable use. Because of these considerations, multiple experts indicated that recommending extreme caution with concurrent prescription of opioid pain medications and benzodiazepines was more appropriate than a recommendation to avoid prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and that category B would be more appropriate than category A for this recommendation.

Although in certain circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient receiving benzodiazepines (e.g. severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dosage benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, because other central nervous system depressants (e.g. muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin) can potentiate respiratory depression associated with opioids, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent use of these medications. Clinicians should check PDMPs for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants.

### Evaluating the impact of prescribed versus nonprescribed benzodiazepine use in methadone maintenance therapy: results from a population-based retrospective cohort study [^11696T1w]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Benzodiazepine (BZD) use is common in patients who are engaged in methadone as a treatment for opioid use disorder. BZD prescribing is generally discouraged for this patient population due to the increased risk of BZD dependence and BZD use disorder, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) discontinuation, and opioid-overdose death. However, some patients have concurrent mental health disorders, where BZD use may be clinically indicated. This study evaluates the impact of prescribed BZD on MAT outcomes.

Methods

Linking urine drug screening data (UDS) and prescribing information from single-payer health records, we conducted a retrospective Kaplan-Meier analysis between patients using prescribed and nonprescribed BZD with methadone treatment retention as the primary outcome. Data are from a network of 52 outpatient clinics in Ontario, Canada, between January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2013.

Results

We identified 3692 patients initiating methadone-assisted treatment for the first time; 76% were BZD-/UDS- (no BZD prescription and < 30% screens positive for BZD); 13% were BZD+/UDS-; 6% BZD-/UDS+; and 6% BZD+/UDS+. Using 1-year treatment retention as a primary outcome, patients using nonprescribed BZD (BZD-/UDS+) were twice as likely (adjusted odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.53) to discontinue treatment as those not using BZD (BZD-/UDS-), or those using BZD in a prescribed manner (BZD+/UDS+).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that prescribed BZD can be used during methadone MAT without impacting a patient's retention in MAT, but nonprescribed BZD use is predictive of treatment discontinuation. Importantly, we urge both the physician and patient to seek alternative clinical options to BZD prescribing, due to the potential for developing physical dependence (and BZD use disorder) to BZD and the risks of negative interactions with opioids.

Recommendations for Patients Co-prescribed Benzodiazepines and Opioids

16 Because patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing at least every 3 months or with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal, whichever is more frequent (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
17 Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
18 Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risk, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders

19 Clinicians should consider more frequent assessments of the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing for patients with co-occurring SUDs and/or other co-occurring addictions (e.g. behavioral addictions) compared with the general guidance in Recommendation 1 (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
20 When tapering BZD medication in patients with SUD, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD concurrently with the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
21 Clinicians should not use BZD prescribing or tapering considerations as a reason to discontinue or disrupt a patient's medications for SUD treatment, including buprenorphine and methadone (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
22 Following the taper, clinicians should continue to monitor and treat any underlying SUDs or refer patients to an appropriate level of care for continuing care (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
23 Clinicians should offer patients harm reduction services or provide them with referrals to access these services (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) and provide or refer patients for related education (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians can consider providing or referring patients to community services for drug checking or other safe use supplies (e.g. fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, sterile syringes) and related education (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Intersection of benzodiazepines (BZDs) with the opioid overdose epidemic — co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids; given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^113q6TCo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Patients co-prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids — implementation and risk assessment: Prior to initiating a BZD taper for patients who are co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, clinicians should seek to coordinate care with other clinicians who are prescribing BZDs or opioids to a given patient and may consult the PDMP. Clinicians should conduct risk–benefit assessments more often when patients have additional risk factors for adverse events related to concurrent BZD and opioid use, with additional risk factors including having an SUD, a bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia and/or taking fentanyl, morphine, or methadone. Patients prescribed both opioids and BZD comprise a high-risk population, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and BZDs concurrently and consider whether the risks of concurrent use of opioids with other CNS depressants outweigh the benefits, and use of BZDs is not a reason to withhold or suspend treatment with methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). As discussed in Recommendation 1, the CCG recommends that clinicians conduct risk–benefit assessments periodically and with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal, whichever is sooner, and the Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) is a tool that can be used for this purpose.

### Challenges of diagnosing and managing designer benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal: a case report [^112YJdkd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the last 10 years, an increasing number of unregulated novel psychoactive substances, including "designer benzodiazepines" (DBZDs), have emerged on the recreational drug market. Despite the rapidly increasing usage of DBZDs, there is a significant lack of information regarding clinical management. Here we present a case illustrating the difficulties of diagnosing and managing DBZD related sedative-hypnotic use disorder.

Case Presentation

Our patient is a 30-year-old man with severe opioid and sedative-hypnotic use disorders. He had a 10-year history of using heroin, clonazolam, and alprazolam. He stopped using heroin when on methadone maintenance therapy but continued using clonazolam and nonprescribed alprazolam. His opioid treatment program discontinued methadone due to benzodiazepine intoxication, and he returned to heroin use. He then presented for residential withdrawal management where he underwent successful buprenorphine induction and benzodiazepine withdrawal management. During a 3-month period of benzodiazepine abstinence, he struggled with ongoing cravings and post-acute withdrawal syndrome, ultimately leading to return to DBZD use.

Discussion

Despite the increasing prevalence of DBZD use, the usage of DBZDs is likely under-recognized because these compounds are generally not included on standard in-office urine drug immunoassay tests. Initial studies suggest that DBZDs have high potencies, shorter half-lives, are more addictive, and can result in more severe withdrawal symptoms compared to known benzodiazepines. However, there remains a lack of information about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DBZDs, making clinical management for DBZD related sedative-hypnotic use disorders challenging to treat.

### Treating benzodiazepine withdrawal in a bridge clinic [^115xLyyP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths are rising, driven by increasing use of nonprescribed benzodiazepine pills. For patients who wish to stop nonprescribed benzodiazepine use, rapid inpatient tapers are typically the only option to treat benzodiazepine withdrawal. Substance use disorder bridge clinics can provide the high-touch care needed to manage outpatient benzodiazepine tapers in patients at high risk due to other substance use disorders.

Objective

Describe the implementation and short-term outcomes of an outpatient benzodiazepine taper protocol to treat benzodiazepine withdrawal in a substance use disorder bridge clinic.

Methods

The clinical team developed a 4- to 6-week intensive outpatient taper protocol using diazepam. Patients with benzodiazepine use disorder were eligible if they had benzodiazepine withdrawal, lacked a prescriber, wanted to stop benzodiazepines completely, and agreed to daily visits. For patients who initiated a taper between April 2021 and December 2022, we evaluated the proportion of patients who completed a taper (i.e., tapered to a last prescribed dose of diazepam 10 mg/d or less); likelihood of remaining on the taper over time; and seizure, overdose, or death documented at the study institution during or within 1 month of taper completion or discontinuation. Other secondary outcomes included HIV testing and prevention, hepatitis C testing, and referrals to recovery coaching or psychiatry.

Results

Fifty-four patients initiated a total of 60 benzodiazepine tapers. The population was mostly male (61%) and non-Hispanic White (85%). Nearly all patients had opioid use disorder (96%), and most (80%) were taking methadone or buprenorphine for opioid use disorder before starting the taper. Patients reported using multiple substances in addition to benzodiazepines, most commonly fentanyl (75%), followed by cocaine (41%) and methamphetamine (21%). Fourteen patients (23%) completed a taper with a median duration of 34 days (IQR 27.8–43.5). Most tapers were stopped when the patient was lost to follow-up (57%), or the team recommended inpatient care (18%). Two patients had a seizure, and 4 had a presumed opioid-involved overdose during or within 1 month after the last taper visit, all individuals who did not complete a taper. No deaths occurred during or within 1 month of taper completion or discontinuation. Challenges included frequent loss to follow-up in the setting of other unstable substance use. Patients received other high-priority care during the taper including HIV testing (32%), PrEP initiation (6.7%), hepatitis C testing (30%), and referrals to recovery coaches (18%) and psychiatry (6.7%).

Conclusions

Managing benzodiazepine withdrawal with a 4- to 6-week intensive outpatient taper in patients with benzodiazepine and opioid use disorders is challenging. More work is needed to refine patient selection, balance safety risks with feasibility, and study long-term, patient-centered outcomes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112Wp76S]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — patients who take opioids: Patients who are on chronic opioid medication (opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder or pain) should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression; similarly, patients taking sedative-hypnotic medications exhibit tolerance to benzodiazepines and should be monitored closely for appropriate dose. For patients with concurrent alcohol withdrawal and opioid use disorder, stabilize opioid use disorder (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with treating alcohol withdrawal.

### Systematic assessment of non-medical use of prescription drugs using doctor-shopping indicators: a nation-wide, repeated cross-sectional study [^114Rx6d5]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to present the first nation-wide, systematic, repeated assessment of doctor-shopping (i.e. visiting multiple physicians to be prescribed the same drug) during 10 years for more than 200 psychoactive prescription drugs in the 67 million inhabitants in France.

Design

This was a nation-wide, repeated cross-sectional study.

Setting and Participants

Data are from the French National Health Data System in 2010, 2015 and 2019 for 214 psychoactive prescription drugs (i.e. anaesthetics, analgesics, antiepileptics, anti-Parkinson drugs, psycholeptics, psychoanaleptics, other nervous system drugs and antihistamines for systemic use).

Measurements

The detection and quantification of doctor-shopping relied upon an algorithm that detects overlapping prescriptions from repeated visits to different physicians. We used two doctor-shopping indicators aggregated at population level for each drug dispensed to more than 5000 patients: (i) the quantity doctor-shopped, expressed in defined daily doses (DDD), which measures the total quantity doctor-shopped by the study population for a given drug; and (ii) the proportion doctor-shopped, expressed as a percentage, which standardizes the quantity doctor-shopped according to the use level of the drug.

Findings

The analyses included approximately 200 million dispensings to approximately 30 million patients each year. Opioids (e.g. buprenorphine, methadone, morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl), benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) (e.g. diazepam, oxazepam, zolpidem and clonazepam) had the highest proportions doctor-shopped during the study period. In most cases, the proportion and the quantity doctor-shopped increased for opioids and decreased for benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Pregabalin had the sharpest increase in the proportion doctor-shopped (from 0.28 to 1.40%), in parallel with a sharp increase in the quantity doctor-shopped (+843%, from 0.7 to 6.6 DDD/100000 inhabitants/day). Oxycodone had the sharpest increase in the quantity doctor-shopped (+1000%, from 0.1 to 1.1 DDD/100000 inhabitants/day), in parallel with a sharp increase in the proportion doctor-shopped (from 0.71 to 1.41%). Detailed results for all drugs during the study period can be explored interactively at: https://soeiro.gitlab.io/megadose/.

Conclusions

In France, doctor-shopping occurs for many drugs from many pharmacological classes, and mainly involves opioid maintenance drugs, some opioids analgesics, some benzodiazepines and Z-drugs and pregabalin.

### Clonazepam [^116i2r8F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids:

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe clonazepam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clonazepam is used with opioids (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction:

The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse).

Before prescribing clonazepam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of clonazepam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, have been reported during initiation and conversion of patients to methadone, and even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Proper dosing and titration are essential and DISKETS Dispersible Tablets should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of DISKETS Dispersible Tablets or following a dose increase. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak pharmacologic effect, especially during the initial dosing period.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants,

including alcohol, is a risk factor for respiratory depression and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

Reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants in patients in methadone treatment to those for whom alternatives to benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are inadequate.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation and consider delaying or omitting daily methadone dosing.

Box 2 note of caution — avoid misapplication of this Guideline explains that clinical practice guidelines can have unintended impacts on clinical decision-making and that misapplication of the 2016 CDC opioid recommendations led some prescribers to abruptly discontinue pain medications without first developing a plan for safe tapering, putting patients at risk of withdrawal and potential transition to illegally obtained opioids. It warns that abrupt discontinuation of BZDs confers similar and additional risks: rapid BZD dose reduction can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and delirium and potential destabilization of existing mental health conditions, especially in those taking long-term BZDs and at higher doses. It states that BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and that clinicians and healthcare systems should carefully consider how to meet the needs of patients requiring BZD tapering, including those who experience significant challenges during the tapering process.

Co-occurring sedatives/benzodiazepines and level of care — treatment should not be withheld; monitoring and caution are advised: Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and opportunities for treatment retention versus risks of diversion when determining whether treatment in an OTP or OBOT is more suitable. Patients with co-occurring alcohol, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder may need a more intensive level of care than can be provided in an office-based setting; however, treatment services should not be withheld if intensive care is not accessible or acceptable, and in these cases, the patient should be carefully monitored. The use of benzodiazepines and other sedative-hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend treatment; although combined use increases the risk of serious side effects, the harms from untreated opioid use disorder can outweigh these risks, so a risk-benefit analysis should be conducted with greater support and careful medication management, and prescribing benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotics should be used with caution, particularly for patients prescribed methadone or buprenorphine.

### Urine drug tests: ordering and interpreting results [^113S2bvy]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Urine drug testing is an essential component of monitoring patients who are receiving long-term opioid therapy, and it has been suggested for patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine or stimulant therapy. Family physicians should be familiar with the characteristics and capabilities of screening and confirmatory drug tests. Immunoassays are qualitative tests used for initial screening of urine samples. They can give false-positive and false-negative results, so all results are considered presumptive until confirmatory testing is performed. Immunoassays for opioids may not detect commonly prescribed semisynthetic and synthetic opioids such as methadone and fentanyl; similarly, immunoassays for benzodiazepines may not detect alprazolam or clonazepam. Immunoassays can cross-react with other medications and give false-positive results, which have important implications for a patient's pain treatment plan. False-negative results can cause missed opportunities to detect misuse. Urine samples can be adulterated with other substances to mask positive results on urine drug testing. Family physicians must be familiar with these substances, the methods to detect them, and their effects on urine drug testing.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate [^115tnRTa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants

Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, gabapentinoids, and other opioids) increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.

As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing an opioid overdose reversal agent, as is recommended for all patients on buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Effect of risk mitigation guidance opioid and stimulant dispensations on mortality and acute care visits during dual public health emergencies: retrospective cohort study [^117ECwT2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

At the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, new policies and interventions were rapidly developed to support public health measures. The first iteration of Risk Mitigation Guidance (RMG) was issued by the British Columbia Ministry of Health and British Columbia Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU) on 26 March 2020. The RMG provided clinical guidance to physicians and nurse practitioners about prescribing select medications to people at risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection in the interest of reducing harm from exposure to the illegal drug supply. The practice of prescribing pharmaceutical alternatives to the illegal drug market is commonly known as "prescribed safer supply". The RMG referenced existing BCCSU guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder and suggested additional or alternative medications that could be prescribed to people who decline treatment for opioid use disorder, who use illegal opioids but do not meet criteria for opioid use disorder, or who use substances other than opioids. The substances listed in the first iteration of the RMG included opioids (tablet hydromorphone, oral morphine), stimulants (dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate), benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam), and alcohol withdrawal management medications (carbamazepine, gabapentin, clonidine). Publicly funded health insurance coverage for these medications is available for eligible residents of British Columbia. The RMG was initially focused on supporting people experiencing withdrawal due to public health quarantine and isolation protocols. On 15 July 2021, the Province of British Columbia released a provincial Prescribed Safer Supply policy that extended prescribing outside the covid-19 pandemic. The RMG was the first known clinical guidance issued by a provincial or state government in North America to support physicians and nurse practitioners in prescribing alternatives to the illegal drug supply.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^114uZm5N]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal and opioid use disorder (OUD) — Safety warnings emphasize that concurrent use of methadone or buprenorphine with alcohol or benzodiazepines increases respiratory depression risk, but concurrent treatment with benzodiazepines should not be a reason to withhold buprenorphine or methadone and increased monitoring may be appropriate; naltrexone is not approved by the FDA for withdrawal management, does not relieve withdrawal symptoms, and cannot be administered until patients are free of short-acting opioids for at least 7–10 days or 10–14 days for long-acting opioids, and failing to observe these wait periods may cause precipitated withdrawal; anesthesia-assisted opioid detoxification or ultra-rapid opioid detoxification has been associated with serious complications and is not recommended.

Benzodiazepine tapering in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) — clinicians should consider more frequent assessments of the risks and benefits of continued use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) for patients with co-occurring SUDs and/or other addictions; when tapering BZD medication in patients with SUD, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD concurrently with the BZD taper; clinicians should not use BZD prescribing or tapering considerations as a reason to discontinue or disrupt a patient's medications for SUD treatment, including buprenorphine and methadone; following the taper, clinicians should continue to monitor and treat the underlying SUDs or refer patients to an appropriate level of care for continuing care. Each of these statements is labeled "Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112Jkbhm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

WARNING: LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION,
LIFE-THREATENING QT PROLONGATION, ACCIDENTAL INGESTION, ABUSE POTENTIAL,
INTERACTIONS WITH DRUGS AFFECTING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES and TREATMENT FOR
OPIOID ADDICTION

Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, have been reported during initiation and conversion of patients to methadone, and even when the drug has been used as recommended and not misused or abused [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Proper dosing and titration are essential and methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable in the use of methadone for detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid addiction. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of methadone hydrochloride tablets for oral suspension or following a dose increase. The peak respiratory depressant effect of methadone occurs later, and persists longer than the peak pharmacologic effect, especially during the initial dosing period.

Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, is a risk factor for respiratory depression and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

Reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants in patients in methadone treatment to those for whom alternatives to benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are inadequate.
Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If the patient is visibly sedated, evaluate the cause of sedation and consider delaying or omitting daily methadone dosing.

### FDA urges caution about withholding opioid addiction medications… [^1158e4Nc]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

- Buprenorphine and methadone relieve the withdrawal symptoms and psychological cravings experienced by patients addicted to opioids. 5
- Methadone to treat opioid addiction is dispensed only at specially licensed treatment centers.
- Methadone is marketed under the brand names Diskets, Dolophine, and Methadose, and also as generics. Methadone is available as a tablet, liquid, and wafer.
- A physician must complete training in order to be qualified to prescribe or dispense buprenorphine to treat addiction.
- If you are taking buprenorphine or methadone to treat opioid addiction or dependence, take care when combining these drugs with benzodiazepines or other sedatives to treat anxiety or insomnia. Taking both of these types of medicines can result in serious side effects, including overdose and death.

These serious side effects result because buprenorphine, methadone, and benzodiazepines all impact the central nervous system. The CNS controls most of the functions of the body, including breathing.
- Although concomitant use of buprenorphine or methadone with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions, including overdose and death, creating barriers to MAT can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder.
- As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine or methadone treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, other prescribed opioid analgesics, alcohol, and illicit drugs.
- Current evidence does not support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine or methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant use in MAT-treated patients.

However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine or methadone dosing, a health care professional should evaluate the cause of sedation. Omitting or decreasing the dose of buprenorphine or methadone may be appropriate. 3 noted that patients receiving MAT were commonly dispensed a benzodiazepine prescription. The median percent of patients who received concomitant methadone or buprenorphine prescriptions was 13. 3 percent and
20. 2 percent across multiple U. S. regions, respectively.

Emergency department opioid withdrawal — benefits and harms of implementing the recommendations include the following: Adequate treatment of significant opioid withdrawal with the potential for engaging in medication for addiction treatment (also referred to as medications for OUD, or, historically, medical/medication-assisted treatment) for OUD. Potential harms include potential precipitation of opioid withdrawal after receiving buprenorphine in a patient not yet showing signs/symptoms of withdrawal, although this can be overcome with sufficient buprenorphine dosing; adverse effects of buprenorphine including the potential for respiratory depression, which is rare unless the patient is also receiving sedatives/hypnotics such as benzodiazepines; and a possible increased risk of opioid toxicity after methadone if discharged and additional opioids are used, which is not present with buprenorphine therapy because of its μ-receptor affinity and partial agonist activity resulting in a ceiling on respiratory depression.

### "Should patients with substance use disorders Be prescribed benzodiazepines? " No [^112bsJS7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) should not use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, insomnia, or anything else, for the same reasons that they should not drink any alcohol or use other drugs, regardless of their primary drug used. Once the addiction "switch" is thrown on, it never again goes off. This question has additional relevance today because in 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration put black box warnings on all benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics about the serious risks associated with their concomitant use. Anxiety is not a benzodiazepine-deficiency disease. It is possible to treat anxiety and insomnia without medicines of any kind, and it is possible to use medicines other than benzodiazepines for these common and serious mental disorders. Although many patients with SUDs are eager to use benzodiazepines, using alternatives is often effective and it does not put the patient's recovery in jeopardy. The standard I propose here is based on the experience of many people with SUDs who have tried and failed to use benzodiazepines for anxiety.

POPULATION-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

Patients Co-prescribed Benzodiazepines and Opioids

Recommendations for Patients Co-prescribed Benzodiazepines and Opioids
16 Because all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal and at least every 3 months (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
17 Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
18 Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risk, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to initiating a BZD taper for patients who are co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, clinicians should seek to coordinate care with other clinicians who are prescribing BZDs or opioids to a given patient. This may entail obtaining releases or other agreements for clinicians to contact other prescribers and/or consulting the PDMP.
Clinicians should conduct risk–benefit assessments more often when patients have additional risk factors for adverse events related to concurrent BZD and opioid use. Additional risk factors may include but are not limited to having an SUD, a bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia and/or taking fentanyl, morphine, or methadone.

Rationale

Although not generally recommended, patients with chronic pain are commonly prescribed BZD and opioid medication for pain management concurrently. Patients prescribed this combination of medications tend to be on relatively higher doses of opioids and report higher levels of pain and lower self-efficacy for pain management. They also have greater healthcare utilization, especially ED visits. Finally, these patients are at greater risk of nonmedical substance use and co-occurring psychiatric conditions compared to patients who are prescribed opioids but have never used BZDs.

Patients taking both opioids and BZDs may be prescribed these medications by different clinicians. When the risks associated with the combined use of these medications outweigh the benefits, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients to determine which medication to taper. Prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with patients' other prescribers. The CGC noted that reaching other clinicians may be challenging. Clinicians can consider coordinating with payers or pharmacies, as they may have alternative mechanisms for communicating with other clinicians involved in a patient's care.

### Methadone at tapered doses for the management of opioid withdrawal [^1128dAHW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use in many countries of tapered methadone for detoxification from opiate dependence, the evidence of efficacy to prevent relapse and promote lifestyle change has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To determine whether tapered methadone is effective to manage withdrawal from opioids.

Search Strategy

We searched: the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2000), MEDLINE (OVID 1966–2000), EMBASE (1980–2000); scan of reference list of relevant articles; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials from pharmaceutical industry; Internet (NIDA, Clinical Trials.org, BMJ).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which focus on the use of tapered methadone (length of treatment max 30 days) versus all other pharmacological detoxification treatments, placebo and different modalities of methadone detoxification programs for the treatment of opiate withdrawal. Trials including patients with additional diagnoses such as benzodiazepine dependence were also eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer (LA) assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between reviewers. Qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies were carried out using validated checklists. Where possible analysis was carried out according to the "intention to treat" principles.

Main Results

20 studies were included in the review, with 1357 people randomised. 10 studies compared methadone with adrenergic agonists, 7 studies compared different modalities of methadone detoxification, 2 studies compared methadone with other opioid agonists, 1 study compared methadone with chlordiazepoxide one with placebo. The conclusions of the 10 studies that compared methadone with adrenergic agonists showed no substantial clinical difference of the two treatments in terms of retention in treatment, degree of discomfort and detoxification success rates. The conclusions of the 6 studies that compare different methadone reduction schedules, showed that different types of methadone withdrawal schedule produce different responses in terms of time course of withdrawal, the severity of withdrawal response and possibly in terms of subsequent engagement with treatment. Regarding the studies that compare methadone with other opioid agonists, in Sorensen 1982 methadyl acetate performed similarly to methadone on most process and outcome measures, while in Tennant 1975, methadone reduced severity of withdrawal and had fewer drop-outs than did a propoxyphene group. In Drummond 1989, using chlordiazepoxide vs methadone, the results suggest that the two drugs had similar results in terms of overall effectiveness. San 1992 compared methadone with placebo and found more severe withdrawal and more drop outs in the placebo group. The results indicate that tapered methadone and other medications used in the included studies are effective in the treatment of the heroin withdrawal syndrome, although symptoms experienced by subjects differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. It seems that regardless of which medication is selected for heroin detoxification, the rates of subsequent heroin abstinence are about equal. This suggests that the medications are similar in terms of overall effectiveness. Improvements were achieved when other services such as counseling and other supporting services were offered contemporaneously with detoxification.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to duration, design and treatment objectives, impairing the application of meta-analysis. Results of many outcomes could not be summarised because they were presented either in graphical form or provided only statistical tests and p-values. For most studies standard deviation for continuous variables were not provided. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long acting opioids, accompanied by medicaopioids, accompanied by medical supervision and ancillary medications can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. However this cannot be considered a goal for a detoxification as heroin dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder and the goal of detoxification should be to remove or reduce dependence on heroin in a controlled and human fashion and not a treatment for heroin dependence.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1144dv7s]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine dose conversion and transition emphasizes that determining the equivalent dose of an alternative BZD is inexact and can vary across patients; many conversion tools exist, but unlike with opioid medications no precise strategies for conversion exist; widely available equivalent doses were established based on average diazepam doses and patient experience should be considered when converting because some patients may require higher or lower doses than the reported equivalent; transition to an alternative BZD may be more successful if those doses are slowly transitioned over 1–2 weeks rather than 1–2 days.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^114z4FwX]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing — analytical performance of presumptive opiate and benzodiazepine immunoassays highlights cross-reactivity and missed detections. "For example, opiate IA, often derived from morphine, exhibits varying cross-reactivity with different opioids, potentially leading to false positives or negatives". "Semisynthetic opioids like hydromorphone and hydrocodone may trigger positive immunoassay results, while oxycodone and oxymorphone are typically undetected, even with a 300 ng/mL cutoff", and "Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone generally escape detection via opiate immunoassay testing". For benzodiazepines, assays "formulated for oxazepam and older benzodiazepines like diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, may yield false negatives for newer benzodiazepines like clonazepam and lorazepam", and "This can require more specialized testing to confirm the absence or presence of these drugs". Regarding novel substances, "Most commercially available immunoassay reagents are ill-suited for detecting designer drugs, including psychedelic phenethylamines, even at high concentrations", and "Synthetic and designer drugs, designed to evade detection, demand definitive testing for identification".

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^1123yNmc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at admission to methadone treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of methadone as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in methadone-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of methadone dosing, ensure that a medically-trained healthcare provider evaluates the cause of sedation, and delays or omits the methadone dose if appropriate.

Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.

For patients in methadone treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's methadone treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.

If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in methadone treatment for opioid use disorder [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)].

In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking the medications prescribed and not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^113soaQK]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Polysubstance use disorder — benzodiazepines or other sedative medications increase the risk for respiratory depression in patients who are taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). While the combined use of these medications increases this risk, the harm caused by untreated opioid withdrawal, OUD, or alcohol withdrawal outweighs these risks, and consulting with an addiction specialist physician may be helpful in determining an appropriate approach to complex polysubstance use withdrawal. Patients who are taking opioid medication for OUD or pain should be monitored closely when benzodiazepines are prescribed due to the increased risk of respiratory depression. Patients with concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome should be stabilized on buprenorphine or methadone and a benzodiazepine, prior to tapering benzodiazepines. For patients with co-occurring alcohol withdrawal and OUD, stabilize the OUD (e.g., with methadone or buprenorphine) concomitantly with alcohol withdrawal management.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115WUMUG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Assessing risks and benefits of continued benzodiazepine prescribing — clinicians should review BZD use frequently for patients with a history of substance use disorders (SUDs), recognize higher morbidity and mortality risks when BZDs co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD) or opioid use disorder (OUD) due to CNS and respiratory depressant effects, and should carefully consider these risks when deciding on continued BZD prescribing.

---

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ZBJTc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e. ≥ 120 days) is common. Long-term BZD use is associated with an increased risk of physical dependence and withdrawal and ongoing risk of adverse events such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive impairment.– Evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk, although the mechanism for this association is not well understood. The risk–benefit balance for continued BZD use may shift over time, and stopping can be challenging because physical dependence develops with regular use. It should be noted that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with the use of prescribed BZDs and is distinct from substance use disorders (SUDs; see Box 1). Older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use. Some older adults have taken BZDs continuously for decades. In some instances, use has been so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Box 1
Physical Dependence Versus Substance Use Disorder

Safe tapering of BZDs can be clinically complex because rapid dosage reductions may precipitate acute withdrawal, which can be life-threatening. Patients are also at risk of recurrence and exacerbation of the symptoms for which BZDs were initially prescribed (e.g. anxiety, seizures, insomnia) and destabilization. This Guideline was motivated, in part, by patients reporting harms associated with too rapid tapering/discontinuation of BZD medications. Inadequate tapering strategies may push patients to the illegal drug market, where counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSOs) are common, presenting an increased risk of overdose and overdose death. This Guideline aims to help clinicians in diverse practice settings determine whether and how to taper BZD medications.

Intersection with the Opioid Overdose Epidemic

Co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids. In addition, some individuals may concomitantly take BZDs and opioids to augment the effects of both substances.

Given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose. – In 2021, 13.7% of overdose deaths in the USA involving opioids also involved BZDs, and nearly 88% of overdose deaths involving BZDs also involved opioids.

### Are prescription opioids driving the opioid crisis? Assumptions vs facts [^117EuPiH]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) contributed to 31% of opioid analgesic fatalities in 2011 (vs 18.4% in 2004), according to the CDC, but this may understate their true contribution. A Canadian study evaluated 607,156 people aged 15–64 years. Of those prescribed opioids for pain who died of opioid analgesic toxicity, coprescribed BZDs were detected at death in 84.5%. In a statewide study of 2,182,374 North Carolina residents who received one or more opioid analgesic prescriptions in 2010, BZDs were present in 61.4% who fatally overdosed on their prescribed opioid. Compared with opioid OD alone, opioid + BZD OD rates were 2.8 times greater in persons taking < 75.0 mg/d in morphine-equivalent dose (MED) and 45.8 times greater in those taking > 300 mg/d MED. In contrast to opioid analgesics, dispensed BZD prescriptions increased 226% from 2009 (40.9 million) to 2014 (133.4 million). Increases were comparable for the top three prescribed BZDs (alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam).

In 2014, alcohol contributed to OD deaths where the following opioids were present: fentanyl (12.2%), heroin (20.7%), hydrocodone (17.2%), morphine (13.0%), and oxycodone (16.7%). Alcohol contribution to opioid OD deaths is likely underestimated. Concurrent heroin and prescription opioid detection by toxicology testing in fatal overdose creates uncertainty over the relative contribution of each agent to death. In such cases, the OD is recorded as both a prescription opioid OD and a heroin OD.

Between 2000 and 2010, when fatal respiratory depression occurred, it typically developed during the first five days of opioid therapy initiation, with the highest rates in the initial 24 hours. Opioid initiation at too high a starting dose, or failure to consider other risk factors for respiratory depression such as coprescribed CNS sedatives, indicate prescriber knowledge deficits. Also during 2000–2010, equianalgesic dose tables (EDT) were commonly used in opioid switching to determine dose equivalence between original and replacement opioids. EDT use increased as more patients with chronic pain were prescribed opioids. With EDT calculations generally based upon observations in opioid-naïve postsurgical patients administered single-dose opioids and other flaws and limitations, EDT use was associated with increased fatal opioid toxicity.

### Drug safety communication… [^1116iGKZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Announcement Based on our additional review, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration is advising that the opioid addiction medications buprenorphine and methadone should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other drugs that depress the central nervous system. The combined use of these drugs increases the risk of. Health care professionals should take several actions and precautions and develop a treatment plan when buprenorphine or methadone is used in combination with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants. These include:

- Educating patients about the serious risks of combined use, including overdose and death, that can occur with CNS depressants even when used as prescribed, as. carisoprodol Soma, Soma Compound, Soma Compound w/ codeine chlorzoxazone No brand name currently marketed cyclobenzaprine Amrix.

Additional Information for Health Care Professionals
- The medication assisted treatment drugs for opioid use disorder buprenorphine or methadone should not be categorically denied to patients taking benzodiazepines or other central nervous system depressants.
- Although concomitant use of buprenorphine or methadone with benzodiazepines. the time of buprenorphine or methadone dosing, a health care professional should evaluate the cause of sedation. Omitting or decreasing the dose of buprenorphine or methadone may be appropriate.
- Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases. of concomitant use with MAT medicines. In some cases, monitoring at a higher level of care for tapering may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering off a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose is appropriate.

Harm reduction during benzodiazepine tapering — clinicians should offer patients harm reduction services or provide referrals; clinicians should provide opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) and related education (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation); clinicians can consider providing drug checking or other safe use supplies (e.g., fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, sterile syringes) and related education (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
