## Question

A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of fever, fatigue, and productive cough for the past 2 days. He had similar symptoms 6 months ago when he was diagnosed with pneumonia. Three weeks ago, he was diagnosed with otitis media for the 6th time since birth and was treated with amoxicillin. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), the pulse is 130/min, the respirations are 36/min, and the blood pressure is 84/40 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Examination shows purulent discharge in the left ear canal and hypoplastic tonsils without exudate. Coarse crackles are heard over the right lung field on auscultation. An X-ray of the chest shows a right-middle lobe consolidation. Flow cytometry shows absent B cells and normal T cells. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. Intravenous immunoglobulins
B. Recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration
C. Stem cell transplantation
D. Thymus transplantation

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management step is most appropriate for a 2-year-old boy with recurrent otitis media, recurrent pneumonia, absent B cells, and normal T cells. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely immunologic diagnosis and whether the pattern fits X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care treatment for that condition. Next, I will examine why the alternative options are incorrect or not first-line. Finally, I will confirm dosing and monitoring considerations to ensure the plan is complete and safe.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. Absent B cells with normal T cells in a boy with recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary and ear infections is classic for X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which results from BTK mutations that arrest pre–B-cell development and cause profound hypogammaglobulinemia after maternal IgG wanes. Hypoplastic tonsils are a supportive clinical clue, and delayed diagnosis is common, so I should not be surprised by the history of repeated infections before recognition [^852a971e] [^a11a53b8] [^bb84de66].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate management priority. The cornerstone of therapy for XLA is immunoglobulin replacement to restore opsonic and neutralizing antibodies, which reduces infection frequency and severity and prevents end-organ damage such as bronchiectasis. Case series and contemporary cohorts consistently show improved outcomes with IVIG, and guidelines endorse IgG replacement as standard care in primary antibody deficiencies including XLA, with typical starting doses of 400–600 mg/kg every 3–4 weeks and titration to maintain trough IgG at or above 8 g/L, often higher in patients with ongoing infections or bronchiectasis [^d148122a] [^99817dfe] [^e148505d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the alternatives. Recombinant G-CSF treats neutropenia, but there is no neutropenia here, so G-CSF would not address the B-cell defect and is inappropriate. Stem cell transplantation is curative for some primary immunodeficiencies, but for XLA it is not first-line because IVIG is effective and safer; transplant is reserved for refractory cases or when complications emerge, not as initial therapy. Thymus transplantation relates to T-cell defects, not isolated B-cell failure, so it does not fit this phenotype and is not indicated here [^852a971e].

> I should double-check dosing and monitoring details to make the plan actionable. A reasonable starting regimen is IVIG 400–600 mg/kg every 4 weeks, with a trough IgG target of at least 8 g/L and consideration of 10 g/L in those with bronchiectasis or persistent infections. After initiating therapy, reassess infection frequency and IgG troughs after about 3 months and adjust the dose or interval accordingly, which aligns with consensus guidance for primary antibody deficiencies and real-world XLA management [^99817dfe] [^e148505d].

> But wait, what if the presentation reflects a secondary hypogammaglobulinemia rather than a primary B-cell defect? The flow cytometry showing absent B cells argues strongly against secondary causes, which typically show normal B-cell numbers even when IgG is low; thus, the phenotype is most consistent with XLA, and IVIG remains the correct first-line therapy rather than pursuing secondary etiologies or non–B-cell–directed interventions [^852a971e].

> In summary, I need to ensure the management matches the biology. The most appropriate next step is intravenous immunoglobulin to replace missing antibodies, with standard pediatric dosing and monitoring to achieve protective troughs and reduce recurrent infections, while reserving transplant and other modalities for select refractory scenarios. Therefore, the correct choice is A. Intravenous immunoglobulins [^d148122a] [^99817dfe] [^b4d64281].

---

The most appropriate next step is **intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)** [^d148122a] because the child has absent B cells with normal T cells, consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) [^852a971e], and IVIG is the standard replacement therapy to prevent recurrent bacterial infections [^d148122a]. Stem cell transplantation is not first-line [^852a971e], thymus transplantation is irrelevant (T cells are normal), and G-CSF is not indicated (no neutropenia).

---

## Clinical reasoning and diagnosis

- **Absent B cells with normal T cells**: This pattern is classic for XLA, a primary B-cell defect causing hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent bacterial infections [^852a971e] [^a11a53b8].

- **Recurrent otitis media and pneumonia**: Typical for XLA due to impaired antibody production [^a11a53b8] [^bb84de66].

- **Hypoplastic tonsils**: Supportive of XLA, as B-cell–dependent lymphoid tissue is underdeveloped [^a11a53b8] [^ef063b0a].

---

## Management of X-linked agammaglobulinemia

- **IVIG replacement**: Standard therapy to restore antibody levels, reduce infection frequency, and prevent complications like bronchiectasis [^d148122a] [^99817dfe].

- **Dosing and targets**: Typical starting dose is 400–600 mg/kg every 3–4 weeks, with trough IgG targets ≥ 8 g/L; higher targets (≥ 10 g/L) may be needed in patients with bronchiectasis or persistent infections [^99817dfe] [^e148505d].

- **Monitoring**: Adjust dose to maintain protective IgG levels and minimize infections [^99817dfe].

---

## Why other options are inappropriate

- **Stem cell transplantation**: Reserved for refractory cases or severe complications; not first-line for XLA [^notfound].

- **Thymus transplantation**: Used for T-cell defects (e.g. DiGeorge); T cells are normal here [^ebfc5bc6].

- **G-CSF**: Indicated for neutropenia; there is no neutropenia in XLA [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate IVIG replacement therapy** [^d148122a] to restore antibody function and prevent further infections, with ongoing monitoring and dose adjustment to maintain protective IgG levels [^99817dfe].

The child who has recurrent infections poses one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in pediatrics. The clinician faces a two-fold challenge in determining first whether the child is normal or has a serious disease, and then, in the latter case, how to confirm or exclude the diagnosis with the minimum number of the least invasive tests. It is hoped that, in the absence of good-quality evidence for most clinical scenarios, the experience-based approach described in this article may prove a useful guide to the clinician.

Recurrent infections in children are a cause for concern. It is essential to distinguish simple recurrent infections caused by exposures in the day care or school settings from those caused by inherent deficiencies in the immune system or other systemic diseases. Multiple diagnostic tools are available for the evaluation of recurrent infections. The sites of infections and organisms responsible are important in guiding clinicians in the appropriate laboratory work-up and diagnosis of these patients. Once a diagnosis is made, proper treatment and management decisions can be made to treat the patients appropriately and ensure their lifelong health.

Recurrent or persistent infection is the major manifestation of primary immunodeficiency, which also results in atypical infection with opportunistic organisms. Young children are also vulnerable to infection and recurrent infection is common. While most children with recurrent infection have a normal immunity, it is important to recognize the child with an underlying primary immunodeficiency and investigate and treat appropriately and yet not over investigate normal children. Prompt, accurate diagnosis directs the most appropriate treatment, and early and judicious use of prophylactic antibiotics and replacement immunoglobulin can prevent significant end organ damage and improve long-term outlook and quality of life. This paper describes important presenting features of primary immunodeficiency and indicates when further investigation is warranted.

22q11.2 deletion syndrome — recurrent infection risk and management — T‑lymphocyte immunodeficiency does not appear to translate into increased parasitic infection, and most pediatric patients do not require directed management of an immunodeficiency. Patients of all ages with 22q11.2DS have anatomic and physiologic predispositions to upper and lower respiratory tract infections with a propensity for recurrent or persistent otitis media, sinusitis, and pneumonia. The infectious agents are most likely those common in the community, and standard management regimens should be used; for severe, function‑impacting, or structurally complicated infections, referral to immunology may be warranted, and more aggressive management can include prophylactic antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or thymic transplantation.

### Sepsis with sacroiliitis in X-linked agammaglobulinaemia [^fa669baf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A boy under 5 years, with recurrent infections since 9 months of age, presented with fever and painful limping. Clinical examination revealed absent tonsils, antalgic gait and mild tenderness in the right hip joint. MRI of the pelvis demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the right sacroiliac joint, indicative of sacroiliitis. Blood cultures identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the causative organism. Immunological evaluation showed panhypogammaglobulinaemia and the absence of CD19-positive B cells in the lymphocyte subset analysis. Next-generation sequencing confirmed a hemizygous mutation (c.1256G > A variant) in the BTK gene at exon 14, establishing a diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). The child was managed with intravenous immunoglobulin and a 4-week course of antibiotics, resulting in clinical improvement. This case represents the first reported instance of P. aeruginosa sepsis associated with pyogenic sacroiliitis in a child with XLA, highlighting the need for vigilance in diagnosing rare infections in immunocompromised patients.

Results

Delayed diagnosis and severe recurrent bacterial infections

The clinical data collected prior to diagnosis are shown in Table 1. The mean age at onset and at diagnosis was 2.5 and 8 years, respectively. All patients showed recurrent infections; otitis media, pneumonia, and septicemia were universally observed, followed by sinusitis (2/4), bronchiectasis (2/4), arthritis (2/4), skin infection (2/4), meningitis (2/4), and recurrent diarrhea (1/4). Tonsils were absent or hypoplastic in all patients. Patients 1 and 2 had a positive family history. Their brothers died of recurrent infections at age of 6 and 9 years, respectively. No patients with a positive family history were screened for XLA before onset of infection.

Low levels of circulating B cells and immunoglobulins

As shown in Table 2, all patients exhibited very low serum immunoglobulin levels at diagnosis. No patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) substitution therapy before diagnosis. The percentage of circulating B cells was 0–1.9%. Based on these clinical and laboratory findings, our patients were clinically diagnosed with XLA. Neutropenia was observed in patient 4. The ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells was markedly inverted in patients 1 and 4.

Three novel and one reported mutations of the BTK gene

To confirm the diagnosis, mutation analysis of the BTK gene was performed (Table 3). Patients 1 and 3 were found to carry novel frameshift mutations, c.1770delG and c.1742delG, respectively. They were located in the SH1 domain. Patient 2 had a novel nonsense mutation (c.1249A > T), which was located in the SH2 domain. The prevalent silent polymorphism affecting (c.1899 C > T) was also observed in patient 2. Patient 4 carried a reported mutation (c.441G > A) in the TH domain.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^5dab2fb5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Immunodeficiency in adults is more prevalent than commonly recognized and often remains underdiagnosed due to its heterogeneous presentation. This review highlights the most frequent causes of adult-onset immunodeficiency and provides a structured approach to its evaluation. Early recognition and appropriate workup are crucial, as delayed diagnosis may lead to recurrent, severe, or opportunistic infections with significant morbidity. It is essential to emphasize that a normal initial workup does not exclude underlying immunodeficiency, particularly in high-risk patients. Therefore, individuals with recurrent infections, poor vaccine responses, or other clinical features suggestive of immune dysfunction should be referred to an immunology specialist for comprehensive assessment and tailored management. A multidisciplinary approach involving primary care providers, immunologists, infectious diseases physicians, and other specialists is key to optimizing patient outcomes and preventing long-term complication.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the immunological management of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and other defects in thymic development [^ebfc5bc6]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

These findings have led to the recommendation for patients with 22q11.2del to have periodic evaluations with a humoral immune assessment beginning at 8–10 months of age, regardless of whether earlier immune assessments are normal. Quantitative immunoglobulin assessments should be obtained earlier if the child has early onset of recurrent, unusual, refractory, or severe infections, keeping in mind that the IgG in an infant is predominantly maternally derived early in life, and an undetectable IgA level (< 6 mg/dL) is not considered abnormal in the first year of life. The workgroup recommends obtaining periodic humoral assessments along with a detailed clinical infection history initially every 5 years if clinically well regarding infections and then every 5–10 years. If the infection history is abnormal or if ongoing humoral assessments are abnormal, an additional and more comprehensive immune work-up should be performed and include assessment of capsular polysaccharide-specific responses.

Specific Antibody Responses

Similar to other primary immune deficiency disorders, in 22q11.2del, normal immunoglobulin levels do not exclude impaired specific antibody responses. In a study evaluating the frequency of impaired specific antibody response to pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens ages 4 to 22 years, 11 of 20 patients (55%) had an abnormal or poor response. All but one of these patients had IgG levels over 550 mg/dL, and 80% were experiencing recurrent infections. The frequency and severity of infections improved following prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole or IgG replacement therapy (IGRT), suggesting these abnormalities are more likely to be clinically significant. If capsular polysaccharide-specific responses are truly T cell independent, this would suggest an underlying defect in the B cell compartment, unrelated to any T cell abnormalities.

Infection Susceptibility

An estimated 35 to 40% of individuals with 22q11.2del experience recurrent infections. This increased incidence is likely multifactorial, related to anatomical variations, cellular or humoral immune deficiency, or both. In early childhood, prolonged viral respiratory infections with or without secondary bacterial infections are the most commonly described condition. The frequency of these infections does not correlate with T cell counts, which suggests that anatomical causes may be the major contributor to these symptoms. The frequency of infections was assessed in a cohort of 55 individuals with 22q11.2del ages 9 years and older. This age restriction was used to minimize numerous confounders at a younger age, such as daycare, reflux, cardiac surgery, and velopharyngeal insufficiency, complicating upper airway issues and bottle feeding. Recurrent episodes of otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia were each defined by more than three episodes per year requiring antibiotics, all within the previous 2 years. Results demonstrated that 40% of the individuals were considered as healthy as their peers. The incidence of recurrent sinusitis was 27%, recurrent otitis media 25%, recurrent bronchitis 7%, and recurrent pneumonia 4%. Two individuals in this group had recurrent parotitis, two had extensive warts, one had mastoiditis, and one had osteomyelitis. Prolonged viral upper respiratory tract infections were common. Interestingly, the frequency of infection did not correlate with T cell counts. Related to COVID, a survey including 25 patients with 22q11.2del and confirmed infection self-reported low rates of severe disease and no deaths. Some individuals with 22q11.2del also experience esophageal motility disorders, which can impair swallowing and predispose to aspiration, leading to recurrent pneumonias. In patients experiencing pneumonias, an effort should be made to determine the underlying cause, with consideration for a fluoroscopic video swallow study under imaging. The authors did not find any significant difference in immunology laboratory parameters when comparing patients experiencing recurrent infections to those who were clinically well.

### The diverse clinical features of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (diGeorge syndrome) [^8abda8d4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old boy with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was referred for recurrent sinopulmonary infections. He was diagnosed shortly after birth by a fluorescence in situ hybridization test that was performed due to interrupted aortic arch type B. He had no hypocalcemia, and his recovery from cardiac repair was uneventful. He had difficulty feeding and gained weight slowly, but, otherwise, there were no concerns during his first year of life. At 15 months of age, he began to develop significant otitis media and bronchitis. He was hospitalized once for pneumonia at 18 months of age and has never been off antibiotics for more than 1 week since then. He has not had any previous immunologic evaluation. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections in a child with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can have the same etiologies as in any other child. Atopy, anatomic issues, cystic fibrosis, and new environmental exposures could be considered in this setting. Early childhood can be problematic for patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome due to unfavorable drainage of the middle ear and sinuses. Atopy occurs at a higher frequency in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and these children also have a higher rate of gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration than the general population. As would be appropriate for any child who presents with recurrent infections at 2 years of age, an immunologic evaluation should be performed. In this review, we will highlight recent findings and new data on the management of children and adults with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^6aff3831]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) definitions and severity criteria propose that adult hypogammaglobulinemia (HG) be defined as a serum IgG level below 700 mg/dL with stratification into 400 to 699 mg/dL, 200 to 399 mg/dL, and 0 to 199 mg/dL; age-appropriate pediatric reference ranges should be considered. To characterize persistence, SHG duration can be categorized as lasting 3 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 24 months, and more than 24 months. Severe infection is proposed as requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, or antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal therapy for treatment, and recurrent infection is proposed per Jeffrey Modell Foundation criteria as 4 or more new ear infections, 2 or more serious sinus infections, 2 or more pneumonias, and 2 or more deep-seated infections including septicemia.

Methods

Patients

Patient 1 presented with sepsis and erysipelas at age of 6 years. Several episodes per year of sinusitis, which were treated by antibiotics for at least 2 months, were noted between the age of 7 and 9 years. Patient 1 was diagnosed as XLA at the age of 10 years. There was no lymphadenopathy and his tonsils were absent. Patient 1 had an elder male sibling who died at 6 years old due to recurrent pneumonia and purulent meningitis. Chest X-ray showed lobar pneumonia in the left lung. No organism could be isolated.

Patient 2 was well for the first 8 months of life. He then had frequent pneumonia and sore throats. From 1 to 5 years of age, he had 3–4 episodes of otitis media, 4–5 episodes of pneumonia, and 1–2 episodes of erysipelas every year, which were treated by antibiotics for at least 10 days. At the age of 6 years, patient 2 was referred to the National Hospital of Pediatrics because of sepsis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, otitis media, and pneumonia. His tonsils were hypoplastic. He had an elder male sibling who was died at 9 years of age due to recurrent infections, including pneumonia, otitis media, and dermatomyositis. Patient 2 had an elder sister who was well.

From 9 months of age, patient 3 had recurrent otitis media and mastoiditis that were operated on three times (4, 7, and 9 years of age) at the National Hospital of Pediatrics. However, he did not fully recover after the operations. At 11 years old, patient 3 was referred to the National Hospital of Pediatrics again due to septicemia and purulent meningitis. His tonsils were absent. He had no male sibling in the family and his female sibling was normal.

Patient 4 was noted to have persistent diarrhea and skin infections when he was 18 months old. From 2 to 4 years of age, he had 5–6 episodes of otitis media per year. At 5 years of age, he was admitted to the National Hospital of Pediatrics because of septicemia, persistent coughing and otitis media and left knee arthritis. His tonsils could not be visualized. His mother had a history of lupus and two female siblings were normal.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update)-executive summary [^0c1cd023]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2011 guideline developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations on the pre-, intra-, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years of age under consideration for tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil, including its capsule, by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with 289,000 ambulatory procedures performed annually in children < 15 years of age, based on the most recent published data. This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing children under consideration for tonsillectomy and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to educate clinicians, patients, and/or caregivers regarding the indications for tonsillectomy and the natural history of recurrent throat infections. Additional goals include the following: optimizing the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasizing the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improving the counseling and education of families who are considering tonsillectomy for their children, highlighting the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. Children aged 1 to 18 years under consideration for tonsillectomy are the target patient for the guideline. For this guideline update, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of nursing, anesthesiology, consumers, family medicine, infectious disease, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, and sleep medicine.

Key Action Statements

The guideline update group made strong recommendations for the following key action statements (KASs): (1) Clinicians should recommend watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been < 7 episodes in the past year, < 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or < 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years. (2) Clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (3) Clinicians should recommend ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or both for pain control after tonsillectomy. The guideline update group made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in KAS 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess. (2) Clinicians should ask caregivers of children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, asthma, and behavioral problems. (3) Before performing tonsillectomy, the clinician should refer children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing for polysomnography if they are < 2 years of age or if they exhibit any of the following: obesity, Down syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses. (4) The clinician should advocate for polysomnography prior to tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing in children without any of the comorbidities listed in KAS 5 for whom the need for tonsillectomy is uncertain or when there is discordance between the physical examination and the reported severity of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing. (5) Clinicians should recommend tonsillectomy for children with obstructive sleep apnea documented by overnight polysomnography. (6) Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers and explain that obstructive sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management. (7) The clinician should counsel patients and caregivers regarding the importance of managing posttonsillectomy pain as part of the perioperative education process and should reinforce this counseling at the time of surgery with reminders about the need to anticipate, reassess, and adequately treat pain after surgery. (8) Clinicians should arrange for overnight, inpatient monitoring of children after tonsillectomy if they are < 3 years old or have severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 10 obstructive events/hour, oxygen saturation nadir < 80%, or both). (9) Clinicians should follow up with patients and/or caregivers after tonsillectomy and document in the medical record the presence or absence of bleeding within 24 hours of surgery (primary bleeding) and bleeding occurring later than 24 hours after surgery (secondary bleeding). (10) Clinicians should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The guideline update group made a strong recommendation against 2 actions: (1) Clinicians should not administer or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. (2) Clinicians must not administer or prescribe codeine, or any medication containing codeine, after tonsillectomy in children younger than 12 years. The policy level for the recommendation about documenting recurrent throat infection was an option: (1) Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Differences From Prior Guideline

Incorporating new evidence profiles to include the role of patient preferences, confidence in the evidence, differences of opinion, quality improvement opportunities, and any exclusion to which the action statement does not apply. There were 1 new clinical practice guideline, 26 new systematic reviews, and 13 new randomized controlled trials included in the current guideline update.

BCTT-related SHG — evaluation and vaccination — includes baseline/follow-up testing and careful timing of immunizations: serum IgG levels and peripheral B-cell flow cytometry before and after initiating BCTT help identify preexisting HG and detect SHG after starting BCTT; a previous review has recommended administering vaccines at least 6 months after the last course of RTX and 4 weeks before the next if disease activity allows; passive tetanus immunoglobulin has been recommended for high-risk patients treated with RTX in the last 24 weeks; live vaccines are not recommended until B-cell repletion occurs; pediatric RTX vaccine recommendations are similar to adults with establishment of adequate antibody titers before RTX initiation considered the best preventative measure; decisions about vaccine timing should be made primarily by the treating physician with input by clinical immunology if needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^227cd21d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^b1eb3d62]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

B-cell targeted therapies (BCTTs) — regulatory note and pediatric considerations — state that SHG due to BCTT is currently not a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication for IgG-RT (IVIG or SCIG), and that screening and monitoring of immunoglobulins as well as careful consideration of heightened clinical monitoring, vaccinations, antibiotic prophylaxis, and/or IgG-RT when appropriate may improve clinical outcomes by decreasing infections. In pediatrics, there are increasing reports of SHG on RTX with some receiving IgG-RT, and B-cell numbers start to recover at approximately 6 months and recover by approximately 12 months post-RTX treatment, with timing influenced by underlying condition, concomitant treatments, and age-related immune maturation.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^5afe91ee]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Neurology — evaluation, vaccination, and management of SHG are summarized as follows: Screening at time of diagnosis and before initiation of BCTT with at least a serum IgG level is recommended, and monitoring serum IgG levels and examining peripheral B-cell flow cytometry before and after initiating therapy allow timely identification of SHG and heightened clinical monitoring for infections as appropriate; vaccinations are an important part of infection prophylaxis and when possible, vaccinations should be administered before initiation of immunosuppressive agents other than IFN-β; in addition to vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, BCTT dose/frequency adjustment or discontinuation, and IgG-RT have been reported as strategies for infection prevention, and if IgG-RT is initiated and there are no plans for BCTT readministration, it may be reasonable to pause IgG-RT after 9 to 12 months to allow for reevaluation of immune function when clinically stable and infection-free; RCTs are needed to demonstrate the equivalency of SCIG to IVIG.

### Evaluating the child with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections [^28c80e32]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

We review the limited available evidence on underlying causes of recurrent pneumonia in children, supplemented by our own clinical experience. Diagnosing recurrent pneumonia in children is difficult. Diagnostic confusion is possible with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and asthma. In our series of children with recurrent pneumonia, we never identified asthma as an underlying cause. Because the frequency or severity of recurrent pneumonia does not always justify additional invasive investigations, the diagnostic work-up may be incomplete in a number of cases. This may help to explain why an underlying cause for recurrent pneumonia cannot be found in approximately 30% of cases. Finally, the paradigm that recurrent pneumonia in the same lung lobe has a differential diagnosis different from those recurring in multiple lobes was not borne out in our case series. A stepwise and pragmatic approach to evaluating children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections is recommended.

Immune work up (Table 2) revealed a relative paucity of CD8 + cells, and poor in vitro response to antigens. CD19 + B cell counts were low and she developed hypogammaglobulinemia with absent responses to vaccinations with tetanus, measles, mumps and varicella. Even after the age of 2 years, she was unable to mount a response to the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine.

Table 2
Patient 1–immune work up

The patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy and is tolerating her treatment very well, with dramatic improvement in reducing the frequency of infections.

Patient 2 was reported previously. Briefly, he is a 12-year old-boy of Tamil descent, born at term and was small for gestational age. He first presented at 11 weeks of age with severe episodes of bilateral pneumonia and continued to suffer from recurrent pneumonia and asthma thereafter. Upon assessment at the age of 5 months, his head circumference was 39.5 cm (below the third percentile for age). Weight was at the tenth percentile for age and length was below the third percentile for age. Developmental assessments, performed at 11 months and 5 years of age, indicated delays in expressive language, gross and fine motor skills, while social skills were appropriate for age. He was found to have characteristic dysmorphic features (Fig. 4), spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (Fig. 2c, d), as well as retinal dystrophy. A brain MRI revealed mild ventriculomegaly and prominent extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces. An immunologic evaluation was significant for CD19 lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. He was unable to mount a long-standing response to tetanus and pneumococcal vaccines, and had non-reactive titres for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, despite appropriate vaccination. He was therefore started on IVIG treatment at the age of 11 years. Similar to patient 1, the responses to T cells antigens were absent.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of refractory disease), IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain ≥ 1 of the following evaluations in pediatric patients not responding to initial therapy after 48–72 hours:

- clinical and laboratory assessment of the current severity of illness and anticipated progression in order to determine whether higher levels of care or support are required

- imaging evaluation to assess the extent and progression of the pneumonic or parapneumonic process

- further investigations to identify whether the original pathogen persists, the original pathogen has developed resistance to the agent used, or there is a new secondary infecting agent.

Screening and monitoring in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — general considerations emphasize core laboratory assessments. The figure notes that "At a minimum, screening and monitoring should include an IgG level", that "Non-Ig immunoglobulins and specific antibody responses have also been recommended because IgG levels alone do not indicate normal B-cell function", and that "Lymphocyte subsets for B-cell enumeration and peripheral B-cell flow cytometry for phenotyping can be considered, particularly in patients about to receive or receiving immunosuppressants". It also states that "Additional studies are needed to clearly define which patient populations benefit from screening and monitoring as well as the timing of and the laboratories to include in screening and monitoring".

### Common variable immunodeficiency and natural killer cell lymphopenia caused by ets-binding site mutation in the IL-2 receptor γ (IL2RG) gene promoter [^e60798d1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

At the time of his diagnosis, it was noted that his maternal grandfather was under treatment for CVID. The grandfather presented to an immunology team at the age of 34 years with a 20-year history of recurrent otosinopulmonary tract infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, bronchiectasis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus and celiac disease. On initial presentation, he had an IgG 2 and IgG 4 subclass deficiency, absent antibody response to polysaccharide vaccine, CD4 and NK lymphopenia, and reduced proliferative responses to PHA. Immunoglobulin substitution was implemented, along with antibiotic prophylaxis, and he was managed successfully on this regimen for 25 years until he died at age 62 years after a cardiac event.

Flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes revealed a significantly diminished γc expression in both the grandson and grandfather (Fig 1, A; see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at). Likewise, IL2RG mRNA expression in sorted T and B cells from the grandson showed a 4.2-fold reduction in T cells and a 33-fold reduction in B cells compared with healthy control subjects (Fig 1, B). The T cells were then stimulated with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, and phosphorylated STAT5 levels were determined by means of flow cytometric analysis (Fig 1, C). This was diminished in the patient with a fold reduction compared with healthy control samples of 3.5-, 7.5-, and 3.8-fold for IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, respectively.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^21780b3b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

Recurrent respiratory infections

Recurrent respiratory infections in children

Recurrent respiratory infections are common in children. Nearly 25% of children experience RRTIs during their first year of life and approximately 6% of children under 6 years of age experience RRTIs. In most cases, these infections pass with mild symptoms and the frequency of infection tends to reduce over time, with a complete resolution typically around 12 years of age. Nonetheless, RRTIs can significantly negatively impact the quality of life of the child and family and have important medical and social costs. In some cases, URTIs can cause acute complications such as otitis media, pneumonia, glomerulonephritis, and myocarditis.

There is a lack of universal consensus on the definition of RRTIs. A consensus was published proposing an up-to-date definition and recommendations to guide physicians in the complex process of diagnosing, managing, and preventing pediatric RRTIs. For example, childhood respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are considered recurrent if within a year a child aged 6–12 years has three or more RTIs (one of which can be pneumonia, including severe pneumonia) or two mild cases of pneumonia confirmed by X-rays and/or clinical criteria.

The widespread presence of recurrent URTIs is not considered a global phenomenon. However, several cohort studies have attempted to estimate the prevalence of recurrent URTIs. The prospective, observational birth cohort study Steps to the Healthy Development and Well-being of Children (STEPS) observed 1,089 children from their birth until they turned 2 years old, tracking RTIs using a daily symptom diary. Recurrent RTIs were defined as more than 98 days of respiratory illness per year and was reported in 10% of the participant cohort. Approximately 60% of the participants with RRTIs were diagnosed with a minimum of three episodes of acute otitis, 73% received at least three courses of antibiotic treatment and 21% had been hospitalized with an acute form of RTI. By the time the children turned 2 years old, 12% had been diagnosed with asthma. Therefore, the authors concluded that RRTIs are a risk factor for asthma in children.

### Tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in moderately affected children [^185dd561]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In previous clinical trials involving children severely affected with recurrent throat infection (7 or more well-documented, clinically important, adequately treated episodes of throat infection in the preceding year, or 5 or more such episodes in each of the 2 preceding years, or 3 or more such episodes in each of the 3 preceding years), we found tonsillectomy efficacious in reducing the number and severity of subsequent episodes of throat infection for at least 2 years. The results seemed to warrant the election of tonsillectomy in children meeting the trials' stringent eligibility criteria but also provided support for nonsurgical management. We undertook the present trials to determine 1) whether tonsillectomy would afford equivalent benefit in children who were less severely affected than those in our earlier trials but who nonetheless had indications for tonsillectomy comparable to those in general use, and 2) whether, in such children, the addition of adenoidectomy would confer additional benefit.

Methods

We conducted 2 parallel randomized, controlled trials in the Ambulatory Care Center of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. To be eligible, children were required to have had a history of recurrent episodes of throat infection that met standards slightly less stringent than the standards used in our earlier trials regarding either the frequency of previous episodes or their clinical features or their degree of documentation, but not regarding > 1 of those parameters. These reduced standards were nonetheless more stringent than those in current official guidelines, which list "3 or more infections of tonsils and/or adenoids per year despite adequate medical therapy" as an indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Of 2174 children referred by physicians or parents, 373 met the current trials' eligibility criteria and 328 were enrolled. Of these, 177 children without obstructing adenoids or recurrent or persistent otitis media were randomized to either a tonsillectomy group, an adenotonsillectomy group, or a control group (the 3-way trial), and 151 children who had 1 or more such conditions were randomized to either an adenotonsillectomy group or a control group (the 2-way trial). Outcome measures were the occurrence of episodes of throat infection during the 3 years of follow-up; other, indirect measures of morbidity; and complications of surgery.

Results

By various measures, the incidence of throat infection was significantly lower in surgical groups than in corresponding control groups during each of the 3 follow-up years. However, even among control children, mean rates of moderate or severe episodes were low, ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 per year. Adenotonsillectomy was no more efficacious than tonsillectomy alone. Of 203 children treated with surgery, 16 (7.9%) had surgery-related complications of varying types and severity.

Conclusions

The modest benefit conferred by tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in children moderately affected with recurrent throat infection seems not to justify the inherent risks, morbidity, and cost of the operations. We conclude that, under ordinary circumstances, neither eligibility criteria such as those used for the present trials nor the criterion for surgery in current official guidelines are sufficiently stringent for use in clinical practice.

### Delayed-onset ADA1 (ADA) deficiency not detected by TREC screen [^4712cbb8]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 9-month-old boy presented to a community pediatrician with a recent history of failure to thrive. Workup revealed neutropenia and lymphopenia. Subsequent admission for fever and pneumonia revealed an absolute neutrophil count of 860 and absolute lymphocyte count of 214. Lymphopenia affected all lymphocyte subsets and his naïve and memory CD4 + T-cell ratio was inverted for age. Immunoglobulin levels were normal for age, and tetanus and diphtheria antibody titers were protective. The profound lymphopenia raised suspicion for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), despite a normal newborn screening by T-cell receptor excision circle analysis. He did not have a previous history of recurrent fevers or infections, had attended day care, and had received all age-appropriate vaccines. He subsequently was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, adenovirus upper respiratory infection, and rotaviral diarrhea. An enzyme assay revealed absent adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and elevated erythrocyte deoxyadenosine nucleotides. With genetic sequencing, 2 pathogenic variants in the ADA gene were confirmed. Acute management of ADA-SCID is aimed at restoration of enzyme activity, followed by curative therapy. The patient is currently on immunoglobulin therapy and recombinant ADA (Revcovi), with an excellent immune response, while awaiting sibling hematopoietic cell transplant from a matched sibling. Hypomorphic ADA variants can present with delayed-onset SCID, and some of these patients are missed by SCID newborn screening. A careful review of a complete blood cell count might offer clues and promote confirmatory diagnostic investigation.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^236f6e75]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) evaluation and management — Figure 2 outlines workup after a low IgG level in a patient with a history of a condition/treatment associated with SHG, including rechecking IgG, checking IgA and IgM, measuring specific antibody titers to tetanus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, vaccinating with titers obtained 4–6 weeks later, and lymphocyte subset/B-cell phenotyping, with consideration of protein loss. In patients with a history of recurrent, severe, or unusual infections, criteria include IgG < 700 mg/dL with associated non-IgG HG and suboptimal responses to vaccination or isolated IgG < 400 mg/dL (a cutoff of 400 mg/dL has been suggested in SOT and hematologic malignancy); management includes a trial of prophylactic antibiotics followed by an IgG replacement therapy (IgG-RT) trial. If isolated IgG < 150 mg/dL, shared decision making about IgG-RT trial is advised; otherwise, monitor clinically and repeat laboratories every 6 months. The IgG-RT trial lists a typical starting dose 400–600 mg/kg/mo using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG), with serum IgG checked 3 months after starting IgG-RT (trough before fourth dose if IVIG) to adjust dosing, and a starting goal trough > 800 mg/dL. Ongoing follow-up includes periodic assessments every 6–12 months, consideration of pausing IgG-RT if immunosuppression is discontinued (9–12 months after discontinuation of BCTT) or the SHG-associated condition is treated, and re-evaluation of immune function about 3–4 months after pausing IgG-RT.

### Otolaryngologic manifestations of immunodeficiency [^ebb0e62d]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Otolaryngologists are frequently consulted to manage infectious and noninfectious complications of immune deficiency. Although defects of host defense and recurrent or severe infections are the most obvious manifestations of immune deficiency, patients are often at increased risk for autoimmune and malignant disease as well. Knowledge of primary and acquired immune deficiencies will facilitate appropriate identification, treatment, and referral of patients with these defects. When immunodeficiency is known or suspected, it is particularly important to have a high index of suspicion for unusual or severe manifestations of infection, to have a low threshold for obtaining imaging to aid in diagnosis, and to treat infections for longer periods of time with higher doses of antibiotic. Surgery may be required for definitive treatment of infections that do not respond to medical therapy and for management of complications of infectious disease

### Immunological investigations in children with recurrent respiratory infections [^7d1d72f2]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract infections are common diseases in childhood. Most children with recurrent respiratory infections do not have an immunodeficiency. If they do, this is often due to an antibody deficiency. An important point in the investigation of a child with recurrent respiratory infections is to assess whether the child is thriving. If not, an underlying disease should be sought. Immunological investigations are useful if other, more frequent, underlying diseases have been ruled out. Early immunological screening is mandatory if there is a family history of immunodeficiency. In this review, a protocol is described which identifies children with severe antibody deficiency by simple screening tests before recurrent infections have caused irrepairable damage to the lungs. More elaborate tests are used to detect milder antibody deficiencies. These are reserved for those children in whom symptoms persist.

Types of Immunodeficiency

Primary Immunodeficiency

Distinguishing between IEI and SID in adult patients can be challenging, as autoimmune and hematologic or oncologic conditions can be both the causes and the manifestations of immune dysfunction. IEI is usually diagnosed during childhood, but some entities, particularly CVID, may manifest in adulthood. In addition, hypomorphic variants of classically severe IEI (e.g. mutations in RAG1/2, ADA2, or NF-κB1 genes) can present with attenuated phenotypes and be diagnosed later in life. CVID is defined by reduced levels of immunoglobulins G (IgG) along with low levels of IgA and/or IgM, defective responses to immunizations, and abnormal B cell immunophenotype, often with significant reduction of isotype-switched memory B cells. CVID represents a heterogenous group of disorders with variable clinical phenotypes, contributing to delayed diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed between 20 and 45 years of age after multiple consultations and hospitalizations. While genetic variants are identified in 25–30% of cases, novel disease-causing mutations continue to be discovered. The clinical presentation and potential complications can vary according to the underlying genetic defect.

The main clinical feature of CVID is recurrent respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media, mainly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, which have been reported in over 90% of patients in large studies. Viral (e.g. herpes zoster), fungal (e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii), and parasitic (e.g. Giardia) infections are less frequent. In adults with recurrent respiratory infections, the presence of allergy, autoimmunity, and/or granulomatous disease should raise the suspicion of underlying CVID. Patients with predominant non-infectious complications (autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, enteropathy) are increasingly recognized as a distinct subgroup of CVID with different pathophysiology and outcomes compared to those with mainly infectious manifestations. Additional complications affecting CVID patients include atopy, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, lymphoproliferation, splenomegaly, protein-losing enteropathy, and granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD). Bronchiectasis and interstitial lung disease are major complications of pulmonary infections and represent key signs for CVID diagnosis.

Secondary Immunodeficiency

SID conditions are acquired, tend to appear later in life, and can be transient or permanent. They result from external factors that impair immune function. Identifying the underlying cause is crucial, as targeted interventions can often alleviate or reverse immune dysfunction.

### Immunodeficiency presenting as an undiagnosed disease [^53b825ac]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Although primary immunodeficiencies typically present with recurrent, chronic, or severe infections, autoimmune manifestations frequently accompany these disorders and may be the initial clinical manifestations. The presence of 2 or more autoimmune disorders, unusual severe atopic disease, or a combination of these disorders should lead a clinician to consider primary immunodeficiency disorders.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^32c133d0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is characterized by prolonged immune reconstitution, for which CD4+ T-cell enumeration has been identified as an indicator of immune status. Full immunization is typically repeated 2 years post-HSCT when patients are off all immunosuppression and the CD4+ T-cell count is above 200. For infection prophylaxis, routine use of IgG-RT is not recommended; it may be considered for severe SHG (IgG < 400 mg/dL) particularly with bacteremia or recurrent sinopulmonary infections despite hygiene and antimicrobial prophylaxis. IVIG has been used for severe SHG with severe infections, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use, and Choosing Wisely recommendations from transplant societies recommend against routine IVIG after HSCT. Uncertainties include defining initiation criteria for IgG-RT (including use in the absence of infections) and determining the equivalency of SCIG to IVIG.

### Progressive B cell depletion in human MALT1 deficiency [^80c371fb]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-translocation gene 1 (MALT1)-deficiency is a rare combined immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent infections, dermatitis and enteropathy. We herein investigate the immunological profiles of our patient and previously reported children with MALT1-deficiency. A mutation analysis was performed by targeted panel sequencing for primary immunodeficiency. Lymphocyte subset, activation and B cell differentiation were analyzed by flow cytometry and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Pneumocystis pneumonia developed in a 6-month-old Japanese infant with atopic dermatitis, enteritis and growth restriction. This infant showed agammaglobulinemia without lymphopenia. At 8 years of age, the genetic diagnosis of MALT1-deficiency was confirmed on a novel homozygous mutation of c.1102G > T, p.E368X. T cell stimulation tests showed impairments in the production of interleukin-2, phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and differentiation of B cells. In combination with the literature data, we found that the number of circulatory B cells, but not T cells, were inversely correlated with the age of patients. The hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) successfully reconstituted the differentiation of mature B cells and T cells. These data conceptualize that patients with complete MALT1-deficiency show aberrant differentiation and depletion of B cells. The early diagnosis and HCT lead to a cure of the disease phenotype associated with the loss-of-function mutations in human CARD11.

Clinical signs of immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation

Both patients fulfilled the classical and revised criteria of a primary immunodeficiency disorder with frequent infectionsand showed laboratory signs of immune dysregulation. Starting from the age of 3 weeks after birth, patient 1 developed recurrent invasive bacterial infections including episodes of sepsis; a proven Staphylococcus capitis sepsis at the age of 1½ years was followed by a severe urosepsis at 3 years. Apart from two episodes of pneumonia, chronic relapsing productive bronchitis with laboratory signs of bacterial infections recurred more than eight times per year, requiring inpatient admittance and intravenous antibiotic treatment. Moreover, the boy suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections possibly related to the hypospadia, with microbiological evidence of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-positive-positive Escherichia coli infection on two instances. Considering the clinical history of repeated severe bacterial infections in this patient, laboratory investigations revealing selective antibody deficiency and decreased numbers of class-switched B cells (see below), he was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg, at monthly intervals) at 5 years of age. This resulted in a significant decrease in the occurrence of infections, especially of the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract.

Patient 2 suffered from relapsing viral bronchiolitis and required frequent hospitalisations for intravenous antibiotics because of recurrent severe infections (invasive pneumonia, frequent episodes of febrile otitis media, bronchitis with bacterial superinfection, two episodes of suspected meningitis with seizures required intensive care (see table 1). Upon immunological investigations hypogammaglobulinaemia was diagnosed and immunoglobulin substitution commenced according to evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of primary antibody deficiencies. Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment was used from 20 months of age (0.4 g/kg monthly) and switched to subcutaneous Ig substitution (SCIG; 160–200 mg/kg weekly), resulting in reduced frequency and severity of infections and improved thriving. Recently, patient 2 developed protracted enteropathy with calprotectin concentrations in stool > 1800 µg/g (normal < 50 µg/g), which may potentially indicate inflammatory bowel disease and awaits further evaluation by endoscopy and histology.

### Inborn errors of immunity: a role for functional testing and flow cytometry in aiding clinical diagnosis [^4ad162cd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

With the exponential discovery of new inborn errors of immunity (IEI), it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between a number of the more recently defined disorders. This is compounded by the fact that although IEI primarily present with immunodeficiency, the spectrum of disease is broad and often extends to features typical of autoimmunity, autoinflammation, atopic disease, and/or malignancy. Here we use case studies to discuss the laboratory and genetic tests used that ultimately led to the specific diagnoses.

### Clinical and mutational features of Vietnamese children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia [^bb84de66]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

XLA is caused by a B-cell developmental defect. Being an arrest of differentiation of pre-B cells to mature B cells, pre-B cells are found in normal amounts while mature B cells are nearly undetectable, that result in a pronounced reduction of serum Ig of all classes. Therefore, affected boys suffer from recurrent bacterial and enteroviral infections after six months of life after maternal antibodies are no longer present in the infant's circulation. Mutations in all five domains of the BTK gene have been found to cause XLA. In the present study, we report four Vietnamese boys with XLA and investigated the mutation characteristics of their BTK gene.

The clinical manifestations of our XLA patients were typical and similar to previous reports, with severe recurrent infections (Table 1), low levels of mature B cells and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) (Table 2). Pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media were observed in all our patients. Bronchiectasis was present in patients 1 and 2, possibly reflecting the delay of diagnosis with a complication of acute pneumonia in their histories. Patients 1 and 4 presented with arthritis, which was treated as juvenile idiopathic arthritis before diagnosis of XLA; both patients had markedly inverted CD4 + /CD8 + ratio (Table 1). However, a relationship between inverted CD4 + /CD8 + ratio and arthritis is presently unclear. Similar to previous reports, all our patients were diagnosed with XLA late. The age of onset of infection was between 8 months and 6 years (mean 2.5 years). Nonetheless, the age of diagnosis of XLA ranged from 5 to 11 years old (mean 8 years), possibly reflecting the poor knowledge of health workers about XLA and insufficient equipment for diagnosis of XLA in Vietnam, such as flow cytometer. Moreover, the delayed diagnosis may be because the disease is rare and infections (such as pneumonia, sinusitis, and otitis media) are common in our pediatric population. As the estimated prevalence of XLA is 1/200 000, it is suggested that many XLA cases in Vietnam may be undiagnosed. Because early initiation of immunoglobulin replacement therapy could prevent sequelae associated with infections, early diagnosis is of great importance. National networks and diagnostic guidelines for XLA may be helpful for us to improve these issues.

The grandson presented at age 4 years with a history of recurrent bacterial otitis media and chronic suppurative rhinitis, rotavirus-induced gastroenteritis (age 18 months), echoviral gastroenteritis (age 2 years), and varicella zoster (age 4 years). He had IgG deficiency (1.8 g/L) with normal IgA and IgM levels (1.0 and 0.5 g/L, respectively) and did not mount an adequate response to the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax; Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), although he responded appropriately to immunization with protein antigens (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at). He had normal numbers of T and B cells but completely absent NK cells. T-cell proliferation after stimulation with PHA, anti-CD3, and Candida species was suboptimal but not completely abrogated. He was started on immunoglobulin replacement therapy and is well, with his infections limited to recalcitrant cutaneous warts.

Immunoglobulin replacement — use criteria, dosing, and monitoring in CRS with humoral immunodeficiency: Immunodeficiency has been reported as "an underlying risk factor for the development of refractory, recurrent, acute, or recalcitrant CRS". Immunoglobulin replacement is "approved as a replacement therapy for antibody deficiency disorders, including common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and hyper-IgM syndrome", and its appropriate use "can prevent complications from CRS, including subperiosteal abscess, intracranial abscess, meningitis, sepsis, or even death". For patients with specific antibody deficiency and normal immunoglobulin levels, "considerable controversy exists", and "most experts in this area consider demonstration of impaired antibody production essential" with three conditions that "must be shown", including significant infectious morbidity, exclusion and treatment of other disorders, and inadequacy or poor tolerance of other therapies. Many clinicians perform a clinical trial of IgG replacement at 400 mg/kg per month for up to 6 months, reassess humoral immune function no sooner than 3 months (preferably 4–6 months) after the last infusion, and discontinue therapy generally after no more than 3 to 6 months if there is lack of clinical efficacy.

### Clinical findings leading to the diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia [^a11a53b8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether the diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is being made in a timely fashion, the clinical findings leading to the diagnosis of XLA were determined in 82 patients with proven mutations in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (60 patients with sporadic disease and 22 patients with familial disease). Recurrent otitis was seen in almost all of the patients with sporadic XLA who were older than 12 months at the time of diagnosis. However, fewer than 10% of patients were evaluated for immunodeficiency before they were hospitalized for infection; 38% of patients were hospitalized more than once before diagnosis. We conclude that the majority of patients with XLA were recognized to have immunodeficiency during or shortly after their first hospitalization for infection. Most of the patients had a history of recurrent otitis at the time of diagnosis, which when combined with the physical finding of markedly decreased or absent tonsils and cervical lymph nodes, could have alerted physicians to the diagnosis of XLA.

Immunophenotyping suggests immune defects due to girdin deficiency

As defects in cytoskeletal actin are known to cause inborn errors of immunity, and the patients were prone to infections, we set out to investigate their infection history and immune cell distribution and function in more detail. Both patients have been hospitalized due to recurrent pneumonias and have had over 30 infections requiring antibiotic treatment: at the age of 15 years, P1 has had 9 otitis media, at least 11 pneumonias, as well as upper respiratory tract infections. He was hospitalized for 9 days due to simultaneous infection with varicella zoster and adenovirus at 6 years 2 months of age. Patient 2 (P2) has had 18 otitis media, at least 6 pneumonias, upper respiratory tract infections, and 3 skin infections by 11 years of age. In addition, P2 developed inflammatory bowel disease at the age of 8 years and was treated with regular azathioprine and courses of prednisolon.

Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) supplementation after CAR T-cell therapy — criteria, dosing, and pediatric considerations are as follows: We recommend considering IVIG in patients with IgG ≤ 400 mg/dL who are experiencing severe or recurrent bacterial infections, particularly involving the sinopulmonary tract. Beyond the first 3 mo, patients with IgG ≤ 400 mg/dL who are not experiencing infections may be trialed off IVIG with close monitoring, and IVIG supplementation may be considered for patients with IgG 400mg/dL-600mg/dL who are experiencing recurrent or severe bacterial infections. IVIG can also be considered when IgG < 200 mg/dL, particularly when associated with extremely low IgA levels, irrespective of the time from CAR T-cell infusion and the incidence and severity of infections. Patients with IgG > 600 mg/dL with recurrent or serious infections should undergo additional immunologic evaluation, and if specific IgG subclass levels or immunization titers are low or nonprotective, IgG replacement or vaccination can be considered. IgG supplementation should be given with 400 to 500 mg/kg IVIG every 3 to 4 wk, with a goal IgG trough > 600 mg/dL in adults; if infections persist despite monthly supplementation, the dose or frequency can be increased, or subcutaneous (SC) administration with a specific SC Ig formulation can be considered. In children, there is currently no evidence to support the safety of stopping immune globulin; supplementation should be given with 250 to 500 mg/kg IVIG every 4 wk, and in children with prolonged B-cell aplasia, SCIg replacement may be considered, with a goal to maintain IgG > 1000 mg/dL.

### Disseminated aspergillosis in X-linked agammaglobulinemia: beyond the norm [^8d0fae84]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) due to a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), leads to the arrested development of B cells at the pro-B cell stage. This results in absent B cells and severe hypogammaglobulinemia. XLA patients usually present with recurrent sinopulmonary infection. Bacterial infections are the commonest [2], fungal infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus and Candida species are rarely reported and they are associated with mortality in XLA [3]. We report a 3.5-year-old boy with disseminated aspergillosis, an uncommon presentation of XLA. Despite treatment with antifungals, including voriconazole and amphotericin B, the patient succumbed to the illness. Genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic variant in the BTK gene (R28H), confirming XLA diagnosis. This case highlights the potential for severe fungal infections in XLA patients and suggests broader immune system dysregulation beyond B-cell defects.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^a5180f81]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — definition and initial management: Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) is characterized by reduced immunoglobulin levels due to a medication or a disease process, leading to decreased antibody production or increased antibody loss, and is distinct from primary hypogammaglobulinemia due to inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiencies, which comprise more than 400 inherited disorders. Of note, the distinction between primary HG and SHG can be challenging to make, and we recommend thorough consideration of both primary and secondary causes when evaluating HG. When iatrogenic causes cannot be removed or underlying conditions cannot be reversed, therapeutic options are not clearly delineated but include heightened monitoring for clinical infections, supportive antimicrobials, and in some cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

### IRAK1 duplication in MECP2 duplication syndrome does not increase canonical NF-κ B-induced inflammation [^d04e7393]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patient 3 is a 25-year-old patient who is followed-up in our department at least 4 times a year and was clinically and molecularly characterized before [P1 in,]. Array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) confirmed a duplication of 1.1 Mb at Xq28. He first presented with global developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and spastic tetra paresis. He suffers from epilepsy and recurrent severe infections. Of his in total 64 episodes of pneumonia, he had developed 47 until his 14th y/a. After starting an immunoglobulin substitution (at 12 y/a) as well as supportive measures and antibiotic prophylaxis (at 14 y/a), the frequency of infections declined, leading to 3 episodes of pneumonia only in the following 8 years. Despite this treatment, we recorded an increase of hospital admissions due to infections in the last 2 years including 12 episodes of pneumonia and 2 episodes of sepsis (Fig. S1). Throughout the last years, the boy developed chronic aspiration and shows bronchiectasis in his latest CT scans (Fig. S2). We are now detecting opportunistic pathogens such as a multidrug-resistant Citrobacter freundii as well as Candida glabrata and Trichosporon asahii in bronchoalveolar lavages. He is currently under prophylactic anti-infective treatment with cotrimoxazole, penicillin, and fluconazole. In all infectious episodes, our patients presented with fever above 39 °C and high CRP levels, typically above > 100 mg/dl, already during the first 3 days of the infection. The boy shows a normal total immunoglobulin titer but deficiency of IgG2, IgG4, IgA, and IgM. A polysaccharide-specific antibody deficiency persisted despite repeated vaccinations.

The baseline clinical features of all patients in our cohort are summarized in Table 2. Detailed case reports of P1, P2, and P4–P9 are provided in the Supplementary Information.

### Diagnostic interpretation of genetic studies in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases: a working group report of the primary immunodeficiency diseases committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^2eeeffb0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Other evidence for pathogenicity assessment in PIDDs includes explicit guidance: Summary statement 13: Although the presence of a probable genetic explanation might reduce the likelihood that other genetic changes are pathogenic, the presence of a dual molecular diagnosis must not be excluded. Additionally, Summary statement 14: A variant in a gene strongly associated with the immunodeficient phenotype in the patient should be viewed with increased suspicion for pathogenicity. Supporting context notes that the presence of an alternate explanation for the immunologic phenotype or disease is considered supporting evidence that the variant might be benign, but caution is advised because more than 5% of patients with PIDDs have been observed to carry dual molecular diagnoses that produce a blended phenotype. Moreover, the presence of a phenotype or family history highly specific for the gene affected by the variant is normally considered supporting evidence for pathogenicity, and in PIDDs this might increase this evidence from supporting to moderate; for example, a novel variant in CYBB in a male patient with absent neutrophil respiratory burst and history of recurrent staphylococcal abscesses should be judged with increased suspicion for pathogenicity.

### Shorter birth length and decreased T-cell production and function predict severe infections in children with non-severe combined immunodeficiency cartilage-hair hypoplasia [^48a8e5be]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

We evaluated respiratory infections (recurrent otitis media and/or pneumonia) and severe infections (sepsis, recurrent pneumonia, and/or opportunistic infections) as primary outcome variables. Sepsis diagnoses were made by hospital pediatricians, and we verified the compliance with sepsis criteria when detailed data were available. Recurrent pneumonia was defined as at least 3 radiologically confirmed pneumonias. Recurrent otitis media was defined as at least 3 episodes of acute otitis media within 6 months, at least 4 within a year, or at least 10 ever. We explored whether clinical course correlated with laboratory immunologic parameters or with birth length (adjusted for gestational age), Hirschsprung disease, or severe anemia, which we defined as anemia requiring red blood cell transfusions. We used the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation test, and Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Statistical analyses and visualization of the results were performed by SPSS Statistics v25 and v27 (IBM) and GraphPad Prism v9.2.0 (GraphPad Software).

Machine learning analyses

We used the random forest method for identification of the relative importance of each feature compared to the target outcome. For the study, we used 2 data sets. Data set 1 comprised all 32 patients. Data set 2 comprised 24 patients with additional naive T-cell counts, with 2 different target values: target 1, development of respiratory infections; and target 2, development of severe infections (Fig 1).

For all model trainings, we used sample division of 80% of samples for model training and 20% of samples for model validation. Estimation accuracy of the models with library 'sklearn' accuracy_score was as follows: for data set 1, respiratory infections accuracy was 0.93 and severe infections 0.93, and for data set 2, respiratory infections accuracy was 1.0 and severe infections 1.0 (maximum value, 1.0). These values indicated that the tested parameters did predict the outcome in the validation model, so we continued analysis.

Training models were done with Python v.3.10.6 'sklearn' v1.2.2 library RandomForestClassifier object, using parameters: n_estimator = 2000, random_state = 42 for all data set and target outcomes. Results of the training model represent the relative importance of each feature with the given data set and target outcome. The importance value was acquired from inbuilt method feature_importances of the RandomForest classifier.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV — epidemiology and risk factors are characterized by Pneumocystis jirovecii as the cause and early-life exposure, with "two-thirds of healthy children have antibodies to P. jirovecii by age 2 years to 4 years". Before prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy (ART), PCP burden and mortality were high: "PCP occurred in 70% to 80% of patients with AIDS; the course of treated PCP was associated with a 20% to 40% mortality rate in individuals with profound immunosuppression". Risk is strongly linked to immunodeficiency: "Approximately 90% of PCP cases occurred in patients with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3", and "CD4 cell percentage < 14%" along with prior PCP, oral thrush, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, weight loss, and higher plasma HIV RNA levels were associated with higher risk. Incidence has fallen where prophylaxis and ART are widespread, with "recent incidence among patients with AIDS in Western Europe and the United States is < 1 case per 100 person-years", yet current cases often arise in those not engaged in HIV care or with advanced immunosuppression, including "CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3".

### Agammaglobulinemia: from X-linked to autosomal forms of disease [^852a971e]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interruptions or alterations in the B cell development pathway can lead to primary B cell immunodeficiency with resultant absence or diminished immunoglobulin production. While the most common cause of congenital agammaglobulinemia is X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), accounting for approximately 85% of cases, other genetic forms of agammaglobulinemia have been identified. Early recognition and diagnosis of these conditions are pivotal for improved outcomes and prevention of sequelae and complications. The diagnosis of XLA is often delayed, and can be missed if patient has a mild phenotype. The lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype in this condition makes management and predicting outcomes quite difficult. In contrast, while less common, autosomal recessive forms of agammaglobulinemia present at younger ages and with typically more severe clinical features resulting in an earlier diagnosis. Some diagnostic innovations, such as KREC level measurements and serum BCMA measurements, may aid in facilitating an earlier identification of agammaglobulinemia leading to prompt treatment. Earlier diagnosis may improve the overall health of patients with XLA.

Clinical Features

HEM1-deficient patients typically present in the first year of life with dysregulated immune responses leading to a syndrome of immunodeficiency coupled with hyperinflammation, lymphoproliferation, and autoimmunity (Table 1). While the patient cohort reported by Salzer et al. displayed a predominantly autoimmune phenotype and those reported by Castro et al. had features consistent with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), the patients reported by Cook et al. had a mixed clinical picture, highlighting the overlapping features and commonalities. All patients suffer from recurrent infections such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, and abscesses. Respiratory infections commonly lead to chronic complications including bronchiectasis. Interstitial lung disease is also described without a clear etiology but may be related to viral infections or chronic inflammation. Other bacterial infections have included cellulitis, septic arthritis, and cholecystitis. Reported viral infections have included disseminated herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and gastroenteritis. One patient has been described with lymphadenitis after Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination, but this occurred after initiation of steroids. Notably, siblings of patients from three of the seven kindreds died before 3 years of age from unknown causes or known infections, possibly because of HEM1 deficiency.

### The clinical utility of measuring IgG subclass immunoglobulins during immunological investigation for suspected primary antibody deficiencies [^fb4c7d4e]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Measurement of IgGSc Concentrations to Aid the Diagnosis of Specific Antibody Deficiency

It is important to differentiate between isolated IgGScD, SAD, and clinically relevant IgGScD, since the decision process for treatment and management may differ. Individuals with SAD differ from those with isolated IgGScD and clinically relevant IgGScD, since they have normal IgGSc concentrations and always have an impaired response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. Patients with SAD are predisposed to sinopulmonary bacterial infections, sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia with pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus aureus.

Patients with SAD are managed in a variety of ways, including vaccination with conjugated vaccines, prophylactic antibiotics, and occasionally with antibody replacement therapy. This may differ from the patient management employed for those with isolated IgGScD and certainly for those with clinically relevant IgGScD with respect to antibody replacement. This may be indicative of the differing severity of immune defect among these PIDs (Figure 3).

Initial treatment of patients with normal IgG but IgGScD or SAD may include antibiotics for the infections and vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. A clear purpose for antibody replacement therapy is reduced levels of serum IgG (< 2 g/L) in patients with recurrent bacterial infections, but this may be more difficult to justify in the presence of normal total IgG. The justification may be strengthened, however, for patients with clinically relevant IgGScD, as both IgGSc concentrations and response to vaccination are compromised. Antibody replacement therapy may be indicated in SAD patients, or patients with isolated IgGScD or clinically relevant IgGScD if the patients present with severe and/or RI, even though prophylactic antibiotics have been administered. The decision-making process is governed by clinical presentation, may involve the patients response to treatment, and is a clinician-dependent justification. Measurement of IgGSc is required to support the clinical presentations and the decisions for appropriate treatment.

Abnormal findings from examinations on lungs and diseases of respiratory system not elsewhere classified (NEC) were the direct parents of multiple phenotypes including respiratory conditions (pneumococcal pneumonia, general pneumonia, bronchiectasis, empyema and pneumothorax, alveolar and parietoalveolar pneumonopathy, abnormal imaging findings, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis), organ damage or inflammation (pericarditis, hepatomegaly) and infections or inflammations (meningitis, chronic pharyngitis and nasopharyngitis). Failure to thrive and developmental disorders was also the direct parent of gastrointestinal conditions and pancytopenia. Other phenotypes involved in this consensus DAG were non-Hodgkin lymphoma and disorders involving the immune mechanism.

In Cohort 2, neutropenia, bacterial pneumonia and influenza were the direct parents of CID diagnosis (Fig. 3). Influenza, bacterial pneumonia, abnormal findings from examinations on lungs and acute pharyngitis were the direct parents of multiple phenotypes including respiratory conditions (bronchopneumonia and lung abscess, pseudomonal pneumonia, empyema and pneumothorax, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, pulmonary inflammation or edema, bronchiectasis, pneumococcal pneumonia), acute or recurrent infections (acute sinusitis, chronic tonsilitis and adenoiditis, acute pharyngitis, otitis media, skin infections, bacteremia, meningitis, candidiasis, mycoses), allergies or allergic reactions (allergic rhinitis, urticaria), organ inflammation (pericarditis), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, developmental delays/ disorders and disorders of the immune system (IM; the latter typically associated with autoimmune diseases).

### Flow cytometry and its use in the diagnosis and management of mature lymphoid malignancies [^5d8f445f]. Histopathology (2011). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen major advances in flow cytometric immunophenotyping and this has expanded the utility of flow cytometry to investigate the antigens present on normal and neoplastic haematopoietic cells. This review summarizes how flow cytometry is used currently in the diagnosis and management of mature lymphoid malignancies. The establishment of disease-specific phenotypes allows the creation of assays which can detect neoplastic cells with high specificity and sensitivity. Certain lymphoid neoplasms are well defined immunophenotypically, while others are more heterogeneous. The availability of more sophisticated cytometers and a wider selection of antibodies in routine diagnostic laboratories will lead to the resolution of these more complex disease entities.

### A registry study of 240 patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia living in the USA [^b4d64281]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is no doubt that current therapies in XLA patients reduce early mortality, but patients continue to experience complications that impact both organ function and health-related quality of life (Fig. 2 B). Sinopulmonary infections and hospitalizations remain part of the day-to-day life for these patients. Among this cohort of patients, no significant association was detected for IgG dose and/or IgG level and survival, but this is likely due to limited data among those who died.

As patients with XLA live into adulthood, there is a need to establish standards of practice to monitor progression of disease and end organ damage. The cumulative risk of chronic lung disease in XLA has been reported to reach 47% at 50 years of age. Therefore, how should lung function of XLA patients be monitored? Should all patients have periodic CT imaging? What about pulmonary function studies? When should this start and how frequently? Given the gastrointestinal and neurologic manifestations reported, should efforts be directed at identifying biomarkers for these complications? Newborn screening strategies are currently being considered. Earlier diagnosis could allow for early institution of therapies. However, it is clear from this and the longitudinal study of Italian patients that IgG replacement during the lifetime of these patients is not sufficient to control morbidity and mortality. Alternatively, gene therapy strategies are in the horizon. B cell development and function were restored in a murine model of XLA using UCOE-BTK promoter–based lentiviral gene therapy with a recent publication describing its safety and efficacy, and sustained correction of B cell function in these murine models.

### Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections in children: a practical approach to diagnosis [^e8aee46b]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Many children are affected by recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), but the majority of them do not suffer from serious lung or extrapulmonary disease. The challenge for clinicians is to distinguish the recurrent RTIs with self-limiting or minor problems from those with underlying disease. The aim of this review is to describe a practical approach to children with recurrent LRTIs that limits unnecessary, expensive and time-consuming investigations. The children can be divided into three groups on the basis of their personal and family history and clinical findings: 1) otherwise healthy children who do not need further investigations; 2) those with risk factors for respiratory infections for whom a wait-and-see approach can be recommended; and 3) those in whom further investigations are mandatory. However, regardless of the origin of the recurrent LRTIs, it is important to remember that prevention by means of vaccines against respiratory pathogens (i.e. type b Haemophilus influenzae, pertussis, pneumococcal and influenza vaccines) can play a key role.

Tisagenlecleucel immunoglobulin management — observational findings and IVIG considerations are as follows: in a single-center cohort of 12 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia who did not receive prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 2 patients (17%) required IVIG for recurrent sinopulmonary infections between 12 and 22 months after chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) infusion, and approximately one-third recovered immunoglobulins at 12 to 30 months without intervention; IVIG should be considered for patients with hypogammaglobulinemia complicated by recurrent infections and may also be considered when IgG levels are extremely low (especially < 200 mg/ dL), particularly when associated with extremely low IgA levels.

### Hypogammaglobulinemia in children receiving targeted immunotherapies for B lineage malignancies: practical guidance for assessment and management [^d33ed1e2]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypogammaglobulinemia is a well-defined risk factor for infection. B-cell-directed immunotherapies given in addition to conventional chemotherapy are now core elements of effective therapy for children with B lymphoid malignancies. These therapies are associated with depletion of normal B cells and consequent hypogammaglobulinemia. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanism, incidence, and clinical outcomes related to hypogammaglobulinemia in children with mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as provides practical guidance for laboratory monitoring and considerations for immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

IgG replacement therapy in secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — guideline excerpts include the following statements and thresholds. "IVIG as replacement therapy for secondary immunodeficiencies (IgG < 400 mg/dL or specific antibody failure defined as < 2-fold increase in antibody titers to pneumococcal polysaccharide and polypeptide antigen vaccines) with severe or recurrent infections and ineffective antimicrobial treatment". For nonhematologic causes including transplant, guidance lists "IgG < 400 mg/dL regardless of infection frequency/severity" and "IgG > 400 mg/dL, with at least 1 life-threatening infection in the last 12 mo or at least 2 serious infections in the last 6 mo requiring more than standard outpatient antibiotic therapy". In ANCA-associated vasculitis on rituximab maintenance, "Immunoglobulin replacement is conditionally recommended… who have IgG < 300 mg/dL and recurrent severe infections, or without recurrent infections but with impaired vaccine responses". For hematopoietic stem cell transplant, "IVIG should not be routinely administered but may be considered for patients with IgG < 400 mg/ dL". In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, recommendations include "IVIG or SCIG as replacement therapy for IgG < 500 mg/dL and recurrent or severe infection with encapsulated bacteria despite oral antibiotic prophylaxis", and physician guidance indicates use "for IgG < 500 mg/dL, with recurrent sinopulmonary infections requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization". Additional contexts include myeloma in which to "Consider IVIG for patients with HG and recurrent infections", B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia where "IgG-RT should be considered for HG and recurrent bacterial infections and inadequate antibody levels in response to diphtheria, tetanus, or pneumococcal vaccinations", and that "IVIG is FDA-approved for prevention of bacterial infections in HG and/or recurrent bacterial infections".

The parents (subjects I:1 and I:2) were healthy and non-consanguineous and of Dutch-Italian origin (Fig 1, A). Subject II:3, currently 17 years old, was given a diagnosis of monocyclic systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis at the age of 6 years and reactive arthritis at the age of 9 years. Test results for autoantibodies were negative. Her younger sister (subject II:4, currently 12.5 years old) had multiple episodes of reactive arthritis between the ages of 3 and 5 years. In addition, both patients had recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections. Patient II:4 was given a recent diagnosis of juvenile myasthenia gravis confirmed by positive acetylcholine receptor autoantibody levels.

The immunologic workup of patients II:3 and II:4 is provided in Table E1 and Figure E1 in this article's Online Repository at. In summary, patient II:3, who was first examined at the age of 9 years, had absent serum IgA and IgM and severe B lymphopenia (Fig 2, A). Patient II:4, who was first evaluated at 4.5 years of age, had absent IgA but normal IgM levels. Her B-cell counts were initially in the lower normal range but decreased progressively over time (Fig 2, A). Both patients had poor polysaccharide vaccination responses. Total IgG and IgG subclass levels have thus far remained normal. There were no important abnormalities in peripheral T-cell subsets. The youngest sibling (subject II:5) is currently 8 years old and in good health.

### Acute otitis media in children… [^b67a8226]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

A two-year-old child presents to your office with a runny nose and a temperature of 39°C; he's tugging at his right ear. His mother reports that these symptoms have been present for a day. His appetite and fluid intake are good, and while a bit irritable, he does not appear lethargic or toxic. The tympanic membrane is dull but not erythematous. It has limited mobility. What would be the best way to manage this patient's illness. It is also important to distinguish AOM, which may benefit modestly from antibiotics, from otitis media with effusion, which does not. The authors of the guideline strongly recommend that the physician include an assessment of the child's pain, since this assessment is the first step to reducing pain. Too often, patients leave with an antibiotic but without a recommendation for analgesia. The decision to prescribe antibiotics depends on the child's age, the certainty of the diagnosis and the severity of symptoms.

Severe AOM is characterized by severe otalgia and/or a temperature of 39°C or higher. In certain circumstances, provided that follow-up in 48 to 72 hours can be assured and analgesia is provided, observation without antibiotics is an option. 2, 3 and that the risk of complications is no higher with delayed antibiotic treatment. 4 If antibiotics are needed, amoxicillin is recommended as initial management in a dose of 80 mg per kg per day to 90 mg per kg per day for nonsevere illness, and amoxicillin-clavulanate is recommended in a dose of 90 mg per kg per day for children with severe symptoms or for those who need additional coverage for beta lactamase positive H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The illness is not severe, with a low-grade fever and non-specific tugging at his ear. It would be reasonable to provide analgesia in the form of acetaminophen and have the parents observe the child carefully for 48 to 72 hours.

If he does not improve, or shows signs of worsening, they should return for reevaluation. If antibiotics are required and symptoms are not severe, amoxicillin at a dose of 80 mg per kg per day to 90 mg per kg per day is the best choice for non-allergic patients. Acute Otitis Media Encounter Form.

Flow cytometry is a routinely available laboratory method to study cells in suspension from a variety of human sources. Application of this technology as a clinical laboratory method has evolved from the identification of cell-surface proteins to characterizing intracellular proteins and providing multiple different techniques to assess specific features of adaptive and innate immune function. This expanded menu of flow cytometric testing approaches has increased the utility of this platform in characterizing and diagnosing disorders of immune function.

Monitoring immunoglobulin replacement therapy

Dose monitoring and adjustments

Recommendation 23

Following initiation of IgRT, IgG levels should only be measured to assess appropriate dosing of IV or SC IgRT after a minimum of 3 months.

This statement was developed following comments from the first Delphi round (where a number of infusions had been specified rather than a time interval as above). The circulated statements gave the respondents the opportunity to give different responses for IV and SC IgRT, however as both achieved consensus they have been incorporated into a single statement.

On starting IgRT, a number of initial dosing regimens are used. Some clinics employ loading doses over a short period, some start by the IV route and then switch to SC dosing, while others simply start the planned long-term treatment regimen without any initial priming.

Recommendation 24

For the majority of primary immunodeficiency patients, the optimal IgG target should be ≥ 8 g/L (trough for IV, random for SC) to avoid recurrent infection.

Recommendation 25

In some primary immunodeficiency cases (XLA, antibody deficiency with end organ damage/persistent infections) it may be necessary to maintain an IgG level of ≥ 10 g/L (trough for IV, random for SC) to minimise infection or progressive end organ damage.

Recommendation 26

In some secondary immunodeficiency cases, it may be necessary to maintain an IgG level of up to 10 g/L (trough for IV, random for SC) to avoid infection or progressive end organ damage.

Recommendation 27

In primary immunodeficiency patients, immunoglobulin doses should be adjusted according to infection burden and/or progression of organ disease.

Evidence review: One dose comparative study was identified (PID, n = 43) in which the authors suggested that after starting patients on standard dose therapy, dose should be increased if patients developed two or more severe infections per year.

Recommendation 28

If a patient with primary or secondary immunodeficiency is stable and free of infection on IgRT, immunoglobulin dose reduction should be considered. (Children's doses should continue to be weight adjusted.)

The Delphi included two separate recommendations for primary and secondary immunodeficiencies both of which reached consensus and have therefore been combined into a single statement.

Recommendation 29

Patients with primary immunodeficiency treated with IgRT who continue to have a high infection burden despite trough IgG level ≥ 8 g/l should have other treatments optimised (e.g. antibiotic prophylaxis, physical therapy) prior to immunoglobulin dose increase.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — IgG replacement therapy (IgG-RT) initiation thresholds and starting dose include that "an IgG level below 150 mg/dL should certainly warrant initiating IgG-RT", and a "cutoff of 400 mg/dL has been referenced"; "A starting dose of 400 to 600 mg/kg every 4 weeks using actual body weight is accepted practice". Targeting "Target trough IgG levels of 800 mg/dL… is recommended in PI guidelines", while alternatives that "need to be studied" include "400 mg/dL or 500 mg/dL", "700 mg/dL", and "1000 mg/dL in patients with associated bronchiectasis or chronic pulmonary disease".

### Novel presentation of major histocompatibility complex class II deficiency with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^247f08db]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deficiency is one of the combined immune deficiency disorders caused by defects in the MHC class II regulatory genes leading to abnormal T cells development and function. Therefore, patients mainly present with increased susceptibility to infections, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. In this report, we present one MHC class II deficient patient with a novel presentation with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Methods

Immunophenotyping of lymphocyte subpopulations and HLA-DR expression was assess by flow cytometry. Gene mutational analysis was performed by whole exome and Sanger sequencing.

Results

We reported a 7-year-old girl, who was diagnosed at age of 2 years with MHC class II deficiency by genetic testing and flow cytometry. Two years later, she developed disseminated BCGitis which was treated with proper antimicrobial agents. At the age of 7 years, she presented with clinical features fulfilling 6 diagnostic criteria of HLH including evidence of hemophagocytic activity in bone marrow aspiration. Accordingly, the diagnosis of HLH was established and the patient was started on IV Dexamethasone, Anakinra and IVIG. Eventually, patient started to improve and was discharged in good condition. Few months later, the patient was readmitted with severe pneumonia and sepsis leading to death.

Conclusion

Patients with MHC class II deficiency might present with disseminated BCGitis especially if the patient has severe T cell lymphopenia. Additionally, this immune defect might be added to the list of inborn errors of immunity that can be complicated with HLH.

### A rare case report of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS): diagnostic pitfalls [^366bc8aa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Activated PI3K Delta Syndrome (APDS) is a rare autosomal dominant inborn error of immunity (IEI) caused by overactivation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, leading to impaired T- and B-cell differentiation, progressive lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and elevated IgM. Clinically, it presents with early-onset recurrent infections, chronic lymphoproliferation, and autoimmunity, though severity varies widely, from severe childhood disease to asymptomatic adults. The phenotype overlaps with other IEIs such as CVID, CTLA-4 deficiency, NFKB1 deficiency, and STAT3 gain-of-function, often leading to misdiagnosis. Indeed, Rivalta B. et al. described cases initially diagnosed as hyper-IgM syndrome, CVID, or unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia, underscoring the diagnostic challenges.

The suspicion of inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and the diagnosis of APDS are usually delayed. Typically, symptoms of APDS present in early childhood with recurrent infections, particularly involving the lungs, sinuses, and ears. In the most recent cohort reported by Barzaghi F. et al. the classical onset was characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, often mild but frequent, and associated with airway remodelling. Coulter et al. reported that recurrent respiratory tract infections were the most common presentation, observed in 98% of patients, with onset before the age of 7 years. This was followed by recurrent otitis media (48%) and rhinosinusitis (45%). Similarly, Jamee et al. found that the most frequent infections in APDS patients were pneumonia (43.6%), otitis media (28.8%), sinusitis (25.9%), diarrhoea (16%), and eye infections (10.7%). A genotype–phenotype correlation has also been suggested, with sinusitis more commonly reported in APDS1, while pneumonia is more frequently observed in APDS2. Notably, bronchiectasis, a marker of chronic pulmonary damage, has been reported in 28–60% of patients across various cohorts, with a mean age at diagnosis of 8.6 years.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^3965b0d2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial infections, serious and recurrent — epidemiology in HIV-infected children is characterized by high pre-cART rates and substantial declines with cART: Before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was available, serious bacterial infections had an event rate of 15 per 100 child-years; pneumonia was 11 per 100 child-years, bacteremia 3 per 100 child-years, and urinary tract infection 2 per 100 child-years, with other serious infections occurring at rates < 0.2 per 100 child-years and otitis media/sinusitis 17–85 per 100 child-years. Since the advent of cART, the rate of pneumonia has decreased to 2 to 3 per 100 child-years, similar to 3 to 5 per 100 child-years in HIV-uninfected children, and bacteremia/sepsis has decreased to 0.35 to 0.37 per 100 child-years, though still higher than invasive pneumococcal disease in U.S. children (0.018 and 0.0022 per 100 child years for those aged < 5 and 5–17-year-olds, respectively); rates of sinusitis and otitis in cART-treated children are 2.9–3.5 per 100 child-years but remain higher than in HIV-uninfected children.
