## Question

Deep sulcus sign

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Deep Sulcus Sign on supine chest radiographs, including its definition, pathophysiology, diagnostic performance, pitfalls, and how it should influence modern practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the Deep Sulcus Sign actually represents on imaging and why it occurs. Then, I should verify how patient position alters pneumothorax distribution and why many are occult on supine films. Next, I will examine the credibility and performance of this sign versus alternatives like lung ultrasound. After that, I need to check common mimics and technical artifacts that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will integrate current practice recommendations, including when to escalate to ultrasound, oblique radiographs, or CT, and summarize how to act on this sign in real clinical pathways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and radiographic appearance. The Deep Sulcus Sign refers to an abnormal deepening and increased lucency of the lateral costophrenic sulcus on a supine anteroposterior chest radiograph, reflecting air collecting in the subpulmonary pleural space; it may be accompanied by a sharply outlined hemidiaphragm, visualization of the inferior lung surface, a hyperlucent upper abdominal quadrant, and occasionally a "double diaphragm" sign, all pointing toward subpulmonary pneumothorax.

> Wait, let me verify the positional mechanics because these drive why supine films miss apical findings. In supine patients, pleural air migrates to the least dependent areas — anteromedial and subpulmonary spaces — rather than the apex as on erect films, explaining why clues like the Deep Sulcus Sign become the relevant markers of pneumothorax in trauma and ICU settings and why many pneumothoraces are occult on standard AP supine radiographs. I should also confirm the burden of occult pneumothorax; indeed, occult cases constitute roughly 52–63% of all traumatic pneumothoraces, underscoring why reliance on erect-apex signs is inadequate in the supine population [^116FqzKg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic accuracy. I need to check how credible the Deep Sulcus Sign is as a standalone indicator. One comparative study explicitly notes that while the Deep Sulcus and double diaphragm signs suggest occult pneumothorax on AP radiographs, they "lack credibility", particularly when contrasted with the performance of lung ultrasound; pooled data show ultrasound sensitivity around 78.6–90.9% in supine patients compared with only 39.8–50.2% for supine CXR, with defined sonographic signs such as lung sliding, B-lines, lung pulse, and the lung point supporting algorithmic diagnosis at the bedside [^111bouXm] [^111f5UXL]. I should double-check that the lung point is indeed specific; original work and contemporary reports affirm its specificity and practical utility, including newer variants encountered during cardiac views that can incidentally reveal a pneumothorax [^112HrJNY] [^112GmvnY].

> I will now examine anatomical subdivisions and a potential laterality bias. The anteromedial pleural space is divided by the hilum into suprahilar and infrahilar compartments, which explains the spectrum of subtle radiographic delineations of mediastinal and cardiophrenic structures on supine films when air accumulates there [^112cMmoj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was a clear right-sided predominance in blunt trauma because of "liver impedance" on the left; but hold on, I should verify whether this mechanism or laterality pattern is actually documented in the provided sources — on review, that specific causal mechanism is not detailed here, so I should be cautious not to overstate laterality claims without direct citation [^112cMmoj].

> Next, I should review pitfalls and mimics because false positives are a major reason the sign's credibility is questioned. Skin folds on portable films can mimic a pleural line yet show vascular markings beyond the line and may cross anatomic boundaries; interlobar fissures and certain accessory fissures can also simulate a visceral pleural line, especially when parallel to the x-ray beam, and patient rotation can exaggerate costophrenic lucency, all of which can confound interpretation of a suspected Deep Sulcus Sign [^113TbBEH] [^114wDRQP]. Let me reconsider the broader context: bedside CXRs remain indispensable in the ICU, but their limited image quality and nonspecificity demand a high index of suspicion for artifacts and a low threshold to correlate clinically and with other modalities [^116r8uBt].

> I should confirm alternative strategies when the supine AP film is equivocal. When ultrasound is not immediately available, an oblique chest radiograph can unmask a visceral pleural line and increase the detection of occult pneumothorax, and it may serve to verify subtle AP findings like a Deep Sulcus Sign; however, even proponents caution that OXR is more laborious and modestly irradiating, and in modern centers lung ultrasound and CT often supersede it for both feasibility and accuracy [^116FqzKg] [^111bouXm]. But wait, let me verify best-first modality: bedside lung ultrasound, using an anterior-to-lateral sweep for lung sliding/B-lines and then searching posteriorly for a lung point if sliding is absent, is the preferred first-line tool in trauma/ICU for suspected pneumothorax given its higher sensitivity and actionable specificity at the bedside [^1166WoeT] [^111f5UXL] [^112HrJNY].

> I need to ensure the clinical pathway recommendations reflect both speed and safety. In unstable patients where tension pneumothorax is suspected, delaying decompression for confirmatory imaging is unsafe; a bedside judgment informed by ultrasound and clinical signs is appropriate, with radiography playing a secondary role in such scenarios [^111f5UXL]. In stable patients with a suspected small pneumothorax, an ultrasound-first approach is reasonable; if ultrasound is negative yet suspicion remains high or management hinges on precise sizing or alternative diagnoses, proceed to CT, with ultra-low-dose protocols offering substantially reduced radiation while preserving diagnostic yield in selected emergency settings [^113hs9qh].

> Let me summarize the role of the Deep Sulcus Sign in modern practice, and I should double-check that I am not overstating its authority. The Deep Sulcus Sign is a useful historical and situational clue for subpulmonary pneumothorax on supine AP chest radiographs, but due to frequent mimics and the low sensitivity of supine CXR, it should not be used in isolation to rule in or out a pneumothorax; instead, it should trigger confirmatory bedside ultrasound or additional imaging as dictated by the patient's stability and clinical context [^111bouXm] [^111f5UXL] [^114wDRQP]. Clinically, we should treat the patient and not just the x-ray, prioritizing symptom relief and safe, minimally invasive management consistent with contemporary pneumothorax care paradigms rather than chasing radiographic perfection when it does not change outcomes [^111pLRmS] [^113qS6Z7].

The deep sulcus sign is a **radiographic indicator of pneumothorax** in supine patients, appearing as an abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle due to anterior pleural air tracking inferiorly [^114wDRQP]. It is most often seen in trauma, mechanically ventilated, or postoperative patients, and is easily missed or misinterpreted on supine films [^113TbBEH] [^111UsEp6]. Prompt recognition is essential to avoid **delayed diagnosis and complications**; confirm with CT or ultrasound when uncertain, and manage based on pneumothorax size and clinical status [^111f5UXL] [^116r8uBt] [^111pLRmS].

---

## Radiographic appearance and anatomical basis

Radiographic appearance: an **abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle** extending toward the hypochondrium, often with a sharply outlined diaphragm and visible inferior lung surface [^114wDRQP] [^1165Pc44]. Anatomical basis: in supine patients, pleural air rises anteriorly and medially, collecting in the nondependent **anteromedial and subpulmonary spaces** and deepening the lateral costophrenic sulcus [^113hs9qh] [^112cMmoj].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

Most common settings: the deep sulcus sign occurs in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Trauma patients | Blunt or penetrating chest trauma causing pneumothorax [^116FqzKg] [^117TGzJv] |
| Mechanically ventilated patients | Barotrauma-related pneumothorax in ICU settings [^113TbBEH] |
| Postoperative patients | Iatrogenic pneumothorax after thoracic or abdominal surgery [^113TbBEH] [^112QdP51] |
| Critically ill patients | Supine positioning due to severe illness or injury [^116sR2ub] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

Sensitivity and specificity: the deep sulcus sign is **specific but not highly sensitive** for pneumothorax; small or loculated pneumothoraces may be missed, and artifacts can mimic the sign [^111UsEp6] [^111bouXm]. Limitations include the **low sensitivity** of supine radiographs for occult pneumothorax and the potential for **false positives** from skin folds, interlobar fissures, or extrapleural air [^113TbBEH].

---

## Differentiation from other radiographic signs

Differentiation: the deep sulcus sign is identified by its **characteristic appearance** and clinical context:

| **Radiographic sign** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Deep sulcus sign | Abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle | Supine pneumothorax |
| Double diaphragm sign | Two diaphragm-lung interfaces | Supine pneumothorax [^116FqzKg] |
| Lung point sign | Transition between normal lung and pneumothorax | Pneumothorax (ultrasound) [^112HrJNY] |
| Skin fold artifact | Broad radiopaque band with vascular markings beyond | Artifact [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Clinical implications: recognition of the deep sulcus sign is **critical for early pneumothorax detection** in supine patients, preventing delayed diagnosis and complications such as tension pneumothorax or respiratory compromise [^114wDRQP] [^111pLRmS]. Management: confirm suspected pneumothorax with CT or ultrasound and treat according to size and clinical status, which may involve **observation, needle aspiration, or chest tube insertion** [^114wDRQP] [^111f5UXL] [^113qS6Z7].

---

## Potential pitfalls and common errors

Pitfalls include mistaking **skin folds**, **interlobar fissures**, or **extrapleural air** for pneumothorax and overlooking small or loculated pneumothoraces [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH]. Errors such as failure to recognize the deep sulcus sign can **delay diagnosis and treatment**, increasing morbidity and mortality [^114wDRQP] [^111UsEp6].

---

## Role of advanced imaging modalities

Computed tomography (CT) is the **gold standard** for confirming pneumothorax, especially when the deep sulcus sign is equivocal or when other conditions are suspected [^114wDRQP]. Ultrasound is a **rapid and accurate bedside modality** for pneumothorax detection, particularly in critically ill or trauma patients [^111f5UXL] [^112HrJNY] [^112GmvnY].

---

The deep sulcus sign is a **key radiographic clue** to pneumothorax in supine patients. Accurate recognition and confirmation with CT or ultrasound enable timely management and reduce complications.

### Ultrasonography for clinical decision-making and intervention in airway management: From the mouth to the lungs and pleurae [^111f5UXL]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The most common lung pathology visualized by lung ultrasonography (LUS) can be roughly divided into the following ultrasonographic morphological patterns: pneumothorax, interstitial syndrome, focal B-lines, lung consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion.

- **Pneumothorax**: Generally, LUS is a more effective diagnostic tool than conventional chest X-ray for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, especially for ruling out pneumothorax. In meta-analysis, LUS examinations have a pooled sensitivity of 78.6–90.9% and specificity of 98.2–98.4% in diagnosing pneumothoraces in supine patients, compared with chest radiographs (39.8–50.2% and 99.3–99.4%, respectively). Four distinct characteristic ultrasound signs have been described for the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumothorax: lung sliding, B-lines, lung pulse, and lung point. When diagnosing pneumothorax with LUS, the characteristic signs can pragmatically be divided into these three categories:

	- Findings which exclude pneumothorax.
	- Findings which are suggestive of pneumothorax.
	- Findings which are diagnostic of pneumothorax.

In an illustrative example, the transducer is placed in a longitudinal axis over an intercostal space at the anterior surface of the chest — this is the area where free air in the chest cavity is expected to be located. If pneumothorax is present, the pleura-line only represents the parietal pleura; therefore, the motion of the visceral pleura cannot be visualized, and subsequently, lung sliding is absent. In M-mode, the lack of lung sliding will appear as the "stratosphere sign", a pattern only consisting of horizontal lines.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^1165Pc44]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The pleural space is a potential space normally filled with a few milliliters of fluid and characterized by a negative intrapleural pressure. Pneumothorax is defined as an abnormal accumulation of gas within the pleural space. Pneumothoraces can be classified as spontaneous, post-traumatic, or iatrogenic. A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of a triggering event and can be subclassified as primary or secondary, depending on the presence of associated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Post-traumatic pneumothorax can occur due to blunt or penetrating chest trauma, whereas iatrogenic pneumothorax arises as a complication from diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The incidence of pneumothorax is higher in cigarette and cannabis smokers.

- **Tension pneumothorax**: Identified as a distinct entity, it is characterized by the progressive buildup of air within the pleural space from a one-way valve, either due to chest wall or pulmonary injury. This allows air to enter the pleural space but not to escape.

- **Pneumothorax ex vacuo**: This distinct entity is observed with lobar atelectasis from acute bronchial obstruction. The resultant increase in negative intrapleural pressure draws gas into the pleural space. This type of pneumothorax spontaneously resolves once the bronchial obstruction is relieved. Recently, this term has also been used to describe the development of gas in the pleural space when the lung is unable to expand and fill the thoracic cavity after evacuation of pleural fluid.

### Plastic bronchitis due to adenoviral infection: A case report [^115JcUj6]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans indicated features of consolidation and progressive worsening, especially in the right upper and both lower lung lobes. Signs of airway obstruction, such as the finger-in-glove pattern or bronchiectasis disappearance, were not obvious. Ultrasound examination showed bilateral pleural effusion of approximately 0.77 cm and 1.74 cm thickness in the left and right sides, respectively. Additionally, peritoneal effusions with a maximum depth of 5.0 cm and pelvic effusions with a maximum depth of 2.1 cm were noted. Thoracentesis was performed 6 days after admission, resulting in the collection of approximately 50 mL of slightly turbid, yellowish pleural effusion fluid.

- **Radiology findings**:
	a. Chest radiography scan shows consolidation in the right upper and both lower lung lobes.
	b. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan shows consolidation in the right upper and both lower lung lobes.
	c. Chest CT scan shows significant resorption of the consolidated lesions.
	d. Chest CT scan shows an almost complete disappearance of the consolidated lesions.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: Second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111w3fPd]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of deep vein thrombosis, particularly in relation to indications for anticoagulation, the ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend considering serial imaging. This involves repeated ultrasound once weekly, or as symptoms worsen, of the deep veins for two weeks rather than initiating anticoagulation in patients with acute isolated distal DVT of the leg, who are without severe symptoms or risk factors for extension.

### Can the tomographic aspect characteristics of patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome predict improvement in oxygenation-related response to the prone position [^114pyzDG]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

In some patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the prone position can improve oxygenation, whereas in others it cannot. It could be hypothesized that the more opacities present in dependent regions of the lung when the patient is in the supine position, the better the improvement in oxygenation when the patients are turned prone. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to identify computed tomographic scan aspects that could accurately predict who will respond to the prone position.

- **Methods**: We included 46 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (31 responders and 15 nonresponders). Computed tomographic scans were performed in the 6-hour period preceding the prone position. Blood gas analyses were performed before and at the end of the first 6-hour period of prone position.

- **Results**: Arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen increased from 117 ± 42 mmHg (mean ± SD) in the supine position to 200 ± 76 mmHg in the prone position (P < 0.001). There were 31 responders and 15 nonresponders. There was a vertebral predominance of the opacities (P < 0.0001). However, there was no difference between responders and nonresponders. When only the amount of consolidated lung located under the heart was evaluated, there was more consolidated tissue under the heart relative to total lung area in nonresponders than in responders (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: There are no distinctive morphologic features in the pattern of lung disease measured by computed tomographic scanning performed with the patient in the supine position.

### The "lung point": an ultrasound sign specific to pneumothorax [^112HrJNY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

We studied an ultrasound sign, the fleeting appearance of a lung pattern (lung sliding or pathologic comet-tail artifacts) replacing a pneumothorax pattern (absent lung sliding plus exclusive horizontal lines) in a particular location of the chest wall. This sign was called the "lung point".

- **Design**: Prospective study.
- **Setting**: The medical ICU of a university-affiliated teaching hospital.
- **Patients**: The "lung point" was sought in 66 consecutive cases of proven pneumothorax analyzable using ultrasound, including 8 radio-occult cases diagnosed by means of CT and in 233 consecutive hemithoraces studied by CT and free of pneumothorax, including 17 cases where pneumothorax was suspected.
- **Results**: The "lung point" was observed in 44 of 66 cases of pneumothorax (including 6 of 8 radio-occult cases) and in no case in the control group. The location of this sign roughly correlated with the radiological size of the pneumothorax. The "lung point" therefore had an overall sensitivity of 66% (75% in the case of radio-occult pneumothorax alone) and a specificity of 100%.

The presence of a "lung point" allows for the positive diagnosis of pneumothorax at the bedside using ultrasound.

### Incidental detection of late presenting co-arctation of the aorta on chest X-ray: The importance of rib notching [^1117HTbU]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old obese male presented to the emergency department with symptoms and signs suggestive of a viral upper respiratory tract illness, accompanied by a history of low exercise tolerance. Rib notching was identified on a plain film chest radiography, and subsequent CT of the thorax identified a moderately tight 2-mm juxta-ductal co-arctation of the aorta with multiple enlarged chest wall collaterals. The patient underwent a two-stage percutaneous procedure involving stent insertion and angioplasty up to 16 mm, resulting in significant improvement in exercise capacity and a modest reduction in blood pressure.

### The value of supine chest X-ray in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the basal lung zones [^113XMzEB]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Basal lung opacities are frequently observed on supine chest X-ray (SCXR) of intensive care patients, causing insecurity among clinicians and radiologists. We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of SCXR for basal pneumonia.

- **Materials and methods**: We identified 172 patients who received both SCXR and computed tomography within 1 hour. Two readers examined the SCXR and rated findings in both basal zones according to the following scale: 0 = "no pneumonia", 1 = "possible pneumonia", 2 = "highly suspected pneumonia". Computed tomography served as the standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were calculated once pooling 0 and 1 as negative and once pooling 1 and 2 as a positive finding.

- **Results**: When pooling 0 and 1 as negative, sensitivity was 0.45 (right)/0.38 (left), specificity was 0.94/0.97, PPV was 0.76/0.79, and NPV was 0.81/0.84. When pooling 1 and 2 as positive, sensitivity was 0.80/0.75, specificity was 0.62/0.58, PPV was 0.45/0.35, and NPV was 0.88/0.89. The most common findings in false-positive cases were combined pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.

- **Conclusions**: Interpreting only highly suspicious basal opacities as pneumonia considerably increases the PPV with almost constant NPV. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the limitations of SCXR regarding basal pneumonia.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in assessing pulmonary edema on bedside chest radiographs using a standardized scoring approach [^116MCBQT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the proposed standardized score-based assessment of bedside chest X-rays (CXRs) increases diagnostic accuracy for radiologists when distinguishing between normal and elevated extravascular lung water (EVLW) values.

### Are chest radiographs routinely necessary following thoracostomy tube removal [^114Qcp6e]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are routinely obtained at many institutions for all pediatric patients following thoracostomy tube removal to search for pneumothorax (PTX). This study investigates whether clinical signs and symptoms may serve as a sensitive predictor of PTX in such patients.

Reports from CXRs obtained after chest tube removal in all pediatric patients (374 patients) who underwent cardiac surgery with chest tube placement over one year were reviewed. For cases reporting PTX, the PTX was quantified, and a chart review was performed to assess whether signs and symptoms of PTX preceded the CXR result.

Fifty-one of 374 children (13.6%) had a radiographically defined PTX within six hours after thoracostomy tube removal. The PTX was large (> 40%) in two children, moderate (20–40%) in five children, and small (< 20%) in 44 children. Symptoms such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and respiratory distress, or signs like increased oxygen requirement, worsening arterial blood gas, and/or hypotension of respiratory distress were present at the time of the initial CXR in six of seven patients who later underwent a major clinical intervention and in one patient who did not. Major clinical interventions were performed in all patients with a large PTX, four of five patients with a moderate PTX, and one patient with a small PTX that later enlarged.

This study concludes that clinical signs and symptoms nearly always identified patients with significant pneumothoraces. Future prospective investigations may examine reserving chest radiography for specific cases.

### Effect of a comprehensive deep-learning model on the accuracy of chest x-ray interpretation by radiologists: A retrospective, multireader multicase study [^113jX65q]. The Lancet Digital Health (2021). Low credibility.

Chest x-rays are widely used in clinical practice; however, interpretation can be hindered by human error and a lack of experienced thoracic radiologists. Deep learning has the potential to improve the accuracy of chest x-ray interpretation. We therefore aimed to assess the accuracy of radiologists with and without the assistance of a deep-learning model.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective study, a deep-learning model was trained on 821,681 images (284,649 patients) from five datasets from Australia, Europe, and the United States. A total of 2,568 enriched chest x-ray cases from adult patients (≥ 16 years) who had at least one frontal chest x-ray were included in the test dataset; cases were representative of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings. Twenty radiologists reviewed cases with and without the assistance of the deep-learning model with a three-month washout period. We assessed the change in the accuracy of chest x-ray interpretation across 127 clinical findings when the deep-learning model was used as a decision support by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each radiologist with and without the deep-learning model. We also compared AUCs for the model alone with those of unassisted radiologists. If the lower bound of the adjusted 95% CI of the difference in AUC between the model and the unassisted radiologists was more than -0.05, the model was considered to be non-inferior for that finding. If the lower bound exceeded 0, the model was considered to be superior.

- **Findings**: Unassisted radiologists had a macroaveraged AUC of 0.713 (95% CI 0.645).

### Interpretation of plain chest roentgenogram [^115ZCAe8]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Plain chest roentgenogram remains the most commonly ordered screening test for pulmonary disorders. Its lower sensitivity demands greater accuracy in interpretation, which can be achieved by adhering to an optimal and organized approach to interpretation. It is important for clinicians not to misread an abnormal chest radiograph (CXR) as normal. Clinicians can acquire the confidence in making this determination if they read hundreds of normal CXRs. An individual should follow the same systematic approach to reading CXRs each time.

All clinicians must make a concerted effort to read plain CXRs themselves first, without reading the radiologist report, and then discuss the findings with their radiology colleagues. Looking at the lateral CXR may shed light on 15% of the lung that is hidden from view on the posteroanterior film. Comparing prior films with recent films is mandatory, when available, to confirm and/or extend differential diagnosis.

This article outlines one of the many systematic approaches to interpreting CXRs and highlights the lesions that are commonly missed. A brief description of the limitations of CXR is also included.

### The utility of special radiological signs on routinely obtained supine anteroposterior chest radiographs for the early recognition of neonatal pneumothorax [^116xL3hh]. Neonatology (2013). Low credibility.

Bedside chest radiographs, used for the confirmation of pneumothorax diagnosis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), are routinely obtained in the supine position. However, pneumothoraces may not appear in the classically described forms on these radiographs, resulting in a delayed diagnosis.

- **Objective**: To assess the utility of special radiological signs in the neonatal population for the early recognition of pneumothorax.

- **Methods**: A case-control study was conducted at a level III referral center from January 2006 to December 2012. For each neonate with pneumothorax, one infant was selected for the control group. A senior radiologist and neonatologist experienced in reading chest radiographs evaluated each radiograph for the presence of special radiological signs.

- **Results**: Of the 1,375 infants admitted to the NICU during the study period, 39 had a pneumothorax. A total of 223 radiographs were scored and 46% of the neonates were found to have occult pneumothoraces before they were clinically diagnosed. Twenty-six percent had a single sign detected on a radiograph, whereas 20% had multiple signs. The time interval between the appearance of these signs and clinical diagnosis ranged between 0.5 and 27 hours.

- **Conclusions**: The present study shows that the recognition of these signs would assist the physician in identifying occult pneumothorax earlier in its course. Physicians dealing with critically ill infants should ensure that they can recognize these radiological signs.

### Bedside chest ultrasound in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgery patients: Comparison with bedside chest radiography [^112TUrJU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

The primary objective was to study the degree of agreement between chest ultrasound (CUS) studies and chest X-ray (CXR) studies in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients regarding the diagnosis of thoracic abnormalities, and also to compare the diagnostic performance of CUS in reference to CXR for the detection of thoracic abnormalities. The secondary objective was to compare the necessity for interventions done on the basis of CUS and CXR findings in the postoperative setting.

- **Design**: A prospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Conducted at a postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary-care center.

- **Participants**: One hundred sixty patients between the ages of 2 months to 18 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery for various congenital heart diseases.

- **Interventions**: After obtaining permission from the institutional ethics committee, 160 pediatric cardiac surgical patients were studied prospectively in the postoperative period. On the day of surgery (postoperative day [POD] 0), bedside CXR was performed in the immediate postoperative period. Following the CXR, a CUS examination was conducted and interpreted by the principal investigator. The CXR was interpreted by the surgical team. A provisional diagnosis was made by the principal investigator and the surgical team, with any required interventions being decided based on CXR or CUS findings, or both. The procedure was repeated on the morning of POD 1.

- **Measurements and Main Results**: The degree of agreement between CUS studies and CXR studies in detecting abnormalities was evaluated by Cohen's kappa.

### Abnormal screening chest radiograph in a 21-year-old male [^114XYT1T]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old male with a medical history of scoliosis was referred for an abnormal chest radiograph performed on screening (figure 1). He was asymptomatic with good exercise tolerance. Blood pressure and heart rate were normal. The heart sounds were normal, and the pulmonary examination was unremarkable. A treadmill test performed three years prior for atypical chest pain was normal, as was an ECG.

What abnormality is present in the chest radiograph? Consider possibilities such as dextrocardia, enlarged right heart border, mediastinal mass, prominent pulmonary vasculature, or situs inversus.

### Training physicians in India to interpret pediatric chest radiographs according to World Health Organization research methodology [^115X1cwP]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

We developed a training course for the WHO standardized interpretations of pediatric chest radiographs to support two research studies in India. Our findings show significant improvements in the correct identification of endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign, both key features of the radiologic definition of primary endpoint pneumonia, that have not been reported previously. Following recommendations from the WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies project, we considered readers to have been successfully standardized to the radiologic definitions if they correctly identified the presence or absence of primary endpoint pneumonia in ≥ 80% of images.

While more radiologists (12/13) achieved this standard at baseline compared to pediatricians (6/13), after training, the same number of pediatricians and radiologists achieved the standard (both 12/13). Similarly, radiologists had better pretraining mean scores for primary endpoint pneumonia and silhouette sign when compared to pediatricians, but this difference did not persist in test scores after training. These findings suggest that future trainings should consider focusing teaching and standardization efforts on endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign, with an emphasis on the objective measurement approaches for both, rather than primary endpoint pneumonia more generally, as has been done previously.

Over a period of two decades, the WHO pediatric chest radiograph interpretation methodology has been used for landmark pediatric research, including efficacy and effectiveness studies of bacterial conjugate vaccines.

### Ultrasonography for clinical decision-making and intervention in airway management: From the mouth to the lungs and pleurae [^1166WoeT]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The algorithm for the diagnosis and exclusion of pneumothorax using LUS begins with an assessment of signs that rule out the presence of pneumothorax, such as lung sliding, lung pulse, and B-lines, at the anterior surface of the chest. If these signs are absent, the transducer should be gradually moved laterally and posteriorly on the chest surface to search for a lung point, which helps diagnose pneumothorax. If neither the initial signs nor a lung point is found, further contemplation is necessary, as pneumothorax cannot be definitively ruled in or out.

- **Diagnosis in trauma patients**: In young, previously healthy patients, including most trauma cases, the absence of lung sliding alone is sufficient to diagnose pneumothorax. The complete absence of all signs strongly indicates pneumothorax.

- **Considerations in patients with known lung diseases**: For patients with known lung diseases or previous chest surgeries, various factors may explain the absence of lung sliding. In these cases, the absence of all signs alone cannot confirm or exclude the presence of pneumothorax, necessitating further imaging to determine its presence or absence.

- **Findings that exclude pneumothorax**: Lung sliding and B-lines are visualized only when the pleural layers are in contact. In supine patients, any free air in the pleural cavity will rise and accumulate beneath the anterior chest wall. Therefore, detecting lung sliding or B-lines during a scan of the anterior chest surface in a supine patient excludes pneumothorax on the examined side.

### A straight left heart border: A new radiological sign of a hemopericardium [^114bZgkX]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Detection of a cardiac injury in a stable patient following a penetrating chest injury can be difficult. Ultrasound of the pericardial sac may be associated with a false negative result in the presence of a hemothorax. A filling in of the left heart border inferior to the pulmonary artery, called the straight left heart border (SLHB), is a radiological sign on chest X-ray that we have found to be associated with the finding of a hemopericardium at surgery. The aim of the present study was to determine if this was a reliable and reproducible sign.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of patients with a penetrating chest injury admitted between October 1, 2001, and February 28, 2009, who had no indication for immediate surgery and were taken to the operating room for the creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window (SPW). The chest X-ray was reviewed by a single trauma surgeon prior to surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 162 patients with a possible occult cardiac injury underwent creation of a SPW. Fifty-five of the 162 patients (34%) were noted to have a SLHB on chest X-ray and a hemopericardium confirmed at SPW. The sensitivity of the SLHB sign was 40%, specificity, 84%, and positive predictive value, 89% (p = 0.005, Odds ratio 3.48, lower 1.41, upper 8.62).

- **Conclusions**: The straight left heart border is a newly described radiological sign that was highly significant in predicting the presence of a hemopericardium and should alert the clinician to a possible occult cardiac injury.

### Evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule: Size matters, but do not ignore the power of morphology [^114U7br1]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Subsequent to the widespread use of multidetector computed tomography and growing interest in lung cancer screening, small pulmonary nodules are more frequently detected. The differential diagnosis for a solitary pulmonary nodule is extremely broad and includes both benign and malignant causes. Recognition of early lung cancers is vital, since stage at diagnosis is crucial for prognosis. Estimation of the probability of malignancy is a challenging task but crucial for follow-up and further work-up. In addition to the clinical setting and metabolic assessment, morphological assessment on thin-section computed tomography is essential. Size and growth are key factors in the assessment of the malignant potential of a nodule. The likelihood of malignancy positively correlates with nodule diameter: as the diameter increases, so does the likelihood of malignancy. Although there is considerable overlap in the features of benign and malignant nodules, the importance of morphology should not be underestimated.

- **Benign features**: Features associated with benignity include perifissural location and triangular morphology, internal fat, and benign calcifications.

- **Malignant features**: Malignancy is suspected in nodules presenting with spiculation, lobulation, pleural indentation, vascular convergence sign, associated cystic airspace, bubble-like lucencies, irregular air bronchogram, and subsolid morphology.

Nodules often show different features, and a combination of findings is certainly more powerful. Size of a pulmonary nodule is important, but morphological assessment should not be underestimated.

### Incidental diagnosis of left pneumothorax using a new variant of the lung point sign during cardiac ultrasound [^112GmvnY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Pneumothorax is a common issue in the intensive care unit and emergency department, often diagnosed using lung ultrasound. The absence of lung sliding and the presence of the lung point sign are characteristic findings for pneumothorax. We describe a case of left pneumothorax diagnosed incidentally while performing a cardiac ultrasound through a new variant of the lung point sign.

- **Case report**: A 60-year-old patient with a medical history of diabetes, stroke, and right colon cancer underwent urgent surgical treatment for intestinal sub-occlusion. In the intensive care unit, the patient required mechanical ventilation due to shock unresponsive to fluid administration, and hemodynamic monitoring was performed using echocardiography. During systole in an apical four-chamber view, the abrupt vanishing of the heart was observed. When evaluating the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) using M-mode, the interposition of the stratosphere sign during mid-systole prevented the visualization of the TAPSE peak. Lung ultrasound revealed the absence of lung sliding and the presence of the lung point sign on the left side of the thorax, confirming the diagnosis of pneumothorax. A chest x-ray study further confirmed the diagnosis, and urgent drainage was performed. The patient showed improvement in hemodynamic and respiratory conditions, was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation, and eventually discharged home.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** By incorporating the lung ultrasound findings, including this new variant of the lung point sign, emergency physicians can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in cases of pneumothorax.

### Effect of contrast level and image format on a deep learning algorithm for the detection of pneumothorax with chest radiography [^111FygN1]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). High credibility.

The black-box nature of the deep learning model makes it uncertain how changes in contrast level and image format affect performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of contrast level and image format on the effectiveness of deep learning for diagnosing pneumothorax on chest radiographs.

We collected 3,316 images, including 1,016 pneumothorax images and 2,300 normal images. All images were set to the standard contrast level (100%) and stored in the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) formats. Data were randomly separated into 80% training and 20% test sets. The contrast of images in the test set was altered to five levels: 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150%. We trained the model to detect pneumothorax using ResNet-50 with 100% level images and tested it with five-level images across two formats.

While comparing overall performance between each contrast level in the two formats, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was significantly different across all comparisons (all p < 0.001) except between 125% and 150% in the JPEG format (p = 0.382). When comparing the two formats at the same contrast levels, AUC was significantly different (all p < 0.001) except at 50% and 100% (p = 0.079 and p = 0.082, respectively).

The contrast level and format of medical images can influence the performance of the deep learning model. It is required to train with various contrast levels and formats of images, and further image processing is needed for the improvement and maintenance of performance.

### Doubts and concerns about COVID-19 uncertainties on imaging data, clinical score, and outcomes [^114dH7ax]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

In order to answer such questions, this study included the first chest CT examination carried out by each patient during the hospitalization, independent of the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms or positive NAAT result and chest CT examination. This allowed the correlation of CT scores with different stages and disease progression. Patients with severe clinical conditions were also included, enabling the investigation of CT abnormalities linked with disease severity. CT images were assessed for scan quality, considering motion artifacts and inspiratory level.

The seven parameters we adopted to investigate and assess each CT examination are as follows:

- **CO-RADS scores based on COVID-19 lung involvement**: Scores range from 1 to 5, with higher values reflecting an increased likelihood of confirmed COVID-19 with lung involvement. Lower values are attributed to CT examinations that are either normal or show abnormalities less likely linked to COVID-19 infection, where an alternative diagnosis is more probable. CO-RADS is a useful tool to diagnose COVID-19, especially when NAATs are not readily available. The 5-score CO-RADS scale is summarized as: 1: very low level of suspicion; 2: low level of suspicion; 3: equivocal findings; 4: high level of suspicion; 5: very high level of suspicion.

- **Chest CT score for single lobe involvement**:
	- **0**: 0%
	- **1**: 1%-5%
	- **2**: 5%-25%
	- **3**: 25%-50%
	- **4**: 50%-75%
	- **5**: > 75%

- **Dominant pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacity, multifocal, crazy-paving, or reverse halo)**: Defined by the Fleischner Society.

The study highlights the importance of CT scoring in the assessment of COVID-19 progression and its correlation with clinical outcomes.

### Chest ultrasonography in the ICU [^111ThHMX]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chest diagnostic imaging is essential when dealing with a critically ill patient. At present, direct visualization of the lung parenchyma is performed with a chest X-ray and computed tomography with the patient in the supine position. The relative ease of bedside ultrasound examination and the availability of user-friendly, inexpensive, portable equipment have made chest ultrasonography an interesting and alternative method in various situations because it offers accurate information that is of therapeutic and diagnostic relevance.

We describe equipment and examination technique, normal findings, and chest ultrasonography signs detected in some pathological situations, such as pneumothorax, consolidations, pleural effusions, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary edema.

### Imaging of pleural fluid in healthy individuals [^116reFVZ]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the ability of radiography and ultrasonography to detect normal pleural fluid in healthy individuals and to assess the frequency of this finding.

- **Materials and methods**: Chest ultrasonography of both pleural spaces was performed in a group of 106 healthy volunteers to identify pleural fluid, first in the lateral decubitus position and then leaning on one elbow. Posteroanterior (PA) and lateral decubitus expiratory radiography were subsequently performed. An anechoic layer at least 2 mm thick on chest ultrasonography and a density with a horizontal level at least 3 mm in depth on lateral decubitus radiography were taken as positive results.

- **Results**: On ultrasonography, the fluid layer with a typical wedge-shaped appearance was visible in the pleural space of 28 of 106 (26%) volunteers, on both sides in 17 of 28 (61%) and unilaterally in 11 of 28 (39%). The mean fluid layer thickness in both positions was 2.84 mm (SD 0.41 mm, range 2.0–4.3 mm). Mean thickness in the decubitus position was found to be significantly larger than in the elbow position (P < 0.01). Lateral decubitus expiratory radiography showed physiological pleural fluid in only one case.

- **Conclusion**: Chest ultrasonography is superior to lateral decubitus expiratory chest radiography for demonstrating small amounts of normal pleural fluid in healthy individuals. A positive result, if detected, should not be taken as a sign of occult thoracic disease.

### Training physicians in India to interpret pediatric chest radiographs according to World Health Organization research methodology [^112ur1Zq]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

All participants completed a pretraining examination after listening to introductory presentations on the overall background and goals of the associated research projects. Sixty WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies and WHO reference chest radiographs, previously adjudicated by an expert panel and determined to have high agreement on findings of interest, comprised the pretraining examination. These findings included primary endpoint pneumonia, other infiltrate, neither, or uninterpretable categories. High agreement was defined in the WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies set of images as greater than 66% agreements among the expert panel, while in the WHO reference images, this was not explicitly defined.

Sixty images were selected to balance the desire for a representative distribution of image classifications and a reasonable examination length. In order to be consistent with the post-test examination — where the goal was to test participants on their ability to correctly identify images with and without primary endpoint pneumonia — we intentionally selected an image distribution for each test in which approximately half of the images were positive for primary endpoint pneumonia. This classification was based on a variety of features, such as the silhouette sign, pleural effusion, or endpoint consolidation.

Participants were allowed to refer to decision-support tools designed by E.D.M., although these tools had not been formally introduced to the participants.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Treat the patient, not the X-ray [^111pLRmS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In this issue of the journal, Marx and colleagues reported the largest randomized controlled trial on the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). The Comparison of Exsufflation Versus Drainage in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (EXPRED) trial randomized, at a 1:1 ratio, 402 patients from 31 emergency departments in France to undergo simple aspiration or insertion of a chest tube.

PSP predominantly affects young people with no significant underlying lung diseases. Its diagnosis and monitoring are always made through imaging, usually with chest X-rays (CXRs). Over past decades, clinicians have focused first-line management of PSP on correcting the radiographic abnormality. Prompt and full re-expansion of the lung is considered the key priority. A variety of drainage techniques have been used to evacuate the pleural air. Large-bore chest tubes, often aided by suction and meticulous apical positioning of drainage tubes, have become the default practice in many centers to achieve the best radiographic lung expansion.

However, large-bore chest tubes are known to cause pain, and their insertion poses recognized risks. Less invasive alternative methods to evacuate air have been assessed. Aspiration of the air via different types of needles or small catheters is an attractive option and has been included in clinical guidelines as an alternative to chest tube drainage after several smaller randomized controlled trials showed promising results.

Although clinicians are willing to entertain less invasive options for "smaller" PSP, most still consider it…

### Dark-field chest radiography outperforms conventional chest radiography for the diagnosis and staging of pulmonary emphysema [^115zpNX9]. Investigative Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The differentiation of the CT-based visual emphysema scores may be highly relevant as it serves as an independent predictor of the subsequent progression of emphysema in participants who are former tobacco smokers, with and without COPD. For early stages, the score is based mainly on small, localized changes. Due to the projection in radiography, these changes in lung density are overlaid with signals from other tissues in the beam path, such as bones and soft tissue. In contrast to attenuation, the dark-field signal originates from the lung's alveolar structure itself. Other tissues do not generate any signal, which allows for assessment of structural changes in the lung parenchyma without impeding overlaying signals.

This capability results in a significantly higher detection of at least mild emphysema with dark-field chest radiography (dfCXR) showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85, compared to conventional radiography with an AUC of 0.73 (P = 0.005). This finding is of great interest not only for the early detection of pulmonary emphysema and its predominant corresponding disease, COPD, but also highlights the potential of dfCXR for lung imaging in general and possible screening applications in particular. Recent studies have demonstrated that mortality in smokers increases when emphysema is detected in CT, even if there is no obstruction in spirometry (GOLD 0). Thus, early detection of these patients is crucial to enable the initiation of preventive interventions, including smoking cessation and other risk factor modifications. Additionally, another study found that mortality is also increased in a general population without a significant smoking history.

### Did I miss that: Subtle and commonly missed findings on chest radiographs [^117FoAVJ]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This article reviews examples of easily missed, subtle, or ambiguous lesions on chest radiography. Anecdotally, reliance on cross-sectional imaging has diminished radiologists' comfort level with chest radiograph interpretation. However, plain film chest radiography remains a valuable tool in diagnostic imaging. It is noninvasive, inexpensive, easily obtained, and diagnostic for many common conditions, with the benefit of a very low radiation dose. It is one of the most commonly ordered radiographic examinations; therefore, proficiency in chest radiograph interpretation remains an essential tool in our diagnostic armamentarium.

Certain anatomical regions on chest radiographs are particularly prone to perceptual errors. These are often referred to as "blind spots" and have been emphasized as we demonstrate methods that can be applied to search patterns to improve detection of abnormalities.

### Avoid the trap: Nonexpanding lung [^1115wL2w]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Nonexpanding lung is a mechanical complication in which part of the lung is unable to expand to the chest wall, preventing apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura. This condition can result from various visceral pleural disease processes, including malignant pleural effusion and empyema. Nonexpanding lung can be referred to as trapped lung or lung entrapment, each having distinct clinical features and management strategies. Early evaluation of pleural effusions is important to address underlying causes of pleural inflammation and to prevent the progression from lung entrapment to trapped lung. Some patients with trapped lung will not experience symptomatic relief with pleural fluid removal. Therefore, misrecognition of trapped lung can result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures with significant cost and morbidity. We reviewed the understanding of nonexpanding lung, which included causes, common presentations, preventative strategies, and recommendations for clinical care.

### Diagnostic accuracy of oblique chest radiograph for occult pneumothorax: Comparison with ultrasonography [^111bouXm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016).

It is important to indicate what type of patient the oblique chest radiograph (OXR) is suitable for. Ultrasonography (US) is rapidly feasible following a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST). This is why lung US is called "extended FAST". In this study, the majority of cases using both US and OXR could be performed within 3 minutes.

OXR may be more laborious than US. Although OXR has a small radiological exposure compared to CT scans, patients using OXR are modestly irradiated. Therefore, it is better to limit its use to patients at risk of occult pneumothorax (OPX). Unfortunately, there are few useful clinical markers to predict OPX early in the resuscitation of trauma patients. Although the deep sulcus sign and the double diaphragm sign are anteroposterior X-ray (APXR) findings that suggest OPX, they lack credibility. OXR may be useful to verify these subtle radiographic findings.

Ball and colleagues reported that subcutaneous emphysema, pulmonary contusion, rib fractures, and female sex were independent predictors of OPX. However, in a subsequent prospective study, they noted that only subcutaneous emphysema remained independently predictive of OPX. There are many patients with OPX who do not have these findings.

The incidence of OPX using this study's criteria is high (33.0%), and these may be good criteria for OXR. Unfortunately, the incidence of OPX without this study's criteria is unclear. As such, further studies are needed to determine the indication for OXR. In reality, there may be little chance to use OXR because the majority of trauma centers in advanced countries have US and CT available. We recommend the use of OXR when CT is unusable, for example.

### Pleuritic chest pain: Sorting through the differential diagnosis [^116yXofE]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to chest X-ray (CXR), the AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR to evaluate for abnormalities, including pneumonia, in patients with unexplained pleuritic chest pain.

### Tension pneumothorax and the "forbidden CXR" [^115ex1Xj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A case is presented of unilateral tension pneumothorax associated with flail chest and pulmonary contusions in a spontaneously ventilating patient following a fall. The tension element was not suspected until a chest X-ray was available, nor was immediate needle thoracocentesis performed. No morbidity resulted as a consequence. This case highlights the difficulty in deciding whether or not tension pneumothorax is the predominant cause of respiratory distress in a patient with multiple chest injuries and provides further evidence challenging some of the doctrine on how to treat suspected tension pneumothorax.

### Identifying pulmonary nodules or masses on chest radiography using deep learning: external validation and strategies to improve clinical practice [^111MFoCS]. Clinical Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic performance of a deep learning-based system for the detection of clinically significant pulmonary nodules and masses on chest radiographs.

Materials and methods: Using a retrospective study of 100 patients (47 with clinically significant pulmonary nodules/masses and 53 control subjects without pulmonary nodules), two radiologists verified the clinically significant pulmonary nodules and masses according to chest computed tomography (CT) findings. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software using a deep-learning approach was employed to detect pulmonary nodules and masses to determine the diagnostic performance across four algorithms: heat map, abnormal probability, nodule probability, and mass probability.

Results: A total of 100 cases were included in the analysis. Among the four algorithms, the mass algorithm achieved a 76.6% sensitivity (36/47, 11 false negatives) and 88.68% specificity (47/53, six false positives) in the detection of pulmonary nodules/masses at the optimal probability score cut-off of 0.2884. Compared to the other three algorithms, the mass probability algorithm demonstrated the best predictive ability for pulmonary nodule/mass detection at the optimal probability score cut-off of 0.2884 (AUC Mass: 0.916 versus AUC Heat map: 0.682, p < 0.001; AUC Mass: 0.916 versus AUC Abnormal: 0.810, p = 0.002; AUC Mass: 0.916 versus AUC Nodule: 0.813, p = 0.014).

In conclusion, the deep-learning based computer-aided diagnosis system is likely to play a vital role in the early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and masses on chest radiographs.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of chest radiograph (CXR) findings in COVID-19 [^112twE4E]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Chest radiography (CXR) is most likely to be the utilized modality for diagnosing COVID-19 and following up on any lung-associated abnormalities. This review provides a meta-analysis of the literature on CXR imaging findings to determine the most common appearances of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, equipping medical researchers and healthcare professionals in their efforts to combat this pandemic.

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The inclusion criteria consisted of the following: (1) studies published in English literature; (2) original research studies; (3) sample sizes of at least 5 patients; (4) reporting clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients as well as CXR imaging features; and (5) noting the number of patients with each corresponding imaging feature. A total of 1,948 patients were included in this study.

To perform the meta-analysis, a random-effects model calculated the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of abnormal CXR imaging findings. Seventy-four percent (74%) (95% CI: 51–92%) of patients with COVID-19 had an abnormal CXR at the initial time of diagnosis or sometime during the disease course. While there was no single feature on CXR that was diagnostic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia, a characteristic set of findings was observed. The most common abnormalities were consolidation (28%, 95% CI: 8–54%) and ground-glass opacities (29%, 95% CI: 10–53%). The distribution was most frequently bilateral (43%, 95% CI: 27–60%), peripheral (51%, 95% CI: 36–66%), and basal zone (56%, 95% CI: 37–74%) predominant.

### Double-lung point sign in traumatic pneumothorax [^116M8RPV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Lung ultrasound has emerged as a rapid and accurate screening tool for pneumothorax. The lung point sign, a sonographic representation of the point on the chest wall where the pleural layers re-adhere, is 100% specific to confirm the diagnosis. Double lung point sign for a single pneumothorax is extremely unusual and has only been reported twice in the literature. A 49-year-old woman was transported to the emergency department (ED) intubated and sedated with a severe head injury. She remained hemodynamically stable without respiratory compromise throughout her ED course. Chest computed tomography was notable for an anterior left pneumothorax with underlying pulmonary contusion. Bedside ultrasound of this region revealed a double lung point sign. Our case report is the first to confirm the association of the double lung point sign with a single pneumothorax on corresponding computed tomographic imaging.

### The yield of chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose chest-CT in emergency department patients suspected of pulmonary infection without respiratory symptoms or signs [^116r8uBt]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Study procedures involved history taking, physical examination, and laboratory tests initiated by the attending physician. After setting the indication for chest imaging and acquiring informed consent, the attending physician provided a clinical question on the structured and standardized radiology request form. This was followed by either ultra-low-dose chest CT (ULDCT) or chest X-ray (CXR), according to the imaging method allocated to the month of presentation. If the clinical question was not adequately answered after obtaining the CXR or ULDCT, standard additional imaging, such as chest CT with intravenous contrast medium or CT pulmonary angiography, was performed.

The median ULDCT dose was 0.2 mSv (interquartile range, IQR: 0.2 to 0.3 mSv). The median CXR dose for portable anterior–posterior (AP) CXR was 0.02 mSv (IQR: 0.02 to 0.03 mSv) and for bucky CXR posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral was 0.05 mSv (IQR: 0.03 to 0.07 mSv). Additional technical information on the imaging techniques used (ULDCT and CXR) is available in the supplementary appendix.

Radiologists used a structured standardized report to optimize and standardize reading. Reading and reporting were performed or supervised by the radiologist on call at the time of clinical management, including outside office hours. The ULDCT and CXR were read with prior imaging if available. To increase inter-reader consistency, residents and radiologists less experienced in the field of chest imaging were supervised by a group of seven radiologists with a subspecialty in chest imaging. When a radiologic diagnosis of pneumonia was made, a pneumonia pattern was reported: lobar, interstitial, or broncho.

### Retrodiaphragmatic portion of the lung: How deep is the posterior costophrenic sulcus on posteroanterior chest radiography [^112sK52i]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the depth of the posterior costophrenic sulcus (CPS) on posteroanterior (PA) chest radiography in relation to the diaphragmatic dome and lateral CPS.

- **Materials and methods**: Five hundred and forty consecutive PA chest radiographs performed for general health screenings were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 282 radiographs were selected based on specific criteria: visualization of the inferior boundary of the posterior CPS behind the right hemidiaphragm, and absence of abnormal findings affecting the shape and level of the diaphragm. The subjects were 155 men and 127 women with a mean age of 40.7 ± 8.4 years. Measurements included the distances between the right diaphragmatic dome and posterior CPS (total diaphragmatic height), the diaphragmatic dome and lateral CPS (diaphragmatic dome height), and the lateral and posterior CPS (posterior CPS depth). Additionally, the levels of the right lateral and posterior CPS were scored in relation to the thoracic and lumbar spines. Relationships between the posterior CPS depth, demographic and physical data, and other radiographic measurements were analyzed.

- **Results**: The mean right posterior CPS depth was 29.2 ± 15.6 mm. The average level of the posterior CPS in relation to the spine was 13.5 ± 0.6, corresponding to the level of the lower half of the L1 vertebral body. The posterior CPS depth showed a tendency to be deeper in taller participants (r = 0.17, p < 0.01), those with a higher body mass index (BMI; r = 0.25, p < 0.01), and with a longer total diaphragmatic height.

### Arc concave sign on thin-section computed tomography: A novel predictor for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma in pure ground-glass nodules [^1158AUDV]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate the risk factors of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma, especially to report and validate the use of our newly identified arc concave sign in predicting invasiveness of pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs).

- **Methods**: From January 2015 to August 2018, we retrospectively enrolled 302 patients with 306 pGGNs ≤ 20 mm, pathologically confirmed (141 preinvasive lesions and 165 invasive lesions). Arc concave sign was defined as a smooth and sunken part of the edge of the lesion on thin-section computed tomography (TSCT). The degree of arc concave sign was expressed by the arc chord distance to chord length ratio (AC-R); a deep arc concave sign was defined as AC-R larger than the optimal cut-off value. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors of invasiveness.

- **Results**: Arc concave sign was observed in 65 of 306 pGGNs (21.2%), and a deep arc concave sign (AC-R > 0.25) was more common in invasive lesions (P = 0.008). Under a microscope, interlobular septal displacements were found at the tumour surface. Multivariate analysis indicated that irregular shape (OR, 3.558; CI: 1.374–9.214), presence of deep arc concave sign (OR, 3.336; CI: 1.013–10.986), the largest diameter > 10.1 mm (OR, 4.607; CI: 2.584–8.212), and maximum density > -502 HU (OR, 6.301; CI: 3.562–11.148) were significant independent risk factors of invasive lesions.

- **Conclusions**: Arc concave sign on TSCT is caused by interlobular septal displacement. The degree of arc concave sign can reflect the invasiveness of pGGNs. Invasive lesions can be effectively distinguished.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Treat the patient, not the X-ray [^113qS6Z7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The primary endpoint of the trial followed those of many prior studies and centered on the expansion of the lung. "Failure" was defined by any residual pneumothorax ⩾2 cm on radiographs 24 hours after the intervention. The study was set up as a noninferiority trial, but the predicted failure rate in the control group, based on literature data, differed significantly from the actual observed rate in the recruited subjects. Two different methods to define the inferiority margins were presented, which created much discussion on their relative statistical validity.

Not surprisingly, the trial found that patients treated with chest tubes had better radiographic success. Only 18% of drainages in the chest tube group "failed" compared with 29% in those treated with simple aspiration. However, patients in the aspiration group reported less pain (mean difference, −1.4 [95% CI: −1.89 to −0.91] on a 10-point scale) and significantly fewer of them described restriction in breathing as a result of pain (frequency difference, −18% [−27% to −9%]). Serious adverse events were uncommon in both groups. No intergroup differences were found in the long-term outcome measures, especially the recurrence rates after 1 year (20% in the aspiration group and 27% in the chest tube group).

These results serve to confront clinicians with the need to examine their priorities for PSP management. More invasive drainages provide better CXR improvement, reassuring clinicians but at the expense of patient comfort and procedural risks. The fundamental focus in PSP management should be to 1) relieve symptoms and 2) stop the…

### Commonly missed findings on chest radiographs: Causes and consequences [^113aVS3t]. Chest (2023). Low credibility.

Chest radiography (CXR) continues to be the most frequently performed imaging examination worldwide, yet it remains prone to frequent errors in interpretation. These pose potential adverse consequences to patients and are a leading motivation for medical malpractice lawsuits. Commonly missed CXR findings and the principal causes of these errors are reviewed and illustrated. Perceptual errors are the predominant source of these missed findings, and the medicolegal implications of such errors are explained. Awareness of commonly missed CXR findings, their causes, and their consequences is important in developing approaches to reduce and mitigate these errors.

All patients who underwent the craniocaudal approach were successful both technically and clinically. The median procedure time was 25 minutes, which was similar to the time reported by Takizawa et al, within 20 minutes. Unlike their report, where all procedures were performed using fluoroscopic guidance, half of our procedures were performed using ultrasound (US) guidance. In fact, poor visibility of the superior sulcus lesion precluded the US-guided puncture, and thus fluoroscopic puncture was used in four patients. Therefore, it might be preferable to prioritize fluoroscopic puncture.

Possible approaches to the superior sulcus lesions other than the craniocaudal approach include the conventional intercostal approach and the transscapular approach. Although the safety and efficacy of the conventional intercostal approach are established, reaching the superior sulcus lesion is sometimes difficult because of the existence of normal lung parenchyma. The transscapular approach has been reported to reach the superior sulcus lesions; however, this approach requires penetration of the bone and is thus more invasive than the craniocaudal approach.

The craniocaudal approach has two advantages. The first is the ability to achieve the procedure in the supine position. Therefore, this approach may be feasible for patients who are connected to ventilators, which can make changing their postures difficult. The second advantage is its effectiveness for patients with diffuse subcutaneous metastases or pleural dissemination. If the conventional intercostal approach is performed for such patients, it may be less effective.

### Derivation of a decision instrument for selective chest radiography in blunt trauma [^117TGzJv]. The Journal of Trauma (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator, "NEXUS criteria for chest X-ray in blunt chest trauma", is used for evaluating blunt cardiac injury, blunt chest trauma, traumatic thoracic aortic injury, and clavicle fracture. The NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument (NEXUS Chest X-ray) is designed to identify patients at low risk of injury who may not require imaging, specifically chest X-rays. This helps reduce unnecessary radiation exposure and healthcare costs.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray is applicable to patients who have sustained blunt chest trauma, often occurring due to incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical assaults. The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the decision-making process for the necessity of a chest X-ray, based on the presence or absence of specific criteria. These criteria include:

- **Age over 60**
- **Rapid deceleration mechanism**
- **Chest pain**
- **Intoxication**
- **Altered mental status**
- **Distracting painful injury**
- **Tenderness in the chest wall, sternum, thoracic spine, or scapula**

Patients who do not meet any of these criteria are considered at low risk for significant injury and may not require a chest X-ray. However, the decision to forego imaging should always be made in conjunction with clinical judgment.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray should not be used in patients with penetrating chest trauma or those with a known history of chest injury.

### The "white gray sign" identifies the central sulcus on 3T high-resolution T1-weighted images [^111Y3WnF]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

The central sulcus is an important anatomic landmark, but most methods of identifying it rely on variable gyral and sulcal patterns. We describe and assess the accuracy of reduced gray-white contrast along the central sulcus, an observation we term the "white gray sign".

Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 51 fMRIs with a T1-weighted 3D inversion recovery fast-spoiled gradient-echo and concomitant hand-motor fMRI, which served as confirmation for the location of the central sulcus. To measure gray-white contrast across the central and adjacent sulci, we performed a quantitative analysis of 25 normal hemispheres along the anterior and posterior cortices and intervening white matter of the pre- and postcentral gyri. 3D inversion recovery fast-spoiled gradient-echo axial images from 51 fMRIs were then evaluated by two raters for the presence of the white gray sign as well as additional established signs of the central sulcus: the bracket, cortical thickness, omega, and T signs.

Results: The mean gray-white contrast along the central sulcus was 0.218 anteriorly and 0.237 posteriorly, compared with 0.320 and 0.295 along the posterior precentral and anterior postcentral sulci, respectively (P < .001). Both raters correctly identified the central sulcus in all 35 normal and 16 abnormal hemispheres. The white gray sign had the highest agreement of all signs between raters and was rated as present the most often among all the signs.

Conclusions: Reduced gray-white contrast around the central sulcus is a reliable sign for identification.

### Vocal fold paralysis as a sign of chest diseases: a 15-year retrospective study [^112PJ6Ci]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Vocal fold paralysis (VFP) is sometimes the only sign of chest diseases. However, some patients with VFP due to chest diseases are not diagnosed correctly at the first examination, which may leave the patients untreated for a long time. Depending on the situation, a chest x-ray is not enough for detecting the primary lesion. The objective of this study was to discuss the diagnostic procedure for VFP based on the retrospective analysis of the cases.

- **Methods**: A total of 42 patients (29 males and 13 females) with VFP due to chest disease examined at the Department of Otolaryngology of Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed retrospectively.

- **Results**: Of the primary chest diseases, lung cancer (15 cases) was the most common, followed by thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (9 cases), metastatic tumor from other regions (6 cases), pulmonary and mediastinal tuberculosis (TB) (5 cases), and esophageal cancer (4 cases). While the primary lesions were easily detected with chest x-ray in most of the cases, some lesions in the aortopulmonary window were difficult to detect. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) was useful to detect any mass in this region.

- **Conclusions**: In the diagnosis of VFP due to chest diseases, a chest x-ray was useful but not always enough for detecting the primary lesion. The necessity of further examinations, including contrast-enhanced chest CT, must be kept in mind for the cases with negative chest radiographs.

### High-resolution computed tomography of the lungs: The borderlands of normality [^111sYLyh]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is now widely used in the assessment of airways and diffuse lung disease. Considerable literature on pathologic correlation has increased the understanding of the signs of disease seen on HRCT. However, neither the significance of subtle individual signs nor the spectrum of HRCT appearances in healthy lungs is well documented. HRCT signs that cause diagnostic uncertainty and the spectrum of findings that exist between definite normality and definite abnormality are discussed.

### Is a routine chest x-ray necessary for children after fluoroscopically assisted central venous access [^111JHhqn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine in a pediatric population whether a routine chest x-ray after central venous access is necessary when the central venous catheter is placed with intraoperative fluoroscopy.

This was a retrospective review of the charts of all patients at Children's Hospital in Denver, Colorado who underwent subclavian or internal jugular central venous catheter placement from January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2001. Age, sex, primary reason for access, access site, number of venipuncture attempts, type of catheter, intraoperative fluoroscopy results, chest x-ray results, location of the tip of the catheter, and complications were analyzed.

There were 1,039 central venous catheters placed in 824 patients, 92.6% in the subclavian vein and 7.4% in the internal jugular vein. There were 604 (58.1%) children who had both fluoroscopy and a postprocedure chest x-ray; there were 308 (29.6%) who had only fluoroscopy; there were 117 (11.3%) who had only a postprocedure chest x-ray, and there were 10 (1.0%) who had neither fluoroscopy nor chest x-ray. On completion of the procedure, there were 12 (1.1%) children with misplaced central venous catheters, only 1 (0.1%) when intraoperative fluoroscopy was used. There were 17 (1.6%) complications; 9 (0.9%) were pulmonary (pneumothorax, hemothorax, or an effusion). All children with pulmonary complications experienced clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of the complication after their central venous catheter insertion but before their postprocedure chest x-ray.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^1122K9pN]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax in the infrahilar anteromedial space of a 39-year-old woman due to traffic accident-related trauma is depicted in Fig. 3. A supine radiograph shows a sharp delineation of the left heart border (arrow) and a deep anterior cardiophrenic sulcus (asterisk). An axial CT of the lung base reveals substantial air collection in the pleural cavity at the anterior cardiophrenic sulcus (asterisk) and on the left side of the heart border (arrow).

### Prediction of preoperative intrathoracic adhesions for ipsilateral reoperations: Sliding lung sign [^113ob358]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Chest ultrasonography was performed on the day of the procedure. The patient was maintained under general anesthesia using single-lung ventilation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube, positioned in the lateral decubitus position on the operating table.

VATS lobectomy employed the tri-portal approach according to Hansen et al. It consists of two 1–1.5 cm lower access incisions for two thoracoscopic ports located in the 7th or 8th intercostal space, in the posterior and anterior axillary line, respectively, and a 4–5 cm port incision placed in the 4th intercostal space of the anterior axillary for a utility incision.

All patients were examined with an ultrasound study using an ultrasound machine with convex (3.5 MHz) and linear (7.5 MHz) transducers, in the lateral position with the seventh or eighth intercostal space of the midaxillary line, undergoing bipulmonary ventilation. We evaluated lung sliding, an echographic phenomenon produced during the normal respiratory cycle; the visceral pleura slides on the parietal pleura. The presence of pleural adherence does not permit the observer to appreciate this sign.

To determine the optimal entry site, we searched for areas with a good echographic sliding sign and a normal appearance of the chest wall and pleural line. When the appropriate echographic aspects were not present, we examined other adjacent areas to avoid pleural adhesion. After identifying the ideal entry site with chest sonography, we performed local anesthesia with Mepivacaine (200 mg). After making a small skin incision, we slowly introduced cu…

### Prediction of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in patients with congenital heart disease using deep learning-based analysis of chest radiographs [^1173xJXL]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Chest radiography is a useful non-invasive modality to evaluate pulmonary blood flow status in patients with congenital heart disease. However, the predictive value of chest radiography is limited by the subjective and qualitative nature of the interpretation. Recently, deep learning has been used to analyze various images, but it has not been applied to analyzing chest radiographs in such patients.

- **Objective**: To develop and validate a quantitative method to predict the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs using deep learning.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective observational study included 1,031 cardiac catheterizations performed for 657 patients from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2019, at a tertiary center. Catheterizations without the Fick-derived pulmonary to systemic flow ratio or chest radiography performed within one month before catheterization were excluded. Seventy-eight patients (100 catheterizations) were randomly assigned for evaluation. A deep learning model that predicts the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs was developed using the method of transfer learning.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The ability of the model to predict the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. The diagnostic concordance rate was compared with three certified pediatric cardiologists. The diagnostic performance for a high pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 2.0 or more was evaluated using cross tabulation and a receiver operating characteristic analysis.

### A method to detect occult pneumothorax with chest radiography [^116FqzKg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Small pneumothoraces are often not visible on supine screening chest radiographs because they develop anteriorly to the lung. These pneumothoraces are termed occult. Occult pneumothoraces account for an astonishingly high 52% to 63% of all traumatic pneumothoraces. A 19-year-old obese woman was involved in a head-on car accident. The admission anteroposterior chest radiographs were unremarkable. Because of the presence of right chest tenderness and an abrasion, we suspected the presence of a pneumothorax. Thus, we decided to take a supine oblique chest radiograph of the right side of the thorax, which clearly revealed a visceral pleural line, consistent with a diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax. A pneumothorax may be present when a supine chest radiograph reveals either an apparent deepening of the costophrenic angle (the "deep sulcus sign") or the presence of two diaphragm-lung interfaces (the "double diaphragm sign"). However, in practice, supine chest radiographs have poor sensitivity for occult pneumothoraces. Oblique chest radiograph is a useful and fast screening tool that should be considered for cases of blunt chest trauma, especially when transport of critically ill patients to the computed tomographic suite is dangerous or when imminent transfer to another hospital is being arranged and early diagnosis of an occult pneumothorax is essential.

### The answer may lie in avoiding the underwater seal rather than the chest drainage tube [^114GhFDJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

When a patient presents to a health facility with symptoms suggesting a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), a finite amount of time has already passed since the index event of the creation of a visceral pleural defect (T0). When the PSP is diagnosed using radiological tests, an intercostal drain (ICD) may be inserted, according to the existing guidelines, at time point T1. Two different events could have occurred between T0 and T1: the pleural defect causing the pneumothorax is either closed because of natural healing or still open.

When the ICD is connected to an underwater seal, the underwater placement acts as a barrier to air entry into the pleural space through the drainage tube had it been left open to the air. The negative pleural pressure during each inspiration results in lung expansion, while it also pulls the water column up the drainage bag to a level numerically equal to the negative pleural pressure. During expiration, the positive pleural pressure drives the accumulated air out through the drainage tube.

If healing of the visceral pleural defect has occurred between T0 and T1, there might be a quick expulsion of air from the pleural cavity through the ICD with successive respiratory cycles over a few minutes to hours. At the end of this variable period, bubbling in the ICD bag would cease. In the other scenario, in which the visceral pleural defect is persistent, air will repeatedly accumulate in the pleural cavity with each inspiration, only to be expelled through the ICD either with each expiration (when the leak is grade 2 according to Cerfolio classification) or during an inadvertent forced expiratory maneuver.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^112cMmoj]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax in the anteromedial space is frequently observed in supine patients as it is the least dependent pleural space. This space is divided by the hilum into the suprahilar space and the infrahilar space.

Radiographic signs of pneumothorax in the suprahilar anteromedial space include a sharp delineation of the superior vena cava (SVC), the azygos vein on the right, the left subclavian artery, the left superior intercostal vein on the left, the anterior junction line, and the superior pulmonary vein on the affected side. The anterior junction line is a normal anatomical structure visible on chest radiography, caused by the visceral and parietal pleurae of both lungs meeting anteriorly at the midline.

- **Figure details**: Fig. 2 presents a suprahilar anteromedial pneumothorax in an 83-year-old man with enteritis.
	a. A supine radiograph shows a sharp delineation of the SVC (arrowhead), right brachiocephalic vein (white arrow), and anterior junction line (black arrow).
	b. An axial CT image at the SVC level shows air collection in the pleural cavity on the right side of the SVC (arrowhead) and the anterior junction line (black arrow).

Radiographic signs of pneumothorax in the infrahilar anteromedial space include the sharp delineation of the heart border, inferior vena cava (IVC), pericardial fat pad, and deep anterior cardiophrenic sulcus (Fig. 3). The pericardial fat pad simulates a…

### Is routine chest radiograph necessary after chest tube removal [^114sS6pu]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Obtaining a chest radiograph (CXR) after chest tube (CT) removal to rule out a pneumothorax is a universal practice. However, the yield of this CXR has not been well documented. Additionally, most iatrogenic pneumothoraces resulting from CT removal are atmospheric in origin, asymptomatic, and can be observed. Recently, we have begun to discontinue routine CXR for CT removal. We evaluated our experience with CT removal to clarify the usefulness of routine post-CT removal CXR.

- **Methods**: After IRB approval, a retrospective study was conducted on patients who had a CT placed in the past decade. Cardiac patients requiring a CT were excluded. Patient demographics, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a CXR after CT removal (Group 1) and those without (Group 2). Percentages were compared with Chi-square with Yates correction.

- **Results**: 462 patients were identified (Group 1 = 327, Group 2 = 135). Indications for CT included empyema (n = 176), lung resection (n = 146), pneumothorax (n = 71), pleural effusion (n = 26), spinal fusion (n = 20), trauma (n = 16), and miscellaneous (n = 7). Seven patients (2.1%) in Group 1 required reinsertion for pneumothorax (n = 4), empyema (n = 2), and pleural effusion (n = 1), compared to 1 patient (0.7%) in Group 2 who required reinsertion for pleural effusion. This difference was not significant (P = 0.2).

- **Conclusions**: In non-cardiac patients with a CT, tube reinsertion is uncommon and tube replacement is secondary to symptoms. Therefore, routine post-CT removal CXR is not necessary.

### Horner's syndrome in a patient presenting with a spontaneous pneumothorax [^115CKoJt]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothoraces are a common thoracic problem presenting to an Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. The symptoms and signs are well described, and a chest X-ray examination is usually diagnostic. However, the neurological signs, specifically Horner's syndrome on the ipsilateral side, are not widely recognized. This case illustrates the association and emphasizes that when assessing a patient with a suspected spontaneous pneumothorax, an ipsilateral Horner's syndrome supports the clinical diagnosis. Further, its presence makes a tension pneumothorax, or as in this case, a pneumothorax with significant collapse and apical adhesions, more likely. No previous case reporting the association has had the opportunity for thoracoscopic assessment and demonstration of likely cause.

### The hanging chin sign as a mortality predictor in geriatric patients at the emergency department: a retrospective cohort study [^116YFgBK]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

All chest X-rays were retrospectively reviewed. The following details were documented: presence of the hanging chin sign, patient position during acquisition (standing, sitting, or lying), projection view (posteroanterior (PA) or anteroposterior (AP)), and presence of a lateral view. In case of doubt, an independent blinded radiologist (LB) was consulted. Disagreements were resolved by consensus between the researcher AH and radiologist LB.

Figure 1 shows the different projection views of the chest X-ray (1A-C). Preferably, a chest X-ray consists of a standing PA view and a lateral view. When a patient is unable to stand, an AP view is acquired in a sitting or even lying position. An AP view is non-preferable because of lower quality and magnification of the heart, making it more difficult to evaluate.

- **Figure 1 description**: A and B show the standard projections of the chest X-ray. The patient is standing against the detector. C shows an AP projection without the presence of a hanging chin sign. D, E, and F show examples in which a hanging chin sign could be seen on the chest X-ray.

The hanging chin sign is most commonly seen on a chest X-ray made in an AP view (Fig. 1D). It is also seen in a PA view, but to a lesser extent, especially in patients with lordosis or (hyper) kyphosis (Fig. 1E-F). Neuromuscular disorders are also mentioned as a cause.

The 'hanging chin sign' on the chest X-ray was considered positive when the mandibular bone was projected over one or more ribs (Fig. 2). Patients were excluded.

### Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary? A prospective study of 350 cases [^112QdP51]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is necessary.

- **Patients and method**: The study group included 350 consecutive patients who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 hours after the procedure in all cases. Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax.

- **Results**: Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large (> 10%) pneumothorax. The other three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (≤ 10%), which resolved completely 24 to 48 hours later.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^113TbBEH]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

When a portable chest radiography is conducted, the x-ray cassette is positioned behind the patient, and skin folds may occur between the chest wall and the cassette. Skin folds are likely to occur in elderly and cachectic patients who have sagging skin.

In contrast to the pleural line in pneumothorax, skin folds manifest as a broad radiopaque band that may extend beyond the parietal pleural line or midline with vascular markings beyond the lines of the folds (Fig. 8). Skin folds usually run in pairs or three at a time. Additionally, skin folds may be multiple or bilateral or may disappear suddenly. A negative Mach effect enhancing the skin folds may be seen. Clothing or bed sheets may also produce a similar artifact.

Fig. 8 shows a skin fold mimicking pneumothorax on a radiograph in a 66-year-old woman with glioblastoma. The skin fold appears as a broad radiopaque band (black arrows) adjacent to a radiolucent band (white arrows), which reflects a negative Mach band effect in the left lung field on a supine radiograph. It extends beyond the pleural cavity. Vascular markings (black arrowhead) are visible beyond its edge.

- **Interlobar fissures**: In the presence of interlobar pleural effusion or thickening of interlobar or accessory fissures, the interlobar fissures may resemble the visceral pleura seen in pneumothorax. Moreover, if a normal interlobar fissure is parallel to the x-ray beam, it may be visible and mimic the visceral pleura that is observed in pneumothorax on radiographs (Fig. 9). However, unlike pneumothorax, vascular markings are present.

### Bedside chest radiography [^113hs9qh]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

The bedside chest X-ray (CXR) is an indispensable diagnostic tool for monitoring seriously ill patients in the intensive care unit. The CXR often reveals abnormalities that may not be detected clinically. In addition, bedside CXRs are an irreplaceable tool to detect the malposition of tubes and lines and to identify associated complications. Although the image quality is often limited, bedside CXRs still provide valuable diagnostic information. The interpretation of bedside CXRs is often challenging and requires extensive radiologic experience to avoid misinterpretation of the wide spectrum of pleural and pulmonary disease. The clinical information is of substantial value for the interpretation of the frequently nonspecific findings.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: radiograph findings correlated with CT [^114wDRQP]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The subpulmonary space is the second most common area for air collection in supine patients with pneumothorax. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the radiographic anatomy of this space, leading to a high failure rate in detecting subpulmonary pneumothorax.

Radiographic signs of pneumothorax in this space include a hyperlucent upper quadrant of the abdomen, visualization of the inferior surface of the lung, sharply outlined diaphragm, sharp delineation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) on the right lung, the "deep sulcus" sign, and the "double diaphragm" sign. Additionally, the diaphragmatic dome may be slightly elevated as the lung collapses.

- **Figure 4**:
	- A: Supine radiograph of a 36-year-old woman with interstitial pneumonia shows a hyperlucent upper quadrant of the abdomen (black asterisk). It also depicts the inferior surface of the lung (arrowheads), a sharply outlined diaphragm (black arrows), sharp delineation of the IVC (white arrow), and the "deep sulcus" sign (white asterisk).
	- **B**: Coronal CT image clearly shows the inferior surface of the lung (arrowheads), sharply outlined diaphragm (black arrows), sharp delineation of the IVC, and the "deep sulcus" sign (white asterisk).

The "deep sulcus" sign appears on radiographs as an abnormal deepening and lucency of the lateral costophrenic sulcus extending toward the hypochondrium. This sign is caused by air collecting in this area.

### Pneumothorax: From definition to diagnosis and treatment [^116sR2ub]. Journal of Thoracic Disease (2014). High credibility.

The disease pneumothorax can be associated with various symptoms and conditions, including hypotension, chest wall percussion hyperresonance, subcutaneous emphysema, cyanosis, atelectasis, epigastric abdominal pain, tachypnea, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. Other associated factors include dyspnea, decreased breath sounds, absence of lung sliding, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, endometriosis, the halo sign, COPD, cystic fibrosis, the lung point sign, cigarette smoking, asthma, chest pain, and sweating.
