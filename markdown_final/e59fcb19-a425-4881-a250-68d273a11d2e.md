## Question

fever temperature in an adult

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to define fever in adults across settings, including thresholds, measurement methods, special populations, and the distinction from hyperthermia, culminating in a concise, practical definition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiologic definition of fever versus hyperthermia. Then, I should verify the most authoritative thresholds used in critical care and infectious diseases guidelines. Next, I will examine special populations such as older adults, neutropenic patients, and long-term care residents. After that, I need to check how measurement site and device accuracy affect interpretation. Then, I will review how fever is defined in non-ICU contexts like FUO and general outpatient care. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, clinically usable definition and highlight key caveats and exceptions, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality sources and guideline consensus.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental distinction so I don't conflate mechanisms. Fever is a regulated increase in the hypothalamic set point driven by pyrogenic cytokines, whereas hyperthermia is an unregulated rise in core temperature without an elevated set point; this matters because antipyretics work for fever but not for hyperthermia, and hyperthermia syndromes often exceed 41°C and require rapid cooling, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret thresholds and decide on therapy [^111HHEmd] [^112RTJFX].

> Now, I should verify the most authoritative adult fever thresholds. In adult ICU patients, the SCCM/IDSA guideline defines fever as a single temperature measurement ≥ 38.3°C, and this threshold is consistently echoed across multiple guideline documents and updates, which anchors the critical care standard for adults without severe immunocompromise [^1116SG8x] [^112AUogF] [^111zXFyD]. Wait, let me verify the CDC hospital-acquired infection definition; yes, it uses > 38.0°C as a fever threshold for surveillance purposes, which is slightly lower and context-specific, so I should not overgeneralize that to all ICU fever definitions [^1116SG8x].

> Next, I should review special populations where lower thresholds are appropriate. For neutropenic oncology patients, both IDSA and NCCN define fever as a single oral temperature ≥ 38.3°C or ≥ 38.0°C sustained for at least 1 hour, reflecting the risk of occult infection despite blunted fever responses; I need to ensure I apply this lower sustained threshold in this group [^1116SG8x]. For older adults in long-term care, IDSA uses a lower threshold of a single oral temperature > 37.8°C, repeated oral > 37.2°C, or rectal > 37.5°C, or a rise from baseline > 1.1°C, acknowledging attenuated febrile responses in the elderly; I should double-check that I'm not extrapolating this to all older adults outside LTC, as the evidence base is strongest in that setting [^1116SG8x]. Hold on, I should verify whether critically ill older adults have a different threshold; the surgical critical care consensus notes that while LTC definitions exist, they have not been extended to critically ill elders, so I should avoid applying LTC cutoffs to ICU patients without supporting guidance [^111zXFyD].

> I will now examine how measurement site and device accuracy influence interpretation. Central thermistors (pulmonary artery, bladder, esophageal) are the gold standard for core temperature and should be preferred when available or when accuracy materially affects decisions; oral and rectal measurements are more reliable than axillary, tympanic, or temporal artery devices, which have poor agreement with core and should not be relied upon when precision matters; I need to ensure I confirm discordant peripheral readings with a central method before acting definitively [^114id8nk] [^115p6Jv9] [^111Aad9M] [^116VkASg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said tympanic thermometers are acceptable substitutes; the meta-analysis shows sensitivity around 64% and wide limits of agreement, so I should correct that and avoid tympanic or temporal artery thermometers for critical decisions [^116VkASg].

> Next, I should review non-ICU definitions so I don't overapply ICU thresholds. For fever of unknown origin, the classic and contemporary definitions converge on a documented temperature ≥ 38.3°C on several occasions over at least three weeks with an unrevealing initial workup; this is a research and diagnostic framework rather than an acute management threshold, but it reinforces 38.3°C as a consistent fever cut point in adult ambulatory and inpatient evaluations [^117Nng2s] [^112FQ7yj] [^115QePFm]. Hold on, I should verify that some modern proposals allow 38.0°C; yes, some authors suggest lowering to 38.0°C to broaden capture, but the most widely cited definitions still use 38.3°C, so I will anchor on that while noting the variability [^115QePFm].

> Let me consider the general outpatient context briefly. Many primary care sources pragmatically treat temperatures at or above 38.0°C as clinically significant fever warranting evaluation, even though there is no single universal outpatient standard; I should be transparent that this is a practical convention rather than a guideline-endorsed threshold, and I will align my synthesis to the higher-credibility ICU and FUO sources for consistency [^notfound].

> I should confirm how age modifies fever expression so I don't misclassify older adults. Meta-analytic data show that older adults are less likely to present with fever and have mean admission temperatures about 0.14°C lower than younger adults, supporting the rationale for lower thresholds in geriatric care settings and heightened vigilance for nonfebrile presentations of infection in the elderly [^114WnbSZ]. But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing to all older adults? The LTC-specific IDSA thresholds are where the evidence is strongest, so I will apply those judiciously and avoid extrapolating to community-dwelling elders without supporting data [^1116SG8x].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable definition while preserving context. For most immunocompetent adults in acute care, fever is best defined as a core temperature ≥ 38.3°C, recognizing that this is the SCCM/IDSA ICU standard and aligns with FUO definitions; in neutropenic patients, use ≥ 38.3°C once or ≥ 38.0°C sustained for ≥ 1 hour; in older adults in long-term care, use > 37.8°C once, repeated oral > 37.2°C or rectal > 37.5°C, or a rise > 1.1°C from baseline; and for hospital-acquired infection surveillance, > 38.0°C is used by CDC, which is a lower administrative threshold rather than a physiologic definition [^1116SG8x] [^117Nng2s] [^112FQ7yj]. I need to ensure I emphasize that infection can be present without fever, particularly in older or immunocompromised patients, so absence of fever does not exclude serious disease and should not delay appropriate evaluation [^111tfuHq].

> Finally, I should double-check the measurement caveats and hyperthermia warning so clinicians apply thresholds safely. Always interpret temperatures in clinical context, prefer central measurements when accuracy will change management, and remember that temperatures ≥ 41.0°C suggest hyperthermia syndromes rather than fever and require urgent cooling rather than antipyretics; this distinction prevents delays in life-saving therapy for heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114id8nk] [^112RTJFX] [^1135pHz5].

In adults, **fever is defined as a core temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)** [^116bVXvh]. In critically ill or ICU patients, **≥ 38.3°C (101°F) is the standard threshold** for fever [^1116SG8x] [^111zXFyD]. For older adults in long-term care, **≥ 37.8°C (100.0°F) or a rise > 1.1°C from baseline** is considered fever [^1116SG8x]. Measurement method matters: oral, rectal, or tympanic temperatures are preferred; axillary and temporal measurements are less reliable [^114id8nk] [^116VkASg]. Fever is a marker of infection or inflammation, but absence of fever does not exclude serious illness, especially in older or immunocompromised patients [^111tfuHq] [^114WnbSZ].

## Definition of fever in adults

Fever is a regulated rise in core temperature due to a higher hypothalamic set point triggered by pyrogens; it is distinct from hyperthermia, which is an unregulated rise without a set-point change [^111HHEmd] [^112RTJFX]. The **standard adult threshold is ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)** [^116bVXvh].

## Temperature thresholds for fever in adults

| **Clinical context** | **Temperature threshold** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) | Standard definition [^116bVXvh] |
| Critically ill or ICU patients | ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) | Standard threshold in ICU settings [^1116SG8x] [^111zXFyD] |
| Older adults in long-term care | ≥ 37.8°C (100.0°F) or rise > 1.1°C from baseline | Lower threshold due to blunted fever response [^111zXFyD] |
| Neutropenic patients | ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) once or ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained ≥ 1 hour | Immunocompromised-specific definition [^1116SG8x] |

---

## Measurement methods and accuracy

Accurate temperature measurement is essential for diagnosis and management. Preferred methods include oral, rectal, and tympanic measurements, whereas axillary and temporal artery methods are less reliable [^114id8nk] [^116VkASg].

| **Measurement method** | **Accuracy** | **Reliability** |
|-|-|-|
| Oral | High | High |
| Rectal | High | High |
| Tympanic | Moderate | Moderate |
| Axillary | Low | Low |
| Temporal artery | Low | Low |

## Physiological and clinical significance of fever

Fever is a conserved host response that enhances immune function and inhibits pathogens, but it also increases metabolic demand and may worsen outcomes in some critically ill patients [^111HHEmd] [^111rb9bX]. Fever is a marker of infection or inflammation, yet its absence does not exclude serious illness — especially in older or immunocompromised patients [^111tfuHq] [^114WnbSZ].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Fever prompts evaluation for infection or other causes; management balances symptom relief with the potential benefits of fever. Routine antipyretics are not clearly beneficial in critically ill adults, though they may be used for comfort [^111v5EvZ] [^117ADJMW]. In adults, **fever is defined as a core temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)**, with higher thresholds in ICU patients and lower thresholds in older adults; accurate measurement and clinical context are essential for diagnosis and management [^1116SG8x].

### Fever after immunization: current concepts and improved future scientific understanding [^11413Fx5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Fever is a common clinical complaint in adults and children with a variety of infectious illnesses, as well as a frequently reported adverse event following immunization. Although the level of measured temperature indicative of a "fever" was first defined in 1868, it remains unclear what role fever has as a physiologic reaction to invading substances, how best to measure body temperature and compare measurements from different body sites, and, consequently, how to interpret fever data derived from vaccine safety trials or immunization safety surveillance. However, even with many aspects of the societal, medical, economic, and epidemiologic meanings of fever as an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) still elusive, it is a generally benign — albeit common — clinical sign. By standardizing the definition and means of assessment of fever in vaccine safety studies, thereby permitting comparability of data, we hope to arrive at an improved understanding of its importance as an AEFI.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^1116SG8x]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Fever definition — adult ICU and related settings: Normal body temperature varies by age, gender, diurnal variation, and sampling site, and evidence indicates a decrease of 0.03°C per birth decade over the last 157 years. For hospital-acquired infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines fever as a measured temperature of greater than 38°C. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) defines fever in individuals greater than 65 years old residing in long-term care facilities as a single oral temperature greater than 37.8°C, repeated temperature measurements greater than 37.2°C (oral) or greater than 37.5°C (rectal), or an increase from baseline greater than 1.1°C. In neutropenia due to chemotherapy, both IDSA and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network define fever as a single oral temperature measurement greater than or equal to 38.3°C or greater than 38.0°C sustained over at least 1 hour. For ICU patients, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and IDSA have previously defined fever as the presence of a single temperature measurement greater than or equal to 38.3°C, which this guideline uses. Not all patients with infection manifest fever and, in fact, the absence of fever in patients with infection is associated with worse outcomes. Consequently, the recommendations in this guideline may generally apply to ICU patients with suspected infection regardless of the presence of temperature elevation.

ICU fever

Question

How is fever in the ICU assessed and defined?

Recommendation

A temperature > 38.3°C in critically ill patients is defined as a fever, and > 39.5°C as a high fever, except in neutropenia. It is important to consider that, in the elderly, the fever response may be blunted and thus, an infected elderly person may not manifest a fever. Additionally, certain ICU conditions and treatments can easily mask fever, as discussed below.

Discussion

Therapies such as continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), peritoneal lavage, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may alter core temperature. Environmental considerations such as room temperature, mattress type, lights, and external warming devices may also impact core body temperature. Clinicians should consider patient-specific factors when evaluating temperature data in a critically ill patient. Furthermore, not all patients with infection will generate a fever: the elderly, those with open abdominal wounds or large total body surface area burns, patients treated with antipyretics, or those on ECMO or CRRT may be euthermic or hypothermic. Fever in patients with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm) is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C sustained over 1 hour or recurrent over 12 hours.

In the elderly, a lower cut-off for fever is considered specifically for older adult residents of long-term care facilities. The definition has not been extended to critically ill older adults as evidenced by the joint guidelines of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) on the workup of fever written in 2023. However, and importantly so, other signs of infection besides fever should be closely evaluated as it is common that an infected elderly person does not manifest a fever due to blunted physiological responses. In older adult patients, change in behavior, a rise in baseline temperature by 1 degree, lack of cooperativeness with care, laboratory values that indicate organ dysfunction, altered mentation, and change from baseline including fatigue, loss of appetite, delirium, and falls should all be considered possible signs of an infection.

Devices used should be assessed, maintained, and calibrated regularly according to manufacturer's guidelines. Temperature is most accurate when measured with esophageal probes and bladder catheter thermistors (as opposed to axillary or tympanic), however central measurement is not always necessary.

Question

What is the recommended approach to a patient with fever in the ICU?

---

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^112AUogF]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Fever is frequently an early indicator of infection and often requires rigorous diagnostic evaluation.

Objectives

This is an update of the 2008 Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society (IDSA) and Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guideline for the evaluation of new-onset fever in adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise, now using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Panel Design

The SCCM and IDSA convened a taskforce to update the 2008 version of the guideline for the evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients, which included expert clinicians as well as methodologists from the Guidelines in Intensive Care, Development and Evaluation Group. The guidelines committee consisted of 12 experts in critical care, infectious diseases, clinical microbiology, organ transplantation, public health, clinical research, and health policy and administration. All task force members followed all conflict-of-interest procedures as documented in the American College of Critical Care Medicine/SCCM Standard Operating Procedures Manual and the IDSA. There was no industry input or funding to produce this guideline.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review for each population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak or as best-practice statements.

Results

The panel issued 12 recommendations and 9 best practice statements. The panel recommended using central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors when these devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical for diagnosis and management. For patients without these devices in place, oral or rectal temperatures over other temperature measurement methods that are less reliable such as axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers were recommended. Imaging studies including ultrasonography were recommended in addition to microbiological evaluation using rapid diagnostic testing strategies. Biomarkers were recommended to assist in guiding the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. All recommendations issued were weak based on the quality of data.

Conclusions

The guidelines panel was able to formulate several recommendations for the evaluation of new fever in a critically ill adult patient, acknowledging that most recommendations were based on weak evidence. This highlights the need for the rapid advancement of research in all aspects of this issue-including better noninvasive methods to measure core body temperature, the use of diagnostic imaging, advances in microbiology including molecular testing, and the use of biomarkers.

Introduction

Fever, or pyrexia, can be defined as having a temperature above the normal range owing to an increase in the body's core temperature setpoint. The thermoregulatory centre, located in the hypothalamus, contains temperature sensitive neurons, aiming to maintain thermal homoeostasis. Fever is caused by a disturbance in the thermal homoeostasis and thermal setpoint caused by pyrogenic cytokines, pyrogens, as a response to inflammation and infection. Pyrogens induce a change from the normal thermal setpoint, leading to an increase or decrease in body core temperature. Hyperthermia is different from fever and can be defined as an increase of the body's core temperature not related to the thermoregulatory centre. Changes in body temperature and thermal setpoint evoke physiological and behavioural responses to maintain thermal homoeostasis. Fever is an integral part of the inflammatory response, affecting the reproduction of some bacteria and viruses negatively and amplifying the immunological response. Fever and hyperthermia are also associated with several adverse events including seizures, organ failure, and brain damage.

The origin of treating fever predates 2000 years before the Common Era, and treating fever with antipyretics in patients admitted to hospital is commonly considered standard practice today. The aim of treating fever may be to reduce the patient's discomfort and to decrease physiological stress. However, fever therapy is likewise used in heavily sedated patients in intensive care units, with the rationale for treatment being a mortality and morbidity benefit by reduction of metabolic demand and hypoxic tissue injury. Fever is present throughout the animal kingdom, yet the underlying physiology is not fully understood. Fever is metabolically costly and increases oxygen demand, but it also induces cellular and immunological mechanisms protecting against microorganisms. In human studies, a positive correlation has been found between febrile temperatures during bacteraemia and survival. Furthermore, antipyretic drugs have shown to increase the duration of certain illnesses and inhibit antibody response. Aggressive treatment with paracetamol has even exposed a tendency towards increased mortality. Another study has shown that fever is an independent predictor of mortality. Whether fever is an epiphenomenon and merely a marker of illness or a modifiable target affecting important outcomes, such as death, is not known, suggesting an urgent need for robust evidence regarding the benefits and harms of fever therapy.

### Investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin in adults [^117Nng2s]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Few clinical problems generate such a wide differential diagnosis as pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. The initial definition proposed by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961,¹ later revised, is "a fever of 38.3°C (101°F) or more lasting for at least three weeks for which no cause can be identified after three days of investigation in hospital or after three or more outpatient visits". ²⁻⁴Essentially the term refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an obvious cause despite reasonable evaluation and diagnostic testing. A fever that is not self limiting for which no cause can be found can become a source of frustration for both patient and doctor. There is little consensus on how such patients should be investigated, although recent prospective studies have evaluated diagnostic protocols to suggest approaches to investigation. ³⁵⁶ We discuss evidence from epidemiological and diagnostic studies and suggest an approach to investigating and managing pyrexia of unknown origin. Immunocompromised individuals, those with HIV infection, and patients admitted to hospital for other reasons with persistent or unexplained fever represent distinct subgroups in which the likely causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pyrexia usually differ from those in patients who are not immunocompromised. We do not discuss these subgroups in this review other than to provide definitions of pyrexia of unknown origin in different groups of patients (see box 1).

### Approach to the adult patient with fever of unknown origin [^1135PtTj]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) in adults is defined as a temperature higher than 38.3 degrees C (100.9 degrees F) that lasts for more than three weeks with no obvious source despite appropriate investigation. The four categories of potential etiology of FUO are classic, nosocomial, immune deficient, and human immunodeficiency virus-related. The four subgroups of the differential diagnosis of FUO are infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, and miscellaneous. A thorough history, physical examination, and standard laboratory testing remain the basis of the initial evaluation of the patient with FUO. Newer diagnostic modalities, including updated serology, viral cultures, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, have important roles in the assessment of these patients.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^116rdmtX]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of study

Antipyretics are routinely administered in care both in and out of hospital, and physical cooling is applied in severe fever not responding to antipyretic drugs. Our results suggest little to no difference in effect between fever therapy and no fever therapy; realistic, while still clinically relevant, intervention effects of fever therapy have so far not been properly studied, however. Fever therapy may be investigated in further adequately powered high quality randomised trials also including a health economics perspective, to define implications for patients and society.

Conclusion

Fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death or serious adverse events in febrile adults. We found insufficient evidence to confirm or reject the hypothesis that fever therapy influences quality of life or the risk of non-serious adverse events.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

### Is age associated with different vital signs in adults presenting to hospital with bacterial infection? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WnbSZ]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Temperature

The proportion of patients presenting with fever decreased with age (n = 58 studies, slope coefficient −0.014, 95% CI −0.024 to −0.005, P < .05) (Figure 3a). Admission temperature also decreased with age (n = 31 studies, slope coefficient − 0.0071, 95% CI −0.011 to −0.0027, P < .05) (Figure 3b). Older adults were less likely to present to hospital with a fever (n = 19 studies, RR 0.89, 0.83 to 0.95, I² = 85.9%) (Figure 3c) with a mean difference in temperature of −0.14°C (n = 17 studies, MD −0.14°C, −0.26 to −0.02°C, I² = 94.6%) (Figure 3d). There was no relationship between hypothermia and age (n = 13 studies, slope coefficient 0.0058 95% CI −0.011 to 0.022, P = .49) (Supplementary Figure S2a). Older adults were not more likely to be hypothermic (n = 8 studies, RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.57, I² = 68.7%) (Supplementary Figure S2b).

Guideline methodology — consensus and best-practice statements: Best-practice statements were made only when suggested GRADE criteria for best-practice statements were met. Best practice statements had to be clear, answer an important actionable question where the benefit would be unequivocally large, and evidence would be difficult to collect or summarize, and an explicit rationale for the benefit was provided. After finalizing a preliminary recommendation, members of the taskforce received electronic links to indicate their agreement or disagreement, and consensus required 80% agreement by at least 75% of the voting panel.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^111v5EvZ]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of fever therapy compared with no fever therapy in a wide population of febrile adults.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials.

Data Sources

CENTRAL, BIOSIS, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection, searched from their inception to 2 July 2021.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised clinical trials in adults diagnosed as having fever of any origin. Included experimental interventions were any fever therapy, and the control intervention had to be no fever therapy (with or without placebo/sham).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Primary outcomes were all cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and non-serious adverse events. Aggregate data were synthesised with meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and trial sequential analyses, and the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Forty two trials assessing 5140 participants were included. Twenty three trials assessed 11 different antipyretic drugs, 11 trials assessed physical cooling, and eight trials assessed a combination of antipyretic drugs and physical cooling. Of the participants, 3007 were critically ill, 1892 were non-critically ill, 3277 had infectious fever, and 1139 had non-infectious fever. All trials were assessed as being at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis showed that the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the risk of death (risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; P = 0.62; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (risk ratio 1.02, 0.89 to 1.17; I² = 0%; P = 0.78; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) could be rejected. One trial assessing quality of life was included, showing no difference between fever therapy and control. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis showed that the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the risk of non-serious adverse events could be neither confirmed nor rejected (risk ratio 0.92, 0.67 to 1.25; I² = 66.5%; P = 0.58; four trials; very low certainty evidence).

Conclusions

Fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death and serious adverse events.

Fever, commonly defined by a temperature of ≥ 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F), occurs in approximately one half of patients admitted to intensive care units. Fever may be attributed to both infectious and noninfectious causes, and its development in critically ill adult medical patients is associated with an increased risk for death. Although it is widespread and clinically accepted practice to therapeutically lower temperature in patients with hyperthermic syndromes, patients with marked hyperpyrexia, and selected populations such as those with neurologic impairment, it is controversial whether most medical patients with moderate degrees of fever should be treated with antipyretic or direct cooling therapies. Although treatment of fever may improve patient comfort and reduce metabolic demand, fever is a normal adaptive response to infection and its suppression is potentially harmful. Clinical trials specifically comparing fever management strategies in neurologically intact critically ill medical patients are needed.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guideline — GRADE appraisal and recommendation framework explains that guideline methodologists assessed the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE methodology and rated quality as high, moderate, low, or very low based on domains including risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias, and other criteria, using GRADEpro online software to produce evidence summary tables. Recommendations were formulated with the evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework; the task force met monthly and completed electronic EtD forms for each PICO, considering quality of evidence, magnitude of effect, patient values and preferences, resources, cost, acceptability, and feasibility. For strong recommendations, the wording "we recommend" was used and for weak recommendations "we suggest", with strong recommendations for or against an intervention based on whether desirable outweighed undesirable effects or the reverse.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^115Le8qU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

There are numerous causes of a raised core temperature. A fever occurring in sepsis may be associated with a survival benefit. However, this is not the case for non-infective triggers. Where heat generation exceeds heat loss and the core temperature rises above that set by the hypothalamus, a combination of cellular, local, organ-specific, and systemic effects occurs and puts the individual at risk of both short-term and long-term dysfunction which, if severe or sustained, may lead to death. This narrative review is part of a series that will outline the pathophysiology of pyrogenic and non-pyrogenic fever, concentrating primarily on the pathophysiology of non-septic causes.

### Guidelines for evaluation of new fever in critically ill adult patients: 2008 update from the American college of critical care medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117SJxHc]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the practice parameters for the evaluation of adult patients who develop a new fever in the intensive care unit, for the purpose of guiding clinical practice.

Participants

A task force of 11 experts in the disciplines related to critical care medicine and infectious diseases was convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Specialties represented included critical care medicine, surgery, internal medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, and laboratory medicine/microbiology.

Evidence

The task force members provided personal experience and determined the published literature (MEDLINE articles, textbooks, etc.) from which consensus was obtained. Published literature was reviewed and classified into one of four categories, according to study design and scientific value.

Consensus Process

The task force met twice in person, several times by teleconference, and held multiple e-mail discussions during a 2-yr period to identify the pertinent literature and arrive at consensus recommendations. Consideration was given to the relationship between the weight of scientific evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Draft documents were composed and debated by the task force until consensus was reached by nominal group process.

Conclusions

The panel concluded that, because fever can have many infectious and noninfectious etiologies, a new fever in a patient in the intensive care unit should trigger a careful clinical assessment rather than automatic orders for laboratory and radiologic tests. A cost-conscious approach to obtaining cultures and imaging studies should be undertaken if indicated after a clinical evaluation. The goal of such an approach is to determine, in a directed manner, whether infection is present so that additional testing can be avoided and therapeutic decisions can be made.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^114Hxhz7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Whether due to pyrexia or a hyperthermia syndrome, elevated body temperature is commonly encountered in patients admitted to adult ICUs. Although estimates of the incidence of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies are derived from studies with small sample size and inconsistent reporting of noninfectious aetiologies, current literature suggests that pyrexia is most frequently the sign of an infection. Among patients admitted to the ICU following surgery and/or an acute neurological condition, early fever may indicate a noninfectious process. Pyrexia commonly triggers a full septic work-up, but on its own is a poor predictor of culture-positivity. In order to improve culturing practices, and better guide the diagnostic approach to critically ill patients with pyrexia, additional research is required to provide more robust estimates of the incidence of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies, and their relationship to other clinical features. In the meantime, we suggest that investigations in patients with an elevated body temperature should be guided by the clinical probability of the aetiologies outlined in our proposed diagnostic approach.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults [^112FQ7yj]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad but is typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. Most cases in adults occur because of uncommon presentations of common diseases, and up to 75% of cases will resolve spontaneously without reaching a definitive diagnosis. In the absence of localizing signs and symptoms, the workup should begin with a comprehensive history and physical examination to help narrow potential etiologies. Initial testing should include an evaluation for infectious etiologies, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes such as venous thromboembolism and thyroiditis. If erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels are elevated and a diagnosis has not been made after initial evaluation, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, with computed tomography, may be useful in reaching a diagnosis. If noninvasive diagnostic tests are unrevealing, then the invasive test of choice is a tissue biopsy because of the relatively high diagnostic yield. Depending on clinical indications, this may include liver, lymph node, temporal artery, skin, skin-muscle, or bone marrow biopsy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of fever of unknown origin and therefore should be avoided except in patients who are neutropenic, immunocompromised, or critically ill.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^11157B5q]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A systematic review of observational studies in febrile critically ill adults reported five different definitions of pyrexia among the nine included studies, with 38.3 °C being the most frequently cited threshold. A meta-analysis examining thermometer accuracy found seven distinct definitions of pyrexia, with 37.8 °C being the most frequently cited temperature threshold. A multinational survey of 139 ICUs in 23 countries found 14 discreet temperature thresholds used to define pyrexia with a range of 37–40 °C and a median (interquartile range) of 38.2 °C (38.0–38.5 °C). Guidelines in critically ill adults define pyrexia as a temperature of 38.3 °C or greater, with the caveat that a lower threshold should be used in immunocompromised patients who are more likely to harbor a severe illness without significant elevation in body temperature. Although not a well-established inherited or acquired state of immunodeficiency, being critically ill presents multiple factors that may impair immune system function and the likelihood of responding to physiologic stress through an elevation in body temperature. These factors include but are not limited to the presence of invasive catheters, decreased mobility and ability to communicate, frequent use of anti-pyretic analgesic drugs and/or broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and extracorporeal forms of organ system support. Therefore, in this article a core body temperature of 38.0 °C or greater will represent pyrexia or hyperthermia. High pyrexia will be defined as a temperature of 39.5 °C or greater.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^114qaxYY]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effects of fever therapy compared with no fever therapy in a wide population of febrile adults.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials.

Data sources

CENTRAL, BIOSIS, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection, searched from their inception to 2 July 2021.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised clinical trials in adults diagnosed as having fever of any origin. Included experimental interventions were any fever therapy, and the control intervention had to be no fever therapy (with or without placebo/sham).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Primary outcomes were all cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and non-serious adverse events. Aggregate data were synthesised with meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and trial sequential analyses, and the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Forty two trials assessing 5140 participants were included. Twenty three trials assessed 11 different antipyretic drugs, 11 trials assessed physical cooling, and eight trials assessed a combination of antipyretic drugs and physical cooling. Of the participants, 3007 were critically ill, 1892 were non-critically ill, 3277 had infectious fever, and 1139 had non-infectious fever. All trials were assessed as being at high risk of bias. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis showed that the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the risk of death (risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 1.19; I² = 0%; P = 0.62; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (risk ratio 1.02, 0.89 to 1.17; I² = 0%; P = 0.78; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) could be rejected. One trial assessing quality of life was included, showing no difference between fever therapy and control. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis showed that the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the risk of non-serious adverse events could be neither confirmed nor rejected (risk ratio 0.92, 0.67 to 1.25; I² = 66.5%; P = 0.58; four trials; very low certainty evidence).

Conclusions

Fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death and serious adverse events.

SCCM/IDSA guidelines for adult ICU new-onset fever describe an update using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and apply to adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise; the document addresses microbiologic studies, imaging procedures, and the use of biomarkers for fever with initial onset after ICU admission, focusing on detection of potential infectious etiologies. It states that not all febrile episodes dictate a need for investigation when a noninfectious etiology is obvious such as postoperative fever, and that for fevers requiring investigation a good history and physical examination will often reveal potential sources of infection. It directs that diagnostic studies should then be sent with those potential sources in focus rather than reflexively sending cultures for all possible sources, notes that any recommendation from the 2008 guideline not specifically addressed in this update remains in place, and clarifies that although recommendations may be applicable to severely immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients and those with severe neutropenia, these populations are not directly addressed here.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^114Gz9aU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Management of pyrexia

Temperature target

Different approaches to fever treatment have been proposed:
Control of pyrexia when it occurs: treatment administered when temperature exceeds a predefined threshold
Strict avoidance of pyrexia: temperature maintained below fever threshold
Strict maintenance of normothermia: TTM with a predefined normothermia range, e.g. 36–37 °C.

The absence of consensus over a definition of fever, the multitude of clinical situations and the scarcity of trials hinder setting goals for clinical practice in terms of treatment timing, rapidity of normothermia induction, temperature target and duration of treatment.

For patients with OHCA, some data can be drawn from the TTM 33 versus 36 °C study. After the 4-h period to achieve the targeted temperature, 95% of the patients in the 36 °C group had a core body temperature below 37.5 °C for the first 24 h. Treatment of pyrexia in this population may, therefore, correspond to a strict maintenance of body temperature below 37.5 °C. Whether strict normothermia is superior to a strategy that aims to control pyrexia at > 37.5 °C once it occurs remains to be tested.

In the "Eurotherm" study, the evolution of body core temperature shows that, in the control group, patients were strictly maintained at 37 °C, which could correspond to "standard" normothermia in TBI.

In septic shock, fever control with a TTM of 36.5–37 °C over a 48-h period was found to be advantageous. In a post hoc analysis, the association between different thresholds of temperature and mortality were tested. The time spent with a core body temperature below 38.4 °C within the first 48 h was the most discriminatory. This raises the question of whether a strict avoidance of pyrexia could be sufficient to induce similar benefits.

### Prolonged febrile illness and fever of unknown origin in adults [^114rkC3H]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin has been described as a febrile illness (temperature of 101°F [38.3°C] or higher) for three weeks or longer without an etiology despite a one-week inpatient evaluation. A more recent qualitative definition requires only a reasonable diagnostic evaluation. Although there are more than 200 diseases in the differential diagnosis, most cases in adults are limited to several dozen possible causes. Fever of unknown origin is more often an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than an unusual disease. The most common subgroups in the differential are infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. Clinicians should perform a comprehensive history and examination to look for potentially diagnostic clues to guide the initial evaluation. If there are no potentially diagnostic clues, the patient should undergo a minimum diagnostic workup, including a complete blood count, chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level testing. Further testing should include blood cultures, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Human immunodeficiency virus and appropriate region-specific serologic testing (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, tuberculosis) and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography or computed tomography are commonly performed. If the diagnosis remains elusive, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography plus computed tomography may help guide the clinician toward tissue biopsy. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are generally discouraged in patients with fever of unknown origin.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America adult ICU new fever — results overview: The panel issued 12 recommendations and 9 best practice statements and recommended central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors, when devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical for diagnosis and management; for patients without these devices, oral or rectal temperatures over less reliable methods (axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers) were recommended. Imaging studies including ultrasonography were recommended in addition to microbiological evaluation using rapid diagnostic testing strategies, and biomarkers were recommended to assist in guiding the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy, with all recommendations issued being weak based on the quality of data.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^116bVXvh]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Elevation in core body temperature is one of the most frequently detected abnormal signs in patients admitted to adult ICUs, and is associated with increased mortality in select populations of critically ill patients. The definition of an elevated body temperature varies considerably by population and thermometer, and is commonly defined by a temperature of 38.0 °C or greater. Terms such as hyperthermia, pyrexia, and fever are often used interchangeably. However, strictly speaking hyperthermia refers to the elevation in body temperature that occurs without an increase in the hypothalamic set point, such as in response to specific environmental (e.g., heat stroke), pharmacologic (e.g., neuroleptic malignant syndrome), or endocrine (e.g., thyrotoxicosis) stimuli. On the other hand, pyrexia and fever refer to the classical increase in body temperature that occurs in response to a vast list of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies in association with an increase in the hypothalamic set point. In this review, we examine the contemporary literature investigating the incidence and aetiology of pyrexia and hyperthermia among medical and surgical patients admitted to adult ICUs with or without an acute neurological condition. A temperature greater than 41.0 °C, although occasionally observed among patients with infectious or noninfectious pyrexia, is more commonly observed in patients with hyperthermia. Most episodes of pyrexia are due to infections, but incidence estimates of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies are limited by studies with small sample size and inconsistent reporting of noninfectious aetiologies. Pyrexia commonly triggers a full septic work-up, but on its own is a poor predictor of culture-positivity. In order to improve culturing practices, and better guide the diagnostic approach to critically ill patients with pyrexia, additional research is required to provide more robust estimates of the incidence of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies, and their relationship to other clinical features (e.g., leukocytosis). In the meantime, using existing literature, we propose an approach to identifying the aetiology of pyrexia in critically ill adults.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^114id8nk]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

SCCM/IDSA adult ICU fever — temperature measurement rationale — Any device used to measure temperature in a patient should provide reliable, reproducible, safe, and convenient results, and the thermistor of a pulmonary artery catheter, a bladder catheter, or an esophageal probe is considered the gold standard method for measuring core body temperature to which other devices are compared. Many ICU patients will not have a device in place to directly measure core body temperature and will need to have temperature measurements taken by other devices. A meta-analysis published in 2015 addressed agreement between peripheral and central thermometers and found that nonvascular central thermometers had clinically acceptable limits of agreement with the pulmonary artery thermistors, whereas rectal temperatures were found to be a few tenths of a degree different from the central temperature comparator and were not predictably consistent. Oral and tympanic membrane temperature measurements did not accurately estimate body temperature and were often 1 or 2 degrees higher or lower than the actual core body temperature, and both oral and tympanic membrane thermometers are poor screening tools for monitoring temperature.

There is insufficient evidence to allow for a recommendation to inform the diagnostic value of CT for the diagnosis of underlying causes of fever in ICU patients, yet there was consensus among the panel that it is reasonable for surgical patients to undergo CT imaging of the operative area when fever first occurs several days after surgery and an alternative cause is not readily identified; timing in the immediate postoperative setting has currently insufficient data and should be made in collaboration with the surgical services, with stability of the patient and risk of adverse events during transportation taken into consideration, indications that may include immunocompromised state and specific follow-up of abnormalities on plain radiography, and a benefit that CT can identify sources of fever for which direct diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention is possible (e.g., percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess).

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^111yC1Mj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Temperature is commonly measured as part of the routine assessment of patients admitted to adult ICUs. Normal body temperature is between 36.0 and 37.5 °C. Elevated body temperature is detected in approximately 50% of patients admitted to adult ICUs. In addition to being common, elevated body temperature is associated with increased mortality in subpopulations of critically ill patients including those with acute neurological conditions, noninfectious aetiologies of pyrexia, and medical patients that develop pyrexia in the ICU. Although the optimal approach to managing elevated body temperature in critically ill patients remains controversial, it is widely accepted that elevated body temperature is an evolutionarily conserved sign of an underlying physiologic stressor and its presence should trigger a systematic search for the aetiology.

In this article, we will review the contemporary literature investigating the aetiology and incidence of elevated body temperature among patients admitted to adult ICUs. We will begin by examining literature pertaining to the measurement of body temperature and definitions for what constitutes an elevated temperature. We will then focus on the aetiology of pyrexia in medical and surgical patients with and without acute neurological conditions, including a brief discussion on hyperthermia syndromes. Because immunocompromised patients present a distinct set of aetiologic considerations, they will not be reviewed.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^113ystWg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

What is pyrexia?

Pathophysiology

The process of tightly regulating body temperature within a specified range (± 0.2 °C), or thermoregulation, is an essential homeostatic mechanism. Thermoregulation consists of afferent signalling via warm and cold thermoreceptors, central processing within the hypothalamus and efferent response. These responses include regulation of peripheral blood flow, diaphoresis and shivering. Whilst there is strict control there is also rhythmic temperature variability over a 24-h period. This circadian rhythm is altered in critically ill patients with both temporal shifts and a larger magnitude of variation, both increasing with disease severity.

Pyrexia (also named fever) is the altering upward of the thermoregulatory set point, often secondary to the systemic inflammatory response to a stimulus such as infection. The molecular basis is summarized in Fig. 1. Fever has been defined by The American College of Critical Care Medicine, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America as a core temperature of 38.3 °C or higher. Pyrexia secondary to the systemic inflammatory response should be distinguished from hyperthermia resulting from excessive heat production, as observed in heatstroke and malignant syndromes, or from ineffective heat loss. Temperature levels encountered during hyperthermia are usually higher than during pyrexia because thermoregulation is abolished; indication of rapid temperature control is, therefore, indisputable to avoid irreversible tissue damage.

Grading and measurement

The definition of pyrexia in itself is complex as there is no agreed consensus. This is further complicated by peripheral thermometers not accurately estimating body core temperature. The causes of pyrexia are multiple and contribute to different definitions. During infection, fever is usually defined as a temperature greater that 38.3 °C; in the post-resuscitation care of cardiac arrest, a threshold of 37.6 °C is used; and in stroke, thresholds of 37.2, 37.5 and 38 °C are all applied. Whatever the clinical situation, hypothermia is usually defined by a core temperature lower than 36 °C.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^112EGN9f]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations in relation to other studies

Previous studies have primarily focused on specific patient groups, such as critically ill patients and those with sepsis, or specific fever control interventions. Our review differs from previous research in that we have included a wider variety of both participants and fever therapies, allowing us, unlike previous studies, to obtain sufficient power by reaching required information sizes. The implications of including a variety of different interventions and a diverse patient group may entail results that are difficult to interpret if significant statistical heterogeneity is present. We therefore stated in the protocol that meta-analyses would be done only if the trials showed low levels of heterogeneity. With our analyses indicating low levels of heterogeneity and our subgroup analyses showing no subgroup differences, we deemed meta-analyses to be valid and did them including all identified trials. The relative effect, regardless of intervention type and patient group, being similar confirms and verifies our decision to pool these trials. We do, however, acknowledge that tests of heterogeneity most likely are underpowered.

The scope of this systematic review was wider in the population studied compared with previous research because our ambition was to assess the effects of fever therapy with regard to the outcomes most important to patients — that is, mortality and serious adverse events. Trials designed to investigate and report on these outcomes will inevitably focus on sicker patient populations; the participants included in the important analyses were all admitted to hospital, and most were critically ill. Our results therefore say little about fever therapy for milder disease states in the wider non-admitted population.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Fever therapy in febrile adults: systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses [^115evS6E]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses, we showed that fever therapy does not seem to affect the risk of death or serious adverse events in febrile adults. We found almost no signs of statistical heterogeneity, and none of the predefined subgroup analyses showed evidence of a difference in all cause mortality or serious adverse events, which supports the validity of our meta-analysis results. We found insufficient evidence to confirm or reject the hypothesis that fever therapy influences quality of life or non-serious adverse events.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^1164R7Fg]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Around 35% of in-hospital patients will develop pyrexia, increasing up to 70% amongst the critically unwell. Pyrexia has long been thought of as a protective physiological response to help host defences, although this is now being challenged. Despite recent advances, it remains unclear whether pyrexia or the physiological response to pyrexia causes morbidity and mortality and whether management of pyrexia with pharmacological agents or physical cooling actually confers benefit. We review some of the recent evidence for and against treating pyrexia with reference to varying disease severity. Finally, we discuss treatment strategies and methods.

This narrative review of pyrexia and associated treatment options is based on the latest available published evidence. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for articles published in English before 12 Feb 2016. We used the search terms "fever", "pyrexia", "hyperthermia" in combination with "ICU" or "sepsis" or "brain injury" or "cardiac arrest" and with "cooling" or "antipyretics" or "acetaminophen" or "NSAIDS". We largely selected publication from the past 15 years. Further evidence was selected from these articles' reference lists and from our previous knowledge of the subject. Review articles are cited to provide further information on aspects that are not within the remit of this article.

For low to intermediate probability, we suggest measuring either serum PCT or CRP to rule out bacterial infection (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Biomarkers such as PCT and CRP deployed with rapid turnaround times, have been used as adjuncts in the early diagnosis of sepsis while awaiting microbiologic culture results, major guidelines recommend against routine use of biomarkers in the setting of sepsis and septic shock, out of respect for uncertain benefit and cost and availability issues, and in the setting of fever and lower likelihood of infection, however, there may be a role in obtaining a baseline value to assist in the discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy.

SCCM/IDSA adult ICU fever — measuring body temperature recommendation — Central temperature monitoring methods, including thermistors for pulmonary artery catheters, bladder catheters, or esophageal balloon thermistors, are preferred when these devices are in place or accurate temperature measurements are critical to diagnosis and management. For patients without these devices in place, we suggest using oral or rectal temperatures over other temperature measurement methods that are less reliable (such as axillary or tympanic membrane temperatures, noninvasive temporal artery thermometers, or chemical dot thermometers) (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

### Persistent fever in the ICU [^115cNCud]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Disorders of elevated body temperature may be classified as either fever or hyperthermia. Fever is caused by a pyrogen-mediated upward adjustment of the hypothalamic thermostat; hyperthermia results from a loss of physiologic control of temperature regulation. Fever in the ICU can be due to infectious or noninfectious causes. The initial approach to a febrile, critically ill patient should involve a thoughtful review of the clinical data to elicit the likely source of fever prior to the ordering of cultures, imaging studies, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both high fever and prolonged fever have been associated with increased mortality; however, a causal role for fever as a mediator of adverse outcomes during non-neurologic critical illness has not been established. Outside the realm of acute brain injury, the practice of treating fever remains controversial. To generate high-quality, evidence-based guidelines for the management of fever, large, prospective, multicenter trials are needed.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^113qa2G7]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Approach to determining the aetiology of elevated body temperature in immunocompetent patients admitted to adult ICUs. Example diagnoses are included in each of the terminal boxes. a Often associated with a temperature of 41.0 °C or greater. b Onset will be later for a small percentage of patients with "central pyrexia", otherwise this most commonly occurs early during ICU admission

There is considerable heterogeneity among clinicians in the temperature threshold used to define an episode of pyrexia or hyperthermia. This heterogeneity includes not only temperature variability related to the normal diurnal variability in body temperature, but also differences in the thermometer used to measure temperature. Guidelines in critically ill adults recommend measuring temperature using a central thermometer that provides a direct measure of the core temperature. Examples of such central thermometers include the pulmonary artery catheter, and urinary bladder, esophageal, and rectal thermistors. Although these thermometers provide the most accurate assessment of core body temperature, they are not commonly employed as the primary method of temperature measurement in critically ill patients. Rather, temperature is commonly measured using thermometers that measure temperature from a peripheral site (e.g. tympanic membrane, temporal artery, axilla, mouth) and use proprietary algorithms to convert the measured temperature into a core temperature. Unfortunately, peripheral thermometers are among the least accurate, especially in patients with fever or hypothermia. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that, compared with central thermometers, the sensitivity and specificity of peripheral thermometers for the detection of fever was 64% (95% CI 55–72%) and 96% (95% CI 93–97%), respectively. Therefore, for patients where exact temperature measurement is critical or when measured temperature is not congruent with the clinical picture, confirmation with a central device is a key step in determining the underlying aetiology.

Recommendation 2023

Some uncertainty exists as to whether hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C compared with normothermia is beneficial in terms of improving neurological outcome in all patients after cardiac arrest. The current recommendations from the ERC and ESICM to merely prevent fever, in our view, neither take into account all current available evidence, nor consider the shortcomings of studies. Based on retrospective studies showing that a large proportion of patients with presumed moderate brain damage significantly benefit from hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C, along with the most recent Cochrane systematic review and meta-analyses of RCT showing a statistically significant benefit of hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C, and based on the fact that no study has shown a deleterious effect of hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C on neurological or overall outcome, we suggest that international guidelines follow the current Cochrane analyses and in the interim period, clinicians should consider hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C in all adults after cardiac arrest as soon as feasible, and to maintain this temperature range for at least 24 h. Active normothermia (36.5 to 37.7 °C) should be ensured after rewarming before and during neurological assessment, to avoid fever.

Future randomised studies are needed to identify the patients who benefit most from hypothermia in the range of 32 to 34 °C, and to find the optimal time point of initiating and the optimal duration of hypothermia.

### Evaluation of fever in the emergency department [^115TbfrE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is one of the most common complaints in the emergency department (ED) and is more complex than generally appreciated. The broad differential diagnosis of fever includes numerous infectious and non-infectious etiologies. An essential skill in emergency medicine is recognizing the pitfalls in fever evaluation.

Objective Of Review

This review provides an overview of the complaint of fever in the ED to assist the emergency physician with a structured approach to evaluation.

Discussion

Fever can be due to infectious or non-infectious etiology and results from the body's natural response to a pyrogen. Adjunctive testing including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin has been evaluated in the literature, but these tests do not have the needed sensitivity and specificity to definitively rule in a bacterial cause of fever. Blood cultures should be obtained in septic shock or if the results will change clinical management. Fever may not be always present in true infection, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Oral temperatures suffer from poor sensitivity to diagnose fever, and core temperatures should be utilized if concern for fever is present. Consideration of non-infectious causes of elevated temperature is needed based on the clinical situation.

Conclusion

Any fever evaluation must rigorously maintain a broad differential to avoid pitfalls that can have patient care consequences. Fever is complex and due to a variety of etiologies. An understanding of the pathophysiology, causes, and assessment is important for emergency physicians.

### Permissive versus restrictive temperature thresholds in critically ill children with fever and infection: a multicentre randomized clinical pilot trial [^111rb9bX]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The fever response has been conserved across animal and even plant species throughout evolution for at least 580 million years. Numerous innate and adaptive immunological processes are accelerated by fever. More rapid recoveries are observed from chickenpox, malaria and rhinovirus infections with avoidance of antipyretic medication. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend not using antipyretic agents "with the sole aim of reducing body temperature in children with fever". There is uncertainty if these immunological advantages of fever outweigh the associated increase in metabolic demand (~ 10% increment in in oxygen consumption per degree centigrade) during critical illness.

Observational data in critically ill adults suggest lower mortality with higher peak temperatures in the first 24 h in the context of infection. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of antipyretic interventions in critically ill adults are mostly small (26–200 patients) and do not show any consistent effect on early mortality. In a recent meta-analysis including eight randomized trials, the relative risk for mortality in sepsis with fever control compared with either no control or a more permissive threshold was 0.93, (95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.13). The recent HEAT trial (ACTRN12612000513819) examined the effect of acetaminophen versus placebo to treat fever in 700 critically ill adults with known or suspected infection. Neither mortality nor the number of ICU-free days to day 28 was significantly different. Children differ from adults in both immunity and causes of infection, and hence inferences from adult practice may not be appropriate. We are not aware of any RCTs comparing antipyretics or fever thresholds in critically ill children.

This pilot RCT was conducted to determine the safety and feasibility of a definitive multicentre trial comparing a restrictive approach to fever with a more permissive threshold in critically ill children, with the following objectives: (1) to test the willingness of clinicians to screen, recruit and randomize eligible patients, (2) to estimate the recruitment rate, (3) to test acceptability of the trial, consenting procedures and participant information, (4) to test, following randomization, delivery of, and adherence to the selected temperature thresholds (intervention and control) for antipyretic intervention and to demonstrate separation between the randomized groups in temperature measurements, (5) to inform on the likelihood of major safety concerns, and (6) to inform final selection of a patient-centred primary outcome measure.

The underlying hypothesis is that a more permissive threshold for use of antipyretic interventions is superior to the current restrictive approach.

### Randomised evaluation of active control of temperature versus ordinary temperature management (REACTOR) trial [^111XcBsN]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

It is unknown whether protocols targeting systematic prevention and treatment of fever achieve lower mean body temperature than usual care in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The objective of the Randomised Evaluation of Active Control of temperature vs. ORdinary temperature management trial was to confirm the feasibility of such a protocol with a view to conducting a larger trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned 184 adults without acute brain pathologies who had a fever in the previous 12 h, and were expected to be ventilated beyond the calendar day after recruitment, to systematic prevention and treatment of fever or usual care. The primary outcome was mean body temperature in the ICU within 7 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, ICU-free days and survival time censored at hospital discharge.

Results

Compared with usual temperature management, active management significantly reduced mean temperature. In both groups, fever generally abated within 72 h. The mean temperature difference between groups was greatest in the first 48 h, when it was generally in the order of 0.5 °C. Overall, 23 of 89 patients assigned to active management (25.8%) and 23 of 89 patients assigned to usual management (25.8%) died in hospital (odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.51–1.96, P = 1.0). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in ICU-free days or survival to day 90.

Conclusions

Active temperature management reduced body temperature compared with usual care; however, fever abated rapidly, even in patients assigned to usual care, and the magnitude of temperature separation was small.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^112RTJFX]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Body temperature measurement and definitions

Normal body temperature is between 36.0 and 37.5 °C, with intraindividual variability of 0.5–1.0 °C depending on the time of day (low in early morning, peak in early afternoon/late evening). Elevated body temperature is classified as pyrexia or hyperthermia. Although these two terms are often used interchangeably, their biological mechanisms and response to therapy are different — thus their distinction is important and will be maintained in this article. Pyrexia, also referred to as fever, is an adaptive response to a physiologic stress that is tightly regulated through endogenous pyrogenic and anti-pyretic pathways, and is associated with an increase in the hypothalamic set point. As such, the elevated body temperature in patients with pyrexia responds to pharmacologic anti-pyretic therapies such as acetaminophen. On the contrary, the elevated body temperature that occurs in hyperthermia syndromes often exceeds 41.0 °C, and reflects a pathologic increase in body temperature that is not associated with an increased hypothalamic set point. This elevated temperature in hyperthermia is therefore not responsive to pharmacologic anti-pyretic therapy. For this article, pyrexia and fever will be used interchangeably, but hyperthermia will refer to the syndrome that accompanies specific environmental, pharmacologic, or endocrine stimuli (Fig. 1).

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aDuma]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Patients meeting the criteria for fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be evaluated with structured or nonstructured approaches, but the optimal diagnostic method is unresolved.

Objective

To analyze differences in diagnostic outcomes among patients undergoing structured or nonstructured diagnostic methods applied to prospective clinical studies.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with librarian-generated query strings for FUO, PUO, fever or pyrexia of unknown origin, clinical trial, and prospective studies identified from January 1, 1997, to March 31, 2021.

Study Selection

Prospective studies meeting any adult FUO definition were included. Articles were excluded if patients did not precisely fit any existing adult FUO definition or studies were not classified as prospective.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Abstracted data included years of publication and study period, country, setting (eg, university vs community hospital), defining criteria and category outcome, structured or nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluation, sex, temperature threshold and measurement, duration of fever and hospitalization before final diagnoses, and contribution of potential diagnostic clues, biochemical and immunological serologic studies, microbiology cultures, histologic analysis, and imaging studies. Structured protocols compared with nonstructured diagnostic methods were analyzed using regression models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall diagnostic yield was the primary outcome.

Results

Among the 19 prospective trials with 2627 unique patients included in the analysis (range of patient ages, 10–94 years; 21.0%-55.3% female), diagnoses among FUO series varied across and within World Health Organization (WHO) geographic regions. Use of a structured diagnostic protocol was not significantly associated with higher odds of yielding a diagnosis compared with nonstructured protocols in aggregate (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65–1.49) or between Western Europe (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Spain) (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.49–1.86) and Eastern Europe (Turkey and Romania) (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.41–1.69). Despite the limited number of studies in some regions, analyses based on the 6 WHO geographic areas found differences in the diagnostic yield. Western European studies had the lowest percentage of achieving a diagnosis. Southeast Asia led with infections at 49.0%. Noninfectious inflammatory conditions were most prevalent in the Western Pacific region (34.0%), whereas the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest proportion of oncologic explanations (24.0%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, diagnostic yield varied among WHO regions. Available evidence from prospective studies did not support that structured diagnostic protocols had a significantly better rate of achieving a diagnosis than nonstructured protocols. Clinicians worldwide should incorporate geographical disease prevalence in their evaluation of patients with FUO.

### The continuing question of how fever duration is associated with patient outcome [^111ygPTz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Although fever magnitude and etiology have been associated with outcomes of critically ill patients, possible associations between fever duration and mortality remain inconclusive. Since long-lasting fever is generally attributed to severe pathologic conditions, it is expected to be an indicator of adverse outcome. It also seems plausible that persistent fever in specific patient groups, mainly those with cerebral damage or limited cardiorespiratory reserve, could lead to worsened outcomes. Existing studies on these associations have been considerably limited because of methodological flaws, which may account for controversial findings that have been reported. Well-designed, large-sample studies using diverse measures of fever duration need to be conducted.

### Accuracy of peripheral thermometers for estimating temperature: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VkASg]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Body temperature is commonly used to screen patients for infectious diseases, establish diagnoses, monitor therapy, and guide management decisions.

Purpose

To determine the accuracy of peripheral thermometers for estimating core body temperature in adults and children.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL Plus from inception to July 2015.

Study Selection

Prospective studies comparing the accuracy of peripheral (tympanic membrane, temporal artery, axillary, or oral) thermometers with central (pulmonary artery catheter, urinary bladder, esophageal, or rectal) thermometers.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods, and outcomes and assessed the quality of individual studies.

Data Synthesis

75 studies (8682 patients) were included. Most studies were at high or unclear risk of patient selection bias (74%) or index test bias (67%). Compared with central thermometers, peripheral thermometers had pooled 95% limits of agreement (random-effects meta-analysis) outside the predefined clinically acceptable range (± 0.5 °C), especially among patients with fever (-1.44 °C to 1.46 °C for adults; -1.49 °C to 0.43 °C for children) and hypothermia (-2.07 °C to 1.90 °C for adults; no data for children). For detection of fever (bivariate random-effects meta-analysis), sensitivity was low (64% [95% CI, 55% to 72%]; I2 = 95.7%; P < 0.001) but specificity was high (96% [CI, 93% to 97%]; I2 = 96.3%; P < 0.001). Only 1 study reported sensitivity and specificity for the detection of hypothermia.

Limitations

High-quality data for some temperature measurement techniques are limited. Pooled data are associated with interstudy heterogeneity that is not fully explained by stratified and metaregression analyses.

Conclusion

Peripheral thermometers do not have clinically acceptable accuracy and should not be used when accurate measurement of body temperature will influence clinical decisions.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Fever control in critically ill adults. An individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112nZsj5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

One potential way to protect patients from the physiological demands that are a consequence of fever is to aim to prevent fever and to treat it assiduously when it occurs. Our primary hypothesis was that more active fever management would increase survival among patient subgroups with limited physiological reserves such as older patients, patients with higher illness acuity, and those requiring organ support.

Methods

We conducted an individual-level patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to compare the outcomes of ICU patients who received more active fever management with the outcomes of patients who received less active fever management. The primary outcome variable of interest was the unadjusted time to death after randomisation.

Results

Of 1413 trial participants, 707 were assigned to more active fever management and 706 were assigned to less active fever management. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity in the effect of more active compared with less active fever management on survival in any of the pre-specified subgroups that were chosen to identify patients with limited physiological reserves. Overall, more active fever management did not result in a statistically significant difference in survival time compared with less active fever management [hazard ratio 0.91; (95% CI 0.75–1.10), P = 0.32].

Conclusions

Our findings do not support the hypothesis that more active fever management increases survival compared with less active fever management overall or in patients with limited physiological reserves.

Literature Search

This study protocol follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Checklist. The present study was exempted from obtaining formal institutional review board approval and the requirement to obtain informed patient consent because it is secondary research of publicly available data.

A search of all prospective clinical studies from January 1, 1997, to March 31, 2021, was executed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases with terms constructed by a university librarian that included the query strings of [FUO] [fever of unknown origin (Medical Subject Headings [MeSH])] [PUO] [pyrexia of unknown origin (MeSH)] [clinical trial] [clinical trial (publication type)], and [prospective studies (MeSH)]. English and non-English languages articles were included. The search period was chosen based on the adult FUO criteria by de Kleijn et al in 1997. Relevant non-English abstracts or full-text articles were translated using Google Translate. Articles resulting from these searches and relevant cited references were reviewed. Patients meeting any definition of adult FUO, were included to minimize the chance of unintended selection bias because there remains no single accepted adult FUO definition. Articles were excluded if patients did not precisely fit any existing adult FUO definitionor studies were not classified as prospective.

Abstracted data included years of publication and study period, country, setting (eg, university vs community hospital), FUO defining criteria, structured or nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluation, standard FUO category outcomes (eg, infectious diseases, noninfectious inflammatory disorder, oncology, miscellaneous, and undiagnosed), sex, temperature threshold and method of measurement, duration of fever and hospitalization before final diagnoses, and contribution of potential diagnostic clues, biochemical and immunological serologic studies, microbiology cultures, histologic analysis, and imaging studies. Studies were classified according to geographic distribution based on the 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The United Nations Human Development Index ranking, years of life expectancy at birth (LEB), and gross national income per capita (GNI) were also included for each representative country.

Antipyretic medications for critically ill ICU patients with fever — For critically ill patients with fever who value comfort by reducing temperature, we suggest using antipyretic medications over nonpharmacologic methods to reduce body temperature (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 RCTs including 1,963 non-neurocritically ill patients were examined; fever management reduced body temperature (8 RCTs, n = 1,139, MD −0.41; 95% CI [−0.66 to −0.16]; p < 0.001; I2 = 94%, low quality), but did not improve 28-day mortality (11 RCTs, n = 1,745 patients, RR 1.03; 95% CI [0.79–1.35]; p = 0.82; I2 = 45%, low quality), hospital mortality (3 RCT, n = 877, RR 0.97; 95% CI [0.73–1.30]; p = 0.85; I2 = 0%, moderate quality) or shock reversal (2 RCTs, n = 229, RR 1.11; 95% CI [0.76–1.62]; p = 0.59; I2 = 19%, very low quality). The panel issued a weak recommendation against the routine use of antipyretics in febrile ICU patients; however, in selected cases where patients or family members value reducing temperature for symptomatic relief, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring the use of antipyretic medications to treat fever. In certain patient populations, (neurologically injured or post cardiac arrest) the theoretical benefit of antipyretic therapy may outweigh the risk, but there is little evidence to support a recommendation for routine use of antipyretic medications in these populations.

### Impact of fever on the outcome non-anoxic acute brain injury patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114A1rxn]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Data sources and study selection

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of both retrospective and prospective observational studies, interventional studies and randomized clinical trials. The PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Embase databases were last searched on January 31st, 2024, including publications of adult human studies without date restriction. We used the PICO strategy to formulate our search as follows: Population adult patients (i.e. age > 18 years), admitted to the hospital due to non-cardiac arrest acute brain injury including stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic), subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury; Intervention: fever, as defined by the authors of each study; Control: normothermia; Outcome: primary outcomes were unfavorable neurological outcome and mortality at any time point as defined by the authors. The research strategy with the string for each database is shown in the Supplemental Electronic Material S1.

We considered the following criteria for study inclusion: (1) full-length reports published in peer-reviewed journals in English; (2) randomized clinical trial, interventional studies, observational cohorts, case control studies of adult human patients; (3) studies that assessed body temperature and reported the occurrence and definition of fever (e.g. when "hyperthermia" was used, this was considered as "fever"); (4) studies that included outcomes measures (i.e. mortality at any time point, unfavorable neurological outcome at any time point; neurological deterioration during hospitalization and stroke progression) in acute brain injury patients. Studies conducted in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy post cardiac arrest patients, children, healthy volunteers, or in animal models were excluded. We also excluded studies that compared hypothermia to normothermia without reporting the occurrence of fever. Editorials, commentaries, letters to editor, opinion articles, reviews, meeting abstracts and case reports were also excluded. When multiple publications of the same research group/center described case series with potential overlap, the more recent or larger publication, if eligible, was considered.

Four investigators (MS, EGB, MF, MT) performed the study selection process, including the initial search for the identification of references, the selection of potentially relevant titles for review of abstracts and, among them, of those chosen for review of the full-length reports. All selections were decided by consensus.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^114CmcYU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

"Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war, and of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever". (William Osler)

The normal human temperature is considered to be 37 °C, but may vary by up to 1 °C in healthy individuals. Elevated core temperature is a common finding in intensive care, affecting up to 70% of patients. Despite the general usage of the terms 'pyrexia', 'fever', and 'hyperthermia', they are not yet universally defined. The American College of Critical Care Medicine, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America define fever as a core temperature of 38.3 °C or higher, i.e. just above the upper limit of a normal human temperature, irrespective of the cause. Fever has its etymological basis in Latin, meaning simply 'heat', and pyrexia comes from the Greek 'pyr', meaning fire or fever. Some sources use the terms interchangeably, whereas others preserve 'fever' to mean a raised temperature caused by the action of thermoregulatory pyrogens on the hypothalamus; for instance, in sepsis and inflammatory conditions.

Hyperthermia also has no agreed definition; it has been defined as a core temperature above 38.2 °C, irrespective of the cause. Others use it for the classification of those conditions that increase the body's temperature above that set by the hypothalamus, and therefore specifically exclude those where fever is caused by pyrogens, being due to heat exposure or unregulated heat production in excess of heat loss. Common causes include classical and exertional heatstroke, and drug-related illnesses (for example, malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic syndrome).

There is, however, increasing evidence that many conditions considered non-pyrogenic may stimulate an inflammatory response, and the division into pyrogenic and non-pyrogenic may therefore be less clear-cut than previously understood.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) refers to disorders that present with prolonged and perplexing fevers that are difficult to diagnose. This article presents a clinical overview of classic and current causes of FUOs, which may be due to infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. Comprehensive but nonfocused diagnostic testing is ineffective and should be avoided. The FUO workup should be directed by the key history, physical, and laboratory findings in clinical presentation. The clinical syndromic approach in the differential diagnosis of FUOs is emphasized, and the diagnostic importance and significance of fever patterns are discussed.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^116h9MM2]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Incidence of pyrexia and aetiologies

The incidence of pyrexia among critically ill adults depends on the defining temperature threshold and the population studied (Table 1). A systematic review of nine observational studies in patients admitted to the ICU without an acute neurological condition found that the fever incidence varied between 26 and 88%. The largest studies were from Barie et al. and Laupland et al. Defined as a temperature of 38.2 °C or greater, Barie and colleagues found that fever was present in 26% of 2419 patients admitted to their surgical ICU over a 14-month period. Infections were responsible for 46% of febrile episodes, and were more likely in patients whose fever occurred at the time of admission following emergency surgery. On the contrary, among patients admitted to the ICU following elective surgery, early fever within 72 hours of admission was more likely to be noninfectious, and infectious aetiologies did not emerge until after 72 hours in the ICU. Defined as a temperature 38.3 °C or greater, Laupland and colleagues found that the cumulative incidence of fever was 44% among 20,466 critically ill adults with a broad range of admission diagnoses, with the highest incidence among trauma/neurologic patients. Cultures from blood, urine, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, and/or other sterile fluid were positive in 17% and 31% of fever and high fever episodes, respectively. Bloodstream infection occurred in 9% and 19% of fever and high fever episodes, respectively. Culture-positivity was most likely among medical patients. However, this study probably underestimated the incidence of infectious fever because the authors did not systematically evaluate the results of diagnostic tests other than cultures for identifying infection. Another study in the same health region that undertook a detailed chart review to investigate pyrexia management practices in 100 medical and surgical critically ill patients without an acute neurological condition found that infections were responsible for 73% of pyrexia episodes, with pneumonia the most common infection, occurring in 70% of infectious fevers. This is consistent with a large, prospective study of infection occurrence in 71 ICUs in Italy, wherein the most common source of infection was pneumonia.

Imaging evaluation in ICU fever: in the absence of an obvious non-thoracic source of infection, all patients should undergo chest radiography; site-specific computed tomography should be performed in patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery and may be considered in others with clinical findings pointing to these sites; and in patients with persisting fever when initial investigations fail to reveal a source, either usual care or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography may be considered.

Imaging studies in critically ill adults with fever — For patients who develop a fever during intensive care unit (ICU) stay, we recommend performing a chest radiograph (best practice statement). For patients who have recently undergone thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgery, we recommend performing CT (in collaboration with the surgical service) as part of a fever workup if an etiology is not readily identified by the initial workup (best-practice statement). For critically ill patients with fever in whom other diagnostic tests have failed to establish an etiology, we suggest performing an 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT if the risk of transport is deemed acceptable (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). The panel found insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation regarding the use of WBC scans for patients with fever without an established etiology. For critically ill patients with fever and no abdominal signs or symptoms or liver function abnormalities, and no recent abdominal surgery, we recommend against the routine use of a formal abdominal ultrasound or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) as an initial investigation (best practice statement).

### Overview of fever of unknown origin in adult and paediatric patients [^112ZBvwo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) can be caused by a wide group of diseases, and can include both benign and serious conditions. Since the first definition of FUO in the early 1960's, several updates to the definition, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been proposed. This review outlines a case report of an elderly Italian male patient with high fever and migrating arthralgia who underwent many procedures and treatments before a final diagnosis of Adult-onset Still's disease was achieved. This case report highlights the difficulties in diagnosing certain causes of FUO that requires a very high index of suspicion. The main causes of FUO in paediatric and adult patients will be reviewed here, underlying the fact that a physician should also consider the possibility that a patient with FUO may have a monogenic autoinflammatory disease (AID). The identification of AIDs requires a careful evaluation of both history and clinical details that may reveal important clues to identify the correct aetiology. We also provide a comprehensive account of specific signs and symptoms that could suggest possible diagnoses and guide the work-up of FUO and non-genetic periodic fevers in children.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has fascinated and perplexed clinicians for over a century. No published guidelines exist on the approach to FUO, and studies have demonstrated that a diagnosis is never established in up to 30% of cases. A comprehensive history and physical examination are the keys to establishing a diagnosis in patient with FUO. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of FUO by delineating the most important elements of a comprehensive history and physical examination.

Conclusion

Fever and hypothermia are the two different responses in human sepsis while normothermia is rare. Even though associated with several factors including environmental conditions, their regulatory causes and their potential impact on outcome is poorly understood, more detailed observational studies are needed to understand those before the therapeutic interventions targeting body temperature or metabolic adaptation in general can be tested in the right target population.

Future studies would need to consider that the most probable effect size estimates of TTM are less than half of that targeted in trials to date.

### Fever of unknown origin: a diagnostic approach to this vexing problem [^113T3Cvh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Fever is a common complaint leading families to seek medical attention. Its routine management is the bread and butter of pediatric practice. When fever is seen as prolonged beyond the expected time course (eg, 10 days for a presumed viral respiratory tract infection or 3 weeks for mononucleosis), concern for fever of unknown origin (FUO) may ensue. This diagnosis is among the most challenging for health care providers to approach and often involves referral to subspecialists. Generally, the pace of the evaluation should be guided by the severity of the disease, rather than the anxiety of the family or of the health care providers. It is useful to recognize that uncommon manifestations of common diseases are more likely than are rare diseases. Furthermore, clues to the diagnosis are frequently present in the history and physical examination but are not elicited or unappreciated (perhaps due to time constraints). Therefore, thoroughness and repetition are vitally important. Although the differential diagnosis of FUO is vast, a thoughtful, focused approach based on information gleaned from a thorough history and physical examination (together with any laboratory or other study results) is preferable to a "shotgun" or "running the list" one. Finally, FUO in special populations, including children in the hospital, those with HIV infection or other immunocompromise, and those in the developing world, require special consideration. Most children do well, compared to adults with FUO, but true FUO is not always a benign condition, necessitating the best care a health care provider can offer.

Temperature measurement in critically ill ICU patients — When accurate temperature measurement will influence diagnosis and management, a central thermometer is preferred. A rectal thermometer could be used but is often impractical in the ICU setting. Oral measurements are safe and convenient for alert and cooperative patients, but these temperature measurements can be distorted by mouth breathing or hot or cold fluids or gases in or near the mouth, and in critically ill patients oral temperature measurements are often impractical due to endotracheal intubation or the inability of the patient to cooperate; both thermometers are better than the alternatives when a central thermometer is not available. Tympanic membrane temperature reflects the temperature of the hypothalamus (core) and infrared ear thermometry detects radiant energy and core body temperature, but multiple studies have shown consistently poor agreement between tympanic membrane thermometer measurements and pulmonary artery or esophageal thermistors; such devices are not accurate if there is inflammation or blockage of the auditory canal and can yield inaccurate readings if the otoscope is not completely engaged with the tympanic membrane. The same infrared technology has been used in noninvasive temporal artery thermometers to estimate core body temperature; these estimates have not been reliable, as they have been found to be influenced by environmental temperature and sweating, and like axillary measurements, they should not be relied on. Chemical dot thermometers are single-use plastic strips with 50 heat-sensitive dots that represent temperature increments of 0.1 degrees, and inconsistent agreement between such devices and pulmonary catheter thermistors should limit their use in critically ill patients.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111oZbpS]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For adult patients complaining of acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 4 key characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever in ruling in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is likely to be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting or is associated with an inspiratory whooping sound (Grade 2C). Fever is defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

Serious adverse events

Sixteen trials (19 comparisons) with a total of 2415 participants reported on serious adverse events. The included trials assessed the effects of five different fever therapy interventions: ibuprofen versus placebo (three trials), paracetamol versus placebo (six trials), physical cooling versus no intervention (three trials), antipyretics plus physical cooling versus no intervention (two trials), and physical cooling plus antipyretics versus antipyretics (two trials). All 2415 participants were admitted to hospital; 2050 were critically ill, and 251 were non-critically ill (supplementary table S1). One trial included both critically ill and non-critically ill patients (120/2415). Of the 2415 participants, 1658 had infectious fever and 477 had non-infectious fever (supplementary table S1). For 286/2415 participants the origin of fever was unknown (supplementary table S1). A total of 307 (24.0%) of 1281 trial participants had a serious adverse event in the fever therapy group compared with 276 (24.2%) of 1140 in the control group.

Meta-analysis of serious adverse events did not show evidence of a difference (risk ratio 1.02, 0.89 to 1.17; I² = 0%; P = 0.78; 16 trials; high certainty evidence) (fig 4; supplementary table S3). Quantitative measures of heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%) combined with visual inspection of the forest plot did not show signs of significant heterogeneity (fig 4). Trial sequential analysis showed that we could reject the hypothesis that fever therapy reduces the relative risk of serious adverse events by 23% (fig 5). We assessed this outcome result as being at high risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence as being high (supplementary table S3). None of the subgroup analyses showed evidence of a difference (supplementary figures S12-S19). The assessment time points varied between trials, ranging from one day after randomisation to 90 days after randomisation.

Results

The search strategy defined in the protocol found 3273 publications that were evaluated to identify trials matching our inclusion criteria. We included a total of 42 trials randomising 5140 participants (supplementary figure S1). Twenty three trials assessed 11 different antipyretic drugs, 11 trials assessed physical cooling, and eight trials assessed a combination of antipyretic drugs and physical cooling. Of the participants, 3007 were critically ill, 1892 were non-critically ill, 3277 had infectious fever, and 1139 had non-infectious fever; 3062 participants were admitted to hospital, and 2078 were outpatients. We assessed 21 trials as being of some concern and 21 trials as being at high risk of bias (fig 1). The 42 included trials provided a total of 75 comparisons (supplementary table S1). Seventeen trials were included in meta-analyses. Missing data constituted ≤ 5% of the overall data, and we deemed the impact of missing data to be low; therefore, we did not do sensitivity analyses

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^1135pHz5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A mild elevation in core temperature is of benefit in sepsis. Non-pyrogenic hyperthermia is associated with short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects in a variety of organs. The damage occurs via a number of local and systemic mechanisms. Additionally, there appears to be emerging evidence of an overlap in the mechanisms of heat generation in different conditions. The evidence is that in sepsis the beneficial effects of pyrexia may balance these deleterious factors. However, in non-sepsis, the accumulation of the deleterious consequences of hyperthermia occurs early, at even mild degrees of fever. Hyperthermia above 40 °C appears to carry a high mortality by whatever cause. Early recognition, immediate cooling, and organ support are the mainstays of treatment, and to this end an improved understanding of the pathophysiology will continue to develop.

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^116WzKVD]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.3°C on at least two occasions and a duration of illness of ≥ 3 weeks or having multiple febrile episodes over this time period. There must be no obvious diagnosis despite complete history taking and examination, as well as appropriate investigation that should include routine blood tests, inflammatory markers, autoimmune screen, cultures, chest radiography and abdominal imaging. Investigation includes identifying any potential diagnostic clues (PDCs) that can help reveal the underlying cause of the fever; however, up to 50% of cases of FUO remain undiagnosed.

The case described here is of a rare condition presenting with FUO that proved to be a diagnostic challenge. Despite its rarity, accurate documentation of cases of Cogan's syndrome remains crucial to improving our awareness and understanding of this condition. This could in turn bring about the development of more effective treatment as well as reduce patient morbidity by leading to earlier diagnosis. Our case also stresses how laboratory and radiological investigations should not serve as an alternative to thorough clinical assessments since early recognition of PDCs and symptom complexes is more likely to help clinch a diagnosis than investigations which can at times return non-specific results.

### Prospective studies comparing structured vs nonstructured diagnostic protocol evaluations among patients with fever of unknown origin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RjAiM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

A question remains: can there be an optimal diagnostic protocol to improve diagnostic yield, and for whom or where would it be most applicable? If this search is based on the diagnostic protocol with the least percentage of undiagnosed cases (eg, highest correlation), only 2 studies, used structured protocols reporting rates less than 10.0% despite differing protocols. However, these 2 studies enrolled patients with FUO according to criteria by de Kleijn et al. Therefore, further exploration into the most valuable elements of these 2 protocols might inform an optimal protocol. The positive practical implications of our research results appear to be clear, suggesting physicians worldwide should initially consider geographic disease prevalence when evaluating these patients.

Although this meta-analysis did not support using a structured FUO protocol, that does not exclude additional, more extensive studies exploring optimal diagnostic methods. The goal of FUO research should be to improve the accurate diagnosis and facilitate efficiency with as few tests as required. Possible concepts for future studies include (1) use of a standard contemporary criterion to classify adults with FUOthat would enhance research by allowing better comparison of studies; (2) use of geographic disease epidemiologyand potential diagnostic clues in formulating disease hypotheses, because cases without these clues are particularly challenging to diagnose; (3) design of initial agnostic panel-based diagnostic testing strategies to meet geographic variations in disease, particularly in patients without potential diagnostic clues; and (4) earlier incorporation of advanced diagnostic methods (eg, 18 F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography with or without computed tomography or unbiased next-generation sequencing methods). The most definitive approach would be developing a multicenter FUO network that could prospectively evaluate structured vs nonstructured diagnostic investigations incorporating these elements with geographic disease epidemiology.

Finally, undiagnosed disorders are challenging for patients, families, and clinicians. Therefore, forging an FUO network to evaluate patients with undiagnosed diseases that fosters the breadth of expert collaborations and builds on the principles of the precision diagnostic model implemented by the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Networkmight reduce undiagnosed FUO cases. By improving testing efficiency and patient outcomes, such a network would leverage findings to facilitate better patient care, including added information about existing diseases as well as the discovery of novel prolonged febrile conditions among the many remaining without diagnoses.

### Fever of unknown origin in the elderly [^1137vZGu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) means fever that does not resolve itself in the period expected for self-limited infection and whose cause cannot be ascertained despite considerable diagnostic efforts. The differential diagnosis is often different in older patients, and presentation of disease is frequently nonspecific and symptoms are difficult to interpret. Multisystem disease has emerged as the most frequent cause of FUO in the elderly, and temporal arteritis is the most frequent specific diagnosis. Infections, particular tuberculosis, remain an important group. FUO is often associated with treatable conditions in this age group. Early recognition and prompt initiation of appropriate empirical therapy are cornerstones of the strategy.

The causes of fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) are diverse and may be the result of infectious rheumatic or inflammatory, neoplastic, or miscellaneous disorders. This article reviews the focused diagnostic approach to FUOs, emphasizing relevant history, physical examination, and selected laboratory tests using a clinical syndrome approach. Laboratory tests should be guided by the most likely diagnoses based on the presenting clinical syndrome. Considered in concert, nonspecific laboratory tests may provide important diagnostic clues.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults… [^116PXbDX]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The lack of a standard diagnostic workup leads to frustration for physicians and patients, and numerous noninvasive and invasive procedures are often performed without arriving at a definitive diagnosis. 1, 3 Currently, the most widely accepted definition of FUO requires only a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions and an unrevealing diagnostic workup. 2, 4 Previous definitions have provided suggested minimal time frames for investigation; however, these were acknowledged to be arbitrary and are not included in the current consensus definition. 2, 4. Evaluation INITIAL EVALUATION Early identification and precise localization of the cause are key because diagnostic delay worsens outcomes and contributes to deaths. 10 It should be suspected in cases of fever lasting longer than six months and in medical personnel. Signs such as high temperatures without tachycardia or skin warmth or unusual fever patterns should also bring the diagnosis of factitious fever to mind. 1, 2, 8, 10 It is important to confirm the presence of fever and any temporal pattern it may exhibit. Several infectious etiologies, including malaria and tuberculosis, follow classic fever patterns. 8, 10 Table 2 summarizes physical examination findings that may help in narrowing the potential etiology of the FUO. 8 If one or more of these signs are present, associated conditions should be ruled out before initiating a more general evaluation. Although these signs are found in as many as 97% of patients, they lead to a diagnosis in only 62% of patients with FUO. 4, 11, 12. Evaluation for Inflammatory Diseases. In a prospective study, the three most common inflammatory conditions in FUO were Still disease, large vessel vasculitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

20 An elevated white blood cell count, elevated ESR, and extremely elevated ferritin level are consistent with adult Still disease. Elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and/or antinuclear antibody indicate rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus as the etiology of the FUO. Patients with sarcoidosis may demonstrate characteristic findings on chest radiography or CT, including interstitial lung disease and hilar adenopathy.

### Evaluating fever of unknown origin in adults… [^112zzyp2]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: What is the best approach to evaluating fever of unknown origin that lasts at least three weeks in adults. Setting: Various Study Design: Systematic review Synopsis: Fever of unknown origin in adults is defined as a temperature higher than 38. 3°C lasting at least three weeks. Investigators conducted a systematic review of the English language literature through the year 2000 by searching MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, as well as the references of selected articles, after which they summarized the results and arrived at a set of recommendations. Infection was identified as a cause of fever in only 28 percent of cases. Other identified causes included inflammatory diseases, malignancies, temporal arteritis, and deep venous thrombosis in the elderly.

Nineteen percent of patients will never be given a diagnosis; fortunately, 51 to 100 percent in this group will recover spontaneously. For the initial work-up, patients should record their temperature daily. All medications should be discontinued for 72 hours, when possible, to rule out drug-induced fever. According to one study, computed tomography of the abdomen, which has a 19 percent diagnostic yield, should be one of the first tests performed. Using the Duke criteria. to diagnose endocarditis will allow physicians to rule in and rule out this disease. Nuclear imaging using technetium is specific but not particularly sensitive.

Liver biopsy has a high diagnostic yield but is associated with harm. Empiric bone cultures rarely yield anything of value and should not be used. Bottom Line: After ruling out endocarditis, using computed tomography of the abdomen, performing a nuclear scan using technetium, and perhaps doing a liver biopsy, physicians may arrive at a diagnosis for patients with fever of unknown origin. However, there will be no diagnosis for approximately one in five patients, although most fevers in this group will resolve spontaneously.
