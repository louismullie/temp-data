## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether different emotional states produce different patterns of physiological change and to define directional fractionation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core premise that emotions map onto distinct physiological profiles. Then, I should verify the specific definition of directional fractionation and contrast it with common misconceptions. Next, I will examine concrete examples and mechanisms that illustrate dissociated autonomic responses. Finally, I will synthesize the correct answer and briefly note why the alternatives are incorrect, anchoring the reasoning in contemporary affective neuroscience and psychophysiology.

> Let me first confirm the premise: different emotional states do indeed produce different patterns of physiological change, and these patterns are not uniform across systems. Contemporary affective science emphasizes that affect is a dynamic neurophysiological representation of ongoing bodily states, with valence and arousal dimensions shaping distinct peripheral signatures, and that physiological responses to emotional stimuli vary by context and individual differences, which already hints that uniform "stress" responses are too simplistic [^8064a23b] [^d6f3406c].

> Wait, let me verify the definition of directional fractionation before jumping ahead. Directional fractionation refers to a dissociation within the autonomic response, classically a decrease in heart rate while skin conductance increases, reflecting opposing parasympathetic and sympathetic effects rather than a synchronized up- or down-regulation of all measures; this is the canonical example cited in psychophysiology and is distinct from uniform arousal or random variation, so I need to ensure I anchor on that specific pattern.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether this dissociation is empirically observed. Fear-conditioning paradigms regularly demonstrate fear-induced bradycardia alongside increased electrodermal activity, and methodological guidance for fear-conditioning studies explicitly cautions about capturing both decelerative and accelerative cardiac components, which operationalizes the heart-rate decrease with concurrent sympathetic arousal indexed by skin conductance; this is a direct instantiation of directional fractionation in defensive states [^notfound].

> I will now examine the mechanistic basis to ensure plausibility. The amygdala coordinates defensive responses with both vagal and sympathetic outputs, and BNST subregions can exert opposing effects on anxiety features, illustrating separable pathways that can simultaneously dampen cardiac chronotropy while enhancing sudomotor output; this anatomical and functional segregation supports the idea that heart rate and skin conductance can move in opposite directions within the same emotional state [^fdcfe4a8].

> But wait, what if someone claims that all stress responses uniformly increase heart rate and skin conductance? That would be a misconception; while many stressors do produce tachycardia and higher electrodermal activity, defensive orienting and certain fear states can produce bradycardia with increased skin conductance, and more broadly, physiological stress responses are multidimensional and can show discordance between subjective and peripheral measures, reinforcing that patterns are state- and context-dependent rather than monolithic [^be01a6da].

> Let me consider the options carefully and eliminate distractors. Options that describe uniform increases or decreases across all physiological measures, or random variation, or a purely mental separation of emotion from physiology, do not match the definition of directional fractionation; the correct characterization is an autonomic dissociation wherein heart rate decreases while other responses, such as skin conductance, increase in the same state, which corresponds to option E.

> Final answer: Yes, different emotional states produce different patterns of physiological change, and directional fractionation is best defined as an autonomic reaction in which heart rate decreases while other changes occur in the opposite direction, such as increased skin conductance; this reflects a dissociated pattern of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity rather than uniform arousal or random variation.

Different emotional states produce **distinct physiological patterns** [^d4f1fa88], including heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle activity [^10330a8c]. Directional fractionation is the **dissociation of physiological responses**, most notably a decrease in heart rate with a simultaneous increase in skin conductance [^notfound], reflecting opposing autonomic effects. This pattern is common in fear and anxiety, where parasympathetic cardiac slowing co-occurs with sympathetic arousal [^c5b540f4]. The correct answer is **E**.

---

## Physiological patterns associated with different emotional states

Emotional states are linked to **distinct physiological patterns** [^d4f1fa88] across autonomic, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems:

| **Emotional state** | **Physiological responses** |
|-|-|
| Fear/anxiety | - Increased skin conductance (sympathetic arousal) [^c5b540f4] <br/> - Heart rate may decrease (parasympathetic activation) [^c5b540f4] <br/> - Muscle tension <br/> - Increased cortisol [^dad4ac2c] |
| Anger | - Increased heart rate and blood pressure (sympathetic activation) [^ac014233] <br/> - Increased muscle tension <br/> - Elevated testosterone (in some contexts) |
| Happiness/joy | - Increased heart rate (sympathetic activation) <br/> - Increased skin conductance (moderate arousal) <br/> - Increased zygomatic muscle activity (smiling) [^notfound] |
| Sadness | - Decreased heart rate (parasympathetic dominance) <br/> - Decreased skin conductance (low arousal) <br/> - Increased cortisol (in prolonged sadness) [^notfound] |
| Disgust | - Decreased heart rate (parasympathetic activation) <br/> - Increased skin conductance (sympathetic arousal) <br/> - Facial muscle activation (e.g. nose wrinkling) |

---

These patterns are **context-dependent** and vary with individual differences, cultural factors, and situational cues [^d6f3406c].

---

## Directional fractionation: definition and explanation

Directional fractionation is the **dissociation of physiological responses**, particularly when heart rate decreases while skin conductance increases [^c5b540f4]. This pattern reflects opposing autonomic influences: parasympathetic cardiac slowing alongside sympathetic arousal. It is commonly observed in fear and anxiety, where the brain coordinates defensive responses that include both bradycardia and increased electrodermal activity [^c5b540f4].

---

## Evidence supporting directional fractionation

Multiple studies demonstrate directional fractionation in fear and anxiety:

- **Fear conditioning**: Fear-induced bradycardia (heart rate decrease) co-occurs with increased skin conductance, reflecting parasympathetic cardiac effects and sympathetic sudomotor activation [^c5b540f4].
- **Anxiety disorders**: Patients with anxiety show increased skin conductance with variable heart rate responses, including decreases in some contexts [^e2532be0].
- **Neural mechanisms**: The amygdala and BNST coordinate opposing autonomic outputs, enabling directional fractionation [^fdcfe4a8].

---

## Clinical and research implications

Understanding directional fractionation has **important implications**:

- **Diagnostic tool**: Dissociated physiological responses can help differentiate fear/anxiety from other emotional states.
- **Therapeutic targeting**: Treatments can address specific autonomic pathways (e.g. vagal stimulation, beta-blockers) to modulate these responses [^notfound].
- **Research design**: Studies should measure multiple physiological indices to capture dissociated patterns [^c5b540f4].

---

## Conclusion

Different emotional states produce **distinct physiological patterns**, and directional fractionation is a key example of dissociated autonomic responses — notably, heart rate decrease with simultaneous skin conductance increase. This pattern is common in fear and anxiety and reflects the brain's coordination of opposing autonomic outputs [^c5b540f4].

### Affective integration in experience, judgment, and decision-making [^d6f3406c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The temporal nature of affect and behavior

The brain produces physiological adaptations to meet anticipated demands due to biological and environmental circumstancesand continually represents the sensory consequences of these physiological changes. Affective states are linked to these ongoing sensory changes within the body's physiological systems (e.g. autonomic nervous system, immune system, neuroendocrine system). Therefore, affective states result from the natural bodily fluctuations and changes that are prompted by sensory information from the surrounding world and can be defined as a neurophysiological representation of an individual's ongoing relationship with their environment. Hence, affect is a dynamic process acting as a hedonic summary of recent events and varying expectations, and the weighted integration of events into this dynamic summary is shaped by the current context. In fact, accumulating empirical evidence as well as constructionist theories of emotions suggest that contextual factors including subjective evaluation of them are central in forming affective experience and behavior.

Affect terminology

In affective science, there are longstanding debates about the definition, causation, nature, and consequences of affective states. Here, we will briefly clarify how we use different terms to avoid confusion and demarcate the focus and scope of the current article, which is not on specific emotions but rather on low-dimensional, continuous, and valenced affective states.

The main task of the brain is to manage resources in physiological systems to ensure survival by producing physiological adaptations to meet anticipated demands. It also continually represents the bodily consequences of these physiological adaptations. Affect is linked to these ongoing sensory changes that result from physiological systems such as the autonomic nervous system, the immune system, and the neuroendocrine system. Thus, affect is a fundamental aspect of human experience that could be defined as the constant stream of fluctuations in one's neurophysiological state. This suggests that every waking moment is infused with an affective tone. Studies have reliably shown that this continuous affective state is subjectively experienced as a feeling ranging from pleasure to displeasure (i.e. valence), accompanied by a certain degree of activation.

Emotions are also valenced affective states. We consider emotion as an intense, short-term and an object-focused state. The notion of valence is also at the heart of this definition, but emotions are multidimensional and complex affective states. Psychological constructionist theories of emotions posit that the interplay between ongoing activity in the physiological systems, contextual information, cognitive appraisals, and conceptual knowledge can lead to a range of emotional experiences that are tailored to a given situation. The exact constellation and timing of various components and mechanisms through which emotions are constructed vary in different theories, but arbitrating between these different theories of emotional experience is not the goal of the current article. While we acknowledge that more complex, higher-order emotions are important for judgment and decision-making, we limit our primary focus on how low-dimensional and continuous affective state (i.e. a valenced state representing the continuous neurophysiological activity) fluctuates in the face of ongoing information flow from our surroundings and how these fluctuations continuously influence judgment and decision-making.

Free energy and emotion

Recent theoretical arguments have converged on the idea that emotional states reflect changes in the uncertainty about the somatic consequences of action (Joffily & Coricelli; Wager et al; Seth & Friston). This uncertainty refers to the precision with which motor and physiological states can be predicted. In this setting, negative emotions contextualise events that induce expectations of unpredictability, while positive emotions refer to events that resolve uncertainty and confer a feeling of control (Barrett & Satpute; Gu et al.). This ties emotional states to the resolution of uncertainty and, through the biophysical encoding of precision, to neuromodulation and cortical gain control (Brown & Friston).

In summary, one can associate the valence of emotional stimuli with the precision of prior beliefs about the consequences of action. In this view, positively valenced brain states are necessarily associated with increases in the precision of predictions about the (controllable) future – or, more simply, predictable consequences of motor or autonomic behaviour. Conversely, negative emotions correspond to a loss of prior precision and a sense of helplessness and uncertainty about the consequences of action.

### Diverging neural pathways assemble a behavioural state from separable features in anxiety [^fdcfe4a8]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus, parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the anxious state.

### Multivoxel pattern analysis reveals dissociations between subjective fear and its physiological correlates [^69a21e81]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, defensive responses are multifaceted and can vary as a function of multiple factors such as the threat imminence. For instance, it was shown that a "reactive network" — primarily including the amygdala, periaqueductal gray, and midcingulate cortex — might be involved in the initial reactivity to threat and rapid escape decisions, whereas a more "cognitive network" — which primarily includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate cortex — might mainly be involved in generating more complex behavioral responses. Our approach involved relatively simple defensive reactions to visual stimuli and required little interaction with the threat outside of a simple motor response. As such, the cognitive network involved in more complex defensive responses may not have been accurately captured by our analyses.

Another concern is that emotional states have been proposed to involve (and sometimes interfere with) cognitive functions. As such, we can expect part of our results to represent this interaction rather than a strict representation of fear per se. For instance, the middle frontal gyrus has also been involved in the cognitive regulation of emotion and in the regulation of the physiological reactivity network. Furthermore, activity in this region has also been associated with working memory and the retrieval of semantic information. The same logic applies to attentional processes with reported influences in the occipital, frontal, parietal, and ventral temporal regions. As our experiment involved cognitive functions such as working memory and attention, our results may be partly associated with the interference of fear with these cognitive functions. This observation does not undermine our claim, as complex interactions between cognitive and affective processes might also represent an important mechanism of change in psychotherapy that requires further empirical investigation.

Given that multivoxel decoding involves many parameter choices, one may wonder if our results robustly generalize or if they are due to idiosyncratic details. Overall, our impression is the main results do hold up under different analyses (see Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2, as well as Supplementary Results). One specific concern is with respect to the choice of a between- or within-subject decoding strategy. Here, both approaches presented some similarities, at least regarding subjective ratings of fear (see Supplementary Methods, Results, and Supplementary Fig. S4). However, the generally weaker performance of within-subject decoders rendered a direct comparison impractical, especially for skin conductance reactivity, which contains too few trials within each participant. Therefore, throughout we primarily focused on the between-subject decoding approach.

### Dynamic emotional States shape the episodic structure of memory [^47045a43]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Unlike the robust effects of valence on temporal memory, neither absolute change nor signed change in arousal ratings were statistically significantly related to temporal distance ratings (absolute change: β = 0.006, standard error (SE) = 0.008, χ²(1) = 0.437, p = 0.508, 95% CI = [−0.01, 0.02]; signed change: β = 0.002, standard error (SE) = 0.009, χ²(1) = 0.029, p = 0.862, 95% CI = [−0.02, 0.02]) or temporal order memory (absolute change: β = −0.01, standard error (SE) = 0.06, χ²(1) = 0.029, p = 0.869, 95% CI = [−0.06, 0.05]; signed change: β = 0.036, standard error (SE) = 0.032, χ²(1) = 1.28, p = 0.258, 95% CI = [−0.03, 0.1]).

Altogether, these results demonstrate that experiencing a significant shift in emotional valence, irrespective of its directionality, elicits event segmentation effects in memory. However, the direction of this valence shift had divergent effects on the temporal structure of memory. When this emotional shift occurred in a positive direction, participants were more likely to bind and compress sequential representations in memory. By contrast, when this shift occurred in a negative direction, participants were more likely to segment temporally adjacent experiences in memory.

### Fractionating blunted reward processing characteristic of anhedonia by over-activating primate subgenual anterior cingulate cortex [^71394948]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Translational Considerations

This study was designed to address several challenges faced in the translation of preclinical studies to humans: specifically, whether cross-species anatomical homology implies analogous function, issues of symptom heterogeneity, and the methodologies used to quantify emotion.

First, concerning cross-species comparisons, the putative anatomical homolog of primate sgACC/25 is rodent IL, activations of which have variable effects on appetitive behavior. However, whether primate/rodent anatomical homology necessarily implies analogous function is far from clear — indeed, we have shown opposite effects on the regulation of negative emotion following inactivations of marmoset sgACC/25 to those seen in rodent IL studies. Second, concerning symptom heterogeneity, the impairments in anticipatory and motivational — but not consummatory — domains provide neurobiological evidence for the fractionation of anhedonia into separable subtypes. It is imperative that these subtypes are recognized clinically: people with depression may present with selective impairments in specific aspects of reward processing, with distinct underlying neural mechanisms and hence differing optimal treatment strategies. Finally, anhedonia is a complex emotional construct consisting of behavioral and physiological changes that cannot be adequately measured using single experimental outputs. While informative, studies examining subjective, autonomic, or behavioral components of emotion in isolation fail to account for the complex nature of emotion. Future work must delineate the precise psychological and physiological functions that sgACC/25 subserves in the regulation of positive and negative emotion and isolate the pathophysiological processes that can lead to chronic elevations in sgACC/25 activity associated with mood disorders.

### Frequency dependent emotion differentiation and directional coupling in amygdala, orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex network with intracranial recordings [^01a063de]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

In sum, this work highlights detailed spectral responses of the amygdala, OFC and mPFC differentiating valence conditions. We demonstrate for the first time using direct intracranial recordings evidence for a top-down influence of mPFC over the amygdala and bidirectional connectivity between the OFC and the amygdala coupling during emotional processing. This converges with research showing that spatially diverse and complex neural dynamics support emotional and cognitive functions in this circuitry. A core neural dynamic involving the amygdala, the OFC and mPFC thus underlies the emotional evaluation. Future work could build on this and explore dynamic modulations and the effects of stimulation between these nodes and circuit with implications for neuromodulation targets for affective pathologies.

### Arousal as a universal embedding for spatiotemporal brain dynamics [^46696c95]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The concept of 'brain state' has gained prominence in systems neuroscience as experimental advances have made studies in awake, behaving organisms increasingly routine. Although brain state is typically viewed as comprising several biological or behavioural factors — one of which is often presumed to be 'arousal', — principled criteria for defining and disentangling such components are lacking. Alternatively, construing organisms as dynamical systems, our approach seeks to factorize brain (or rather, organismal) state in terms of constituent endogenous processes, one of which, examined herein, we identified with the arousal construct. Despite grounding arousal in a specific process, our results reveal this process to be multidimensionally structured and nonlinearly coupled to various observables, ultimately implying even broader relevance for arousal than presently recognized.

This generalized view of arousal resonates with two emerging themes. First, brain or arousal states often correspond to qualitatively distinct (neuro-)physiological regimes, limiting the utility of simply orthogonalizing observations with respect to an arousal index (for example, via linear regression or removal of the leading principal component). Second, numerous studies have reported non-random transitions among brain states, as well as functional correlates of dynamical indices of arousal, such as the phase or derivative of pupil size, often with surprising timescale invariance. These observations imply an underlying nonlinear dynamic system. Together, these two themes portray arousal as a dynamic, pervasive and persistent 'background'; this complicates the ability to interpret spontaneous or task-related, variation observed even over seconds without reference to this evolving internal context.

Indeed, by more rigorously capturing the scope of arousal dynamics, our models reveal surprisingly rich spatiotemporal structure across the cortex, challenging conventional views of the underlying mechanisms. Thus, for decades, large-scale brain dynamics have been overwhelmingly interpreted as summations of diverse interactions among discrete regions, fuelling a proliferation of decomposition techniques. Although distinctions among modalities and species should not be overlooked, evidence across these domains has increasingly converged towards a small set of core spatiotemporal components, alongside growing appreciation for arousal-related contributions. We extend these themes by advocating a more radically unified view: that these core components are themselves projections of a non-decomposable dynamical system — the same system that effectively underpins arousal. In this sense, arousal dynamics do not merely modulate interregional interactions, but actively generate spatiotemporal structure through the synchronizedpropagation of topographically organized rotating waves.

### Ketamine's acute effects on negative brain States are mediated through distinct altered States of consciousness in humans [^fca11f1a]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The insights derived from this study must be considered within the context of the study's limitations. First, because our focus was on multi-measurement, multi-domain assessment of ketamine's acute effects, the sample size was limited and not intended to provide a basis for making broader group average inferences. It will be essential to conduct studies designed to replicate and expand these findings. Second, our multi-domain methodology necessarily relies on the administration of a series of assessments at multiple time points within each IV session. While we made every effort to administer assessments within the exact same timing for each participant, this was not always possible due to the need to first address side effects such as nausea. The third limitation relates to the temporal sequence of our mediation models, which was selected based on the order of our measures. Clearly, a change in brain state must have occurred in order for dissociation and other ASCs to occur. It is not clear from our current design whether this brain state is the same as the one we measured during our functional neuroimaging session. Thus, we cannot conclude that depersonalization and dissociative amnesia caused the differential changes in task-evoked anterior insula that we observed. This question may be examined in designs that use more frequent repeated sampling with higher temporal-resolution neuroimaging tools. Fourth, because ketamine has an impact across multiple biological systems, we recognize that there might be additional mediators on the activation of the insula in response to threat, including physiological measures such as heart rate and blood pressures. Although we have shown that physiological measures of heart rate and blood pressures are not significant mediators of the changes in insula activity in our sample, future studies are needed to test additional potential measures, including ketamine metabolites and resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) gamma power. A fifth limitation relates to the extent to which findings from healthy volunteers generalize to an understanding about antidepressant response to ketamine. Previous functional neuroimaging studies observe inconsistent neural effects of ketamine across groups of healthy individuals and patients with MDD. Both groups have been found to show a similar emotional valence-related of effect of ketamine versus placebo on ACC subregion activity elicited by anger versus happy in a facial emotion task, along with opposing effects on another ACC subregion and frontal cortex for post-ketamine versus post-placebo. Healthy individuals and patients with MDD have been found to show opposing effects on activity in the temporal gyri and precuneus/posterior cingulate during an implicit emotion task following ketamine versus placebo. In the resting state, both groups have been observed similar effects of ketamine on gamma power in the ACC and insulawhile patients with MDD specifically have been found to show a normalization of insula to default mode connectivity. These previous studies have examined neural changes two days after ketamine infusion and were not designed to assess the acute neural effects immediately following ketamine infusion as in the present study. However, the variability of findings across healthy and MDD groups highlights the need for future investigations that expand upon the present findings to include clinical participants, enabling a direct comparison of the acute neural effects of ketamine in healthy controls with the acute antidepressant response. Such future investigations would also be important for understanding the relationship of dissociation, assessed by the CADSS and other measures, to the clinical antidepressant response, given that dissociative experiences can also be more intense or extended in MDD.

### Complexity in psychological self-ratings: implications for research and practice [^48917693]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex systems approaches to mental health study psychopathology as a self-organized state emerging out of interdependent cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological processes. This line of research has unarguably produced innovative and valuable insights into psychopathology, yet its most basic testable prediction has almost never been investigated: Do the observables of this complex system, i.e. psychological self-ratings, actually display complex dynamics? This is an important question to resolve, as it directly affects the veracity of the claim that psychopathology should be regarded as a complex system state. In the present study, we address this question by identifying characteristic markers of complexity in the dynamics of psychological observables as measured by repeated self-ratings of social, emotional, physiological, psychological, and behavioral states.

Recently, the mental health field is changing focus from group-based "disease models" to more personalized models of psychopathology. Group-based disease models view mental disorders as conditions in which a specific (biological or psychological) root cause leads to a set of observable symptoms. In this view, knowledge about a population (e.g. people diagnosed with depression) can (at least to some extent) be generalized to an individual from that population. This assumption, however, does not hold when a population is heterogeneous (e.g.) or when processes are non-stationary (for example, when an individual's mood is not stable over time) as is often the case in human sciences. Because of the heterogeneity between patients and the intrinsic non-stationarity of clinical change processes, evidence-based practice guidelines based on group-level comparisons are only of limited use for the care of individual patients. This is why scholars have called for a personalized approach to psychopathology, in which treatment is tailored to the specifics of the individual patient.

### Functional-anatomic fractionation of the brain's default network [^8f7f685a]. Neuron (2010). Low credibility.

One of the most consistent observations in human functional imaging is that a network of brain regions referred to as the "default network" increases its activity during passive states. Here we explored the anatomy and function of the default network across three studies to resolve divergent hypotheses about its contributions to spontaneous cognition and active forms of decision making. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed the network comprises multiple, dissociated components. A midline core (posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortex) is active when people make self-relevant, affective decisions. In contrast, a medial temporal lobe subsystem becomes engaged when decisions involve constructing a mental scene based on memory. During certain experimentally directed and spontaneous acts of future-oriented thought, these dissociated components are simultaneously engaged, presumably to facilitate construction of mental models of personally significant events.

### Multivoxel neurofeedback selectively modulates confidence without changing perceptual performance [^d45fd30b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Here we hypothesize that confidence is generated downstream from the processing of internal signals and perceptual decisions, and that the two processes rely on different neuronal mechanisms. As such, a systematic manipulation of confidence in precise directions (up or down) should happen independently from perceptual performance. Ideally, the change in confidence should be achieved through direct manipulation of specific brain activity patterns within prescribed regions that are independently known to reflect confidence in the same participants (see Fig. 1).

Multivoxel pattern neurofeedback, or decoded neurofeedback (DecNef), enables us to probe precisely this possibility by having participants induce brain activation patterns corresponding to a given mental state or cognitive function in specific regions. DecNef therefore overcomes previously unresolved experimental difficulties; unlike ordinary real-time fMRI neurofeedback, which lets participants consciously self-manipulate the univariate activity level, in DecNef, multivoxel patterns of activation representing specific brain states are fed back to participants. It has been demonstrated that such reinforcement learning or neural operant conditioning of multivoxel patterns can unconsciously induce perceptual learning without stimulus presentation, or be used to change emotional states.

Before using DecNef, we first applied ordinary multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data to examine the relationship between confidence and internal perceptual signal, as well as the nature of brain activation patterns related to confidence. We found correlates of confidence that seem to be independent from perceptual responses. With neurofeedback, we were then able to manipulate confidence in the expected directions (up and down), without changing perceptual performance and without the participants' awareness of the content or purpose of the manipulation. Three converging lines of evidence confirm the bi-directionality of the effects: summary statistics (individual real and expected confidence changes), standardization of DecNef effects in the second week (correction by the ratio of week-2/week-1 effects), and mathematical modelling. Moreover, our results show that this change in confidence is unlikely to be the product of a nonspecific change in response strategy, such as a mere shift in response criterion. Thus, our results provide strong evidence for the distinct computations underlying confidence and perceptual decision making, and thereby cast doubt on currently dominant views concerning confidence and metacognition.

### Multivoxel pattern analysis reveals dissociations between subjective fear and its physiological correlates [^a0e91568]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Further evidence for a hierarchical model comes from results, indicating that low-level affective processes do not seem necessary to generate a conscious experience of fear. For instance, patients presenting bilateral lesions of the amygdala have been reported to be capable of experiencing fear in some specific situations. Although there is still some debate regarding the possible mechanisms leading to these subjective experiences, the overall evidence at least does not seem incompatible with higher-order models.

A higher-order perspective is in line with previous results and ours, but models of emotions are still being debated. For instance, one may argue against this hierarchical or higher-order view based on experimental demonstrations that the electrical stimulation of the amygdala itself can trigger a subjective experience of fear and anxiety. Although this demonstration was compelling, it is important to mention that in that study this phenomenon occurred only in one out of nine patients. This inconsistency may be partly attributed to inter-individual differences in the spread of electrical activity to other brain regions. However, it is worth noting that the stimulation had a clear dose-dependent effect on the objective physiological response, which was observed across the entire group of patients. Taken together, these results suggest that the amygdala might play a central role in generating physiological responses but possibly a marginal role in generating the conscious experience of fear.

### Familial risk and a genome-wide supported DRD2 variant for schizophrenia predict lateral prefrontal-amygdala effective connectivity during emotion processing [^8171bf80]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

The brain functional mechanisms translating genetic risk into emotional symptoms in schizophrenia (SCZ) may include abnormal functional integration between areas key for emotion processing, such as the amygdala and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Indeed, investigation of these mechanisms is also complicated by emotion processing comprising different subcomponents and by disease-associated state variables. Here, our aim was to investigate the relationship between risk for SCZ and effective connectivity between the amygdala and the LPFC during different subcomponents of emotion processing. Thus, we first characterized with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) physiological patterns of LPFC-amygdala effective connectivity in healthy controls (HC) during implicit and explicit emotion processing. Then, we compared DCM patterns in a subsample of HC, in patients with SCZ and in healthy siblings of patients (SIB), matched for demographics. Finally, we investigated in HC association of LPFC-amygdala effective connectivity with a genome-wide supported variant increasing genetic risk for SCZ and possibly relevant to emotion processing (DRD2 rs2514218). In HC, we found that a "bottom-up" amygdala-to-LPFC pattern during implicit processing and a "top-down" LPFC-to-amygdala pattern during explicit processing were the most likely directional models of effective connectivity. Differently, implicit emotion processing in SIB, SCZ, and HC homozygous for the SCZ risk rs2514218 C allele was associated with decreased probability for the "bottom-up" as well as with increased probability for the "top-down" model. These findings suggest that task-specific anomaly in the directional flow of information or disconnection between the amygdala and the LPFC is a good candidate endophenotype of SCZ.

### Affective neuroscience and the study of normal and abnormal emotion regulation [^8dc08b38]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Affective neuroscience allows investigators to study the biologic basis of psychologic phenomena such as emotion and mood. Understanding the components of emotion, valence, and arousal and their physiologic correlates is the starting point for studies that quantify emotional and physiologic reactions. This information could provide insight into the biologic foundations of numerous psychiatric conditions. Understanding the normal development of emotions and regulation of emotion will provide new avenues of research into the complex problem of severe mood disorders.

### Brain activity underlying emotional valence and arousal: a response-related fMRI study [^d4f1fa88]. Human Brain Mapping (2004). Low credibility.

Emotional behavior is organized along two psychophysiologic dimensions: (1) valence, varying from negative to positive, and (2) arousal, varying from low to high. Behavioral responses along these dimensions are assumed to be mediated by different brain circuits. We recorded startle reflex modulation and skin conductance responses in healthy volunteers during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed a set of emotional pictures and took verbal ratings of the emotional valence and arousal of each picture after scanning. Response-related multiple correlation analysis revealed differential brain activity in five brain regions. Startle reflex changes, associated with the valence of a stimulus, correlated with activity in the amygdala, while verbal reports of negative emotional valence varied with insular activity. Peripheral physiologic and verbal responses along the arousal dimension varied with thalamic and frontomedial activity. Peripheral physiologic responses along both dimensions correlated with activity in somatosensory association areas in the anterior parietal cortex. In the valence dimension, activity in the left anterior parietal cortex was associated with highly correlating peripheral physiologic and verbal responses, suggesting that verbal reports of emotional valence might depend partly on brain circuits representing peripheral physiologic changes. Our data provide direct evidence for a functional segregation of brain structures underlying peripheral physiologic responses and verbal ratings along the emotional dimensions of valence and arousal.

### Multivoxel pattern analysis reveals dissociations between subjective fear and its physiological correlates [^b85d9702]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

One reason for the skepticism about higher-order models might be that anxiety disorders have been reliably associated with a dysregulation of physiological reactivity. As such, higher-order structures are typically conceptualized as playing more of a complementary role in these pathologies. However, it is worth noting that the therapeutic success of psychotherapies for anxiety and depression appears to be mediated by brain regions such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and some regions of the temporal lobes. Also, recent findings indicated that the inhibition of the amygdala by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was positively associated with the outcome of exposure therapy. As such, some higher-order processes may also have an important influence on therapeutic success.

One challenge in the implementation of a higher-order approach to anxiety disorders is the reliance on self-reported measures. This can potentially be a problem, because the means of fear assessment can greatly influence the outcome. We opted for offline categorical ratings, as this is the typical approach for clinical diagnosis, but one may worry that this may not directly reflect the online subjective experience of fear. Our results suggest that both assessment methods may at least partly reflect similar processes, as our decoders trained to predict offline ratings could predict weakly but significantly online ratings in an independent validation fMRI task (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S2). However, further work may be needed to determine precisely which aspects of fear are more salient with different means of assessment and how to cover accurately the multiple dimensions relevant to the self-report of fear.

### How mood-related physiological States bias economic decisions [^10330a8c]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

A more definitive argument comes from physiological responses: while the facial muscles may be contracted on demand, one cannot directly control pupil size or skin conductance. So, the fact that the choice bias could be predicted from physiological responses speaks against a demand effect and for a true emotional involvement. Also, they eliminate the issue of a possible reverse causality: because ratings were made after choices, one could imagine that ratings were impacted by choices, and not the opposite. This reverse interpretation is not possible for the effects of inductions, and the related physiological responses, because the induced mood states were reconstructed from physiological measures recorded before choices were displayed to participants. Interestingly, facial muscles mostly predicted the sign (i.e. valence) and not the intensity of perceived emotion. To estimate the intensity, we needed autonomic arousal measures (pupil size and skin conductance), which by definition are beyond voluntary control. As suggested before, physiological measures may be used as low-level readouts of emotional states in affect-induction paradigms where explicit ratings are omitted, which would avoid potential interference with emotion perception due to the overshadowing effect –. The next step would be to directly record signals from emotionally-relevant brain areas such as the amygdala, insula, and hippocampus. Although impressive progress has been made in the decoding of naturalistic mood fluctuations from neural recordings, the utility of such measures for decoding induced emotions remains to be proven. Ultimately, neural investigations are needed to provide a mechanistic account of how affective states of the brain can bias unrelated choice behaviours.

### Integrated cardio-behavioral responses to threat define defensive States [^9726e72d]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Our results reveal that for several integrated defensive states, the average distance to an approximated maximal HR (HR-to-ceiling) is the most relevant characteristic. This suggests that physiologically, there is not a 'fixed' signal systematically leading to HR change of similar amplitude, but that HR is adjusted to a particular set point for individual microstates that are associated with specific defensive behaviors. Notably, these microstate-related set points are affected by the (sub)context-dependent changes in the rigidity macrostate. Both aspects are captured by our framework, which discretizes HR data to unravel semistable states, and which includes temporal dynamics, which can characterize states of their own. This is most evident in the described ceiling and rigidity macrostates, relating to the upper boundary and range of cardiac output, respectively. Notably, ceiling is predominantly determined by cardiac function and thus may reflect sluggish peripheral endocrine processes, whereas the richer dynamics of rigidity report the interaction between cardiac and behavioral defensive states. The term rigidity originates from our initial hypothesis that although HR can reflect moment-to-moment changes in defensive states, the amplitude does not necessarily reflect only for example a discrete 'fear level' at a given time but is also constrained by higher-order processes. This was further confirmed and supported by our data: rigidity is a neuro-autonomic phenomenon that opposes HR changes. An analogy would be a stretched rubber band that resists deflection pressure (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Mechanistically, it most likely reflects changes at the level of autonomic balance, which constrains the changes in HR that can be achieved — very much like the shifts described for the baroreflex curve. In addition, our finding that LF oscillations of HR, which have been associated with emotions in humans, are sensitive to rigidity strongly suggests that these two processes share an underlying mechanism, such as baroreceptor reflex function. Chx10 + neurons of the vlPAG serve as microstate generators, but they do not affect rigidity and are unlikely to regulate baroreflex function directly. Consequently, although they always send the same signal (same deflection force onto the rubber band) to their downstream regions, their action would be strongly modulated by rigidity (different preload on the rubber band), and thus not always yield the same integrated microstate. Thus, it will be important in future studies to determine how brainstem and higher-order circuits control temporal dynamics of central and peripheral macrostates. Nervous systems have been modeled as near-chaotic systems stabilized by attractors. Our data suggest similar state dynamics, that is main and partial attractors as macrostates and microstates, respectively, for behavioral and cardiac readouts. It is conceivable that this is closely related to fractal characteristics of HR, which exhibit rigidity after pharmacological stimulation. Overall, it reaffirms our framework's adequacy in providing a window into higher-order brain functions such as defense against threat. Notably, defensive state dynamics involve bi-directional brain–body communication, that is, somato- and visceromotor control and interoception.

### Complexity in psychological self-ratings: implications for research and practice [^0ee1a24d]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Second, complex systems exhibit phase transitions, which lead to regime shifts and thus non-stationarity in time series data. While regime shifts are generally undesirable in statistical approaches to psychological dynamics, they are an important research avenue in a complex systems approach. In the dynamic research strategy outlined by Thelen and Ulrich, phase transitions form the starting point for the study of developmental and also clinical change.
First, phase transitions differentiate between different attractor states that demand their own descriptions. For example, a depressed attractor state may yield a specific pattern of cognition, emotion, behavior, and physiology that is reflected in specific values of such variables (e.g. high negative emotions, high rumination) as well as the interrelations between them (e.g. a feedback loop between negative thoughts and negative feelings). A healthy attractor of the same person may in contrast be characterized by completely different values and interrelations of these variables. Aggregation of a time series over different regimes should thus be avoided as this will give a misleading impression of the patient's actual psychological states (e.g. emotions may appear neutral on average, while the patient actually experienced one period of negative emotions and one period of positive emotions). Future research should therefore explicitly examine possible different attractor states in time series (for example with change point analysis).
A second research avenue is the study of early-warning signals (EWS) as precursors of upcoming phase transitions. In a study on self-ratings collected during psychotherapy, EWS were indeed shown to be predictive for upcoming regime shifts in symptom severity levels. Such real-time prediction of transitions may be highly relevant for prevention and intervention in clinical practice. During periods of EWS, complex systems are more sensitive to external influences. Interventions, aimed at either eliciting positive change (e.g. sudden gains ;) or preventing negative change (e.g. suicide attempts ;), may thus be increasingly effective during periods of destabilization (see also). Future research should test this hypothesis.
A third reason to study phase transitions is that these are the moments at which change mechanisms in complex systems may be revealed. Consider a simple example: the emergence of convection rolls when boiling water. At a critical temperature, where the body of water cannot dissipate its heat any more in a regular fashion, convection rolls emerge spontaneously. At the transition point, a change mechanism (a control parameter in complex systems terms) can be identified: the kinetic energy (i.e. heat) that is delivered to the pan. This sounds obvious but note that the heat may not have been identified as the control parameter if the water was only observed within a small temperature range that did not include the critical threshold, or the tipping point. Control parameters thus only become apparent as change mechanisms at the tipping points of transition. From this perspective, EMA research is thus especially interesting during a change process (e.g. therapy) and not during a baseline period in which the change mechanisms are likely to remain hidden. In psychopathology, control parameters will of course be harder to identify than in the example of convection rolls described above. Control parameters for clinical change are likely to be individual and contextualized. This makes control parameters an interesting avenue for applied idiographic research (for steps in this direction, see).

### Neurotransmitter modulation of human facial emotion recognition [^0e9055fe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and future directions

In this narrative Review, we provide a qualitative synthesis of how different neurotransmitter pathways influence human FER. Global evidence seems to indicate that the recognition of fight-or-flight-related emotional cues is the most malleable and most tightly regulated by overlapping neurotransmitter pathways. Overall, a change in the recognition of fear is the most reported finding in social cognition (Figure 2). This may be due to the evolutionary utility of recognising threat cues and the salience attributed to fearful expressions. One observation that we can qualitatively communicate is that FER studies involving functional neuroimaging overall reported lower recognition accuracy across different emotions relative to purely behavioural administration of FER tasks. This may be due to some fundamental differences in study populations that sign up to MRI versus behavioural pharmacology studies, as discussed elsewhere, or because the MRI environment is quite different from the context in which people typically perform these judgements.

Future studies might consider analysing differences in detection thresholds; for example, using drift-diffusion models that are particularly suitable for evidence accumulation (i.e. the response time that is required to judge a morphed face as fearful) could be useful in this domain. Considering the speed by which FER judgements are made, pupillometry (i.e. the iterative measurement of changes in pupil dilation), a technique with very high temporal resolution, can be an important research modality for understanding the underlying physiological correlates of FER, and prediction errors arising from misjudgements. Pupil dilation is also under the influence of a number of neurotransmitter systems, therefore experimental pharmacology studies using this modality can reveal important insights.

Overall, perhaps as expected, central neurotransmitter hubs and brainstem nuclei projecting both to limbic and cortical regions influence FER to a greater extent than other factors such as peripheral inflammatory processes. We think that future studies should adopt a combination of experimental pharmacology and behavioural modelling methods which should reveal more detailed insights into how FER responses are evoked temporally and the specific role of different neurotransmitter systems modulating this process. Designing multidimensional experiments in this area would also have clinical utility, promoting a better understanding of the cognitive effects of compounds that can treat psychiatric and neurological conditions. This is a necessary step towards personalising psychotropic treatments to individual disease correlates, hence achieving better clinical outcomes particularly in the psychosocial symptom domain.

### Dynamic emotional States shape the episodic structure of memory [^c0c601cd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Human emotions fluctuate over time. However, it is unclear how these shifting emotional states influence the organization of episodic memory. Here, we examine how emotion dynamics transform experiences into memorable events. Using custom musical pieces and a dynamic emotion-tracking tool to elicit and measure temporal fluctuations in felt valence and arousal, our results demonstrate that memory is organized around emotional states. While listening to music, fluctuations between different emotional valences bias temporal encoding process toward memory integration or separation. Whereas a large absolute or negative shift in valence helps segment memories into episodes, a positive emotional shift binds sequential representations together. Both discrete and dynamic shifts in music-evoked valence and arousal also enhance delayed item and temporal source memory for concurrent neutral items, signaling the beginning of new emotional events. These findings are in line with the idea that the rise and fall of emotions can sculpt unfolding experiences into memories of meaningful events.

### Computations of uncertainty mediate acute stress responses in humans [^be01a6da]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A recent study examining individual differences in aversive learning found a post-outcome pupillary sensitivity to volatility. The authors found that learning-rate malleability in the face of changing volatility was related to trait anxiety. We additionally establish a link between chronic stress states and beliefs of environmental volatility (Fig. 2c). However, the stimulus–outcome contingencies used in the previous study kept irreducible uncertainty roughly constant, precluding the comprehensive characterization of multiple forms of uncertainty and the relation to the dynamics of emotional and physiological stress responses that we perform here. Our finding that pre-outcome pupil diameter correlates with irreducible uncertainty, and that this modulation is proportional to the effect of uncertainty on subjective stress, is uniquely enabled by our design, and not inconsistent with the volatility sensitivity observed previously.

Fluctuations in skin conductance depend on activity in the sympathetic nervous system, a key component of physiological stress responses. Our finding that skin conductance tracks uncertainty chimes with findings using the Iowa Gambling Task, in which participants make choices between decks of cards that produce rewards and punishments of varying magnitudes. Greater skin conductance responses are elicited whenever participants choose a card from the pack with higher risk, as defined by the variance of the outcome distribution. However, binary choices in static environments do not reveal whether skin conductance truly reflects uncertainty or instead some aspect of the decision process. Our results suggest that even in non-instrumental settings, somatic state relates closely to uncertainty in the environment. Furthermore, we show that these responses are dynamically driven by evolving internal estimates of irreducible uncertainty.

Our multiple stress measures reflect the view that stress is a multidimensional construct, expressed through subjective and physiological channels. Some theoretical accounts highlight the importance of 'coherence' between stress systems in response to a challenge, although discordance between the amplitude of physiological and subjective stress responses is rife (reviewed by Campbell and Ehlert). This is in part because the stressors typically used in laboratory experiments with humans, such as social stress, are difficult to parameterise, precluding a detailed quantitative analysis. Conversely, using a quantitative computational approach, we show that emotional and physiological stress responses track uncertainty and are correlated within individuals. We do not claim that ours are exhaustive metrics of stress, nor that chronic stress necessarily behaves similarly to the acute stress examined here. Establishing how acute stress accumulates to produce allostasis, and what effects such allostasis exerts on subsequent acute stress responses, is a major challenge for the field.

### Interoceptive basis to craving [^c800ae7c]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Main Text

Addictions hijack brain systems controlling emotional and motivational behavior that are fundamental to adaptive survival. Feeling states, such as craving, are the experiential component of motivational behavior, representing consciously accessible expressions of motivational need. Primary feeling states represent an elegant means of maintaining physiological homeostasis; feelings such as hunger, cold, or thirst motivate nutrient absorption (facilitating thermoregulation and rehydration) and may be considered homeostatic emotions. Evolutionary development of emotional systems within social environments may explain a hierarchy of feelings, where more complex emotions can anticipate potential social challenges to homeostatic and internal integrity and contribute to mnemonic reinforcement of adaptive behaviors. Motivational stimuli such as emotive cues engender involuntary bodily responses (for example, in patterns of autonomic arousal). The interoceptive feedback of these dynamic bodily reactions directly influences feeling states and affective experience. This process is central to influential peripheral theories of emotion (e.g.). Correspondingly, the brain's representation of viscerosensory "markers" can guide cognitive and motivational behavior, and the activity of many brain regions implicated in cognition and effect are sensitive to changes in peripheral arousal (reviewed in). One recent formulation proposes that the conscious experience of anxiety arises from "prediction error" where the actual arousal state (conveyed interoceptively within insula cortex) is different from the anticipated/expected arousal state of the body. Recent research byin Science provides strong evidence that interoceptive processes within insula cortex underlie craving associated with nicotine addiction.

### How mood-related physiological States bias economic decisions [^e03f74ce]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

These studies were not preregistered. However, our predictions regarding the effects of mood changes on economic choices were directly determined by simulations of our computational model presented in a previous publication, and our analytic pipeline for assessing those effects was identical to that used in another previous publication.

Participants

Participants were recruited through subject pools of the Paris Brain Institute and of the RISC ('Relais d'Information sur les Sciences de la Cognition'), a collective of labs that conduct experiments in psychology and neuroscience in the Paris region. The announcement of the study stated that we were interested in "cognition, emotion, and physiology", without mention of the scientific purpose (testing the effects of emotions on decisions). Candidates were eligible if they were native French speakers between 18 and 50 years old, with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. They were not allowed to consume alcohol or any psychotropic drugs during the day of the experiment. Further inclusion criteria applied specifically to physiological recordings. For eye-tracking, candidates had to be able to do the entire experiment without glasses or contact lenses. For electromyography, the requirements were not to have any facial tattoos or piercings, not to have make-up on, and to be clean-shaved around the mouth and cheeks.

### Cardiogenic control of affective behavioural state [^36e79d2c]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Interoceptive processing of visceral physiological signals, such as cardiac palpitations or stomach fullness, is crucial for maintaining homeostasis –. Diverse psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorders and addiction, have been hypothesized to be related to dysregulation of interoceptive monitoring by the brain, and can be statistically correlated with specific visceral organ dysfunction. For example, patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia are more likely to have mitral valve prolapse or clinical symptoms similar to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Modern correlative studies have further suggested links between cardiac changes and affect regulation, including correlations between cardiac interoception with anxiety and functional alterations in the insular cortex, a cortical region that has a central role in both the processing of physiological signals and the regulation of emotions. However, determining whether primary physiological signals such as increased heart rate can causally influence behavioural states, as proposed in classical physiological theories of emotion, has — although widely debated — remained largely experimentally intractable. Available nonspecific interventions that might disrupt cardiac signals (such as electrical vagus nerve stimulation) are well known to also induce numerous physiological changes that would be unwanted in this context, including direct suppression of respiratory and heart rates as well as anxiolytic and antidepressive effects –, giving rise to multiple direct confounds for the question explored here. Other nonspecific interventions to alter cardiac rhythms, such as broadly active pharmacological stimulants or electrical pacemakers, also introduce insuperable confounds through initial actions beyond the direct pacing of cardiomyocytes, and thus lack the necessary precision. Studying the key question of how cardiac physiology regulates emotional states has remained inaccessible, and the effects on behaviour remain unknown.

### Modular organization of the brainstem noradrenaline system coordinates opposing learning States [^8e6bb278]. Nature Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

Noradrenaline modulates global brain states and diverse behaviors through what is traditionally believed to be a homogeneous cell population in the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC). However, it is unclear how LC coordinates disparate behavioral functions. We report a modular LC organization in rats, endowed with distinct neural projection patterns and coding properties for flexible specification of opposing behavioral learning states. LC projection mapping revealed functionally distinct cell modules with specific anatomical connectivity. An amygdala-projecting ensemble promoted aversive learning, while an independent medial prefrontal cortex-projecting ensemble extinguished aversive responses to enable flexible behavior. LC neurons displayed context-dependent inter-relationships, with moderate, discrete activation of distinct cell populations by fear or safety cues and robust, global recruitment of most cells by strong aversive stimuli. These results demonstrate a modular organization in LC in which combinatorial activation modes are coordinated with projection- and behavior-specific cell populations, enabling adaptive tuning of emotional responding and behavioral flexibility.

### Neural landscape diffusion resolves conflicts between needs across time [^74f67ac0]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

The qualities of persistence and sudden transitions in internal state that we found in our assay share important features with the adaptive and maladaptive transitions of emotional and psychological states in humans. Intriguingly, major morbidity in schizophrenia arises from disorganized thought processes and behaviours, characterized by the abnormal persistence of, and transitions between, cognitive and behavioural states. These debilitating symptoms lead to disruption of daily life activities including self-care, eating and drinking, as well as unstable emotional states and thought processes; this behavioural disorganization in time is evocative of an excess in the noise term of our model (Fig. 5c, left). On the other extreme, certain maladaptive conditions could arise from minimizing this noise term (Fig. 5c, right); for example, reduced ease of brain-state shifting could contribute to stereotyped and restricted behavioural patterns for those on the autism spectrum, and to behavioural symptoms in other disorders characterized by reduced exploration of available action space (such as major depression). Future work will elucidate to what extent our results generalize to diverse homeostatic needs and affective states in mice and in humans, and whether the model we describe may ultimately help to frame our understanding and treatment of psychiatric diseases.

### Sequential oxygen mismatch from skeletal muscle to prefrontal cortex underpins the rate of exhaustion during all-out exercise [^a134cead]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence supports that exercise tolerance is modulated by both neural processes and psychological states. The perception of effort and the sense of exertional fatigue are in part regulated by decisional and motivational processes within the PFC. Frontal lobe subregion–specific areas of the PFC, such as the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC), the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), govern several other deterministic psychological states that are essential for exercise performance, including pace regulation, motivation, alertness and attentional focus, goal-oriented decision-making, motor planning, task reappraisal, and emotional regulation. For example, a person's motivational state to sustain effort during exhaustive exercise is directly related to their ability to cognitively suppress the aversive sensations associated with the strain of the exercise, with the DLPFC and OFC having been previously linked to exhaustive exercise termination and the VLPFC revealing changes in brain activity following an exercise intensity transition from moderate to high intensity. Moreover, severe-intensity exercise performed within a graded intensity ramp test suggests that both affect (i.e. emotional state) and PFC oxygenation are not only subregion- but also hemisphere-specific. Accordingly, subregion and hemisphere areas within the PFC are not only paramount in regulating our thoughts, decisions, emotions, and actions, but also appear intricately linked to the control of exercise work capacity. Therefore, it is collectively important to examine: 1) psychological and neural influences during maximal effort exercise in tandem with other physiological but nonpsychological mediating variables, and 2) the underlying subregions and hemispheres within the PFC that may link physiological responses to decisions of human behavior.

### Emotional brain States carry over and enhance future memory formation [^f2b2dc44]. Nature Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

Emotional arousal can produce lasting, vivid memories for emotional experiences, but little is known about whether emotion can prospectively enhance memory formation for temporally distant information. One mechanism that may support prospective memory enhancements is the carry-over of emotional brain states that influence subsequent neutral experiences. Here we found that neutral stimuli encountered by human subjects 9–33 min after exposure to emotionally arousing stimuli had greater levels of recollection during delayed memory testing compared to those studied before emotional and after neutral stimulus exposure. Moreover, multiple measures of emotion-related brain activity showed evidence of reinstatement during subsequent periods of neutral stimulus encoding. Both slow neural fluctuations (low-frequency connectivity) and transient, stimulus-evoked activity predictive of trial-by-trial memory formation present during emotional encoding were reinstated during subsequent neutral encoding. These results indicate that neural measures of an emotional experience can persist in time and bias how new, unrelated information is encoded and recollected.

### Evolution, emotions, and emotional disorders [^47014bdb]. The American Psychologist (2009). Low credibility.

Emotions research is now routinely grounded in evolution, but explicit evolutionary analyses of emotions remain rare. This article considers the implications of natural selection for several classic questions about emotions and emotional disorders. Emotions are special modes of operation shaped by natural selection. They adjust multiple response parameters in ways that have increased fitness in adaptively challenging situations that recurred over the course of evolution. They are valenced because selection shapes special processes for situations that have influenced fitness in the past. In situations that decrease fitness, negative emotions are useful and positive emotions are harmful. Selection has partially differentiated subtypes of emotions from generic precursor states to deal with specialized situations. This has resulted in untidy emotions that blur into each other on dozens of dimensions, rendering the quest for simple categorically distinct emotions futile. Selection has shaped flexible mechanisms that control the expression of emotions on the basis of an individual's appraisal of the meaning of events for his or her ability to reach personal goals. The prevalence of emotional disorders can be attributed to several evolutionary factors.

### Estimation of current and future physiological States in insular cortex [^fef0d2ca]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Interoception, the sense of internal bodily signals, is essential for physiological homeostasis, cognition, and emotions. While human insular cortex (InsCtx) is implicated in interoception, the cellular and circuit mechanisms remain unclear. We imaged mouse InsCtx neurons during two physiological deficiency states: hunger and thirst. InsCtx ongoing activity patterns reliably tracked the gradual return to homeostasis but not changes in behavior. Accordingly, while artificial induction of hunger or thirst in sated mice via activation of specific hypothalamic neurons (AgRP or SFO GLUT) restored cue-evoked food- or water-seeking, InsCtx ongoing activity continued to reflect physiological satiety. During natural hunger or thirst, food or water cues rapidly and transiently shifted InsCtx population activity to the future satiety-related pattern. During artificial hunger or thirst, food or water cues further shifted activity beyond the current satiety-related pattern. Together with circuit-mapping experiments, these findings suggest that InsCtx integrates visceral-sensory signals of current physiological state with hypothalamus-gated amygdala inputs that signal upcoming ingestion of food or water to compute a prediction of future physiological state.

### Dynamic systems, contextual influences, and multiple timescales: emotion regulation as a resilience resource [^8d7d83ee]. The Gerontologist (2021). Medium credibility.

We need to understand how psychosocial resources develop, identify the influences that threaten their maintenance, detect the circumstances under which these resources are used, and elucidate the factors that support and promote their growth. Three important components to studying the development of resilience include its dynamic nature, context, and timescale of measurement. Dynamic systems (DS) approaches focus on physiological and psychological structures underling the development of resilience by explicitly mapping parameters of change onto their corresponding aspects of functioning. Previous research has captured emotion regulation within individuals, across traits, and in close personal relationships to show how these methods depict dynamic regulation/resilience resources and their influence on outcomes of interest. The use of multi-time scaled data informs how daily emotion regulation is disrupted in the context of stress to produce dysregulation and disease later in the life course. This approach can also reveal how resilience resources counteract these adverse processes and allow others to thrive and be well. Researchers must not only explore short-term variation in constructs of interest, but also explore how these shorter-term fluctuations contribute to longer-term changes. The confluence of DS, contextual influences, and multiple timescales provides an important set of tools to better understand development.

### The trait and state negative affect can be separately predicted by stable and variable resting-state functional connectivity [^8c9a681f]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many emotional experiences such as anxiety and depression are influenced by negative affect (NA). NA has both trait and state features, which play different roles in physiological and mental health. Attending to NA common to various emotional experiences and their trait-state features might help deepen the understanding of the shared foundation of related emotional disorders.

Methods

The principal component of five measures was calculated to indicate individuals' NA level. Applying the connectivity-based correlation analysis, we first identified resting-state functional connectives (FCs) relating to NA in sample 1 (n = 367), which were validated through an independent sample (n = 232; sample 2). Next, based on the variability of FCs across large timescale, we further divided the NA-related FCs into high- and low-variability groups. Finally, FCs in different variability groups were separately applied to predict individuals' neuroticism level (which is assumed to be the core trait-related factor underlying NA), and the change of NA level (which represents the state-related fluctuation of NA).

Results

The low-variability FCs were primarily within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and dorsal attention network/sensory system and significantly predicted trait rather than state NA. The high-variability FCs were primarily between the DMN and ventral attention network, the fronto-parietal network and DMN/sensory system, and significantly predicted the change of NA level.

Conclusions

The trait and state NA can be separately predicted by stable and variable spontaneous FCs with different attentional processes and emotion regulatory mechanisms, which could deepen our understanding of NA.

### Can passive measurement of physiological distress help better predict suicidal thinking? [^c8ea7c8e]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Data preparation

Physiological data were collected continuously, meaning that autonomic events could have been recorded at any time of the day. Self-report data were collected six times daily over a participant-defined 14-h period (most participants chose a window that lasted from 9 am to 11 pm). This means we would likely not have self-report data at or near the time of most autonomic events. To address this, we aggregated our data into two levels, hourly (i.e. within-day) and daily (i.e. between-day). Hourly data provide increased granularity and resolution (we can describe hours instead of days with suicidal thinking); however, only 26% of the autonomic events observed occurred within 1 h of an EMA prompt. Daily data allowed us to use all available autonomic event data, although doing so meant that we lost some ability to determine the temporality of responses. To aggregate the data, we computed for each participant-hour (To maintain consistency with the day-level analyses, we created an average in cases where there was more than one response per hour.) or participant-day an average of the affective states and suicidal thinking ratings and a sum score for number of autonomic events. To adjust for between-person variability in response styles, we participant-mean centered all affective state ratings in the aggregated datasets.

### The role of emotion and emotion regulation in social anxiety disorder [^6b97b024]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Many psychiatric disorders involve problematic patterns of emotional reactivity and regulation. In this review, we consider recent findings regarding emotion and emotion regulation in the context of social anxiety disorder (SAD). We first describe key features of SAD which suggest altered emotional and self-related processing difficulties. Next, we lay the conceptual foundation for a discussion of emotion and emotion regulation and present a common framework for understanding emotion regulation, the process model of emotion regulation. Using the process model, we evaluate the recent empirical literature spanning self-report, observational, behavioral, and physiological methods across five specific families of emotion regulation processes-situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. Next, we examine the empirical evidence behind two psychosocial interventions for SAD: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Throughout, we present suggestions for future directions in the continued examination of emotion and emotion regulation in SAD.

### The self and its intersubjective synchrony in psychotherapy: a systematic review [^257ac83a]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Altogether, results may suggest that developing a sense of alliance between patient and therapist may require dynamics more closely related to the exteroproprioceptive self, which involves bodily‐based interactions (such as facial expressions, bodily posture and movements) and unfold over longer periods, helping to establish trust and rapport. In contrast, dynamics associated with the interoexteroceptive self may be more involved in immediate emotional reactions and different emotional experiences throughout the therapeutic process. These faster internal physiological responses (like changes in heart rate, breathing rate or EDA) might not directly impact the alliance but play a role in the moment‐to‐moment emotional experience of the therapeutic interaction. Importantly, these faster physiological responses are embedded and thus nested within slower behavioral and social dynamics: Although emotional reactions may fluctuate rapidly, these fast fluctuations are integrated into and contribute to the slower, broader, more gradual development of social and relational dynamics, such as the formation of the therapeutic alliance over time. This resembles the distinction between trait‐ and state‐like alliance (Zilcha‐Mano & Fisher), where trait‐like alliance reflects stable interpersonal characteristics (aligning with exteroproprioceptive dynamics), whereas state‐like alliance embodies evolving, adaptive interactions (resonating with interoexteroceptive dynamics). These varied findings highlight the complex role of the distinct timescales of interoexteroceptive and exteroproprioceptive synchrony in therapy. Achieving optimal therapeutic engagement requires a delicate balance of context‐sensitive synchrony across different timescales. The differing effects of synchrony across patient characteristics and synchrony types underscore the need for further research and more individualized approaches in various therapeutic contexts.

### Nuclei-specific hypothalamus networks predict a dimensional marker of stress in humans [^dad4ac2c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Mental disorders present a huge global burden. Currently, treatments are typically chosen based on broad symptom-based diagnoses, rather than a mechanistic understanding of an individual's behavioural and brain changes. A growing body of work has therefore focused on analysing the brain changes that accompany, predict, or result from mental illness. Recently, in addition, this type of work has increasingly shifted towards a dimensional or transdiagnostic perspective. In line with this, we have shown that a dimensional approach that focuses on interpretable functions such as sleep problems or negative emotions, as opposed to broad classifications or classes of symptoms, aids the characterisation of the underlying brain networks.

Prolonged periods of stress are associated with several common psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Yet, the brain changes that accompany stress are insufficiently understood. Stress can be defined as an actual or anticipated disruption of homoeostasis or an anticipated threat to well-being. Physiological and behavioural responses to acute stress are adaptive, spatially and temporally specific, and regulated by a distributed network of regions including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus –. When these circuits trigger autonomic and endocrine stress responses, brainstem centres as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) are activated. Despite the various contributions made by this diverse set of regions, in this study, we focus on the hypothalamus. As part of the HPA axis, the hypothalamus is one of the key brain regions mediating the balance of hormones in response to acute stress –. For instance, the hypothalamus can directly activate the anterior pituitary and, via the adrenal cortex, trigger the release of cortisol. However, when stress turns into a prolonged state, it becomes maladaptive – and is frequently associated with compromised well-being. Currently, it remains unclear how human hypothalamus networks are affected by stress, in particular prolonged periods of stress. This might partly be because it is challenging to study the hypothalamus in vivo in humans.

### Breathing matters [^fa6099f8]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

Breathing is a well-described, vital and surprisingly complex behaviour, with behavioural and physiological outputs that are easy to directly measure. Key neural elements for generating breathing pattern are distinct, compact and form a network amenable to detailed interrogation, promising the imminent discovery of molecular, cellular, synaptic and network mechanisms that give rise to the behaviour. Coupled oscillatory microcircuits make up the rhythmic core of the breathing network. Primary among these is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), which is composed of excitatory rhythmogenic interneurons and excitatory and inhibitory pattern-forming interneurons that together produce the essential periodic drive for inspiration. The preBötC coordinates all phases of the breathing cycle, coordinates breathing with orofacial behaviours and strongly influences, and is influenced by, emotion and cognition. Here, we review progress towards cracking the inner workings of this vital core.

### Can we predict the direction of sudden shifts in symptoms? Transdiagnostic implications from a complex systems perspective on psychopathology [^eacac618]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Finally, the most direct support for the idea that symptom changes behave according to the principles observed in the complex system stems from empirical research showing that transitions in symptom levels can be anticipated by directly assessing changes in the stability of the system. From other fields of study (e.g. ecology and computer science), it is known that these changes in stability can be observed using certain 'EWS' (Tretyakov et al; van Nes and Scheffer; Dakos et al.). Such signals involve changes in the dynamics of important variables of a complex system, like increasing levels of autocorrelation (i.e. the current state of an element of the system becomes a better predictor for its future state), variance (i.e. elements of the system show greater amplitude changes in their intensity levels) or flickering (sudden changes in intensity levels). These reflect increasing instability of the system and have been shown to closely precede critical phase transitions in various sorts of complex systems. Considering the above, we expect that EWS (which involve more complex aspects of time-series dynamics than simple intensity changes of symptoms) may signal an increased likelihood of a phase transition and that such EWS can predict such transitions substantially earlier than simple changes in mean levels of these symptoms. This means that if psychopathology also behaves as a complex system, we may be able to find EWS that we can use to foresee important shifts in symptoms in an earlier phase and in a personalized manner. A few recent empirical studies already found support for this hypothesis (Schiepek et al; van de Leemput et al; Wichers et al.). For example, in the time-series experiment in which a patient was followed over 239 days completing multiple measurements of mental states a day, EWS were observed in the sum score of all measured mental states. These EWS anticipated a subsequent phase transition in depressive symptoms (Wichers et al.). Although these findings still await replication by a large-scale study in which EWS are followed over time within persons, support for the idea that psychopathology behaves as a complex system is accumulating. To conclude, many hypotheses have been formulated for the application of complex systems theory for the field of psychiatry and some empirical studies have been carried out suggesting we may be able to foresee transitions in levels of symptoms based on the system's changes in stability. We now want to further explore what this theoretical framework can do for foreseeing the type of symptom shifts that individuals may express in the near future. Before we move to the above mentioned theoretical explorations, however, it is important to first discuss the nature of psychopathology.

### Identification of a neurocircuit underlying regulation of feeding by stress-related emotional responses [^4b6742c5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Feeding is a complex behavior and known to be profoundly affected by stress-related emotional states. Research in animals suggests that motivation of feeding competes with emotional states encoding for potential environmental dangers. As such, acute changes in feeding behaviors are associated with adaptive changes in emotional states related to stress and anxiety. Despite differences in describing behaviors related to emotional states between rodents and humans, various states in valence related to emotion are conversed between rodents and humans. In humans, chronic eating disorders are accompanied by marked maladaptive changes in emotional state and are known to be associated with altered stress and anxiety –, whereas food over-consumption is often associated with increased impulsivity and positive reinforcement, similar to drug addiction. These observations support the idea that regulation of feeding and emotional states involves a common brain neural pathway. However, the neural basis underlying behavioral connections between feeding and emotional states is poorly understood.

Emerging evidence suggests that the hypothalamic regulation of feeding involves changes in valence related to emotional states. Thus, feeding elicited by activation of agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons is associated with changes in aversion and signs for anxiety –. In addition, activation of lateral hypothalamus (LH) GABAergic neurons promotes feeding associated with positive reinforcement, whereas activation of LH glutamatergic neurons inhibits feeding and promotes negative valence –. Conversely, recent results have identified that the amygdala, a main brain region in emotion control, plays an important role in feeding regulation. These observations, taken together, support a duel role in the regulation of feeding and behaviors related to emotion changes for both brain feeding and emotion centers.

The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), an important brain site for homeostatic regulation, coordinates numerous behavioral, and physiological adaptions for survival, including feeding. Extensive studies on PVH projection patterns and circuit function suggest that PVH neurons regulate feeding through various projections to within the hypothalamus or downstream brain stem and hindbrain neurons. Among various subtypes of PVH neurons, those expressing corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH neurons) are known to initiate the neuroendocrine aspect of stress responses; however, this response is not involved in stress-induced hypophagia. It is not clear how PVH neurons integrate stress-related responses to feeding control. Importantly, despite previous studies implicating connections between hypothalamic periventricular neurons and basal forebrain structures, where lie brain centers for emotion control, a functional demonstration on PVH projections to these brain structures is still lacking.

### Dynamic emotional States shape the episodic structure of memory [^b17794f1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Accurately perceiving and remembering temporal duration and order is essential for supporting adaptive decision-making and learning –, including for emotionally significant experiences. Until recently, however, emotion-memory research has focused primarily on how emotional stimuli influence recognition of items, their non-temporal features, or their probability of being retrieved in recall. Additionally, attempts to investigate the role of emotion on temporal memory neglect the role of continuously shifting emotional states on memory for event structure within temporally extended sequences. Namely, most studies use individual emotional stimuli to elicit moments of emotional reactivity – as well as memory metrics that fail to capture how complex memories take form. For example, prior work has tested temporal source memory for information encountered during, but not surrounding, emotional events. Other studies have tested temporal source judgments for longer-timescale events. Further still, memory for the temporal order of image sequences or frames from naturalistic film clips are typically queried by presenting items one at a time, or all at once during retrieval. Thus, there is a critical need to determine if memory for the structure of events is influenced by heterogenous emotional states. Here, we sought to address these limitations by investigating if fluctuations in music-induced emotions predict memory for the temporal structure and content of continuous item sequences.

Eliciting dynamic emotions through music has several key advantages over more traditional manipulations of emotional memory. Emotional images and words possess greater semantic relatedness with each other compared to non-emotional stimuli, thereby posing a challenge for dissociating emotion's distinct influence on memory. Memory can also be biased by the amount of conceptual overlap between the thematic content of narratives and an arousal-inducing event. Music, on the other hand, can reliably induce a range of emotions spanning the valence-arousal space with less explicit linguistic structure –. Unfamiliar pieces of instrumental music may help prevent individuals from relying on prior knowledge to scaffold episodic encoding processes. Finally, different emotional reactions to music can be evoked by overlapping acoustic features, such as tone or tempo, enabling some level of control over the lower-level effects of perceptual change on memory encoding. Altogether, these features suggest that music is an effective method for studying the link between emotion dynamics and memory because it can reduce the influence of semantic relatedness, familiarity, and perceptual change on memory.

### Biological predictors of treatment response in affective illness [^4f815c4a]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Attempts to identify biological response predictors generally have met with limited success, particularly where the goal is to develop clinically useful indices. This article reviews the biological approaches to predicting treatment response, beginning with neuroendocrine studies and electroencephalogram analysis and concluding with structural and functional neuroimaging. The article describes the designs of typical studies to aid in interpreting their results and concludes by addressing some of the problems and limitations associated with these approaches and suggesting future directions for this research.

### A complex systems approach to the study of change in psychotherapy [^746e222a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The right side of the first panel of Fig. 1 depicts a strong and entrenched state of psychopathology that forms a "rut" that is easy to enter and difficult to exit. The ball, which represents the state of the system, is caught in the pathological attractor. The thought-emotion-action-physiological patterns that make up the maladaptive attractor can be dense and strongly interconnected, especially with more recurrent and chronic disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Maintaining processes (e.g. rumination, avoidance, and other maladaptive emotion regulation strategies) can interfere with the processing of new information, creating feedback loops that perpetuate the pathological patterns and symptoms and make them difficult to destabilize. In contrast, the components of more healthy functioning (left side) are sparse, weakly connected, and not likely to sustain if activated. It is difficult to capture the ball in the shallow well of what is only a potential attractor.

Change in psychotherapy can take a number of forms. One type of change involves making minor adjustments to maladaptive patterns. For instance, harm reduction strategies reduce some negative consequences of pathological patterns, but they do not induce fundamental attractor changes. An example of this kind of within-attractor change is to provide clean needles to intravenous drug users, which improves safety but does not address the addiction directly. Distress tolerance, mindfulness, and positive emotion activation approaches can change the threshold of activation (or the sensitivity) and automaticity of both pathological and more functional patterns. Behavioral, interpersonal, cognitive reappraisal, emotion regulation, or parenting skills can be used to: (1) reduce feedback loops that block new information and interfere with new learning (spiral in panel 1, right), (2) deactivate or unhook from the pathological patterns of the attractor, or (3) compensate for or override these patterns (see also). In addition, these skills can be used to decrease exposure to stochastic factors or reduce their influence. All of these strategies work within the pathological attractor but do not change it directly.

### State-dependent encoding of exploratory behaviour in the amygdala [^0b737f3d]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The behaviour of an animal is determined by metabolic, emotional and social factors 1,2. Depending on its state, an animal will focus on avoiding threats, foraging for food or on social interactions, and will display the appropriate behavioural repertoire 3. Moreover, survival and reproduction depend on the ability of an animal to adapt to changes in the environment by prioritizing the appropriate state 4. Although these states are thought to be associated with particular functional configurations of large-brain systems 5,6, the underlying principles are poorly understood. Here we use deep-brain calcium imaging of mice engaged in spatial or social exploration to investigate how these processes are represented at the neuronal population level in the basolateral amygdala, which is a region of the brain that integrates emotional, social and metabolic information. We demonstrate that the basolateral amygdala encodes engagement in exploratory behaviour by means of two large, functionally anticorrelated ensembles that exhibit slow dynamics. We found that spatial and social exploration were encoded by orthogonal pairs of ensembles with stable and hierarchical allocation of neurons according to the saliency of the stimulus. These findings reveal that the basolateral amygdala acts as a low-dimensional, but context-dependent, hierarchical classifier that encodes state-dependent behavioural repertoires. This computational function may have a fundamental role in the regulation of internal states in health and disease.

### Cortisol awakening response and negative emotionality linked to asymmetry in major limbic fibre bundle architecture [^f7a1f1fb]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

The limbic system plays an important role in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as well as aspects of emotion, and both neuroendocrine disturbance and increased negative emotionality are associated with risk for developing affective disorders. However, the extent to which the architecture of connections between limbic structures may be linked to individual differences in basal HPA-axis reactivity and negative emotionality is unknown. Here we tested the hypotheses that microstructural asymmetry of the major limbic fibre bundles would be associated with cortisol awakening response (CAR) and neuroticism, a personality trait associated with the tendency to experience negative emotions. Sixty-nine healthy adults were studied with diffusion-weighted imaging, and fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from the cingulum and uncinate fasciculus. Higher neuroticism scores, which were associated with higher CAR, were also correlated with higher right relative to left cingulum FA. Elevated CAR was associated with the degree of FA asymmetry within both the cingulum and the uncinate fasciculus, but in opposing directions. These results suggest that the balance between left- and right-sided limbic circuits may bear an important relationship to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity, and to the tendency to experience negative emotions, and they raise important questions about the significance of limbic system architecture.

### Selective processing of social stimuli in the superficial amygdala [^eafb8afb]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

The human amygdala plays a pivotal role in the processing of socially significant information. Anatomical studies show that the human amygdala is not a single homogeneous structure but is composed of segregable subregions. These have recently been functionally delineated by using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps. However, the response characteristics and individual contribution of these subregions to the processing of social-emotional stimuli are little understood. Here, we used this novel technique to segregate intra-amygdalar responses to facial expressions and nonsocial control stimuli. We localized facial expression-evoked signal changes bilaterally in the superficial amygdala, which suggests that this subregion selectively extracts the social value of incoming sensory information.

### Differential lipid composition and regulation along the hippocampal longitudinal axis [^9049fa37]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipids are major constituents of the brain largely implicated in physiological and pathological processes. The hippocampus is a complex brain structure involved in learning, memory and emotional responses, and its functioning is also affected in various disorders. Despite conserved intrinsic circuitry, behavioral and anatomical studies suggest the existence of a structural and functional gradient along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. Here, we used an unbiased mass spectrometry approach to characterize the lipid composition of distinct hippocampal subregions. In addition, we evaluated the susceptibility of each area to lipid modulation by corticosterone (CORT), an important mediator of the effects of stress. We confirmed a great similarity between hippocampal subregions relatively to other brain areas. Moreover, we observed a continuous molecular gradient along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, with the dorsal and ventral extremities differing significantly from each other, particularly in the relative abundance of sphingolipids and phospholipids. Also, whereas chronic CORT exposure led to remodeling of triacylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol species in both hippocampal poles, our study suggests that the ventral hippocampus is more sensitive to CORT-induced changes, with regional modulation of ceramide, dihydrosphingomyelin and phosphatidic acid. Thus, our results confirm a multipartite molecular view of dorsal-ventral hippocampal axis and emphasize lipid metabolites as candidate effectors of glucocorticoid signaling, mediating regional susceptibility to neurological disorders associated with stress.

### Experimentally induced and real-world anxiety have no demonstrable effect on goal-directed behaviour [^ac8c4d1e]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We conducted the same analyses by using physiological changes in the heart rate as a putatively more objective measure of the change in anxiety arising from our manipulation. The physiological index for change in the heart rate was computed as above, i.e. the difference between the heart rate before inhaling the gas and after inhaling the gas. Changes in the heart rate did not have a main effect on the response rate (F (1, 80) = 0.1, p = 0.75), but there was a trend for an interaction between changes in the heart rate and programmed contingency (F (3.80, 303.94) = 2.00, p = 0.10). Individuals with higher changes in the heart rate tended to show slightly greater sensitivity to instrumental contingency, as their response rate depended more strongly on programmed contingency. Thus, if any moderating effect of anxiety sensitivity exists, it goes in the opposite direction to what has been shown in individual difference research with stress and goal-directed control (e.g. Otto et al; Radenbach et al.). Changes in the heart rate did not affect subjective causality ratings (F (1, 80) = 0.08, p = 0.78). Similarly there was not a significant interaction between changes in the heart rate and programmed contingency (F (3,29, 263.45) = 0.44, p = 0.74) in predicting subjective causality ratings.

### State-dependent effects of neural stimulation on brain function and cognition [^d74e3565]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

Invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation methods are widely used in neuroscience to establish causal relationships between distinct brain regions and the sensory, cognitive and motor functions they subserve. When combined with concurrent brain imaging, such stimulation methods can reveal patterns of neuronal activity responsible for regulating simple and complex behaviours at the level of local circuits and across widespread networks. Understanding how fluctuations in physiological states and task demands might influence the effects of brain stimulation on neural activity and behaviour is at the heart of how we use these tools to understand cognition. Here we review the concept of such 'state-dependent' changes in brain activity in response to neural stimulation, and consider examples from research on altered states of consciousness (for example, sleep and anaesthesia) and from task-based manipulations of selective attention and working memory. We relate relevant findings from non-invasive methods used in humans to those obtained from direct electrical and optogenetic stimulation of neuronal ensembles in animal models. Given the widespread use of brain stimulation as a research tool in the laboratory and as a means of augmenting or restoring brain function, consideration of the influence of changing physiological and cognitive states is crucial for increasing the reliability of these interventions.

### How childhood maltreatment alters perception and cognition-the predictive processing account of borderline personality disorder [^d7b91ddf]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Affective instability

BPD is characterized by an affective instability, in terms of rapid changes of mood, ranging from chronic feelings of emptiness 2 to intense anger, anxiety, or dysphoria – and difficulties in handling these mood fluctuations. From a PP point of view, emotional states have been theorized to be a consequence of acting in the world with the aim of minimizing expected free energy, that is, the uncertainty about the future consequences of actions (Kiverstein, Miller, & Rietveld). In other words, emotional states reflect changes in the uncertainty about the somatic consequences of action (Joffily & Coricelli; Seth & Friston; Wager et al.), with uncertainty relating to the precision with which motor and physiological states are predicted and inferred (Clark et al.). By this view, painful emotions have been thought to accompany events that elicit beliefs of unpredictability, whereas pleasant emotions refer to events that resolve uncertainty and convey a sense of control and confidence (Barrett & Satpute; Clark et al; Gu, Hof, Friston, & Fan). Thus, the valence of emotional states relates to the resolution of uncertainty and the precision with which the consequences of action are predicted (Brown & Friston; Clark et al.). Interestingly, BPD features predicted specific patterns of bias with regard to forecasting future (negative) emotional states (Hughes & Rizvi).

### Preoccupation as psychopathological process and symptom in adjustment disorder: a scoping review [^28eeadb3]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

3.5 Cognitive–emotional dynamics

Different modalities of human functioning, such as emotions, cognitions, behaviour, and physiology, are highly interconnected and influence each other (Izard; Izard et al.). Cognitions can alter physiological and emotional states even through simple cognitive exercises (Beck; Beck & Tompkins; Wilson et al.). Emotions also have an impact on an individual on several levels (Lench et al; Stemmler). For example, a person who feels angry after the loss of their job may experience changes on a behavioural level, resulting in restlessness, as well as changed physiological components, like an altered heartbeat and trembling. Emotions can also cause a change in cognitions (Borkovec; Izard; Okon‐Singer et al.). For instance, after the loss of a job and the emotional arousal due to this event, job‐related cognitions might become very prominent merely due to this emotional arousal, which is cognitively perceived and processed.

Studies have shown that after a stressful life event, many individuals with AjD perceive intensive and distressing emotions (e.g. Anaf et al; Blau; Brewington et al.). As a triggered cognitive component of this emotional distress, preoccupation may form. The emotional pain might be so dominant that it could be difficult not to think about it. This phenomenon can be observed in people with chronic pain: A study with patients suffering from a chronic pain disorder showed that the feeling of pain also triggers attention and thoughts related to pain (Crombez et al.). In other words, emotions trigger a cognitive focus on the current state. Thinking, on the other hand, could bring the aversive event to the attention again, which could elicit negative emotions once more. As a result, both processes, emotions facilitating cognitions and vice versa, may result in a cognitive–emotional dynamic, which finally forms preoccupation as persisting, ongoing and distressing symptom, as it is defined in the ICD‐11.

### Regulation of emotional responses elicited by threat-related stimuli [^28c1998d]. Human Brain Mapping (2007). Low credibility.

The capacity to voluntarily regulate emotions is critical for mental health, especially when coping with aversive events. Several neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation found the amygdala to be a target for downregulation and prefrontal regions to be associated with downregulation. To characterize the role of prefrontal regions in bidirectional emotion regulation and to investigate regulatory influences on amygdala activity and peripheral physiological measures, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with simultaneous recording of self-report, startle eyeblink, and skin conductance responses was carried out. Subjects viewed threat-related pictures and were asked to up- and downregulate their emotional responses using reappraisal strategies. While startle eyeblink responses (in successful regulators) and skin conductance responses were amplified during upregulation, but showed no consistent effect during downregulation, amygdala activity was increased and decreased according to the regulation instructions. Trial-by-trial ratings of regulation success correlated positively with activity in amygdala during upregulation and orbitofrontal cortex during downregulation. Downregulation was characterized by left-hemispheric activation peaks in anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex and upregulation was characterized by a pattern of prefrontal activation not restricted to the left hemisphere. Further analyses showed significant overlap of prefrontal activation across both regulation conditions, possibly reflecting cognitive processes underlying both up- and downregulation, but also showed distinct activations in each condition. The present study demonstrates that amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli can be controlled through the use of cognitive strategies depending on recruitment of prefrontal areas, thereby changing the subject's affective state.

### Baroreceptor activation attenuates attentional effects on pain-evoked potentials [^c11bc91d]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Our experimental paradigm did not evoke significant peripheral physiological (i.e. heart rate and blood pressure) change, either of cue-related expectancy or nociceptive stimulation. This might be related to the short inter-stimulus time (i.e. approximately 7 s) or due to the fact that, in contrast with the previous work, here participants were engaged in recognizing visual stimuli rather than passively waiting for nociceptive stimulation. Importantly, the absence of peripheral physiological effects ensured that the observed interaction was genuinely between neural aspects of the expectancy state and cardiac timing, rather than directly explainable in terms of expectancy-related systematic physiological changes.

Our cued pain paradigm also has similarities to paradigms seeking to differentiate "fear" from "anxiety" influences on nociception. These studies suggest that probable but unpredictable pain (un-cued pain in our experiment) activates "anxiety" circuitry encouraging hypervigilant evaluation of external and somatic environments, whereas directly cued imminent pain activates "fear" circuitry inducing fight/fight responses. Activating "anxiety circuitry" increases pain sensitivity and hyperalgesia, whereas activating "fear circuitry" decreases pain sensitivity via cortico-limbic, midbrainand spinalanalgesic mechanisms. Our finding however, that P2 amplitude is increased to directly cued pain is inconsistent with this literature, and appears instead to be more directly related to attentional phenomena.

### Relations between lab indices of emotion dysregulation and negative affect reactivity in daily life in two independent studies [^77d61491]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the extent to which physiological/biological measures of emotion dysregulation collected in the lab, resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in Study 1 and amygdala activation in response to negative stimuli in Study 2, combined with daily measures of interpersonal stressors predicted negative emotional states in outpatients better than the stressors alone.

Methods

Participants were adult outpatients with emotional distress disorders (N = 30 individuals in Study 1, and N = 26 women in Study 2). After completing a laboratory session that collected physiological/biological measures of emotion dysregulation, participants then completed 1–3 weeks of ambulatory assessment during which they reported on interpersonal stressors and negative affective states several times per day.

Results

Laboratory measures of emotion dysregulation were largely unrelated to either momentary or mean levels of daily-life hostility, sadness, and fear in both studies. However, resting RSA significantly moderated the association between day-level interpersonal stressors and momentary fear such that low resting RSA strengthened this association. Similarly, amygdala activation tended to moderate this relationship in the predicted direction.

Limitations

Both samples were relatively small and focused on only a limited set of diagnoses associated with emotion dysregulation. Only two possible physiological/biological markers of emotion dysregulation were examined.

Conclusions

The current studies support the collection of physiological/biological data on emotion dysregulation when indexing daily-life emotion dysregulation as the degree of emotional reactivity to stressors in daily life among outpatients with emotional distress disorders.

### Integration of hunger and hormonal state gates infant-directed aggression [^63553f4a]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Social behaviour is substantially shaped by internal physiological states. Although progress has been made in understanding how individual states such as hunger, stress or arousal modulate behaviour 1–9, animals experience multiple states at any given time 10. The neural mechanisms that integrate such orthogonal states-and how this integration affects behaviour-remain poorly understood. Here we report how hunger and oestrous state converge on neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) to shape infant-directed behaviour. We find that hunger promotes pup-directed aggression in normally non-aggressive virgin female mice. This behavioural switch occurs through the inhibition of MPOA neurons, driven by the release of neuropeptideY from Agouti-related peptide-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc AgRP neurons). The propensity for hunger-induced aggression is set by reproductive state, with MPOA neurons detecting changes in the progesterone to oestradiol ratio across the oestrous cycle. Hunger and oestrous state converge on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which sets the baseline activity and excitability of MPOA neurons. Using microendoscopy imaging, we confirm these findings in vivo, revealing that MPOA neurons encode a state for pup-directed aggression. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of how multiple physiological states are integrated to flexibly control social behaviour.

### Altered brain dynamic in major depressive disorder: state and trait features [^1461811c]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

One core symptom of MDD is diminished fluctuation in the mood with the dominance of the negative affect state and less experiencing positive emotions. This persistence of lower mood can be interlinked to rigid attention towards negative stimuli, which might also contribute to the perpetuation of negative thoughts and combined with disruption in the cognitive process prevents the patients to leave this state. Directing attention towards negative stimuli can also extend to bodily sensations and may intensify the perception of bodily discomfort, contributing to symptoms such as fatigue, agitation, sleep disturbances, and other somatic complaints commonly observed in individuals with MDD. These patterns are not only relevant to the transient states of depression but also to the enduring depressive traits. Disrupted cognitive processes, distorted attention and maintained negative mood and further might be observed both as state-dependent symptoms in individuals experiencing depressive episodes and as trait-like tendencies in individuals with a predisposition to depression. The rigidity or instability of specific dynamic patterns of functional interactions among brain regions could contribute to both the acute manifestations of depressive states and the underlying trait-related vulnerabilities. Therefore, studying the fundamental dynamics of brain function could provide additional knowledge about the mechanisms in the brain that are related to both specific depressive symptoms and the overall trait and state nature of depression.

Capturing the temporal variability of reoccurring functional activity and connectivity patterns (i.e. spatial states) is critical for understanding the dynamic organization of the brain. The temporal features related to the recurring spatial states can be quantified by fractional occupancy (FO), the proportion of time spent in any of the states characterized by functional activity or connectivity, or the average lifetime of each state (ALT), a parameter of stability of the given spatial brain state and switching rate (SR) measures a ratio of overall transitioning between reoccurring functional states. These dynamic patterns of specific brain connectivity known as spatiotemporal measures have already been shown to be associated with thought processing, and specific cognitive and affective states. Moreover, alterations of brain dynamics patterns have been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.

### The human amygdala parametrically encodes the intensity of specific facial emotions and their categorical ambiguity [^b40d13c1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Notably, emotion ambiguity and certainty are closely related and inversely correlated, and these neurons might encode emotion certainty or confidence in emotion judgment. Here we interpret any change in firing rate, or in BOLD signal, as carrying information, and therefore do not further interpret the sign of that change. Although all our stimuli should be equally attended given the task demands of having to make judgments about them, we acknowledge that task difficulty, attention, mental efforts and RT are of course all intercorrelated to some extent, and future studies will be needed to further distinguish the possible contribution of attentional effects in our study. Furthermore, future studies will be necessary to investigate whether ambiguity-coding neurons are from a circuit separate from the emotion-tracking neurons. Alternatively, ambiguity-coding neurons might pool the activity of emotion-tracking neurons to generate the ambiguity signal, that is, ambiguity-coding neurons effectively code for the absolute degree of emotions. The second hypothesis predicts that ambiguity-coding neurons would respond later in time relative to emotion-tracking neurons, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.

### Trauma-informed care [^679e4048]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Stress responses — Key features of stress physiology include an initial brief response that originates in central nucleus of the amygdala and is mediated by hypothalamus and superior colliculus, which forces the organism to alert to danger, can be followed by the fight-or-flight responses, and whose parasympathetic and vagal response can lead to dissociation or faint. Fight or flight results from adrenal release of epinephrine and cortisol that allow the threat to be addressed, with short term physiological changes including increased heart rate and blood pressure, and excess or frequent activation in childhood can result in long-term changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function leading to dysregulation of the neuroendocrine stress response and consequent physiologic changes. The affiliative response is a higher brain response mediated by oxytocin that appears to mediate stress within the social context by promoting the ability to look to others for support in managing a threat, with the provision of support associated with a decline in stress response, whereas having no support or a hostile environment leads to negative perceptions of others, less adaptive responses and antisocial behaviors, and increased perception of stress and increased cortisol; emerging science underlying the affiliative response elucidates how safe, stable, nurturing relationships can buffer adversity and promote resilience.

### Parcel-guided rTMS for depression [^25d20115]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In our study, all subjects first received the FDA-approved "5-cm rule" treatment (sdTMS) before being entered into experimental treatment. In our group of ten subjects who did not respond to sdTMS, all subjects who received pgTMS responded to treatment as defined based on ≥ 25% reduction in symptoms, and 50% (5/10) obtained remission. Both mean symptom change and % of subjects showing treatment response were significantly greater for pgTMS than for a parallel group of subjects, who received sdTMS for the first time, as well as those expected from rTMS meta-analyses.

In addition to symptom change, we also observed rsfc changes within the predefined DLPFC, DMN, and VIS circuit, suggesting objective physiological effects. Surprisingly, we observed an opposite pattern of rsfc change in the sdTMS and pgTMS groups. sdTMS produced changes similar to those observed pre/post ECT, albeit weaker, suggesting a convergent mechanism of effect. By contrast, pgTMS produced an opposite pattern of change.

Interactions between DLPFC(46), DMN(s32), and VIS(ventral) are critical for normal goal-directed VIS activity, and is consistent with spatio-temporal dynamics of interactions between emotional stimulus and task-driven attention. In particular, the simultaneous increase in DLPFC–DMN and DMN–VIS connectivity in the pgTMS group might underlie the mechanism by which frontal structures regulate attention and emotion influences on VIS cortex.

A mechanistic explanation of this interaction could be that both emotional salience feedback from the DMN and top-down signaling from DLPFC regions synergistically increase processing in the VIS cortex. Long-range cortico–cortical projections might act through local microcircuits to exert spatially specific top-down modulation of sensory processing. Restoration of these small local circuits might be crucial for the development of long-range cortico–cortical projections to exert specific top-down modulation of attention and emotion influences on sensory processing.

### Towards formal models of psychopathological traits that explain symptom trajectories [^afb27cd0]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Probabilistic inferences about traits depend on model validity

A probabilistic inference regarding the level of trait depression an individual possesses should be adjusted by evidence. To do so would require a formal model comparison procedure that defines a suitable target dataset that the model can account for. Moreover, the comparison procedure should be cumulative, aggregating across studies that attempt to model the relevant data. Below, we formalize a hierarchical Bayesian procedure that fits trait models to within-subject symptom variation. Moreover, the model 1 itself depends on the prior body of evidence regarding its ability to explain relevant symptoms.

In the above, θ refers to the parameters of the trait model, which for instance could be an individual's learning rates. To derive validity for the model, also called model evidence, the equation averages all possible individual instances of the model (i.e. all the kinds of individuals with different individual parameters that could be utilizing that model).

Thus, to calculate the validity of the trait model requires collecting data from many subjects that ensures sufficient within-subject data on the relevant dynamics to which the hypothetical trait predisposes an individual. In the example above, we simulated far fewer interactions than those that present the totality of interactions with colleagues. Moreover, there are likely other types of interactions between the person and aspects of their environment (other individuals, other states and outcomes) that, if modeled, may improve model validity.

Even though it is not possible to exhaust the measurement of the relevant factors influencing symptoms dynamics, two generative approaches may help. The first is to collect and model relevant real-life interactions when possible; indeed, this requires more intensive sampling of non-laboratory daily-life dynamics than is typical currently in attempts to formally model symptom variation computationally. The second is to obtain a weighted average over all possible life events that are relevant and go unmeasured, along with assumptions regarding how these factors impact the relevant symptom dynamics. When possible, these assumptions should be encoded as empirical priors.

Although the field has only begun to model symptom variation with computational models, there are now good examples of success in modeling ecologically valid temporal patterns of symptom variation in daily life. For instance, mapped mood variation within subjects to physiological signals generated by two co-occurring learning systems that internalize statistical quantities about rewards along different timescales. Moreover, large-scale smartphone-based approaches have validated models of decision-making with varying levels of happiness in daily life.

### Acute relaxation during pregnancy leads to a reduction in maternal electrodermal activity and self-reported stress levels [^012f3e9d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy is characterized by various changes, including hormonal changes, different personal expectations and a new coordination of the professional and social environment, often accompanied by financial or health concerns. Depending on the circumstances, the degree of support from the environment and many other (individual) factors, these changes can lead to intense emotional states and stress. A negative maternal emotional state or maternal stress over a longer period of time not only affects mental health of the becoming mother but can interfere with the development of the offspring: Several studies have shown adverse effects of intense negative maternal emotional states, ranging from prenatal distress to peripartum mental disorders, on fetal and infant development. More specifically, adverse effects on the physiological, metabolic and neuronal development of the fetus have been reported. The fetal autonomic nervous system reacts and adapts rapidly to environmental changes: Higher fetal heart rate variability and lower fetal heart rate are indicators for fetal well-being. Accordingly, several studies have shown that increased maternal depressive or stress symptoms lead to changes in fetal cardiovascular activity. Furthermore, recent studies reported a relation between maternal stress and the offspring's physiological stress reactivity and cortisol levels. Altered maternal cortisol levels due to high and chronic stress have been hypothesized to be related to the development of emotional and behavioral psychopathology across the child's lifespan, potentially also affecting cognitive performance and brain volume. In addition, maternal diurnal cortisol was related to the newborn's stress reactivity and thus to the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as measured by a neonatal heel-stick measurement.

### Neuropsychobiology of fear-induced bradycardia in humans: progress and pitfalls [^c5b540f4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines

Classically, the most renowned guidelines for heart rate studies in humans have been proposed back in 1981, in a work by Jennings and colleagues. Besides their historical importance, these guidelines still constitute a valuable resource. However, here we aim to highlight a series of recommendations and precautions researchers should consider when designing experiments in humans that use heart rate as the primary dependent variable. Remarkably, many of their recommendations are based on solid pieces of advice that must be followed to ensure proper experimental designs (for instance, suggestions regarding participant selection and exclusion criteria, setting and stimuli considerations, and recording and analysis parameters). Notwithstanding, with our review, we want to update and complement these recommendations by providing guidelines and further advice specifically focused on fear conditioning experimental designs. To do so, we distilled the evidence from the more recent studies that were analyzed in the present manuscript.
The use of heart period (HP) instead of beats per minute (BPM) is recommended, as it is more precise. While BPM change has to be measured in time bins, HP allows for more temporally precise measurements. Moreover, the use of spectral analyses is highly encouraged, as it allows to distinguish between the contributions of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems on HRV.
It is important that the trial time-window for the analysis includes the US, as fear-induced bradycardia onset is related to US presentation. This will ensure that the study will capture all decelerative and accelerative components, which could be left out otherwise.
It is suggested to employ within subjects designs to enhance statistical power, as heart rate variations are subject to individual differences.
In our opinion, a 5-second trial including US is to be considered optimal, even with co-recording of SCR or FPS. In the case of FPS registration, we suggest including some un-probed trials, in order to have a set of trials where cardiac activity is not influenced by the presentation of the acoustic sound (e.g. Szeska et al.).
We recommend using neutral stimuli, as threatening stimuli may influence a participant's physiological activation based on their predisposition towards what is represented on screen. Geometrical shapes, Gabor patches, and neutral faces are all appropriate choices.
It is necessary to employ a sufficiently threatening US, carefully weighed on the participant's individual pain threshold. Both shocks to the wrist and loud noises are effective, but one may prefer using the latter in case of an experiment where a high number of trials is required, for example for protocols that require co-recording of neurophysiological methods like electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography in order to ensure an adequate signal to noise ratio.
We recommend having more CSs presentations than in more classical SCR or FPS studies, as it seems that fear induced bradycardia needs more time compared to other psychophysiological indices to occur. 40 are enough to promote fear induced bradycardia. It is important to note, however, that the amplitude of the SCR strongly decreases over many presentations of the same cues (i.e. habituation; Boucsein et al; Dawson et al.). Therefore, this needs to be considered for future research, and it will need to be taken into account when designing paradigms that involve recording of both HR and SCR.
Model-based estimates provide an additional method to homogenize heart response scoring through different studies and better identify commonalities between them. Castegnetti and colleagues' work provides an in-depth look at the matter. However, as we have not tested the efficacy of model-based approaches over other methods, we encourage future research to investigate this issue.
Data sharing and a common data format would be beneficial to guarantee transparency, reproducibility, and cooperation between research groups and facilitate cumulative knowledge generation.

### Emotional triggers of acute coronary syndromes: strength of evidence, biological processes, and clinical implications [^52ab9ca2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Emotional triggers of acute coronary syndromes include population-level events such as earthquakes and terrorist attacks, and individual experiences of acute anger, stress and depression. The methodology of studying emotional triggers has developed markedly over recent years, though limitations remain. The biological processes underlying triggering include acute autonomic dysregulation, neuroendocrine activation, hemostatic and inflammatory responses which, when associated with plaque disruption, promote myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmia and thrombosis formation. Prevention and management strategies for ameliorating emotional triggering remain to be effectively developed.

### Emotional response patterns during social threat in individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder and non-anxious controls [^e2532be0]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Patterns of synchrony in repeated measures of heart rate, skin conductance levels, negative affect, and positive affect were investigated in patients with social anxiety disorder and non-anxious controls during a speech task. Despite expected low levels of absolute concordance between measures of affect and arousal overall, results revealed clearly defined and specific patterns of emotional response coherence that distinguished between the two groups and depended on the types of measures used. Specifically, findings demonstrated that (a) for both patients and controls, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased negative affect, with patients showing overall stronger levels of synchrony between these two measures than controls; (b) for controls only, increased heart rate was significantly synchronized with increased positive affect; and (c) for patients only, increased skin conductance was significantly synchronized with both increased negative affect and decreased positive affect. These findings are discussed in relation to current conceptualizations of the construct of emotion as well as directions for future research and potential implications for clinical practice.

### The role of functional emotion circuits in distinct dimensions of psychopathology in youth [^6442a0d9]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study has several strengths. First, we used a large sample and sensitive analyses to investigate associations between functional connectivity patterns during emotion processing and psychopathology in children and adolescents. Further, we used a task-based connectivity approach, which has the potential to yield behaviorally more meaningful patterns than resting-state connectivity. Additionally, the data-driven approach to clinical symptoms allowed us to examine associations between functional connectivity patterns during an emotion recognition task and distinct dimensions of psychopathology in youth.

It can be argued that the study lacks ecological validity, since we can merely infer from associations based on perception of emotional facial expressions, rather than real-world emotion perception, nor does the task and sample allow us to study associations between subtle emotion recognition biases in youth with confirmed diagnoses. Using stimulus sets with dynamic facial expressions of children and adolescents has the potential to explain aspects of emotion recognition development and their link to psychopathology with greater ecologically validity. Considering the role of valence, intensity, and arousal in emotion perception, future studies could use stimuli with varying emotion intensities, ecologically valid stimuli (e.g. dynamic facial expressions), add arousal measurements, such as heart-rate variability, and specifically focus on emotion recognition biases in clinical samples. Another limitation includes the potential impact of pubertal development on the processing of emotions, which we did not account for in our study. Finally, future longitudinal studies should examine the developmental relationships between functional emotion circuits and psychopathology in youth and aim to disentangle the interplay between emotion and cognitive processing, i.e. emotion regulation and working memory, to fully understand the roots and consequences of emotion processing biases. Given the relevance and availability of psychosocial interventions, it is particularly important to identify environmental contributors of emotion recognition biases and their subsequent impact on interpersonal relationships. Specifically, in the case of emotion recognition biases in youth with norm-violating behavior, more research and innovation on emotion recognition and regulation trainings is needed to potentially compensate biased neural emotion processing.

### Deconvolution filtering: temporal smoothing revisited [^641361dd]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Inferences made from analysis of BOLD data regarding neural processes are potentially confounded by multiple competing sources: cardiac and respiratory signals, thermal effects, scanner drift, and motion-induced signal intensity changes. To address this problem, we propose deconvolution filtering, a process of systematically deconvolving and reconvolving the BOLD signal via the hemodynamic response function such that the resultant signal is composed of maximally likely neural and neurovascular signals. To test the validity of this approach, we compared the accuracy of BOLD signal variants (i.e., unfiltered, deconvolution filtered, band-pass filtered, and optimized band-pass filtered BOLD signals) in identifying useful properties of highly confounded, simulated BOLD data: (1) reconstructing the true, unconfounded BOLD signal, (2) correlation with the true, unconfounded BOLD signal, and (3) reconstructing the true functional connectivity of a three-node neural system. We also tested this approach by detecting task activation in BOLD data recorded from healthy adolescent girls (control) during an emotion processing task. Results for the estimation of functional connectivity of simulated BOLD data demonstrated that analysis (via standard estimation methods) using deconvolution filtered BOLD data achieved superior performance to analysis performed using unfiltered BOLD data and was statistically similar to well-tuned band-pass filtered BOLD data. Contrary to band-pass filtering, however, deconvolution filtering is built upon physiological arguments and has the potential, at low TR, to match the performance of an optimal band-pass filter. The results from task estimation on real BOLD data suggest that deconvolution filtering provides superior or equivalent detection of task activations relative to comparable analyses on unfiltered signals and also provides decreased variance over the estimate. In turn, these results suggest that standard preprocessing of the BOLD signal ignores significant sources of noise that can be effectively removed without damaging the underlying signal.

### Beyond storm and stress: typicality, transactions, timing, and temperament to account for adolescent change [^95935128]. The American Psychologist (2013). Low credibility.

Adolescent "storm and stress" has been a focal yet controversial developmental framework for over a century. In the present article, we challenge the current perspective that storm and stress is neither ubiquitous nor inevitable but probable. Instead, we argue, storm and stress is a vestigial developmental framework, and we propose a more comprehensive approach to understanding adolescent-typical changes based on six premises: (1) The biological changes of adolescence are inevitable and ubiquitous; (2) adolescent biological changes drive various mechanisms of adolescent behavior; (3) adolescent biological changes are shaped by environmental influences; (4) individual differences in adolescent emotional-behavior changes are domain specific and vary in intensity; (5) there are individual differences in the age of onset and duration of periods of adolescent change; and (6) individual differences in the duration and intensity of transitions in emotional arousal are functionally modulated by burgeoning emotion regulation skills. We conclude with the more comprehensive 4T (typicality, transactions, temperament, and timing) approach and suggestions to guide adolescent research in the 21st century.

### Optogenetic recruitment of hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing-hormone (CRH) neurons reduces motivational drive [^faee89a9]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

While there is a strong relationship between impaired motivational drive and stress-related neuroendocrine activation, much of the evidence linking neuroendocrine activation with distinct behavioral changes is correlational. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) constitute the apex of the HPA axis, initiating a hormonal cascade that culminates in glucocorticoid secretion. In rodents, deficits in preference for sucrose as well as other indices, such as reduced sociability, can be replicated by artificially raising glucocorticoids over several weeks to stress-like levels, thus implicating glucocorticoids in the manifestation of these depressive-like behaviors. Whilst glucocorticoids have been functionally implicated in depressive-like behaviors, direct evidence of a necessary rather than an associative role for activation of PVN CRH neurons in these behaviors, particularly motivation, is lacking. An alternative hypothesis that has recently gained support is that such stress-induced behaviors do not require endocrine signaling, and that PVN CRH neurons also directly drive altered motivational states through synaptic rather than endocrine actions. Interestingly, emotional and physiological stressors robustly activate PVN CRH neurons, whereas real-time recording of these neurons using fiber photometry has shown that these cells are inhibited by positive rewards such as sucrose. These data suggest that stress and motivation interact to determine the activity of these neurons. Further, a recent study that directly manipulated PVN CRH neurons using optogenetics showed that acute stress-related behaviors require an excitatory, glutamatergic projection to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that occurs on a timescale consistent with synaptic rather than endocrine events. In parallel work, we have demonstrated that the LH is an important substrate of chronic stress-induced motivational disturbances. Together these studies suggest a more nuanced role for PVN CRH neurons in motivated behavior, potentially via their projections to brain regions critical for motivation such as the LH or ventral tegmental area (VTA).

Accordingly, here we aimed to test whether directly activating PVN CRH neurons can induce long-lasting motivational disturbances, as assessed by sucrose self-administration, under low and high effort reinforcement conditions in CRH-Cre transgenic mice. We found that repeated optogenetic activation of PVN CRH neurons increased acute stress-like behaviors but produced a long-lasting reduction in motivation for sucrose. This pattern of effects was also observed following direct stimulation of the PVN CRH terminals located in the LH. Together our data provide the first direct demonstration that repeated experimental activation of PVN CRH neurons is sufficient to produce impairments in motivation and suggest that these effects are likely underpinned by PVN CRH neuron projections to brain centers involved in motivation as well as HPA endocrine control.

### Trauma-informed care [^7e77e3e7]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Physiologic effects of trauma in children — brain connectivity changes note that cortisol acts on rapidly developing brain structures with amygdala overactive, hippocampus underactive, and prefrontal cortex not accessible, with a preliminary association with more severe clinical course in major depressive disorder. Epigenetic changes include methylation patterns impacted by threat, mediated by cortisol, with methyl groups attaching to promoter region or core of promotor regions of genes, leading to the transcription or lack of transcription of genes, and implications noted for adult stress and reactivity behavior. Immune function effects include alteration of immune system in response to constant threat with inflammatory system up-regulated, humoral immunity diminished, and cytokine-induced "sickness behavior" (feeling sick), and symptoms including the following: decreased appetite, fatigue, mood changes including depression and irritability, poor cognitive function.

### Preceding attention and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex: process specificity versus domain dependence [^0ce4901e]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) has been shown to be involved in attending different states, all including a strong emotional component. It remains unclear, though, whether neural activity in the DMPFC is predominantly determined by either a particular domain, as emotional stimuli, or by a specific process, as attention. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the alternative hypotheses of domain- versus process-specificity in DMPFC. Subjects had to perceive pictures from three different domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral stimuli, in both a nonattended, i.e., unexpected, and attended, i.e., expected mode. Our results show DMPFC activation during attended, i.e., expected stimulus perception when compared with nonattended, i.e., unexpected stimuli perception. DMPFC activation and corresponding behavioral changes (reaction time, subjective ratings) were observed in all three domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral stimuli. As opposed to those process-specific effects that were found predominantly in posterior DMPFC, a process by domain interaction was found to be characteristic for more anterior parts of the DMPFC. Taken together, our findings favour the hypothesis that neural activity in the posterior DMPFC is determined by a specific process, i.e., attending stimuli, and thus characterized by process-specificity rather than by a particular domain, i.e., sexual, emotional, or neutral stimuli, reflecting domain-specificity. This suggests that the anterior and posterior DMPFC is involved in the process of attending mental states while remaining more (posterior DMPFC) or less (anterior DMPFC) independent of the type or domain of the respective stimulus.

### Layer-specific, retinotopically-diffuse modulation in human visual cortex in response to viewing emotionally expressive faces [^00f4d89e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We quantified fMRI response amplitude to fearful and neutral facial expressions as a function of visual eccentricity. For each participant in the 7 T BOLD and 3 T BOLD experiments, we performed a retinotopic analysis(Fig. 4a) to segment V1 into five iso-eccentricity bins (see Methods). The visual response averaged across different facial expressions exhibited a "half-Mexican hat" profilefrom central to peripheral V1 (Fig. 4b): a positive response at the fovea and extending out to 2 deg (dark red, radius: 0.5–2 deg), corresponding to the retinotopic location of the foveally presented faces (Fig. 4a, bottom), surrounded by a negative response penumbra (dark blue, radius: 2.5–6 deg), and then a return to baseline at more eccentric portions in V1 (green and yellow, radius: 6–88 deg). We found that the valence effect was evident at all eccentricities, and its magnitude did not differ as a function of eccentricity (Fig. 4c). Thus, the valence effect in V1 may be characterized as an additive effect riding on top of the stimulus-evoked response, rather than a multiplicative gain modulation, as has been observed with spatial attention. Although recent evidence suggests that amygdala neurons represent the spatial location of emotionally significant stimuli, the valence effect observed in peripheral portions of V1 in the absence of visual stimulation is consistent with the observations from anterograde tracer studies that amygdala afferents are diffusely distributed throughout V1 in macaque.

### Takotsubo syndrome and emotional stress: a heuristic approach [^e580ca14]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

While acute and reversible coronary syndrome without anatomical damage, called TakoTsubo syndrome, has been repeatedly associated with emotional stress, the specific categories of stressors have been ill-defined. Following a review of variously described emotional stressors associated with that specific cardiomyopathy, a clinical report is presented to raise two issues: the overlap of biological risk factors with emotional stress and the interplay of acute and subacute emotional stressors.

### Metabolic and feeding adjustments during pregnancy [^ecd3f050]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Eating behaviours are determined by the integration of interoceptive and environmental inputs. During pregnancy, numerous physiological adaptations take place in the maternal organism to provide an adequate environment for embryonic growth. Among them, whole-body physiological remodelling directly influences eating patterns, commonly causing notable taste perception alterations, food aversions and cravings. Recurrent food cravings for and compulsive eating of highly palatable food can contribute to the development and maintenance of gestational overweight and obesity with potential adverse health consequences for the offspring. Although much is known about how maternal eating habits influence offspring health, the mechanisms that underlie changes in taste perception and food preference during pregnancy (which guide and promote feeding) are only just starting to be elucidated. Given the limited and diffuse understanding of the neurobiology of gestational eating patterns, the aim of this Review is to compile, integrate and discuss the research conducted on this topic in both experimental models and humans. This article sheds light on the mechanisms that drive changes in female feeding behaviours during distinct physiological states. Understanding these processes is crucial to improve gestational parent health and decrease the burden of metabolic and food-related diseases in future generations.

### Spatiotemporal dynamics in human visual cortex rapidly encode the emotional content of faces [^1478d9f1]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

Although multivariate decoding is more sensitive to differences in neural responses than traditional methods, a necessary caveat of decoding‐based inference is that information relevant in classification may not be equally relevant in brain computation (Kriegeskorte, 2011). By restricting ourselves to a linear classifier, we ensure that the decoder focuses on information explicitly present in the neural activity, as the feature vector is only a linear transformation away from the neural data (King & Dehaenene, 2014; Ritchie & Carlson, 2016). However, it remains an open question whether the brain uses similar mechanisms in its own computations, whether non‐classifiable responses are otherwise represented in the brain, or indeed whether there is a causal link between such neural responses and perception or behavior.

On a similar note, patterns derived from classifier weights indicate the availability of decodable information, but it is difficult to assess the type of information used by the classifier or whether this same information is functionally relevant. However, our results are validated by existing models of emotional face processing, whereby large‐scale differences in spatial patterns over time may be elicited by different pathways involved in processing neutral and emotional/threat‐related and benign stimuli. On the other hand, the role played by individual ROIs in decoding can be interpreted as reflecting differences in neuronal population activity, as suggested by fMRI, MEG and electrophysiological investigations establishing correlations between face‐selective cell activity, the BOLD signal (Hasselmo et al. 1989; Tsao, Freiwald, Tootell, & Livingstone, 2006) and gamma oscillations (Muthukumaraswamy, & Singhgh, 2008; Perry, 2016; Perry et al. 2014). It is likely that different regions contribute different types of discriminating information and further study is needed to tease apart the underlying neural activity. While the overlap in areas between classification problems and the distributed nature of expression‐related information hint at the existence of a core system that efficiently identifies and relays emotional cues, the spatial resolution of our data is too coarse to make strong claims about the structure of this system.

### Circuit dynamics of adaptive and maladaptive behaviour [^e8a1b418]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The recent development of technologies for investigating specific components of intact biological systems has allowed elucidation of the neural circuitry underlying adaptive and maladaptive behaviours. Investigators are now able to observe and control, with high spatio-temporal resolution, structurally defined intact pathways along which electrical activity flows during and after the performance of complex behaviours. These investigations have revealed that control of projection-specific dynamics is well suited to modulating behavioural patterns that are relevant to a broad range of psychiatric diseases. Structural dynamics principles have emerged to provide diverse, unexpected and causal insights into the operation of intact and diseased nervous systems, linking form and function in the brain.

### Disruption of neural periodicity predicts clinical response after deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder [^84b05613]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

An important question raised by these results is that of a mechanistic explanation: what neurophysiological processes underlie the circadian periodicity and neural predictability that we observed that seem so closely related to clinical state? Although our data cannot answer this question, the literature suggests physiological and anatomical relationships that may be explanatory and could generate testable hypotheses for future animal or human research.

One possibility is that the 9-Hz circadian rhythm that we observed is produced by pattern generators in the hypothalamus, as are many other such rhythms. Among the most common cell types related to circadian pattern generation are the orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, which regulate not only wakefulness and arousal but also limbic processes, including fear, stress response and anxiety. Their pathological activity may induce hypervigilant states that promote fearful/avoidant behavior characteristic of the OCD symptomatic state. From the anatomical point of view, the DBS target borders the VS but may, in addition, impinge on the gray matter of the bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST), a small paired septal nucleus that, in animals, is involved in fear conditioning. Due to the direct connectivity between VS/BNST and the hypothalamus, DBS in this region may have direct physiological effects on the hypothalamus. Combining these lines of evidence, it is possible that pathological activity of pattern generators, such as orexin neurons, produces the avoidant behaviors observed in OCD concomitantly with the strongly periodic neural activity. DBS of the VS/BNST region may interfere with this lateral hypothalamic dysfunctional activity, disrupting the neural pattern and reversing behavior toward a more approachful diathesis characterized by tolerance of previous triggers and, thus, decreased OCD symptom severity.

### Orienting to fear under transient focal disruption of the human amygdala [^6f4bdb0a]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Responding to threat is under strong survival pressure, promoting the evolution of systems highly optimized for the task. Though the amygdala is implicated in 'detecting' threat, its role in the action that immediately follows-'orienting'-remains unclear. Critical to mounting a targeted response, such early action requires speed, accuracy, and resilience optimally achieved through conserved, parsimonious, dedicated systems, insured against neural loss by a parallelized functional organization. These characteristics tend to conceal the underlying substrate not only from correlative methods but also from focal disruption over time scales long enough for compensatory adaptation to take place. In a study of six patients with intracranial electrodes temporarily implanted for the clinical evaluation of focal epilepsy, we investigated gaze orienting to fear during focal, transient, unilateral direct electrical disruption of the amygdala. We showed that the amygdala is necessary for rapid gaze shifts towards faces presented in the contralateral hemifield regardless of their emotional expression, establishing its functional lateralization. Behaviourally dissociating the location of presented fear from the direction of the response, we implicated the amygdala not only in detecting contralateral faces, but also in automatically orienting specifically towards fearful ones. This salience-specific role was demonstrated within a drift-diffusion model of action to manifest as an orientation bias towards the location of potential threat. Pixel-wise analysis of target facial morphology revealed scleral exposure as its primary driver, and induced gamma oscillations-obtained from intracranial local field potentials-as its time-locked electrophysiological correlate. The amygdala is here reconceptualized as a functionally lateralized instrument of early action, reconciling previous conflicting accounts confined to detection, and revealing a neural organisation analogous to the superior colliculus, with which it is phylogenetically kin. Greater clarity on its role has the potential to guide therapeutic resection, still frequently complicated by impairments of cognition and behaviour related to threat, and inform novel focal stimulation techniques for the management of neuropsychiatric conditions.

### The subjective experience of pain: an FMRI study of percept-related models and functional connectivity [^357d0a2c]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous work suggests that the perception of pain is subjective and dependent on individual differences in physiological, emotional, and cognitive states. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) studies have used both stimulus-related (nociceptive properties) and percept-related (subjective experience of pain) models to identify the brain networks associated with pain. Our objective was to identify the network involved in processing subjective pain during cold stimuli.

Methods

The current FMRI study directly contrasted a stimulus-related model with a percept-related model during blocks of cold pain stimuli in healthy adults. Specifically, neuronal activation was modelled as a function of changes in stimulus intensity vs as a function of increasing/decreasing levels of subjective pain corresponding to changes in pain ratings. In addition, functional connectivity analyses were conducted to examine intrinsic correlations between three proposed subnetworks (sensory/discriminative, affective/motivational, and cognitive/evaluative) involved in pain processing.

Results

The percept-related model captured more extensive activation than the stimulus-related model and demonstrated an association between higher subjective pain and activation in expected cortical (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC] extending into pre-supplementary motor area) and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) areas. Moreover, connectivity results supported the posited roles of dACC and insula as key relay sites during neural processing of subjective pain. In particular, anterior insula appeared to link sensory/discriminative regions with regions in the other subnetworks, and dACC appeared to serve as a hub for affective/motivational, cognitive/evaluative, and motor subnetworks.

Conclusions

Using a percept-related model, brain regions involved in the processing of subjective pain during the application of cold stimuli were identified. Connectivity analyses identified linkages between key subnetworks involved in processing subjective pain.

### Different multidimensional representations across the amygdalo-prefrontal network during an approach-avoidance task [^addb44cd]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

The prelimbic (PL) area and basolateral amygdala (lateral [LA] and basolateral [BL] nuclei) have closely related functions and similar extrinsic connectivity. Reasoning that the computational advantage of such redundancy should be reflected in differences in how these structures represent information, we compared the coding properties of PL and amygdala neurons during a task that requires rats to produce different conditioned defensive or appetitive behaviors. Rather than unambiguous regional differences in the identities of the variables encoded, we found gradients in how the same variables are represented. Whereas PL and BL neurons represented many different parameters through minor variations in firing rates, LA cells coded fewer task features with stronger changes in activity. At the population level, whereas valence could be easily distinguished from amygdala activity, PL neurons could distinguish both valence and trial identity as well as or better than amygdala neurons. Thus, PL has greater representational capacity.

### Can we define and characterize the aging lower urinary tract?-ICI-RS 2015 [^a659b217]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms increases with age but the etiology is unknown. This article aims to identify research directions that clarify the basis of this association. The initial question is whether biological age is the variable of interest or a time-dependent accumulation of factors that impact on LUT function at rates that differ between individuals. In particular, the accumulation of conditions or agents due to inflammatory states or tissue ischemia is important. Much of the above has been concerned with changes to bladder function and morphology. However, the outflow tract function is also affected, in particular changes to the function of external sphincter skeletal muscle and associated sacral motor nerve control. Nocturia is a cardinal symptom of LUT dysfunction and is more prevalent with aging. Urine production is determined by diurnal changes to the production of certain hormones as well as arterial blood pressure and such diurnal rhythms are blunted in subjects with nocturia, but the causal links remain to be elucidated. Changes to the central nervous control of LUT function with age are also increasingly recognized, whether in mid-brain/brainstem regions that directly affect LUT function or in higher centers that determine psycho-social and emotional factors impinging on the LUT. In particular, the linkage between increasing white matter hyperintensities and LUT dysfunction during aging is recognized but not understood. Overall, a more rational approach is being developed to link LUT dysfunction with factors that accumulate with age, however, the precise causal pathways remain to be characterized. Neurourol.

### Direction-and rate-dependent fractionation during atrial fibrillation persistence: unmasking cardiac anisotropy? [^396ff8f5]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2 Increased pacing frequency decreases transverse conduction velocity

Animal studies have shown that the ratio between longitudinal and transverse conduction velocity (ie, anisotropy ratio) is rate‐dependent, with higher stimulation rates resulting in an increased anisotropy ratio due to a relative decrease in transverse conduction velocity. 2, 7 The sudden decay in transverse conduction velocity could not be accounted for by any changes in the action potential and was fully reversible upon decreases of pacing rate, 7 and therefore must be due to a change in intercellular coupling (ie, gap junctional conductance). Although all gap junctions regardless of directionality will be affected, longitudinal propagation velocity retains due to its relative insensitivity to decreases in coupling. 7, 11 Intercellular coupling is thus susceptible to modulation by rate, even within the course of a few action potentials. 2, 7 In our patient, an increase in pacing frequency induced presence of low‐amplitude, multiphasic atrial potentials with long durations, which was likely caused by an increase in intercellular coupling resistance and led to inhomogeneous and slow conduction. Partially similar findings were presented in bipolar recordings, 12 although especially the potential duration delays observed within this case are exceptional.

Importantly, during premature stimulation both longitudinal and transverse conduction velocity decrease proportionally, whereas increasing the pacing frequency primarily induces an exponential decay of transverse conduction velocity. 2, 7 So although closely related, the sudden appearance of fractionated potentials during premature impulses as well as during an increased pacing rate are caused by two distinct phenomena: the direction‐ and rate‐dependency of anisotropic conduction, respectively.

3.3 Clinical importance

Pacing with different rates and from different sites could aid in identifying nonuniform anisotropic tissue and thus the substrate of AF. Furthermore, substrate‐guided AF ablation techniques that are used in clinical practice — such as low‐voltage ablation and ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms — use thresholds that do not take into account direction‐ and rate‐dependency of (nonuniform) anisotropic tissue.

### Time course of the subjective emotional response to aversive pictures: relevance to fMRI studies [^9a4b5a7d]. Psychiatry Research (2001). Low credibility.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activity related to the experience of emotion presents unique challenges to neuroscientists. One important consideration arises when an experimentally induced subjective emotional response persists after the end of the emotional stimulation epoch. In this case, brain activity related to the emotional response may continue during the subsequent control or comparison epoch. The comparison epoch of the experiment may then contain a lingering emotional response. This study was conducted to better understand the time course of the subjective emotional response to intensely aversive pictures, with the goal of applying this knowledge to the design and analysis of fMRI studies of emotion. A total of 18 women in two separate experiments were shown a series of aversive, neutral and scrambled pictures presented in alternating block designs. Subjects rated the intensity of their negative feelings every 4 s while viewing the pictures. Results indicate that the subjective emotional response persists well after the end of the emotional stimulation epoch. Following a 16-s block of aversive pictures, an average of an additional 16 s elapsed before self-reported negative feelings showed a 74–80% decline. These data suggest that fMRI studies of emotion should consider the time course of the subjective response to emotionally laden stimuli.

### Separable neural signals for reward and emotion prediction errors [^2da9f0ea]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our data also suggests that affective experiences habituate with repeated experiences, giving rise to smaller prediction errors over time. The consequence of blunted affective responses through experience (i.e. reduced prediction errors) means that the emotional experiences of an initial interaction with a social partner is amplified compared to subsequent encounters. This pattern is consistent with normative prescriptions for learning in uncertain and dynamic environments –, highlighting the possibility that the attenuation of affective experience might serve an important role in optimizing learning under uncertainty. Our results underscore the complexity of social behaviors, which likely relies on multiple signals — monetary rewards, affective experiences, and their violations. There could of course be other candidate variables that are interrelated, such as confidenceor state uncertainty estimation. This is supported by the fact that neural ERPs were largely predicted by unsigned PEs, which reflect the magnitude of the PE, regardless of sign. This opens avenues for future research to investigate the neural mechanisms by which unsigned PEs are transformed into signed PEs. While we emphasize the importance of affect in learning, we think future work could manipulate a broader array of factors that influence normative learning dynamics, such as outcome stochasticity, volatility, and temporal structure.

By taking the simple, albeit innovative, step of incorporating emotion as an error signal into a framework, we reveal the importance of affective PEs in driving social learning. With the precise temporal neural time course of EEG, we provide evidence for early processing of reward PEs and the later processing of affective PEs when learning about other people. Although violations of emotion expectations are integrated relatively late in the decision process, they most strongly predict social choice — providing evidence of a neurobiologically plausible separate emotion error signal.

### Pathological laughing and crying in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is related to frontal cortex function [^a3a9711a]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of pathological laughing and crying (PLC) is characterized by episodes of involuntary outbursts of emotional expression. Although this phenomenon has been referred to for over a century, a clear-cut clinical definition is still lacking, and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. In particular, it remains ill-defined which kind of stimuli-contextually appropriate or inappropriate-elicit episodes of PLC, and if the phenomenon is a result of a lack of inhibition from the frontal cortex ("top-down-theory") or due to an altered processing of sensory inputs at the brainstem level ("bottom-up-theory"). To address these questions, we studied ten amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with PLC and ten controls matched for age, sex and education. Subjects were simultaneously exposed to either emotionally congruent or incongruent visual and auditory stimuli and were asked to rate pictures according to their emotional quality. Changes in physiological parameters (heart rate, galvanic skin response, activity of facial muscles) were recorded, and a standardized self-assessment lability score (CNS-LS) was determined. Patients were influenced in their rating behaviour in a negative direction by mood-incongruent music. Compared to controls, they were influenced by negative stimuli, i.e. they rated neutral pictures more negatively when listening to sad music. Patients rated significantly higher on the CNS-LS. In patients, changes of electromyographic activity of mimic muscles during different emotion-eliciting conditions were explained by frontal cortex dysfunction. We conclude that PLC is associated with altered emotional suggestibility and that it is preferentially elicited by mood-incongruent stimuli. In addition, physiological reactions as well as behavioural changes suggest that this phenomenon is primarily an expression of reduced inhibitory activity of the frontal cortex, since frontal dysfunction could explain changes in physiological parameters in the patient group. We consider these findings being important for the clinical interpretation of emotional reactions of ALS patients.

### Default mode network shows distinct emotional and contextual responses yet common effects of retrieval demands across tasks [^2992c48f]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The default mode network (DMN) lies towards the heteromodal end of the principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity, maximally separated from the sensory-motor cortex. It supports memory-based cognition, including the capacity to retrieve conceptual and evaluative information from sensory inputs, and to generate meaningful states internally; however, the functional organisation of DMN that can support these distinct modes of retrieval remains unclear. We used fMRI to examine whether activation within subsystems of DMN differed as a function of retrieval demands, or the type of association to be retrieved, or both. In a picture association task, participants retrieved semantic associations that were either contextual or emotional in nature. Participants were asked to avoid generating episodic associations. In the generate phase, these associations were retrieved from a novel picture, while in the switch phase, participants retrieved a new association for the same image. Semantic context and emotion trials were associated with dissociable DMN subnetworks, indicating that a key dimension of DMN organisation relates to the type of association being accessed. The frontotemporal and medial temporal DMN showed a preference for emotional and semantic contextual associations, respectively. Relative to the generate phase, the switch phase recruited clusters closer to the heteromodal apex of the principal gradient-a cortical hierarchy separating unimodal and heteromodal regions. There were no differences in this effect between association types. Instead, memory switching was associated with a distinct subnetwork associated with controlled internal cognition. These findings delineate distinct patterns of DMN recruitment for different kinds of associations yet common responses across tasks that reflect retrieval demands.

### Layer-specific, retinotopically-diffuse modulation in human visual cortex in response to viewing emotionally expressive faces [^1c186a05]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Viewing faces that are perceived as emotionally expressive evokes enhanced neural responses in multiple brain regions, a phenomenon thought to depend critically on the amygdala. This emotion-related modulation is evident even in primary visual cortex (V1), providing a potential neural substrate by which emotionally salient stimuli can affect perception. How does emotional valence information, computed in the amygdala, reach V1? Here we use high-resolution functional MRI to investigate the layer profile and retinotopic distribution of neural activity specific to emotional facial expressions. Across three experiments, human participants viewed centrally presented face stimuli varying in emotional expression and performed a gender judgment task. We found that facial valence sensitivity was evident only in superficial cortical layers and was not restricted to the retinotopic location of the stimuli, consistent with diffuse feedback-like projections from the amygdala. Together, our results provide a feedback mechanism by which the amygdala directly modulates activity at the earliest stage of visual processing.

### Orienting to fear under transient focal disruption of the human amygdala [^faf72d13]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Drawing on an experimental framework that uniquely enables transient focal disruption of function, here we reconcile conflicting accounts of the role of the amygdala in responding to fear, and provide a putative mechanism for fast, emotional expression-directed orienting. By disentangling distinct components of detection and orientation, and modelling top-down, presumptively cortex-mediated competing effects, we reveal the role of the amygdala to be neither purely sensory nor purely motor, but a context-dependent combination of the two.

The observation of contralateral disruption-induced delay in orienting to any face, regardless of expression, confirms the amygdala's hemifield specificity. The use of hemifield specific stimuli, and disruption too brief to be compensated by plasticity-dependent adaptation, addresses criticisms levied at discordant observations in humans with unilateral chronic amygdala lesions, where lateralization effects may have been masked by neural adaptation, obscured by cortical collaterals, or confounded by attentional biases. Our findings instead cohere with non-human primate anatomy, and with neurophysiological evidence of entrainment to contralateral low-level visual stimuli.

We show that a discernible specificity for fear emerges only when the behavioural task dissociates rapidly detecting a contralateral fearful face from automatically orienting towards it. A drift-diffusion framework explains these responses as an amygdala-mediated early bias towards emotionally salient contralateral objects obscured by parallel, slower but potentially more accurate (putatively cortical) detection mechanisms our Oppose manipulation decouples. This reconciles the observation of amygdala-dependent impaired early detection of faces regardless of their emotional valencewith maintenance of specific — even if delayed — fear recognition via parallel pathways.

High-resolution analysis of the facial features driving fast orienting confirms the decisive influence of scleral exposure, narrowing it to fast responses. High gamma activity within the amygdala preceding contralateral orientation suggests anticipatory neural activitythat may bias the subsequent choice of target.

The synoptic picture that emerges from these results is of a fast, spatially-specific amygdala-centred pathway primarily tasked with rapid orienting to manifestations of fear in the immediate environment.

### Microstructural white matter changes in euthymic bipolar patients: a whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging study [^90fa21af]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Brain structures of a distributed ventral-limbic and dorsal brain network have been associated with altered mood states and emotion regulation in affective disorders. So far, diffusion tensor imaging studies in bipolar patients have focused on frontal/prefrontal brain regions and found alterations in white matter integrity in manic, depressed, and euthymic bipolar patients, observed as changes in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. To extend previous findings, we investigated whole-brain modifications in white matter integrity in euthymic bipolar patients with minimal manic and depressive symptoms.

Methods

Twenty-two patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of bipolar I and II disorder in remission, with no lifetime or present comorbidities of substance abuse, and 21 sex- and age-matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging with diffusion gradients applied along 41 directions. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity group differences were explored using two voxel-based, whole-brain analyses that differ in their normalization approaches.

Results

Fractional anisotropy was significantly increased in bipolar patients relative to healthy controls in medial frontal, precentral, inferior parietal, and occipital white matter. No group differences in mean diffusivity were found.

Conclusions

The result of increased fractional anisotropy in euthymic bipolar patients in the present study suggests increased directional coherence of white matter fibers in bipolar patients during remission.

### Preventing childhood toxic stress: partnering with families and communities to promote relational health [^8df51f12]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Childhood toxic stress and biomarkers — ACE scores and other epidemiologically derived risk factors at the population level are "not valid or reliable predictors of outcomes at the individual level". Toxic stress responses are described as physiologic responses to adversity that are "large, chronic, and unmitigated by social-emotional buffers", and "toxic stress, by contrast, refers to an individual's physiologic response to these adversities". These responses "are known to alter multiple systems that interact in a reciprocal and dynamic manner", and biomarkers of this response "have the potential to be more sensitive and specific measures of experienced adversity at the individual level". The article adds that "validated biomarkers also offer transformational potential as measures of responsiveness to specific interventions", and "the pediatric research community is hoping to develop clinic-friendly, noninvasive biomarkers for different forms and degrees of adversity".

### Hippocampus-based behavioral, structural, and molecular dynamics across the estrous cycle [^f8979c14]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

The activity of neurons in the rodent hippocampus contributes to diverse behaviors, with the activity of ventral hippocampal neurons affecting behaviors related to anxiety and emotion regulation, and the activity of dorsal hippocampal neurons affecting performance in learning- and memory-related tasks. Hippocampal cells also express receptors for ovarian hormones, estrogen and progesterone, and are therefore affected by physiological fluctuations of those hormones that occur over the rodent estrous cycle. In this review, we discuss the effects of cycling ovarian hormones on hippocampal physiology. Starting with behavior, we explore the role of the estrous cycle in regulating hippocampus-dependent behaviors. We go on to detail the cellular mechanisms through which cycling estrogen and progesterone, through changes in the structural and functional properties of hippocampal neurons, may be eliciting these changes in behavior. Then, providing a basis for these cellular changes, we outline the epigenetic, chromatin regulatory mechanisms through which ovarian hormones, by binding to their receptors, can affect the regulation of behavior- and synaptic plasticity-related genes in hippocampal neurons. We also highlight an unconventional role that chromatin dynamics may have in regulating neuronal function across the estrous cycle, including in sex hormone-driven X chromosome plasticity and hormonally-induced epigenetic priming. Finally, we discuss directions for future studies and the translational value of the rodent estrous cycle for understanding the effects of the human menstrual cycle on hippocampal physiology and brain disease risk.

### Dynamic functional connectivity and individual differences in emotions during social stress [^7eb75600]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure to acute stress induces multiple emotional responses, each with their own unique temporal dynamics. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) measures the temporal variability of network synchrony and captures individual differences in network neurodynamics. This study investigated the relationship between dFC and individual differences in emotions induced by an acute psychosocial stressor. Sixteen healthy adult women underwent fMRI scanning during a social evaluative threat (SET) task, and retrospectively completed questionnaires that assessed individual differences in subjectively experienced positive and negative emotions about stress and stress relief during the task. Group dFC was decomposed with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) into 10 components, each with a temporal signature, spatial network of functionally connected regions, and vector of participant loadings that captures individual differences in dFC. Participant loadings of two networks were positively correlated with stress-related emotions, indicating the existence of networks for positive and negative emotions. The emotion-related networks involved the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala, among other distributed brain regions, and time signatures for these emotion-related networks were uncorrelated. These findings demonstrate that individual differences in stress-induced positive and negative emotions are each uniquely associated with large-scale brain networks, and suggest that dFC is a mechanism that generates individual differences in the emotional components of the stress response.

### Stress, psychiatric disease, and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^ac014233]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Acute and chronic stress responses — Short-term metabolic responses to increased norepinephrine and epinephrine include a potential increase in glucose levels via increased insulin resistance, increased hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and increased adipose tissue lipolysis, increasing readily available nutrient fuels. Acute "fight or flight" reactions include cardiopulmonary responses such as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased heart contractility, and bronchial dilation. Psychosocial stress can have unfavorable effects including an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events and increased respiratory rate leading to dyspnea. While acute stress is usually associated with decreased hunger, it may contribute to emotional eating, especially for those with underlying chronic mental stress. Chronic mental stress can elicit longer-term "submit and stay" hormonal responses and can lead to increased anxiety and depression, behavior change, diminished cognition, poor sleep patterns, and reduced tolerance to pain.
