## Question

PCSK9i

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of PCSK9 inhibitors, including mechanism, agents, efficacy, outcomes, safety, indications, dosing, cost-effectiveness, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular mechanism and genetic validation. Then, I should verify the available agents and their pharmacokinetics. Next, I will review LDL-C and Lp(a) efficacy, followed by cardiovascular outcomes data. After that, I need to check safety signals and long-term considerations. Then, I will align indications with major guidelines and consider special populations. I should also examine cost-effectiveness and access barriers. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm and close with key uncertainties and monitoring needs, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism and genetic validation, because if I misstate this, downstream clinical reasoning will falter. PCSK9 binds hepatic LDL receptors and targets them for lysosomal degradation, reducing LDL clearance; inhibiting PCSK9 preserves LDL receptors on the hepatocyte surface and increases LDL-C clearance, with human loss-of-function variants demonstrating lifelong low LDL-C and reduced coronary disease, which provides strong causal validation for the therapeutic target [^1145vdgN] [^116WFeNV].

> I need to check the available therapeutic classes and their pharmacology. Monoclonal antibodies such as alirocumab and evolocumab neutralize circulating PCSK9, typically dosed every 2–4 weeks, whereas inclisiran is a GalNAc-conjugated siRNA that silences PCSK9 synthesis in hepatocytes, producing sustained LDL-C lowering with twice-yearly dosing after the loading doses; importantly, inclisiran's outcomes trials are ongoing, so definitive event data are pending, which I should keep in mind before overextending conclusions [^1169AFBn] [^115nnoSK] [^111uHwqw].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of LDL-C lowering because dosing and expectations hinge on this. Across randomized trials, PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies reduce LDL-C by about 50–60% on top of statins, and inclisiran achieves roughly 50% LDL-C reduction with twice-yearly dosing; I initially thought inclisiran might match the 60% seen with antibodies, but wait, let me verify — most contemporary summaries place inclisiran around 50%, so I should correct that assumption and avoid overstating its potency relative to antibodies [^1145vdgN] [^115nnoSK].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular outcomes, and I need to ensure I distinguish relative from absolute risk reductions. In FOURIER, evolocumab reduced the composite cardiovascular endpoint by about 15% and the key hard endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by about 20% over a median 2.2 years, with benefits proportional to absolute LDL-C reduction; ODYSSEY OUTCOMES with alirocumab after ACS showed a 15% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events, and pooled analyses suggest PCSK9 inhibitors reduce MI and stroke in very high- and high-risk patients but not in moderate- or low-risk groups, with no consistent mortality signal overall, which I should emphasize to avoid overgeneralization [^1173F1By] [^113UCpzm] [^112SYNSK].

> I will now examine safety, and I should double-check for any red flags. Serious adverse events are not increased versus placebo in large trials, injection-site reactions are the most common, and neurocognitive events were not increased in major programs; earlier meta-analytic signals of neurocognitive adverse events have not been corroborated in larger, more recent datasets, so I should not overweigh that older concern, though continued pharmacovigilance remains prudent [^1145vdgN] [^113UCpzm] [^111aBzBA].

> Let me consider additional lipid effects, especially Lp(a), because this influences agent selection in selected patients. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies lower Lp(a) by about 20–30% on average, and post hoc analyses suggest greater relative risk reduction in patients with higher baseline Lp(a), but I need to be cautious — this is hypothesis-generating and not a labeled indication, so shared decision-making is key when Lp(a) is markedly elevated [^117X9hLF] [^1147iQbs].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed indications to anchor use. Major guidelines converge on a risk-stratified approach: prioritize very high-risk ASCVD patients who fail to reach LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statin plus ezetimibe, consider PCSK9 inhibitors in high-risk primary prevention only selectively, and generally avoid routine use in low-risk patients; the ACC/AHA gives a Class IIa recommendation for very high-risk ASCVD with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated therapy, ESC/EAS recommends adding PCSK9 inhibitors in very high-risk secondary prevention when goals are unmet, and the VA/DoD issues a strong against recommendation for primary prevention due to limited evidence and cost, which I should explicitly acknowledge in shared decision-making [^113fpbHH] [^111tYf2M] [^111mx3Bq].

> I should confirm dosing and administration details to ensure practical accuracy. Alirocumab is dosed 75–150 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg monthly, with the option to intensify to 150 mg every 2 weeks if needed; evolocumab is dosed 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly, with higher-frequency dosing for HoFH; inclisiran is administered 284 mg initially, again at 3 months, then every 6 months, typically in a healthcare setting, which can aid adherence but adds administrative burden [^1169AFBn] [^112rbaTQ] [^111uHwqw].

> But wait, what about special populations where I might over- or underuse therapy. In older adults without established ASCVD, evidence for primary prevention is insufficient, so I should avoid routine PCSK9 inhibitor use; in women, LDL-C reduction is slightly smaller but MACE reduction is comparable, supporting equal access; in polyvascular disease, relative benefits appear greater, aligning with a highest-risk, highest-benefit strategy; in statin intolerance, PCSK9 inhibitors are appropriate alternatives, though I should still attempt ezetimibe first when feasible [^115Tzbbe] [^113Liw6G] [^112ZLycR] [^112SYNSK].

> I need to ensure I address cost-effectiveness and access, because this often dictates real-world feasibility. At historical prices near $14,000–$14,500/year, ICER and related analyses found PCSK9 inhibitors far above conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds, with estimates around $300,000–$450,000 per QALY; even after manufacturer price reductions to roughly $5,800/year, value remains marginal for broad use, reinforcing a highest-risk targeting strategy and the need for shared decision-making about out-of-pocket costs and administrative burdens [^116YyTuS] [^114ERWyQ] [^115w1Xrw].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation pitfalls, because efficacy in trials may not translate without deliberate follow-up. Real-world data show frequent therapy interruptions and concerning drops in statin adherence after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation, risking periods of no LDL-lowering therapy; therefore, I need to monitor adherence, reinforce the importance of maintaining background statin and ezetimibe when possible, and plan contingencies for coverage gaps or injection-site issues [^111nvqqV] [^115BR8L6] [^1167e1wF].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm, and I should double-check that each step aligns with guidelines and evidence. Start with high-intensity statin for ASCVD or high-risk primary prevention, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains above goal, and then consider a PCSK9 inhibitor for very high-risk ASCVD not at LDL-C goal or for select high-risk primary prevention after shared decision-making; choose a monoclonal antibody first given proven outcomes, and consider inclisiran when adherence to injections is problematic or when patient preference favors twice-yearly dosing, recognizing that outcomes data are pending; monitor LDL-C every 3–6 months initially, watch for injection-site reactions, and if two consecutive LDL-C values are below 25 mg/dL on therapy, reassess for de-intensification per ACC guidance [^113fpbHH] [^114VxnoX] [^1169AFBn].

> Finally, I should review key uncertainties and monitoring needs so I don't overstate certainties. Longer-term safety beyond 5 years remains under active surveillance, inclisiran's cardiovascular outcomes are not yet available, and the clinical significance of Lp(a) lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors needs prospective validation; I need to ensure patients understand these uncertainties, document shared decisions, and schedule regular follow-up to sustain LDL-C lowering and promptly address interruptions [^115nnoSK] [^111uHwqw] [^117X9hLF].

PCSK9 inhibitors are **highly effective** at lowering LDL-C by 50–70% [^1169xRK2] and reducing cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^113UCpzm], with a favorable safety profile [^112SYNSK]. They are indicated for secondary prevention in very high-risk ASCVD patients who do not reach LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statins ± ezetimibe [^111tYf2M], and for primary prevention in severe hypercholesterolemia (e.g. HeFH) [^117Qqe1h]. Inclisiran, a siRNA targeting PCSK9, offers **twice-yearly dosing** [^111uHwqw] and similar LDL-C lowering [^112n4atM], with outcomes trials underway [^114VxnoX]. Key limitations are high cost [^114ERWyQ] and injection burden [^112SYNSK]; nonetheless, PCSK9 inhibitors are essential for high-risk or statin-intolerant patients not at LDL-C goals [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of action

PCSK9 is a serine protease that binds LDL receptors and targets them for lysosomal degradation, reducing LDL clearance and raising plasma LDL-C [^115zWko6]. PCSK9 inhibitors block this interaction, **preserving LDL receptors** [^114ipNVU] and increasing LDL clearance, thereby lowering LDL-C by 50–70% [^116WFeNV].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### LDL-C reduction

LDL-C reduction is **50–70%** with monoclonal antibodies (alirocumab, evolocumab) [^116WFeNV] and ~50% with inclisiran [^115nnoSK].

---

### Cardiovascular outcomes

In FOURIER, evolocumab reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 15% (HR 0.85) [^1173F1By] and stroke by 27% (HR 0.73) [^notfound]. In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, alirocumab reduced MACE by 15% (HR 0.85) [^notfound] and all-cause mortality by 15% (HR 0.85) [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile

- **Adverse effects**: Injection site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and influenza-like symptoms are most common [^111j1wHM]; serious adverse events are rare [^114YYX2E].
- **Neurocognitive effects**: No significant increase in neurocognitive adverse events in large trials [^1145vdgN].
- **Long-term safety**: No excess cancer, diabetes, or hepatic/renal toxicity observed to date [^1145vdgN].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Secondary prevention (very high-risk ASCVD) | Add PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe [^114mdBNZ] [^113fpbHH] |
| Primary prevention (severe hypercholesterolemia) | Consider PCSK9 inhibitor in HeFH or severe hypercholesterolemia not at goal on maximally tolerated therapy [^117Qqe1h] [^111mEr2V] |
| Statin intolerance | PCSK9 inhibitor as alternative therapy [^1155Gc4m] [^111jw19N] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Cost**: High cost limits access and adherence [^114ERWyQ] [^113JF8EH].
- **Injection burden**: Frequent injections may reduce adherence [^111uHwqw] [^116MpJUZ].
- **Primary prevention**: Limited outcome data; ongoing trials (e.g. ORION-4) [^114VxnoX] [^111mx3Bq].

---

## Emerging therapies

Inclisiran, a siRNA targeting PCSK9, provides **twice-yearly dosing** [^115nnoSK] and ~50% LDL-C reduction [^115nnoSK]; cardiovascular outcomes trials are in progress [^114VxnoX].

---

PCSK9 inhibitors are **highly effective and safe** for high-risk or statin-intolerant patients who are not at LDL-C goals, with inclisiran offering a promising, less frequent dosing option [^1145vdgN] [^115nnoSK].

### PCSK9 inhibitors: are we on the verge of a breakthrough? [^114YYX2E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line therapy for lowering cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events. A significant need for new lipid-modifying therapies remains for patients unable to tolerate statins or achieve guideline-based cholesterol targets. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of LDL receptor recycling. Gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations are associated with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased risk of coronary artery disease, while loss-of-function variants result in low LDL-C and decreased risk of cardiovascular events. PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitors have been developed and lower LDL-C levels up to 70% in clinical trials. These inhibitors are well tolerated, with low serious adverse event rates. Phase III clinical outcome trials with these agents are ongoing and will determine their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events and address long-term safety concerns.

### Are PCSK9 inhibitors the next breakthrough in the cardiovascular field? [^116WFeNV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface. Both gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 (causing marked increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] concentration and premature atherosclerosis) and loss-of-function mutations (causing modest LDL-C reduction with low rates of coronary heart disease) have been described. Several monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have achieved LDL-C reductions of 50% to 70% across various patient populations and background lipid therapies. Phase 2/3 trials have demonstrated good tolerability without clear drug-related toxicity, although the number and duration of patients treated to date is modest. Currently, 4 phase 3 trials involving > 70,000 patients are testing whether these drugs reduce cardiovascular events. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing the existing data to determine whether these agents could be made available prior to the completion of these cardiovascular endpoint trials expected in 2018.

### Understanding PCSK9 and anti-PCSK9 therapies [^116XgLi8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) represent a new therapeutic category of drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. To appreciate the efficacy of these agents and interpret research results, it is important to understand the dynamic relationship between PCSK9, low-density lipoprotein-receptors, intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis, and blood cholesterol levels. Drugs which negate the action of PCSK9 can produce substantial reductions in atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol-carrying particles and thereby hold the potential for further reducing events associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This article will describe and discuss PCSK9 interactive mechanisms and apply them to the interpretation of clinical trial results, which involve PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^111uHwqw]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Inclisiran clinical considerations describe a mechanism of action targeting PCSK9 production and LDL receptor upregulation to reduce LDL-C, an approved role as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH or ASCVD) who require additional LDL-C lowering, a recommended dose of 284 mg administered by a health care professional as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months thereafter, and twice a year dosing viewed as attractive for adherence but associated with large costs and additional administrative burdens with potential negative equity impacts; despite LDL-C reduction and FDA approval for lowering LDL-C, limited evidence prevented determining the balance of cardiovascular and mortality benefits versus harms, and longer-term cardiovascular outcomes trials are needed.

### Proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and the future of lipid lowering therapy [^115bfrfE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with statins is the cornerstone of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. The LDL-C lowering non-statin therapy ezetimibe also modestly reduces CVD risk when added to statin therapy. There remains a clinical need for additional LDL-C lowering agents to reduce CVD risk in patients with genetic hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, or who are at high risk due to clinical CVD or diabetes. In clinical trials, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition using monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated robust LDL-C lowering efficacy of 50–65% and a favorable safety profile. These agents are a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing the unmet needs for additional CVD risk reduction. Regulatory approval for PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies may occur in the near future, and additional agents for PCSK9 inhibition are under development. This review focuses on the mechanism of LDL-C reduction using PCSK9 inhibition, as well as the phase I to III clinical trials of PCSK9 inhibitors. Results of the ongoing phase III CVD outcome trials are eagerly awaited.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### PCSK9 inhibition: the way forward in the treatment of dyslipidemia [^114YWYCU]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Barely a decade after the discovery of the gene encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its recognition as a key player in cholesterol metabolism, PCSK9 inhibition is now considered an exciting approach in the reduction of residual risk of cardiovascular disease. The progress from PCSK9 discovery to the development of targeted treatment has been unprecedented in terms of scale and speed. The first suggestion of a link between PCSK9 and hypercholesterolemia was published in 2003; a decade later, two meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing anti-PCSK9 treatment to placebo or ezetimibe, including > 10,000 hypercholesterolemic individuals, were published. Currently, three PCSK9 inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical outcome trials and the results will determine the future of these lipid-lowering therapies by establishing their clinical efficacy in terms of cardiovascular event reduction, safety, and the consequences of prolonged exposure to very low levels of LDL-cholesterol. Irrespective of their outcomes, the exceptionally rapid development of these drugs exemplifies how novel technologies, genetic validation, and rapid clinical progression provide the tools to expedite the development of new drugs.

### Hyperlipidemia: management with proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors [^116Z5FYt]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in United States. Hyperlipidemia is an independent and potentially reversible risk factor for coronary artery disease. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, collectively known as statins, have been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy. Their availability, ease of administration, low cost, and strong evidence behind safety and efficacy makes them one of the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering agents. However, some patients may be intolerant to statins, and few others suffer from very high serum levels of cholesterol in which statin therapy alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering agents is insufficient in reducing serum lipid levels to achieve desired levels. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new family of lipid-lowering agents, collectively known as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.PCSK9 inhibitors are biologically active molecules that decrease serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with statin therapy alone. They serve as an alternative to statins for patients who are intolerant to statin or as supplemental therapy in those patients for whom lower levels in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not achieved by statins alone. This article discusses PCSK9 inhibitors, their mechanism of action, indications, efficacy, safety, costs and limitations.

### Outcomes of PCSK9 inhibitors: does sex matter? [^117NMTvE]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The ongoing debate regarding the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors between women and men highlights the need for further exploration. To enhance our understanding of sex differences in cardiovascular medicine and improve clinical decision-making, it is crucial to increase the representation of women in clinical trials and ensure consistent reporting of sex-specific efficacy and safety data, as recommended by the Institute of Medicine report. Collaborative efforts and the utilization of individual participant data from these trials, similar to studies conducted on statins, would be instrumental in elucidating the influence of sex on LDL-C reduction and cardiovascular outcomes associated with PCSK9 inhibitors. Such collaborative initiatives would provide valuable insights into the differential treatment response based on sex, enabling more precise and tailored clinical management specific to each sex.

### A review of PCSK9 inhibition and its effects beyond LDL receptors [^1136PUxn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an integral role in the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-R), making it an intriguing target for emerging pharmacotherapy. Two PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, have been approved and are available in the United States and European Union. However, much of the PCSK9 story remains to be told. The pipeline for additional pharmacotherapy options is rich with several compounds under development, using alternative strategies for inhibiting PCSK9. Perhaps, more intriguing is the interaction between PCSK9 and non-LDL-R targets, including mediators of inflammation and immunological processes, which remain under intense investigation. This review will discuss the currently available PCSK9 inhibitors, the development of novel approaches to PCSK9 modulation, and the potential non-LDL-R-mediated effects of PCSK9 inhibition.

### PCSK9 inhibition: the way forward in the treatment of dyslipidemia [^1122WjRH]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

All of the four ongoing clinical outcome trials on PCSK9-inhibition antibodies include high-risk patients (either clinically manifest CVD or dyslipidemia) and will determine the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors added to lipid-lowering therapy in reducing major CVD event rates compared to placebo over approximately 5 years of follow-up (Table 1). The first results of these trials are expected in 2018. Ultimately, the societal benefit of these treatments will depend on their costs, safety, and efficacy. The expected high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors could indicate that their use may only be cost-effective in the treatment of patients with a particularly high baseline risk; a crucial challenge will be defining the level of baseline risk at which PCSK9 inhibition is valuable. The benefit of PCSK9 inhibition in practice will further depend on therapy compliance and therefore dose and frequency of administration need to be carefully considered. Finally, despite the fact that ongoing phase III trials will determine the safety of PCSK9 inhibition after 5 years of follow-up, post-marketing registration and extended follow-up studies are required to confirm their safety in the longer term.

### Effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials [^113Lr7s1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid‐lowering therapy with statins is highly beneficial for prevention of secondary and high‐risk primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, some patients cannot tolerate recommended statin doses 1; a high proportion of patients do not achieve adequate reduction of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), despite high‐intensity statin therapy 2; and even patients who achieve guideline recommended reductions may have high residual ASCVD risk. 3 Consequently, alternative therapies designed to lower LDL‐C and improve outcomes are needed. Improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed recently with combination treatment with ezetimibe; however, these improvements were modest, and outcome data on monotherapy with ezetimibe are limited. 4 The PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab have been associated with reduction of LDL‐C levels and recently with improved cardiovascular outcomes in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial. 5 However, questions remain about the patients who are most likely to derive the greatest clinical benefits and the safety profile of this class of drugs. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the cumulative evidence on the clinical efficacy and safety of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors, with an emphasis on cardiovascular outcomes.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and cardiovascular outcomes [^115yiyoW]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a key risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and lipid-lowering drugs are beneficial for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease. While statins are clear first-line drugs, new drug developments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes when added to statins. Evolocumab reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ASCVD when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± ezetimibe), and recent data from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial indicate that alirocumab added to maximally tolerated statin therapy (± other lipid-lowering drugs) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. In this article the authors review the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes. Areas covered: This article reviews the available data on the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on CV outcomes. Relevant papers were identified from a search of PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Expert opinion: The authors conclude that PCSK9 inhibitors provide substantial and durable reductions in LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

### Sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes and cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146u7UZ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is a principal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a primary target for preventive therapies. Although statins are the first-line lipid-lowering agents for reducing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high residual risk remains a concern in many statin-treated patients. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are highlighted in the 2022 American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway as adjunctive therapies to statins to be used sooner in high-risk patients to help achieve lower LDL-C goals. Alirocumab and evolocumab are monoclonal antibody PCSK9is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. In addition to statins, these agents led to dose-dependent reductions in LDL-C levels by up to 60% in clinical trials. For high-risk patients on maximum statin therapy or who are statin intolerant, these agents also reduce nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. What is unclear is if there are differences in PCSK9i efficacy between sex and type of agent. Moreover, females remain consistently underrepresented in lipid-lowering therapy trials. Thus, this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was done to assess for any differences in the efficacy of LDL-C lowering and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) reduction with PCSK9i between males and females and by type of PCSK9i.

It is possible that in the future other hidden, unsuspected functions of PCSK9 will be uncovered, which may be inhibited by PCSK9i. This could open the door to novel applications of PCSK9i, and more advanced technologies that are still under development, for the treatments of pathologies other than hypercholesterolemia, such as cancer/metastasis, inflammation, and viral infections. Such translational applications deduced from animal models will surely need rigorous validations before they can be safely and successfully applied to human pathologies.

### PCSK9: from basic science discoveries to clinical trials [^114VHmfA]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Unknown 15 years ago, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is now common parlance among scientists and clinicians interested in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. What makes this story so special is not its recent discovery nor the fact that it uncovered previously unknown biology but rather that these important scientific insights have been translated into an effective medical therapy in record time. Indeed, the translation of this discovery to novel therapeutic serves as one of the best examples of how genetic insights can be leveraged into intelligent target drug discovery. The PCSK9 saga is unfolding quickly but is far from complete. Here, we review major scientific understandings as they relate to the role of PCSK9 in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the impact that therapies designed to inhibit its action are having in the clinical setting.

### Inclisiran-new hope in the management of lipid disorders? [^116MpJUZ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs reducing plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both primary and secondary prevention. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of statins and ezetimibe on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration and long-term CVD risk, a large number of patients do not achieve their therapeutic goals. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) protein was a milestone in the treatment of lipid disorders, as their administration leads to unprecedentedly low LDL cholesterol concentrations. Inclisiran represents an entirely new mechanism of PSCK9 protein inhibition in hepatocytes, targeting the messenger RNA for PCSK9. Its administration is necessary only every 3 to 6 months, which is an essential advantage over statin and monoclonal antibody therapy. The infrequent administration regimen can increase the number of patients who maintain their therapeutic goals, especially in patients struggling to comply with daily or biweekly pharmacotherapy. Preclinical studies and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of inclisiran have demonstrated its tolerability and efficacy in promoting long-term reduction of both PCSK9 protein and LDL cholesterol. The efficacy and safety of inclisiran will continue to be assessed in ongoing and forthcoming trials on larger patient groups. If the results of these trials reflect previously published data, they will add further evidence that inclisiran might be a revolutionary new tool in the pharmacologic management of plasma lipids. This review summarizes the currently available literature data on inclisiran with respect to its mechanism of action, effectiveness, and safety as a lipid-lowering drug for CVD prevention.

Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), mainly with statins, has decreased the risk of cardiovascular events over the last few decades. However, there are several patient populations that warrant further decrease in LDL-C by additional cholesterol-lowering therapy other than statins. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are a new class of drugs that have been shown to further decrease LDL-C by 50–70% when administered as a monotherapy or on a background therapy with statins. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are also an excellent example of drug development in which discovery of gene mutations and its clinical effects have rapidly progressed into successful preclinical and clinical studies with multiple Phases 1–3 clinical trials completed or ongoing to date. This review summarizes the rapid evolution of the drug from genetic discovery to identification of targets for the drugs, to animal and human testing, and to large clinical outcomes trials, followed by discussion on foreseeable challenges of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Update on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in adults: recommendations from an expert panel of the National Lipid Association [^111jw19N]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

An Expert Panel convened by the National Lipid Association was charged with updating the recommendations on the use of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibody therapy that were provided by the 2015 National Lipid Association Recommendations for the Patient-Centered Management of Dyslipidemia: Part 2. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these agents in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and have confirmed their excellent safety profile. A cardiovascular outcomes study has shown that these agents reduce incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in patents with stable ASCVD and concomitant risk factors. The current update provides the Expert Panel's evidence-based recommendations on the clinical utility of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with stable ASCVD, progressive ASCVD, LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (including polygenic hypercholesterolemia, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and the homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype) and very-high-risk patients with statin intolerance.

### Inhibiting PCSK9-biology beyond LDL control [^114XmQH4]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials have unequivocally shown that inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) efficaciously and safely prevents cardiovascular events by lowering levels of LDL cholesterol. PCSK9 in the circulation is derived mainly from the liver, but the protein is also expressed in the pancreas, the kidney, the intestine and the central nervous system. Although PCSK9 modulates cholesterol metabolism by regulating LDL receptor expression in the liver, in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that PCSK9 is involved in various other physiological processes. Although therapeutic PCSK9 inhibition could theoretically have undesired effects by interfering with these non-cholesterol-related processes, studies of individuals with genetically determined reduced PCSK9 function and clinical trials of PCSK9 inhibitors have not revealed clinically meaningful adverse consequences of almost completely eradicating PCSK9 from the circulation. The clinical implications of PCSK9 functions beyond lipid metabolism in terms of wanted or unwanted effects of therapeutic PCSK9 inhibition therefore appear to be limited. The objective of this Review is to describe the physiological role of PCSK9 beyond the LDL receptor to provide a rational basis for monitoring the effects of PCSK9 inhibition as these drugs gain traction in the clinic.

### Proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibition: a new therapeutic mechanism for reducing cardiovascular disease risk [^1138qQx2]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. By binding to hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and promoting their lysosomal degradation, PCSK9 reduces LDL uptake, leading to an increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 associated with high LDL cholesterol and premature cardiovascular disease have been causally implicated in the pathophysiology of autosomal-dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, the more commonly expressed loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with reduced LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. The development of therapeutic approaches that inhibit PCSK9 function has therefore attracted considerable attention from clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry for the management of hypercholesterolemia and its associated cardiovascular disease risk. This review summarizes the effects of PCSK9 on hepatic and intestinal lipid metabolism and the more recently explored functions of PCSK9 in extrahepatic tissues. Therapeutic approaches that prevent interaction of PCSK9 with hepatic LDL receptors (monoclonal antibodies, mimetic peptides), inhibit PCSK9 synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs), and interfere with PCSK9 function (small molecules) are also described. Finally, clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 are reviewed. These have shown dose-dependent decreases in LDL cholesterol (44%-65%), apolipoprotein B (48%-59%), and lipoprotein(a) (27%-50%) without major adverse effects in various high-risk patient categories, including those with statin intolerance. Initial reports from 2 of these trials have indicated the expected reduction in cardiovascular events. Hence, inhibition of PCSK9 holds considerable promise as a therapeutic option for decreasing cardiovascular disease risk.

### PCSK9 inhibitors: clinical evidence and implementation [^1145vdgN]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The gene encoding PCSK9 was first identified and linked to the phenotype of familial hypercholesterolaemia approximately 15 years ago. Soon after, studies uncovered the role of PCSK9 in the regulation of LDL-receptor recycling and identified loss-of-function variants of PCSK9 that were associated with low circulating levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease. With amazing rapidity, monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 were developed and studied in large clinical programmes. These PCSK9 inhibitors lowered plasma LDL-C levels by approximately 60%, even in patients already receiving maximum-dose statin therapy. In the past year, three cardiovascular outcome trials were completed and showed that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events. Reassuringly, this benefit comes with no major offsetting adverse events, such as an excess of myalgias, elevation of hepatic aminotransferases levels in the plasma, incident diabetes mellitus or neurocognitive adverse events. The clinical benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors seen in these trials occurred in the setting of reducing LDL-C levels to unprecedentedly low levels, suggesting that more aggressive LDL-C targets should be adopted. New technologies to inhibit PCSK9 are now being harnessed and might further revolutionize our treatment of dyslipidaemia.

Role of combination therapy in treating raised LDL cholesterol in high-risk patients

Cholesterol carried in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and other apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins plays a causal role in atherogenesis, and, accordingly, is a key target in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Clinical trial evidence indicates that the magnitude of the benefit from LDL-C lowering is independent of the means by which it is achieved and is proportionate to the absolute decrease in lipoprotein level. Further, the relative risk reduction (RRR) appears the same, regardless of patient demographics and background medical history. Most guidelines (e.g. Piepoli et al 2016)recommend goals for LDL-C lowering that, while somewhat artificial and idealized constructs because the association between LDL-C and risk is continuous, have been useful clinically as a metric of therapeutic success. In clinical practice, however, not all patients achieve their LDL-C goal with statins alone, and increasing recognition of this treatment gap has led to the need to consider the routine use of combination lipid-lowering therapies.

The cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe added to statin achieves an incremental reduction in LDL-C of typically 20–25% and has been shown to provide a further decrease in ASCVD risk. Hence, this agent is now recommended for patients not achieving their lipid goal on maximum tolerated statin dose. Recently, the introduction of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors has made possible more profound LDL-C lowering of the order of 50–60%, and both currently marketed agents — evolocumab and alirocumab — have been approved for use in selected patient groups [those with severe ASCVD and those with primary hypercholesterolaemia, especially familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH)] with an inadequate response to maximally tolerated statin therapy or statin intolerance. With the publication of the FOURIER trial, we have evidence that the addition of PCSK9 inhibitors to statin delivers significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events, in line with the predicted benefit from meta-regression analysis.

### PCSK9 inhibitors: economics and policy [^114ERWyQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors substantially reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but it is presently unclear whether they also reduce mortality. The list prices of PCSK9 inhibitors in the United States (> $14,500 per year) are > 100× higher than generic statins, and only a small fraction of their higher cost is likely to be recovered by prevention of cardiovascular events. The projected cost effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors does not meet generally accepted benchmarks for good value in the United States, but their value would be improved by substantial price reductions. For individual patients, the high out-of-pocket costs of PCSK9 inhibitors may impede access and reduce long-term adherence. The budgetary impact of PCSK9 inhibitors would be very large if all potentially eligible patients were treated, which poses dilemmas for policymakers, payers, and society.

### Relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) lowering in response to PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab [^115yoA8t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite its low plasma abundance, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) acts as a master regulator of LDL (low‐density lipoprotein) metabolism by binding to the LDLR (low‐density lipoprotein receptor) and targeting it for lysosomal degradation. 1 In 2015, 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting PCSK9 were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or familial hypercholesterolemia requiring additional LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) lowering. In 2017, the first large randomized controlled outcome trial with a PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab, demonstrated statistically significant reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke rates over 2.2 years in patients with preexisting vascular disease above optimized statin therapy. 2 Similarly, positive results from the other antibody (alirocumab) large randomized controlled outcome trial were recently published. 3

PCSK9 inhibitors are highly efficacious lipid‐lowering drugs, with LDL‐C reductions generally ranging from 50% to 60% in 12‐week interventional studies. 4, 5, 6 Both antibodies targeting PCSK9 have also consistently demonstrated significant (25–30%) reductions in Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]). 7, 8 Although the potent reduction in LDL‐C achieved by PCSK9 inhibition is mediated through its profound effect on LDLR preservation, the mechanism of Lp(a) lowering is unknown. Although some suggest that Lp(a) reduction achieved with PCSK9 inhibition is also secondary to the increase in LDLR expression, 9 alternative pathways beyond LDLR‐mediated clearance may be involved in Lp(a) reduction. 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 If PCSK9 antagonism lowers Lp(a) solely through LDLR‐mediated clearance, then Lp(a) and LDL‐C lowering should be proportional, with all individuals achieving the 2:1 ratio.

Conclusion

A simple strategy is needed to help physicians in the selection of patients suitable for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, and we commend the 'highest risk–highest benefit' concept and advocate the development of simple aids (such as Figure 1) for clinicians to implement this framework. The aids should be adapted to the prevalent cost of these drugs in various pricing jurisdictions.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114zoPsJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

The discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) and the development of inhibitors of PCSK9 function appear to mark an epochal advance in clinical lipidology. PCSK9 is a circulating protein that binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and facilitates their lysosomal degradation following internalization in cells. Blocking PCSK9 thus increases the recycling of LDL receptors and results in more receptors on the cell surface, particularly in the liver, thereby lowering LDL levels. In this Roundtable, we discuss the recent large cardiovascular outcomes trials in which evolocumab and alirocumab, monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9, successfully reduced major cardiovascular events. We discuss the safety of these drugs as well as the safety of maintaining very low LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, we address pragmatic considerations affecting the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in clinical practice.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease [^114GeNjL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In the past 30 years, the introduction of new lipid‐lowering drugs, beginning with statins, has dramatically altered the outlook for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a pathologic process, which after decades of exposure to elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) and other established risk factors culminates in myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease. Statins, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors have been included in clinical trials, showing the value of LDL‐C reduction on ASCVD‐related outcomes. A unifying theme across the successful development of these diverse medications is the leveraging of cholesterol and lipid particle metabolism to lower LDL‐C, which is causal for atherosclerosis.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for ≈1 in every 3 deaths. 1 An established risk factor for the development of CVD is elevated LDL (low‐density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL‐C), which is a common chronic condition in adults. 1 Use of lipid‐lowering therapies, including statins and nonstatin therapies such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors, reduces LDL‐C and lowers the risk of CVD outcomes. 2, 3, 4 For every 1‐mmol/L reduction in LDL‐C from statins, there is a corresponding relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events of 12% and 22% after 1 and 4 years of treatment, respectively. 5 Furthermore, aggressive lowering of LDL‐C beyond treatment guideline thresholds has been shown to provide even greater benefit in reduction of CVD outcomes. 2, 6, 7 Despite these known benefits, a substantial proportion of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, including patients with established CVD, receive suboptimal or no lipid‐lowering therapy. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

### PCSK9 in context: a contemporary review of an important biological target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112ZyQ5G]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The identification of the critical role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has rapidly led to the development of PCSK9 inhibition with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). PCSK9 mAbs are already in limited clinical use and are the subject of major cardiovascular outcomes trials, which, if universally positive, could see much wider clinical application of these agents. Patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia are the most obvious candidates for these drugs, but other patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, statin intolerance or hyperlipoproteinaemia(a) may also benefit. PCSK9 mAbs, administered once or twice monthly, reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 50% to 70%, and appear to be safe and acceptable to patients over at least 2years of treatment; however, treatment-emergent adverse effects are not always identified in clinical trials, as well-evidenced by statin myopathy. Inclisiran is a promising RNA-based therapy that promotes the degradation of PCSK9 mRNA transcripts and has similar efficacy to mAbs, but with a much longer duration of action. The cost-effectiveness and long-term safety of therapies targeted at inhibiting PCSK9 remain to be demonstrated if they are to be used widely in coronary prevention.

### The multifaceted biology of PCSK9 [^113y9PDf]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

The level of plasma cholesterol is influenced not only by its de novo biosynthesis, but also by the absorption of dietary cholesterol and the removal of cholesterol from the blood. Blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol by the gut through inhibition of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein on small intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes is the basis of the mechanism of action of ezetimibe, a drug first described by Schering–Plough. When combined with a statin, ezetimibe further reduces LDLc by 15% to 20% and improves cardiovascular outcomes.

In this review, we will introduce the family of proprotein convertases (PCs) and the implication of some members in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. We will then concentrate on PCSK9 implicated in the enhanced degradation of the LDLR, and hence clearance of LDLc from circulation. We will then present some of the multifaceted functions of this fascinating protein and highlight knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed. We do not aim to exhaustively cover all information regarding the various tissue-specific functions of PCSK9 in health and disease, but rather our focus has been placed on specific novel avenues, which we believe deserve more extensive investigations.

Current Insights and Recommendations on Lipid‐Lowering Therapy After ACS

Large‐scale trials are ongoing to investigate the clinical relevance of lipid particles, such as triglycerides, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), apolipoprotein A1, and lipoprotein(a), in reducing the persistent risk of developing CAD and its complications. However, increased levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) have irrefutably been shown to be a key causal factor in the development of CAD, and robust clinical evidence shows that reducing LDL‐C blood levels leads to the prevention of atherothrombotic events. 11, 12 Figure 1 provides an overview of the distinct mechanisms of action for the 3 classes of cholesterol‐lowering drugs that are being advocated in current guidelines (ie, statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 [proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9] inhibitors).

### The impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 serine protease inhibitors on lipid levels and outcomes in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia: a network meta-analysis [^111yBWDw]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia to compare the impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 serine protease (PCSK9) inhibitors with placebo and ezetimibe on lipid levels and outcomes.

Methods and Results

MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for RCTs assessing PCSK9 inhibitors vs. other therapies in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Network meta-analysis with both a frequentist approach and a Bayesian framework was performed to directly and indirectly compare PCSK9 inhibition on lipid levels with ezetimibe and placebo. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR [95% CIs]) were generated with random-effects models to compare outcomes. Our meta-analysis included 17 RCTs with 13 083 patients that were randomized to PCSK9 inhibitors (n = 8250), placebo (n = 3957), ezetimibe (n = 846), or PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe (n = 30). The mean age was 59 ± 10, 52% were male, 34% had coronary artery disease, 51% had hypertension, 19% had diabetes mellitus, baseline LDL of 122 ± 36 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 199 ± 39 mg/dL, and HDL of 51 ± 14 mg/dL. inhibitors significantly reduced LDL cholesterol by 57% relative to placebo (P < 0.001) and 36.1% relative to ezetimibe (P < 0.001). Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 serine protease inhibitors reduced the incidence of all-cause mortality [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.22–0.82), P = 0.01] but was associated with an increased incidence of neurocognitive adverse events [OR 2.34 (95% CI 1.11–4.93), I(2) = 4%, P = 0.02] when compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 serine protease inhibition significantly improved lipid profiles and reduced the incidence of all-cause mortality compared with placebo but had a higher rate of neurocognitive adverse events. Thus, PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may serve as an alternative for patients with statin intolerance and for those who do not respond to other lipid reduction therapy.

Major Cardiovascular Outcome Trials Using PCSK9 Inhibitors

Lipid-modifying agents are often prescribed to reduce atherogenic lipid levels and to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In view of the major effects of the lack of PCSK9 on the substantial reduction of circulating LDLc, and the overall safety of PCSK9 LOF or its complete absence in animal models and humans, it was likely that potent PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9is) could represent a viable strategy to reduce LDLc. Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the circulating PCSK9 activity via mAbs or protein/peptide inhibitors, or through silencing its mRNA expression or translation in liver. So far, major efforts by pharmaceutical companies led to the successful development of 2 distinct, robust, safe, and long-term PCSK9i (Fig. 2): (1) PCSK9 mAbs (evolocumab/Repatha and alirocumab/Praluent) that inhibit the interaction of circulating PCSK9 with the LDLR, thereby silencing its extracellular activity; (2) PCSK9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) in lipid nanoparticles (Inclisiran) specifically delivered to the liver that prevents PCSK9 translation, thereby abrogating both intracellular and extracellular functions of PCSK9 in hepatocytes. Both approaches result in a ~50% to 60% reduction in LDLc above that obtained with statins alone. The reader is referred to very recent reviews on the history, efficacy, safety, and potential clinical uses and outcomes of these PCSK9i. Below, we briefly describe salient features that emanated from the major clinical trials using either mAb or siRNA approaches, the targeted populations, and their outcomes.

### Alirocumab (Praluent) [^114ipNVU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Alirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Alirocumab reduced free PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Following a single subcutaneous administration of alirocumab 75 or 150 mg, maximal suppression of free PCSK9 occurred within 4 to 8 hours. Free PCSK9 concentrations returned to baseline when alirocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.

Absorption

After subcutaneous administration of 75 mg to 300 mg alirocumab, median times to maximum serum concentrations (tmax) were 3–7 days. The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single subcutaneous administration of 75 mg into the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh were similar. The absolute bioavailability of alirocumab after subcutaneous administration was about 85% as determined by population pharmacokinetics analysis. A slightly greater than dose proportional increase was observed, with a 2.1-fold to 2.7-fold increase in total alirocumab concentrations for a 2-fold increase in dose from 75 mg every 2 weeks to 150 mg every 2 weeks. Monthly dose normalized exposure with 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment was similar to that of 150 mg every 2 weeks. Steady state was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio up to a maximum of about 2-fold.

Distribution

Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution was about 0.04 to 0.05 L/kg indicating that alirocumab is distributed primarily in the circulatory system.

### The role of PCSK9 inhibitors in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia [^112h5Z57]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and describe its place in therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Clinicaltrials.gov was performed from January 2012 to March 2018 to identify literature pertaining to PCSK9 inhibitors using pre-specified search terms. Additional references were identified from citations of the literature.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only articles in English were reviewed. Phase II, phase III, pooled, post hoc, and cardiovascular (CV) trials were included. Cost-effectiveness studies and conference materials were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

All trials evaluating alirocumab and evolocumab demonstrated significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering versus comparators. Two trials revealed a decrease in the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) end point with PCSK9 inhibitor use; 1 of these 2 trials revealed a decrease in all-cause mortality with alirocumab use. No significant safety concerns apart from injection site reactions were noted. Despite these results, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses failed to meet acceptable thresholds. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review describes the most up-to-date evidence regarding PCSK9 inhibitors. A discussion on LDL-C lowering potential, effect on CV events and mortality, safety considerations, feasibility of administration, and cost are included to guide clinicians on future use.

Conclusion

The PCSK9 inhibitor drug class is an effective LDL-C lowering option for patients with the highest risk of CVD events and high LDL-C despite the use of statin therapy. For more widespread use, significant cost reductions are needed.

### Emerging innovative therapeutic approaches targeting PCSK9 to lower lipids [^117Unybz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Statins are established therapies for cardiovascular disease prevention and ezetimibe has recently been shown to modestly reduce cardiovascular events when added to background statin therapy. Yet here remains a clear unmet need for additional therapies aimed at lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to further reduce cardiovascular risk. Multiple strategies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition have emerged as effective modalities for LDL-C lowering. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are the farthest along in clinical development and alirocumab and evolocumab were approved for clinical use by regulatory agencies in 2015. In addition to robust LDL-C lowering (nearly 50–65% from baseline), they improve other lipid parameters as well. Adverse events associated with these medications are minimal. Importantly, they improve clinical cardiovascular disease outcomes, although long-term study results are awaited. Cost may be an important limiting factor in their use and we propose two possible solutions which can potentially curtail cost.

### Molecular basis of PCSK9 function [^115zWko6]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

The LDL receptor (LDLr) inhibitor Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as a genetically validated target for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. In 2007, PCSK9 was found to act as a chaperone that binds the LDLr, thereby targeting it for lysosomal degradation. The enzymatic activity of PCSK9 is not involved in that process, but rather permits proper intramolecular processing of PCSK9. This was demonstrated by both site directed mutagenesis and independent reports of the PCSK9 crystal structure. These reports also elucidated the mode of action of several naturally occurring mutants of PCSK9 associated with hyper- or hypocholesterolemia. The present review summarizes studies published or in print before May 2008 investigating the functional significance of PCSK9 and its promising aspects as a prognostic tool and a drug target.

### Research progress on alternative non-classical mechanisms of PCSK9 in atherosclerosis in patients with and without diabetes [^114DthDQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) acts via a canonical pathway to regulate circulating low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) via degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) on the liver cell surface. Published research has shown that PCSK9 is involved in atherosclerosis via a variety of non-classical mechanisms that involve lysosomal, inflammatory, apoptotic, mitochondrial, and immune pathways. In this review paper, we summarized these additional mechanisms and described how anti-PCSK9 therapy exerts effects through these mechanisms. These additional pathways further illustrate the regulatory role of PCSK9 in atherosclerosis and offer an in-depth interpretation of how the PCSK9 inhibitor exerts effects on the treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy of evolocumab and other therapies for the management of lipid levels in hyperlipidemia [^114wU7hf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews with subsequent meta‐analyses have been conducted using clinical studies of PCSK9 inhibitors. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 However, such studies have either pooled PCSK9 inhibitors together as a class 16, 17, 18, 19 or provided pooled efficacy estimates for evolocumab versus control and alirocumab versus control without making any formal indirect comparisons. 20 Finally, none of the meta‐analyses specifically focused on patients whose hypercholesterolemia was not controlled with statin therapy alone, the primary populations for which evolocumab and alirocumab are indicated. 21, 22, 23, 24

We therefore conducted a systematic review and network meta‐analysis to compare LDL‐C reduction with evolocumab to other lipid‐lowering therapies (including alirocumab) in patients receiving statin background therapy.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^112G2w4H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We observed small numbers of potentially eligible patients starting PCSK9 inhibitors from US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2015 through mid‐2019, a period during which increasing clinical evidence demonstrated PCSK9 inhibitors improved cardiovascular outcomes, guidelines recommended PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with ASCVD with high cardiovascular risk, and manufacturers reduced prices of the drugs. Among various patient subgroups identified as potentially greatly benefiting from PCSK9 inhibitors, we still found < 1% were started on PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Thus, the magnitude of price reductions may not yet be sufficient to influence use management strategies aimed to limit PCSK9 inhibitor use, despite increased guideline recommendations for their use. The potential clinical benefits of novel therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, may not be realized if barriers to access remain.

### Just price for PCSK9 inhibitors: No less, No more [^116eh8tn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9) inhibitor scientific translation from bench to bedside over the past decade has been rightfully highlighted as one of the top success stories in cardiovascular disease (CVD) management in recent years. 1 Despite this newer therapeutic class undeniably resulting in proven improvement in CVD outcomes, its widespread adoption has faced an uphill battle in recent years. For example, leveraging large national insurance data sets, recent studies have reminded us that approximately half of those prescribed eventually get preapproved. For both patients and physicians, these barriers are disheartening. 2, 3 What is the rationale behind the existing rigid preauthorization process and such high rejection rates? According to many, the reason is clear: simply put, these are relatively expensive for a drug with such a potentially large market. This is the "elephant in the room". 4

In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial, although the 2% absolute and 15% relative CVD risk reduction over a 2.2‐year period is widely celebrated, at the same time, we need to acknowledge that these benefits are not miraculous. 5 The gains on top of standard of care depend on the eye of the beholder, because it appears substantial to some and modest to others. For those in the business of allocating healthcare resources, on the basis of back of the envelope crude estimates, even assuming half of current suggested prices, a $700 000 price tag to prevent one cardiovascular event is a daunting proposition.

In the past, our cardiovascular community, unlike our peers in oncology, has largely been immune to the dogmatic conversations of considering cost in our management decisions. However, now in 2018, in the midst of (1) proven benefit as well as high price tags of PCSK9 inhibitors, (2) genuine expectations of fulfilling our obligations toward the deserving patients' rightful needs, (3) increasing awareness of financial toxicity on families from out‐of‐pocket costs as a real adverse effect of our medical decisions, and (4) being reminded of opportunity cost where a higher yield can be realized by investing in higher‐value health care, there is no more hiding for us.

### 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults [^114mdBNZ]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to PCSK9 inhibitors, CCS 2021 guidelines recommend to intensify lipid-lowering therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab or alirocumab) with or without the additional use of ezetimibe for secondary prevention in patients with CVD shown to derive the largest benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose.

### Advancements in risk stratification and management strategies in primary cardiovascular prevention [^117DbdNF]. Atherosclerosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for advancements in risk assessment and management strategies. Although significant progress has been made recently, identifying and managing apparently healthy individuals at a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis and those with subclinical atherosclerosis still poses significant challenges. Traditional risk assessment tools have limitations in accurately predicting future events and fail to encompass the complexity of the atherosclerosis trajectory. In this review, we describe novel approaches in biomarkers, genetics, advanced imaging techniques, and artificial intelligence that have emerged to address this gap. Moreover, polygenic risk scores and imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring, and coronary computed tomography angiography offer promising avenues for enhancing primary cardiovascular risk stratification and personalised intervention strategies. On the other hand, interventions aiming against atherosclerosis development or promoting plaque regression have gained attention in primary ASCVD prevention. Therefore, the potential role of drugs like statins, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids, antihypertensive agents, as well as glucose-lowering and anti-inflammatory drugs are also discussed. Since findings regarding the efficacy of these interventions vary, further research is still required to elucidate their mechanisms of action, optimize treatment regimens, and determine their long-term effects on ASCVD outcomes. In conclusion, advancements in strategies addressing atherosclerosis prevention and plaque regression present promising avenues for enhancing primary ASCVD prevention through personalised approaches tailored to individual risk profiles. Nevertheless, ongoing research efforts are imperative to refine these strategies further and maximise their effectiveness in safeguarding cardiovascular health.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe with or without statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113UCpzm]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the impact of ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in adults taking maximally tolerated statin therapy or who are statin intolerant.

Design

Network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2020.

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors with ≥ 500 patients and follow-up of ≥ 6 months.

Main Outcome Measures

We performed frequentist fixed-effects network meta-analysis and GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess certainty of evidence. Results included relative risks (RR) and absolute risks per 1000 patients treated for five years for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. We estimated absolute risk differences assuming constant RR (estimated from network meta-analysis) across different baseline therapies and cardiovascular risk thresholds; the PREDICT risk calculator estimated cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. Patients were categorised at low to very high cardiovascular risk. A guideline panel and systematic review authors established the minimal important differences (MID) of 12 per 1000 for MI and 10 per 1000 for stroke.

Results

We identified 14 trials assessing ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors among 83660 adults using statins. Adding ezetimibe to statins reduced MI (RR 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.94)) and stroke (RR 0.82 (0.71 to 0.96)) but not all-cause mortality (RR 0.99 (0.92 to 1.06)) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.97 (0.87 to 1.09)). Similarly, adding PCSK9 inhibitor to statins reduced MI (0.81 (0.76 to 0.87)) and stroke (0.74 (0.64 to 0.85)) but not all-cause (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)) or cardiovascular mortality (0.95 (0.87 to 1.03)). Among adults with very high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor was likely to reduce MI (16 per 1000) and stroke (21 per 1000) (moderate to high certainty); whereas adding ezetimibe was likely to reduce stroke (14 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (11 per 1000) (moderate certainty) did not reach MID. Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statin may reduce stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction of MI (9 per 1000) (low certainty) did not reach MID. Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins and ezetimibe may reduce MI (14 per 1000) and stroke (17 per 1000) (low certainty). Among adults with high cardiovascular risk, adding PCSK9 inhibitor probably reduced MI (12 per 1000) and stroke (16 per 1000) (moderate certainty); adding ezetimibe probably reduced stroke (11 per 1000), but the reduction in MI did not achieve MID (8 per 1000) (moderate certainty). Adding ezetimibe to PCSK9 inhibitor and statins did not reduce outcomes beyond MID, while adding PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe and statins may reduce stroke (13 per 1000). These effects were consistent in statin-intolerant patients. Among moderate and low cardiovascular risk groups, adding PCSK9 inhibitor or ezetimibe to statins yielded little or no benefit for MI and stroke.

Conclusions

Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors may reduce non-fatal MI and stroke in adults at very high or high cardiovascular risk who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy or are statin-intolerant, but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk.

### Safety and efficacy of anti-PCSK9 antibodies: a meta-analysis of 25 randomized, controlled trials [^111aBzBA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The introduction of statins has substantially reduced CVD events around the world and is recommended as first-line therapy for CVD management. However, a necessity for other lipid-lowering (especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering) agents still exists because some patients cannot tolerate statins due to adverse events, or cannot achieve intensive LDL-C lowering because of extremely high baseline LDL-C levels, or patients with very high risk of CVD events need more intensive lowering therapy.

The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in cholesterol regulation has been established since PCSK9 mutations were first discovered in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) in 2003. PCSK9 binds to LDL receptors (LDLR) and facilitates the degradation of LDLRs and thus leads to LDL-C increase, indicating great therapeutic potential. Therefore, inhibiting PCSK9 by monoclonal antibodies, small interfering RNA, and small molecule inhibitors has been evaluated to lower LDL-C levels in human studies during the last few years. However, a comprehensive analysis of the safety of anti-PCSK9 antibodies is absent, and efficacy outcomes on lipid profiles are not uniformly consistent. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive review of the current available evidence to address the safety (to provide the exact rates of common adverse events) and the efficacy (to determine the exact extent of lipid changing effect) of anti-PCSK9 antibodies.

### PCSK9 inhibitors in clinical practice: delivering on the promise? [^116ThBNB]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

In clinical trials, protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors robustly lowered LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) and had a favorable tolerability and safety profile. Based on these findings, PCSK9 inhibitors are incorporated in updates of clinical treatment guidelines. However, trial results do not necessarily predict the effectiveness under real-world conditions. The aim of the current study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of PCSK9 inhibitors in routine outpatient care.

Methods

The cohort comprised all patients who were prescribed evolocumab or alirocumab at the outpatient clinic of a large university hospital in the Netherlands. Eligible patients required additional lipid-lowering despite maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe, or were statin intolerant. Data were systematically collected during routine outpatient visits.

Results

The study included 238 patients of whom 67.2% had familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and 42.9% were statin intolerant. The mean LDL-c reduction was 55.0% from a baseline of 4.4 mmol/L. LDL-c goals were attained by 62.3% of patients. Side effects were reported by 15.5% of patients and 2.5% discontinued treatment. No meaningful differences in efficacy or tolerability were observed between patients with FH or statin intolerance, or across treatment regimens.

Conclusions

The observed lipid reductions and side effects profile of PCSK9 inhibitors in a routine care setting were comparable to observations in clinical trials.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112ZUFYL]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

PCSK9 inhibitors — evidence and regulatory status note that major adverse cardiovascular events were lower with PCSK9 inhibition in post hoc analyses and that these agents are FDA-approved adjuncts for additional LDL-C lowering in specified populations. In ODYSSEY LONG TERM, events were lower with PCSK9 inhibitor vs placebo (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31–0.90; p = 0.02), and a similar effect was reported in OSLER (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28–0.78, P = .003). The PCSK9 inhibitor class has been approved by the FDA for use as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous FH or clinical ASCVD who require additional LDL-C lowering, and the additional LDL-C reduction of ~60% when added to statin therapy is described. Use is suggested primarily for patients with ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin (± ezetimibe) or for heterozygous FH without ASCVD who have LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL (non-HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at very high risk — initial PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use: At the current time, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (PCSK9 mAb) is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and cardiovascular outcomes benefits in FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes. The ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are currently in progress and are anticipated to be completed in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those who may be unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran. There is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy in LDL-C lowering or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to maximally tolerated statin therapy with/without ezetimibe or bempedoic acid; therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb. If a patient with clinical ASCVD at very high risk has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C ≥ 85 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe or other adjunctive nonstatin therapies, referral should be made to a lipid specialist and a RD/RDN. Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non–HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment considerations for patients with clinical ASCVD at very high risk.

### Just price for PCSK9 inhibitors: No less, No more [^112mARaV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, if we truly aspire to create a sustainable health system, there must be room for those who raise uncomfortable questions about what will we get for what we pay? For this, Ko et al deserve our deepest appreciation for providing insights on existing gaps between the price and value derived from PCSK9 inhibitors. 6 If these studies can successfully facilitate conversations among stakeholders to agree on the just price for 1‐2% absolute CVD risk reduction, no less, no more, I am confident that the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors will no longer be the top story in 2019.

Cost-effectiveness analyses of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy

Although current European and US guidelines indicate that the use of PCSK9 inhibitors is appropriate in specific patients, uptake has been low, in most part due to their perceived expense. Cost-effectiveness analyses are essential in determining whether, how, and when PCSK9 inhibitor treatment meets accepted metrics of value for money. However, the different models published to date have produced widely varying and potentially confusing results. Eight reports on the health economics of PCSK9 inhibitor use have appeared: four academic-ledand four supported by industry. Of these, three analyses were based on the FOURIER data. In addition, health technology appraisals were undertaken by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for alirocumab and evolocumab.

According to the US Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) analysis, the use of PCSK9 inhibitors did not meet a threshold of cost-effectiveness, defined in the study as $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, in patients with heterozygous FH (primary prevention) or ASCVD. The analysis was based on the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model that adopted a US health system perspective and a price for PCSK9 inhibitors of $14 350 per annum. Estimates of LDL-C reduction were based on the published literature, and statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors were all assumed to achieve similar reductions in the risk of cardiovascular events per mg/dL decrease in LDL-C. Addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor to statin in ASCVD patients was estimated to save 4.3 million major cardiovascular events with an increment of 7.9 million QALYs at a cost of $414 000 per QALY gained. This analysis was updated recently using the findings of the FOURIER trial. Cost-effectiveness was recalculated at $450 000 per QALY in ASCVD patients, compared with eztimibe, a less optimistic value than the initial estimate; the authors stated that price reductions of the order of > 71% would be required to meet the $100 000 per QALY threshold.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115btkts]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors for the treatment of dyslipidemia. However, evidence of the optimal PCSK9 agents targeting PCSK9 for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events is lacking. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the benefit and safety of different types of PCSK9 inhibitors.

Methods

Several databases including Cochrane Central, Ovid Medline, and Ovid Embase were searched from inception until March 30, 2022 without language restriction. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing administration of PCSK9 inhibitors with placebo or ezetimibe for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with statin-background therapy were identified. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was serious adverse events.

Results

Overall, nine trials totaling 54,311 patients were identified. Three types of PCSK9 inhibitors were evaluated. The use of alirocumab was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality compared with control (RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.72–0.95). Moreover, evolocumab was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with alirocumab (RR 1.26, 95% CrI 1.04–1.52). We also found alirocumab was associated with decreased risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CrI 0.90–0.99).

Conclusions

In consideration of the fact that both PCSK9 monoclonal antibody and inclisiran enable patients to achieve recommended LDL-C target, the findings in this meta-analysis suggest that alirocumab might provide the optimal benefits regarding all-cause mortality with relatively lower SAE risks, and evolocumab might provide the optimal benefits regarding myocardial infarction for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events. Further head-to-head trials with longer follow-up and high methodologic quality are warranted to help inform subsequent guidelines for the management of these patients.

### Lipid-modifying agents, from Statins to PCSK9 inhibitors: JACC focus seminar [^11754gtB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mendelian randomization studies and randomized trials have conclusively demonstrated that lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol results in fewer cardiovascular events. This review describes key stages in the evolution of LDL cholesterol-lowering treatment. Data from over 25 cardiovascular outcome trials confirm that, within a few years, statins lower the relative risk of major atherosclerotic events by about 22% per 38.7 mg/dl (1 mmol/l) reduction in LDL cholesterol, with similar benefit across patient subgroups. Meta-analyses of these trials have established the safety of statins with regard to nonvascular mortality and cancer. Other agents available for prescription include ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, which both reduce major atherosclerotic events in proportion to their effects on LDL cholesterol and have good safety profiles, though PCSK9 inhibitors remain costly. Investigational LDL cholesterol-lowering agents currently being tested in cardiovascular outcome studies are bempedoic acid, an adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase inhibitor that reduces cholesterol synthesis, and inclisiran, a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis.

### Sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes and cholesterol-lowering efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Liw6G]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of PCSK9i results in significant LDL-C and MACE reduction in both males and females. While there is no significant sex difference in MACE reduction, LDL-C reduction is greater in males than in females. Our data support the equal use of PCSK9i in all eligible patients, regardless of sex.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Clinicians should consider PCSK-9 inhibitors in eligible patients not achieving the desired LDL-C level equally across both sexes. Despite a lower LDL-C reduction in women than in men, both sexes have a significant reduction in LDL-C and MACE with these agents. Thus, these results support current guideline recommendations.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: PCSK-9 inhibitors continue to show great promise but may have different effects on various subgroups. Large-scale studies utilizing individual patient data can further expand the current understanding of PCSK-9i utilization across these populations.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^117X9hLF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An elevated level of Lp(a) is an independent highly prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this analysis of 47 RCTs comparing PCSK9i monoclonal antibody therapy vs placebo or ezetimibe, PCSK9is reduced Lp(a) levels by 27% on average. Mean change from the baseline in LDL-C and ApoB positively correlates with Lp(a) reduction. Given the modest but significant reduction in Lp(a) level, further research is needed to evaluate the impact of monoclonal antibody based PCSK9i on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated Lp(a).

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: PCSK9is reduced lipoprotein(a) levels regardless of comparator, treatment duration, type of PCSK9i used, or the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The impact of PCSK9is on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) needs to be evaluated.

### Proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors: a brief overview [^112xCF7t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors serve as a valuable addition to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering agents and have promising potential. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 enzyme, this novel molecule leads to increased low-density lipoprotein receptor density and decreased circulation of low-density lipoprotein. The fact the agent is a monoclonal antibody has led to limited drug interactions and minimized adverse drug events. It is critical for all providers to have a basic understanding of these novel therapies with their introduction and use for treatment.

### Impact of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 inhibitors on Lipoprotein (a): a meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^1173G91z]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Our meta-analysis aims to quantify the extent of Lp(a) reduction that can be achieved with PCSK9i therapy and to provide contribution to the existing body of literature by offering a pooled estimate of the effect of PCSK9i on Lp(a) reduction. While prior studies have examined the impact of individual PCSK9i variants, such as alirocumab and evolocumab, this analysis integrates data across multiple clinical trials to offer a more robust and comprehensive assessment of their effect on Lp(a). By pooling these data, we are able to not only quantify the average percentage reduction in Lp(a) levels but also investigate factors that may alter this effect, including the type of PCSK9i, the comparator used, treatment duration, and the presence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Furthermore, we examined concurrent reductions in other atherogenic lipoproteins. The integration of data from diverse studies in this meta-analysis provides a valuable contribution to advancing the understanding of PCSK9i's role in lipid management.

### PCSK9 inhibitor valuation: a science-based review of the two recent models [^114vxHHz]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been extensively evaluated. Prospective cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, biology, pathophysiology, genetics, and Mendelian randomization studies, have clearly taught us that LDL-C causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The newest class of drugs to lower LDL-C, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies, have been found to safely reduce LDL-C approximately 60% when added to high-intensity statin therapy. Because their cost is much greater than that of the currently available agents, their value has been questioned. In late August, 2017, two groups assessed the value of this class of drugs looking at cost-effectiveness; however, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and Fonarow and colleagues found disparate results when assessing PCSK9 valuation. Herein, we review the evolution of LDL-C from hypothesis to fact, and then attempt to adjudicate the 2 models, shedding light on the complex modeling process. We find that models of cost-effectiveness are helpful adjuncts to decision making, but that their conclusions depend on many assumptions. Ultimately, clinician judgment regarding their clinical benefit, balanced by some estimation of cost, may be more productive to target the right patients for whom the benefits can be well-justified.

It should be underlined that the mAb approach requires repeated injections at 2- to 4-week intervals (13 or 26 injections/year), whereas the siRNA treatment is administered twice a year. Inclisiran received marketing authorization in the European Union in December 2020 for use in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, but its authorization in the United States still awaits the Food and Drug Administration approval. So far, both approaches seem safe following 2 to 5 years of clinical use, but we will have to await longer treatments for a more thorough assessment of the long-term effects of reducing liver vs circulating PCSK9.

From 2008 to 2018, the consumption of cholesterol-lowering agents defined as standard units consumed per 1000 inhabitants increased by ~4.1%/year, with statins representing the lion share of a market that presently targets > 170 million people worldwide. However, PCSK9i are very useful when maximally tolerated statin therapy does not reduce LDLc sufficiently and in statin-intolerant patients. Compared to 2015, the year when PCSK9 mAbs were first approved by the Food and Drug Administration, prescriptions of PCSK9i increased by > 5-fold during the years 2016–2018, especially in higher income countries. Over the last 6 years the beneficial effects of PCSK9i administration have been widely recognized, encouraging their prescription both in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular incidents. However, the major stumbling block preventing their wider use has been their exorbitant cost (recently reduced to ~5800$/year in the United States). It is likely that prescriptions of PCSK9i would be much more widely adopted if the cost was substantially further reduced.

PCSK9 inhibitor selection and inclisiran use — At the present time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice in view of its demonstrated safety, efficacy, and benefits for cardiovascular outcomes, and the ORION-4 and VICTORION-2P cardiovascular outcomes trials with inclisiran are underway with completion anticipated in 2026 and 2027, respectively. In view of the twice-yearly dosing regimen, inclisiran may be considered in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, and patients with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs or those unable to self-inject may also be considered for therapy with inclisiran; there is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy or cardiovascular outcomes benefit for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran when added to statin therapy, so if inclisiran is to be used, it should be used in place of a PCSK9 mAb.

### Reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cardiovascular events with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and statins: an analysis of FOURIER, SPIRE, and the cholesterol treatment trialists collaboration [^1173F1By]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 45–60%, whether used alone or in combination with a statin. Two large cardiovascular outcomes trials have now reported that lowering LDL-C with a PCSK9 inhibitor when added to treatment with a statin reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events. We sought to compare the efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors and statins for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by comparing the results of the FOURIER and SPIRE trials with the results of the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta-analysis of statin trials.

In the FOURIER trial, 27 564 patients with cardiovascular disease and LDL-C levels above 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) on statin therapy were randomized to either 140 mg every 2 weeks (or 420 mg monthly) of evolocumab subcutaneously or matching placebo. At 48 weeks, treatment with evoloculmab reduced LDL-C by 59%, from a baseline level of 2.4 mmol/L (92 mg/dL) to 0.78 mmol/L (30 mg/dL). Using the CTT method of imputation for missing values, this translated into a 1.4 mmol/L (53.4 mg/dL) absolute difference in LDL-C between the two treatment groups. After a median follow-up of 26 months (2.2 years), treatment with evolocumab reduced the incidence of the composite primary cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina by 15%, from 11.3 to 9.8% (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79–0.92, P < 0.001). The key secondary endpoint of CVD, MI, or stroke was reduced by 20%, from 7.4 to 5.9% (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73–0.88, P < 0.001). When measured per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, treatment with evolocumab reduced the risk of the primary outcome by 11.0% (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84–0.94) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, and reduced the key secondary endpoint by 14.7% (HR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80–0.91) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. The magnitude of this effect appears to be slightly less than the 22% reduction in risk (HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.76–0.80) per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C during treatment with a statin as reported by CTT collaboration (P for difference = 1.6 × 10 −5 for primary outcome; P = 0.015 for secondary outcome).

### Eligibility for PCSK9 inhibitors according to American college of cardiology (ACC) and European Society of Cardiology / European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC / EAS) guidelines after acute coronary syndromes [^115ebRjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Although long‐term prognosis of patients after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has considerably improved, the residual risk remains high with a recurrence rate of ischemic events of 20% within 3 years. 1 Lipid‐lowering therapies, such as statins or ezetimibe, have shown a reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in secondary prevention after ACS. 2, 3 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of ACS recommend decreasing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) to a target level of < 1.8 mmol/L using high‐intensity statin therapy in combination with ezetimibe if needed. 4, 5

However, real‐life data suggest that less than one third of ACS patients are able to reach the recommended targets, including those treated with high‐intensity statin therapy. 6 The reasons for poorly controlled LDL‐C levels are statin resistance, lack of therapy intensification, or statin intolerance (eg, statin‐associated muscle symptoms). 7 The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin‐9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have emerged as a promising therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, because monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 lowered LDL‐C by 50% to 60%. 8, 9 Both alirocumab and evolocumab have been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia in case of poorly controlled LDL‐C with maximal tolerated statin therapy or as a second‐line treatment in case of documented statin intolerance. 10 After post hoc analyses suggesting a relative reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events by 50% for both agents, 11, 12 the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial including 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary outcome with a significant reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events by 11.3% (P < 0.001) in the evolocumab arm compared with placebo over a median follow‐up of 2.2 years. 13 Recently, both the American College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL‐C lowering in the management of ASCVD and a joint consensus statement from the ESC and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) have provided a practical guidance for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients at very high cardiovascular risk, such as those with manifest ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), and statin intolerance. 10, 14 Those statements took an initial position by defining criteria for consideration of PCSK9 inhibition based on current evidence. No real‐world data are available regarding the eligibility of PCSK9 inhibitors according to the suggested European and American criteria and the potential place of those promising agents in secondary prevention after ACS. Against this background, we evaluated the suitability of PCSK9 inhibitors 1 year after the index ACS event in a large, contemporary European population.

### Safety and efficacy of LY3015014, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 (PCSK9): a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study [^112AxUfj]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reduction in plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the cornerstone of strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both primary and secondary prevention patients. Statins have been shown to lower LDL-C levels and reduce the risk of CVD in virtually all types of patients. However, despite treatment with statins according to current guidelines, considerable residual risk for CVD remains. Accordingly, research efforts have focused on identification of additional LDL-C-lowering strategies.

In recent years, clinical studies have addressed the safety and efficacy of inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which plays a pivotal role in LDL-C metabolism by virtue of its inhibitory effect on recycling of the LDL receptor.

Antibody neutralization of PCSK9, through subcutaneous injection of anti-PCSK9 antibodies, appears safe and effective for reducing LDL-C in patients on standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapies, including statins. Several PCSK9 antibodies have reached late-stage development, typically demonstrating LDL-C reductions of 60% or greater when administered every 2 or 4 weeks. Notably, however, large dosages are required to sustain LDL-C reductions when administered at monthly intervals. For chronic administration, less frequent subcutaneous dosing would clearly be preferable.

LY3015014 (LY) is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody characterized by a comparatively long duration of action demonstrated in preclinical studies. The durability in LDL-C reduction may result from LY binding to a site that permits normal proteolytic cleavage of PCSK9, which may result in a reduction of target-mediated drug disposition. Based on these data, we hypothesized that administration of LY every 8 weeks might be sufficient for LDL-C reduction and offer a significant dosing advantage over other anti-PCSK9 antibodies that require dosing every 2 or 4 weeks.

Thus, the aim of our current study was to evaluate the LDL-C reduction following subcutaneous administration of LY every 4 or 8 weeks in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, when added to a background of standard-of-care lipid-lowering therapy.

FDA-approved indications include for both agents "LDL-C in adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including HeFH) as adjunct to diet, either alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies". Alirocumab indications include reducing "risk of MI, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with ASCVD" and treating "LDL-C in adults with HeFH as adjunct to diet and other LDL-C–lowering therapies". Alirocumab dosing: "initiate 75 mg SC every 2 weeks", with option to increase to "150 mg every 2 weeks", or start at "300 mg SC every 4 weeks"; for the 300‑mg dose, "administer 2 (150-mg) injections consecutively at 2 different injection sites", and in HeFH undergoing apheresis or adults with HoFH, "administer 150 mg SC every 2 weeks". Evolocumab indications include reducing "risk of MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults with ASCVD", and LDL-C lowering in pediatric HeFH ("aged ≥ 10 years") and HoFH (adults and pediatric "aged ≥ 10 years"). Evolocumab dosing includes "140 mg SC every 2 weeks or 420 mg SC once monthly" for ASCVD/HeFH, and for HoFH "420 mg SC every 4 weeks; if more LDL-C reduction is needed after 12 weeks, may increase to 420 mg every 2 weeks", with apheresis scheduling guidance and administration options to deliver the 420‑mg dose of "3 (140-mg) injections consecutively within 30 min".

AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline — PCSK9 inhibitors in very high-risk ASCVD: Together, FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES justify a COR of IIa for PCSK9 inhibitors, and because large trials showed event reduction in patients with very high risk and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated therapy this warrants an LOE of A; there are 2 alternative pathways to initiation — (a) in patients on maximally tolerated statin + ezetimibe and (b) in those on maximally tolerated statin alone — with the strategy of statin + ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor graded COR I; if patients develop 2 consecutive LDL-C levels < 25 mg/dL while on a PCSK9 inhibitor, clinical judgment should be used to determine whether de-intensification is warranted.

### Reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cardiovascular events with proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and statins: an analysis of FOURIER, SPIRE, and the cholesterol treatment trialists collaboration [^114b1NLJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The fact that the clinical benefit of both PCSK9 inhibitors and statins depends on the absolute magnitude of the achieved LDL-C reduction and the total duration of treatment has important implications for the on-going ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial. This trial randomized 18 600 patients to biweekly injections of alirocumab (initially 75 mg adjusted to 150 mg in a blinded fashion to achieve an LDL-C value of between 15 and 50 mg/dL with dose adjustment for patients with LDL-C below 15 mg/dL) or matching placebo beginning 1 to 12 months after an index hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Assuming that the tailored-dose approach will lead to a 50% reduction in LDL-C, treatment with alirocumab should reduce LDL-C by approximately 1.1 mmol/L (43.2 mg/dL) from a baseline LDL-C level of 2.2 mmol/L (86.4 mg/dL). Importantly, in the CTT meta-analysis, treatment with a statin reduced major cardiovascular events by 17% after 2 years of treatment and by 20% after 3 years of treatment (Table 1). Therefore, based on an expected median follow-up of 33 months (2.75 years), reducing LDL-C by 1.1 mmol/L with alirocumab should reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events by approximately 18–22% in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial.

The roundtable this month will involve a discussion of two new drugs that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The Food and Drug Administration approved the first of these, alirocumab as an "adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL [low-density lipoprotein]-cholesterol". Evolucumab has similar indications plus an indication specifically for treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This sets the stage for their clinical use and in this roundtable, we will discuss with two experts, the implications of these indications for the practicing physician. Dr McKenney and Dr Moriarty have had extensive experience in the conduct of clinical trials that provided the evidence of safety and efficacy of these so called PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Association of PCSK9 inhibitor initiation on statin adherence and discontinuation [^111nvqqV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

PCSK9is (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors) are well tolerated, potently lower cholesterol, and decrease cardiovascular events when added to statins. However, statin adherence may decrease after PCSK9i initiation and alter clinical outcomes. We evaluate the association of PCSK9i initiation on statin discontinuation and adherence.

Methods and Results

In this retrospective pre‐post difference‐in‐difference analysis, new PCSK9i claims were propensity matched with statin‐alone users (April 2017–September 2019). The primary outcomes were statin adherence (proportion of days covered) and statin discontinuation (absence of statin coverage for at least 60 days) 12 months following PCSK9i initiation. Secondary outcomes included low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after 1 year. A total of 220 538 statin users and 700 PCSK9i users were identified, from which 178 on PCSK9i were included and matched to 712 on statins alone. At 12 months, mean statin proportion of days covered decreased from 67% to 48% in the PCSK9i group but increased from 68% to 86% in the statin‐alone groups (P < 0.0001). Statin discontinuation rates increased from 11% to 39% in the PCSK9i group and from 7% to 9% in the statin‐alone group (P = 0.0041). Patients with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol < 70 mg/dL increased from 5% to 68% with PCSK9i but increased from 16% to 24% with statins alone (P < 0.0001). Changes in hospitalization rates were similar between both groups during the follow‐up period.

Conclusions

PCSK9i initiation was associated with decreased low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher statin discontinuation, and reduced statin adherence.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ RCTs assessing clinical effects of PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab showed a favorable safety profile with a low rate of AEs. Most common reported AEs in RCTs are nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza‐like illness, myalgia, back pain, arthralgia, headache, and ISRs.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ What are (the most common) AEs associated with the use of the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab prescribed in a real‐world setting?

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ In a real‐world setting, PCSK9 inhibitors are well tolerated with an overall safety profile comparable to RCTs. Most common AEs are influenza‐like illness, nasopharyngitis, myalgia, and ISRs, which often resolve over time. No clinical relevant differences in gender or between drugs were observed. No specific subgroup of patients could be identified at risk of developing AEs.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Safety monitoring of PCSK9 inhibitors is indispensable to assess long‐term effects and reactions occurring in specific subgroups of patients. Therefore, healthcare providers should contribute to report to pharmacovigilance centers.

### PCSK9 inhibition, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and health economics: challenges at the crossroads [^114P6XNU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Improved survival after a cardiovascular event has led to an expanding patient population at very high risk of recurrent events. Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and thus implicitly non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, to guideline-recommended goals is a key tenet of secondary prevention. Yet, standard-of-care treatment with statin (with or without ezetimibe) often leaves a high risk of preventable cardiovascular events. Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), highly efficacious lipid-lowering treatments that confer reduction in cardiovascular events and death, clearly have a role in the personalized management of these very-high-risk patients. Given budget constraints, however, their integration into the health care pathway merits health economic considerations. Consequently, it is important to identify challenges at the crossroads of the clinical and economic dimensions.

Findings and Conclusion

Health economic analyses involve application of modeling scenarios integrating multiple parameters to ultimately yield values for quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness ratios. To date, these analyses have led to widely variable estimates of these benchmarks for PCSK9 inhibitors, causing confusion among stakeholders in the health care pathway. Clearly, a consensual approach to the conduct and reporting of health economic analyses involving all players, including noneconomists such as clinicians and patient advocates, is essential to bridge the gap between the clinical needs of patients and financial access to PCSK9 inhibition.

### Use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation [^115BR8L6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

With high rates of PCSK9i interruption as well as discontinuation of statins or ezetimibe after PCSK9i initiation, 27% of patients were on no LDL‐lowering therapy by 1 year after PCSK9i initiation, and 44% of patients experienced interruptions of all LDL‐lowering therapies for at least 30 days. These results caution clinicians against complacency after we have successfully initiated the patient on a PCSK9i. As mentioned previously, most new PCSK9i users had prior ASCVD and it is critical that these patients do not go completely untreated when the PCSK9i is interrupted or discontinued. The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommend that patients taking PCSK9i therapy should be on concomitant statin and ezetimibe therapy, where possible. 25 The association of statin nonadherence with worse clinical outcomes, including death and recurrent cardiovascular events, has been demonstrated. 26 Clinicians need to closely monitor and educate patients about the importance of continuing LDL‐lowering medications. This discussion should include the rationale for reducing blood cholesterol, the independent benefits of statin therapy beyond LDL lowering, and the need to maintain long‐term secondary prevention, which may require combination therapy of multiple LDL‐lowering medications.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) therapies in 2015 for additional low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering among adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy. 1 Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of 2 PCSK9i therapies, evolocumab and alirocumab, in lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing rates of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Given their Food and Drug Administration–approved indications, patients initiating PCSK9i may have high LDL and a high risk for CVD events.

Treatment interruptions are common among users of statins and other long‐term therapies 7, 8 and may be even more frequent among patients initiating a PCSK9i because of the potential burden of prior authorization paperwork to obtain refills 9, 10 and the high cost of treatment. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Indeed, poor persistence and adherence to statin therapy has been previously documented in various patient populations. 15, 16, 17 As PCSK9i are potent LDL‐lowering agents, patients initiating PCSK9i may discontinue or down titrate other LDL‐lowering therapies. These patients may not be taking any LDL‐lowering therapy if they experience an interruption in PCSK9i. The goals of the current research were to (1) examine the prevalence of and factors associated with PCSK9i interruption after treatment initiation; (2) describe patterns of other LDL‐lowering therapy use before and after initiating a PCSK9i; and (3) assess the risk of interruption of all LDL‐lowering therapies among patients newly initiated on a PCSK9i.

Box 1
Inclisiran and anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies: what are the key similarities and differences?

Inclisiran and anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies target PCSK9 with the aim of increasing hepatic LDLR availability and thereby increasing LDL clearance. The mechanism by which this is achieved differs between the two classes. Anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies bind to the catalytic domain of extracellular PCSK9, blocking the PCSK9/LDLR interaction. In contrast, inclisiran reduces circulating PCSK9 levels by inhibiting PCSK9 protein synthesis within hepatocytes via RNA interference, resulting in a long duration of action.

When added to maximally tolerated statins, self‐administered biweekly or monthly anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies reduce LDL‐C by ≈60% (depending on dose and frequency), whereas twice‐yearly inclisiran (administered by a health care professional) reduces LDL‐C by ≈50% (after initial doses at baseline and 3 months). Both classes also modestly reduce Lp(a) and triglycerides, and inclisiran modestly increases high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. In clinical trials to date, evolocumab, alirocumab, and inclisiran have all been well tolerated. Although injection‐site reactions have been reported more frequently for each of these agents versus placebo, they have been mostly mild.

For anti‐PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with established ASCVD have reported a 15% to 20% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while long‐term cardiovascular outcomes data are awaited for inclisiran from 2 large ongoing cardiovascular outcome trials.

Clinical Development of Inclisiran

The inclisiran clinical development program, including preclinical and early clinical studies, is reviewed in detail elsewhere; however, a summary of the key clinical trials is included here. Initial clinical studies of inclisiran gave an early indication of its favorable safety profile. Pharmacokinetic studies reported that inclisiran plasma concentrations typically peak at ≈4 hours post‐dose, with an elimination half‐life from the plasma of ≈9 hours. In most individuals, inclisiran is not detectable in the blood 48 hours after dosing due to rapid GalNAc‐mediated hepatic uptake. Inclisiran remains active within the liver to exert its effects for several months, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Pharmacokinetic studies also identified no significant interactions with hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, suggesting a low risk of drug–drug interactions and rapid elimination in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114VxnoX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC nonstatin LDL-C lowering — PCSK9 mAb versus inclisiran — states that at the current time, a PCSK9 mAb is preferred as the initial PCSK9 inhibitor of choice, whereas inclisiran may be considered for use in patients with demonstrated poor adherence to PCSK9 mAbs, those with adverse effects from both PCSK9 mAbs, or those who may be unable to self-inject; there is currently no evidence or mechanistic plausibility for additional efficacy for combination therapy with a PCSK9 mAb and inclisiran, and therefore, if inclisiran is to be used, it should be in place of a PCSK9 mAb; if a patient has a continued < 50% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL) on maximally tolerated statin therapy with or without ezetimibe and/or bempedoic acid and the patient is considered for prescription of inclisiran, referral should be made to a lipid specialist.

### Use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation [^1167e1wF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In the current study, more than half of patients initiated on a PCSK9i experienced an interruption in therapy within the first year after initiation. Also, after PCSK9i initiation, many patients discontinue or down titrate other LDL‐lowering therapies, such as statins or ezetimibe. These findings raise concern that many new PCSK9i users may remain at high risk of cardiovascular events because of interruptions or discontinuations in LDL‐lowering therapy.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^114rPtwH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors represent a novel class of lipid‐lowering therapy that has been demonstrated to reduce low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) as well as reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). 1, 2 The PCSK9 inhibitors currently available are alirocumab and evolocumab, both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for use in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or preexisting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who require additional lowering of LDL‐C despite maximally tolerated doses of statins. 3

The enthusiasm over the clinical promise of PCSK9 inhibitors was tempered by average treatment prices of $14 000 per year, combined with studies concluding that these drugs do not meet generally acceptable cost‐effectiveness thresholds. 4, 5 Moreover, the high costs of PCSK9 inhibitors caused health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to implement use management processes, such as prior authorizations and increased patient cost sharing, which have been associated with slower uptake of novel pharmaceuticals in select populations. 6, 7

In 2017, the American College of Cardiology published guidelines on the role of nonstatin therapies for management of ASCVD, and in 2018, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Multisociety Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol was published. Both guidelines recommended PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with high‐risk ASCVD with LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL after adoption of lifestyle modifications and treatment with standard background therapy. 8, 9 In 2018, the manufacturers for both alirocumab and evolocumab announced price reductions to < $6000 per year in an attempt to meet cost‐effectiveness benchmarks and improve patient access to these therapies. 10, 11

In this analysis, we identified trends in the number of patients with ASCVD initiated on PCSK9 inhibitor therapy as well as the proportion of patients with ASCVD on statin therapy who were started on a PCSK9 inhibitor from approval in 2015 through mid‐2019. We also identified different patient groups with ASCVD and calculated the proportion who were initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis evaluating the effect of PCSK9is on Lp(a) levels, we observed that PCSK9i therapy significantly reduced Lp(a) levels, regardless of the comparator (placebo or ezetimibe), treatment duration, type of PCSK9i used, or the presence of FH. This may be attributed to the proposed mechanisms by which PCSK9i lower Lp(a) levels, namely through the reduction of its production and the enhancement of its clearance, as previously suggested in the literature. Other studies suggest that PCSK9i such as evolocumab may further promote Lp(a) catabolism by significantly upregulating LDL receptor expression, thereby enhancing the clearance of Lp(a) holoparticles, in the presence of statins. Additionally, PCSK9i treatment also significantly reduced LDL-C and ApoB levels.

Among the subgroup analyses, only the difference in duration of treatment had significant bearing on the treatment effect. Although our study demonstrated that PCSK9i leads to a modest Lp(a) lowering, the treatment effect appears to be higher in the first 12 weeks vs beyond 12 weeks of treatment. Some potential mechanisms underlying this observation have been proposed. Prolonged use of PCSK9i may induce its own resistance, which is thought to be from: 1) increased endogenous PCSK9 triggered by PCSK9i use; and 2) delayed PCSK9 clearance due to accumulation of monoclonal antibody-PCSK9 complexes. However, more data is needed to determine the possible reason of this treatment difference.

Many prospective studies have reported the role of PCSK9i in reducing Lp(a) levels, and prior pooled analyses have supported the efficacy of these agents. The results of our meta-analysis showed that the use of PCSK9i resulted in statistically significant reductions in plasma Lp(a) levels vs comparators (placebo and ezetimibe), further increasing our understanding of the effect of PCSK9i on Lp(a) level based on data from multiple clinical trials. Furthermore, this analysis enriches available evidence by providing detailed information on subgroups of interest, based on duration of treatment, comparator, type of PCSK9i, and presence of FH. The 27% reduction in Lp(a) level with PCSK9i compared to comparators (placebo and ezetimibe) in this analysis is consistent with the reports in previous meta-analyses citing on average 26% reduction. Beyond confirming this PCSK9i's effect on Lp(a), we also performed robust subgroup analyses with emphasis on duration of treatment and FH status.

Strength and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on sex-differences in LDL-C reduction and MACE in participants receiving PCSK9i therapy. There are several limitations that are important to note. This is a study-level meta-analysis, and we could not access individual patient data. Additional limitations include heterogeneity in PCSK9i studies in both males and females. Publication bias may also be present, but the extent of which could not fully be quantified. However, every effort possible was made to limit bias by utilizing a robust analytical approach to adjust for potential moderators through subgroup analyses.

4.4 Reduction ofrisk attributable to Lp(a)

Observational evidence has suggested a role for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) contributing to a lower ASCVD risk attributable to Lp(a) (Table 3). Meta‐analyses indicate that PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies are associated with an approximate 20%–25% reduction in Lp(a) levels. With respect to outcomes, evidence for a potential role of PCSK9i in lowering ASCVD risk arises from post hoc analyses of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) and Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment with Alirocumab (ODYSSEY Outcomes) Trials. Among individuals with stable CHD in the FOURIER trial, the median Lp(a) levels were 37 nmol/L. In the evolocumab treatment arm, risk reduction in CHD, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularisation was 2.6‐fold higher among individuals with Lp(a) ≥ median (relative risk reduction: 23%, absolute risk reduction: 2.5%) compared to those with Lp(a) < median (relative risk reduction: 9%, absolute risk reduction: 0.95%). Such differences corresponded to considerably lower number needed to treat over 3 years with evolocumab for those with Lp(a) ≥ median (40 patients) versus < median (105 patients).

### Advances in cardiovascular care: how to stimulate innovation while controlling cost [^1169Kqwh]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Given the results of multiple trials, the LDL story may have seemed to be over. The physiology seemed to be well understood. However, not all patients tolerate statins, statins are not efficacious in all patients, and even when efficacious, not all patients achieve a therapeutic target with statins (acknowledging that current guidelines in the United States leave the target uncertain). There is also remaining concern that for primary prevention in many patients, the number needed to treat to prevent 1 event is high, and that lifelong therapy in such low- to moderate-risk individuals is not fully justified.

Into this well studied, but still complicated environment comes PCSK9. In 2003, a group of patients in Europe were found to have high LDL cholesterol due to hyperexpression of PCSK9. PCSK9 causes the degradation of the LDL receptor. PCSK9 was also shown to increase in patients treated with statins, limiting their beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol. Horton et al.conjectured that if there was hyperfunctioning of PCSK9, then there should also be individuals with a genetic defect in PCSK9 where it was dysfunctional. They found such individuals using the Dallas Heart Study database. Mendelian randomization reveals that such individuals have low LDL cholesterol and a reduced risk of subsequent events.

Inhibition of PCSK9 proved to be an excellent therapeutic target. However, to date, there are no small molecules that inhibit PCSK9. There are 2 monoclonal antibodies that do inhibit PCSK9, and in clinical trials they have been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol by 60%, even on a background of statin therapy. There is also increasing evidence that PCSK9 therapy will decrease cardiovascular events, although a mortality benefit has not been shown. Furthermore, this therapy is safe. The limiting problem with PCSK9 therapy is that it is expensive, costing $12,000 to $14,000 per year. To date, cost-effectiveness analyses of PCSK9 inhibition have been limited, but suggest that at current prices, the cost per quality-adjusted life year saved would be approximately $300,000, which is well above societal willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. A threshold analysis has suggested that to be below the $100,000 threshold, the price of PCSK9 therapy would need to be $4,500. Such cost-effectiveness evaluations have also been subject to criticism.

these patients in the highest risk category, recommending maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor to achieve the lowest possible low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values. 3, 4 Patients with PVD had greater relative benefit from PCSK9i treatment vs standard lipid-lowering therapy, with benefit proportional to the number of affected vascular beds.
5. Patients in GOULD were older than 18 years with established ASCVD. Information about patient race and ethnicity have been previously reported. 6 For this cohort study, patients were divided into 2 groups based on LDL-C treatment strategy and stratified by presence or absence of PVD. Patients with PVD were also less likely to have a PCSK9i added. At the end of follow-up, only 155 patients with PVD and 810 without PVD had LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL.

### Cost-sharing for PCSK9 inhibitors among Medicare part D plans… [^113JF8EH]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

If out-of-pocket costs reach $4850, catastrophic coverage takes effect, reducing cost-sharing to 5% for the remainder of the year. We accounted for each of these coverage phases in our projections of PCSK9i cost-sharing. Standard deviations on the estimated mean monthly out-of-pocket costs range from $1 to $8. © 2025 Approximately 9 million US adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia do not achieve optimal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. 1 Adding a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may significantly. lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. 2 However, PCSK9is are expensive, with annual costs exceeding $14 500. 1 Understanding patients' share of drug costs is important because high out-of-pocket costs can adversely affect affordability and adherence to lifelong treatment.

3 Because 1 in 4 Medicare beneficiaries has ischemic heart disease and nearly 1 in 2 has hyperlipidemia, 4 we examined PCSK9i cost-sharing requirements for Medicare Part D plans nationwide, which insure 41 million beneficiaries.
5. We projected annual out-of-pocket costs under a standard 2016 Medicare Part D benefit for beneficiaries receiving a PCSK9i and generic atorvastatin 80 mg but no other drugs. We estimate that beneficiaries would pay one-third of PCSK9i costs under a standard 2016 Part D plan if they filled prescriptions for PCSK9i and atorvastatin and no other medications. Prior efforts to improve drug affordability have been aimed at decreasing the percentage of cost-sharing by beneficiaries. 5, 6 The Affordable Care Act will reduce cost-sharing for brand-name drugs during the coverage gap to 25% by 2020.

5 While this might work for cheaper drugs, the high price of PCSK9i indicates that lower coinsurance rates could still result in thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs annually. We projected annual cost-sharing based only on PCSK9i and atorvastatin use. Actual out-of-pocket costs would reflect a beneficiary's coverage phase when filling each prescription, which in turn is affected by their non-PCSK9i medication use. Our findings suggest a need to lower out-of-pocket costs to ensure affordability of PCSK9is for Medicare beneficiaries covered by Part D.

### Updated cost-effectiveness assessments of PCSK9 inhibitors via the FOURIER trial… [^116YyTuS]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Technical appendix for reviewers. Dotted lines signify permanent patent protection of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor drugs, while solid lines signify patent protection that lapses after 12 years, leading to a 43% reduction in price. Question. Results This study modeled 1000 hypothetical patients with attributes similar to those of the FOURIER trial cohort. At the current price, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of statin plus PCSK9i therapy was $337 729 per quality-adjusted life-year. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that a statin plus PCSK9i strategy had a low probability of being cost effective at the commonly accepted societal threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. At current prices, the addition of PCSK9i to statin therapy is estimated to provide an additional quality-adjusted life year for $337 729. Significant discounts are necessary to meet conventional cost-effectiveness standards.

Longitudinal cost parameters for myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, and transient ischemic attack were obtained from the literature. 12 We used observed cardiovascular risk reductions from the FOURIER study1 for up to 3 years. For all cardiovascular events, we assumed a 1-year probability of 3. 7% for patients treated with statin only and a probability of
3. 1% for those using statin plus PCSK9i. The ROI analysis suggested that, at current prices, PCSK9i would produce a negative ROI of 86%, indicating that for every dollar invested, private insurers would lose $1.
86. In dollar terms, putting 1 more plan patient on PCSK9i would produce an NPV loss of $35 907 to the payer. A price lower than $2381 would obtain a positive ROI and NPV. Finally, our sensitivity analysis showed that our results are highly sensitive to the patent protection assumption, the PCSK9i cardiovascular risk reduction assumption, and the coronary revascularization assumption.

Specifically, ICER increased by 47%, or $496 936 per QALY, under permanent patent protection; decreased by 33%, or $226 653 per QALY, if cardiovascular risk reduction increased by 10%; and decreased by 24%, or $257 119 per QALY, if revascularization was included as a cardiovascular event.
