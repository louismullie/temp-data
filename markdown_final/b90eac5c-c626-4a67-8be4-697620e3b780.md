## Question

what to do with erythema migrans

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to diagnose and manage erythema migrans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis clinically and when to avoid testing. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic context and exposure risk. Next, I will review what to do if the lesion is atypical and how to test in that scenario. After that, I need to select first-line therapy and duration, including any emerging evidence for shorter doxycycline courses. I will then consider special populations such as children, pregnancy, and immunocompromised patients. I should also address the STARI mimic and coinfections. Finally, I will plan follow-up, counsel on prognosis, and outline prevention and when to suspect complications, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis clinically, because in a patient with a compatible expanding annular erythematous lesion and plausible Ixodes exposure in an endemic area, laboratory testing is not recommended and may be misleading due to the serologic window period, so I should treat based on appearance and exposure history alone, not wait for labs that are likely to be negative early on [^116hyJF8] [^1124NaRM] [^113GPmR2] [^113XNPPA].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic context before I anchor on Lyme disease, because the pretest probability hinges on geography, season, and exposure. EM typically appears 3–30 days after a bite, often peaks in late spring through fall, and is most common in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest, so I should explicitly ask about outdoor activities, duration of tick attachment if known, and whether the lesion is expanding, since these factors materially raise or lower the likelihood of Lyme disease and guide empiric therapy decisions [^1167S1me] [^113AMmuK] [^115csPij].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. I should confirm that serology is unnecessary in classic EM because acute-phase sensitivity is low, around 20–40% in early solitary lesions, and even when positive, it does not change immediate management, so ordering a 2-tier test upfront risks false reassurance and delays treatment, and I should document the clinical diagnosis clearly in the chart to support the decision to treat without testing [^1155sRyJ] [^111sUido] [^113XNPPA].

> But wait, what if the lesion is atypical or the exposure risk is uncertain? In that case, I should reconsider and obtain acute-phase serology with a plan to draw a convalescent sample 2–3 weeks later if the initial test is negative, because paired testing increases sensitivity as the antibody response matures, and I should avoid direct detection methods like blood PCR or routine skin PCR given limited availability, lack of standardization, and modest sensitivity outside of research settings [^114deCWH] [^116nZTzL] [^111sUido].

> I need to ensure I select first-line therapy promptly. Oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil are all acceptable, with doxycycline often preferred for its convenience, penetration, and coverage of common coinfections, and I should treat for 10 days with doxycycline or 14 days with amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil, as extending therapy beyond these durations does not improve outcomes and increases adverse effects and cost [^113aLPHm] [^1144NpMX] [^112zCxGK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought doxycycline had to be 10 days based on guideline defaults, but let me verify emerging evidence. A 2023 randomized noninferiority trial in Slovenia showed that 7 days of doxycycline was noninferior to 14 days for solitary EM in adults, suggesting that shorter courses may be reasonable in selected patients, though I should acknowledge this is European data and not yet incorporated into North American guidelines, so I will discuss this nuance with patients and default to guideline durations unless there is a compelling reason to individualize [^115tVWUF] [^1144NpMX] [^112zCxGK].

> I should double-check special populations. In children, amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil are standard first-line agents, and while doxycycline is increasingly acceptable even in younger children for short courses, some clinicians still avoid routine doxycycline use under age 8 due to historical dental staining concerns, so I will individualize and favor beta-lactams when feasible, and in pregnancy I should avoid doxycycline and use amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil instead, with no need to alter duration solely due to pregnancy [^115vcaPQ] [^115JzewK] [^115wK6jh].

> Let me consider azithromycin carefully. It is a second-line option for patients who cannot take doxycycline or beta-lactams, with a recommended 7-day course in the US, and I should confirm that macrolides are less reliable than first-line agents and should be reserved for intolerance or contraindications, documenting the rationale if used [^111tcLiZ] [^112zCxGK].

> I will now examine the STARI mimic, because in regions where Amblyomma americanum is prevalent, an EM-like rash may occur after lone star tick bites. Since STARI has no proven pathogen or established extracutaneous sequelae and no definitive antibiotic data, if I cannot distinguish STARI from Lyme-associated EM, I should treat as Lyme disease to avoid missing a treatable Borrelia infection, and I should counsel patients accordingly [^1165Fj3t] [^113PBo5N] [^117NiHxP].

> Next, I should review coinfections. If there are high fevers, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or hemolysis, I need to check for anaplasmosis and babesiosis, and because doxycycline treats anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, it becomes the preferred agent when coinfection is plausible, whereas beta-lactams will not treat these pathogens, so I should tailor therapy and testing to the clinical syndrome and local epidemiology [^113qZkj1] [^113LzWnx].

> I should confirm follow-up expectations. Most EM lesions begin to fade within several days to a couple of weeks after starting appropriate therapy, and I will arrange clinical follow-up to ensure resolution and reassess for new symptoms, while advising that persistent nonspecific symptoms after treatment are not uncommon but are generally similar to background population rates and do not indicate treatment failure in the absence of objective signs [^111e7X7B] [^111aJVbn].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling points. Patients often expect a bull's-eye, but central clearing is less common in US presentations, so I will educate that homogeneous expanding erythema is also classic, explain that serology is not needed in typical EM, and warn about mild Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions shortly after starting antibiotics, which are self-limited and not a reason to stop therapy [^114cziPc] [^113bvXs7] [^113Y34Qo].

> I need to ensure we address prevention and when to suspect complications. I will reinforce tick avoidance, daily skin checks, and prompt tick removal, review indications for single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis after a high-risk Ixodes bite within 72 hours, and advise seeking urgent care for new neurologic symptoms, chest pain or palpitations, or marked joint swelling, as these may herald disseminated Lyme disease requiring extended therapy and specialty input [^114XKnAR] [^116bmZV4] [^113LzWnx].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have not overpromised testing. If the patient later develops extracutaneous manifestations or if the initial lesion was atypical and remains undiagnosed, then 2-tier serology becomes appropriate, and I will document the reasoning and timing to avoid misinterpretation of results and to support continuity of care [^113XNPPA] [^115wK6jh].

Treat erythema migrans as **early Lyme disease** with a **clinical diagnosis** [^114deCWH] — no lab testing is needed when the rash is typical and exposure is plausible [^1124NaRM] [^116hyJF8]. Start **oral antibiotics immediately**: doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days [^1144NpMX] [^115tVWUF], or amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily or cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily for 14 days [^113aLPHm] [^112zCxGK]; use azithromycin 500 mg daily for 7 days only if first-line agents are contraindicated [^111tcLiZ]. Treat children with amoxicillin or cefuroxime [^1162CoHg]; doxycycline is acceptable for children ≥ 8 years and when alternatives are unsuitable [^115vcaPQ] [^115csPij]. Monitor for Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions, and reserve serology for atypical rashes or uncertain exposure [^113Y34Qo] [^111sUido]. Prognosis is excellent with timely therapy, and longer courses or IV therapy are not indicated for uncomplicated EM [^111aJVbn] [^116bvzsy].

---

## Clinical diagnosis

- **Clinical diagnosis**: EM is diagnosed clinically based on appearance and exposure history; no lab confirmation is needed for typical lesions in endemic areas [^1124NaRM] [^113GPmR2].

- **Typical features**: Expanding erythematous patch ≥ 5 cm, often annular with central clearing [^113AMmuK]; may be homogeneous or targetoid and is usually nonpruritic and nonpainful [^117HNkQU] [^116bmZV4].

- **Exposure history**: Recent tick bite or outdoor exposure in endemic regions supports diagnosis [^1124NaRM].

---

## Laboratory testing

- **Not indicated for typical EM**: Serologic testing is unnecessary and may be falsely negative early [^1155sRyJ] [^113XNPPA].

- **Atypical lesions**: If lesions are atypical or exposure is uncertain, obtain acute-phase serology with convalescent testing 2–3 weeks later if initial results are negative [^114deCWH] [^116nZTzL].

- **Direct detection methods**: PCR or culture of blood or skin is not recommended due to low sensitivity and limited availability [^111sUido] [^113XNPPA].

## Treatment guidelines

### First-line antibiotic therapy

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | 10 days | - Adults <br/> - Children ≥ 8 years [^1144NpMX] [^115tVWUF] |
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally three times daily | 14 days | - Adults <br/> - Children < 8 years [^113aLPHm] [^1162CoHg] |
| Cefuroxime axetil | 500 mg orally twice daily | 14 days | - Adults <br/> - Children < 8 years [^113aLPHm] [^116oEMi8] |

---

### Alternative therapy

Azithromycin is a second-line option at **500 mg orally once daily for 7 days** [^111tcLiZ] when first-line agents are contraindicated [^111tcLiZ].

---

## Special populations

Children should receive **amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil** [^1162CoHg]; doxycycline is acceptable for those aged ≥ 8 years or when alternatives are unsuitable [^115csPij] [^115vcaPQ]. Pregnant women should receive **amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil**; doxycycline is contraindicated. Immunocompromised patients generally receive the same regimens, with clinical judgment guiding management [^1111ycsW].

---

## Clinical response and follow-up

Response typically occurs within days, with lesion resolution in 2–4 weeks; **Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions** may occur shortly after initiation. Follow-up should confirm resolution and monitor for disseminated disease; **longer courses or IV therapy are not indicated** for uncomplicated EM [^111aJVbn] [^116bvzsy].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent** with timely therapy, with low risk of relapse or chronic symptoms [^117HNkQU] [^1138yVsm] [^111e7X7B].

---

## Prevention of complications

Prevention of complications relies on **early recognition and treatment** to prevent dissemination and late manifestations [^113aLPHm]. Patient education should cover tick avoidance, prompt tick removal, and early recognition of EM [^114uxf3A].

---

Erythema migrans should be treated as **early Lyme disease** with a clinical diagnosis and prompt oral antibiotics; **no routine lab testing is needed** for typical cases, and prognosis is excellent with timely therapy [^1124NaRM] [^1144NpMX].

### Identifying the vector of Lyme disease [^115csPij]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the deer tick. Deer ticks have a four-stage life cycle (egg, larva, nymph, and adult), and nymphal ticks transmit B. burgdorferi to humans more frequently than adult ticks. Transmission of this spirochete typically requires a minimum of 24 to 48 hours of tick attachment. Early stages of Lyme disease are characterized by a hallmark rash, erythema migrans. The overall risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low in a person who has a deer tick bite. If erythema migrans develops at the site of the bite, treatment may include doxycycline in persons who are at least eight years of age. Administration of amoxicillin is appropriate for pregnant women or children younger than eight years. For those who are allergic to these medications, cefuroxime axetil may be used.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease — antimicrobial treatment principles and durations — uses agents active against Borrelia burgdorferi, with erythema migrans cases "treated with 7–14 days on an appropriate antibiotic depending on which drug is prescribed", while "other clinical manifestations are typically treated with 14–28 days of an appropriate antibiotic" based on the manifestation. Commonly used antibiotics in North America include "doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin", and "under most circumstances, oral therapy is effective and preferred over intravenous (IV) therapy due to equivalent efficacies, better tolerability, and lower cost", though indications for IV therapy such as hospitalization are discussed elsewhere in the guideline.

### An update on the diagnosis and treatment of early Lyme disease: "focusing on the bull's eye, you may miss the mark" [^116Ja4CK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To confidently diagnose and treat Lyme disease, the clinician must first understand the natural history of this disease, especially its protean early manifestations. Emergency physicians, primary care physicians, and other providers need to be vigilant in terms of the timely recognition of erythema migrans (EM), the unique marker of early localized stage 1 disease. The classic EM, originally described as a slowly expanding bull's eye lesion, is now recognized to be present in only the minority of cases (9%); the dominant morphologic lesion of EM is now recognized to be the diffusely homogenous red plaque or patch, which occurs in over 50% of cases. This update will define the current morphologic features of early Lyme disease, the indication for serologic studies, and the most recent treatment guidelines, including therapeutic pitfalls.

Discussion

Using medical claims data, we estimated that 329,000 (95% credible interval 296,000–376,000) LD cases occur annually in the United States, which emphasizes the substantial public health effect of this disease. This estimate is consistent with findings from a recent study of diagnostic laboratories that yielded an estimate of 288,000 (range 240,000–444,000) infections among patients for whom a laboratory specimen was submitted in 2008. As expected, our estimate is slightly higher because it also includes LD cases diagnosed without laboratory testing (i.e. clinical diagnosis based on presence of erythema migrans after exposure in a Lyme-endemic area).

Presence of a diagnostic code in the chart or a clinician diagnosis of an infectious condition does not necessarily signify a true infection. Possible reasons include rule-out diagnoses, codes for medical history but not incident infections, and overdiagnosis (incorrect diagnosis of LD when the patient has a different condition). Rule-out diagnoses and medical history codes most likely were reduced — but not completely eliminated — by including only outpatients treated with an antimicrobial drug recommended for LD. Overdiagnosis of LD is not uncommon given that, in some circumstances, the differential diagnosis for symptoms of LD can be broad. Studies of patient charts with the 088.81 code found that 37.9% in Maryland and 55.2% in Wisconsin were classified after chart review as noncases according to the surveillance case definition. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the ≈329,000 patients in whom LD was diagnosed were not infected with B. burgdorferi.

### Differences in Lyme disease diagnosis among medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, United States, 2016–2021 [^112rFHiG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Lyme disease is the most reported vectorborne disease in the United States, and ≈476,000 cases are diagnosed and treated annually. Lyme disease is caused by infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes spp. ticks. Approximately 80% of Lyme disease patients experience an erythema migrans rash at the site of the tick bite. Without recognition or treatment, the bacteria can disseminate and infect multiple organ systems, resulting in a range of disseminated manifestations that can have neurologic, cardiac, and musculoskeletal presentations. Although all manifestations are treatable with recommended antimicrobial drugs, patients with later-stage manifestations are more likely to be hospitalized and to have persistent symptoms after treatment than patients diagnosed with early, localized manifestations.

In US Lyme disease surveillance data, > 90% of cases with reported race are in persons who identify as White. That demographic distribution is thought to reflect the populations residing in areas where infected ticks are most common, which tend to be more affluent and educated rural and suburban communities in northeastern and midwestern states that have predominantly White populations. However, accumulated evidence has shown that non-White persons, particularly persons who identify as Black or African American, have higher rates of disseminated manifestations of Lyme disease, such as neurologic manifestations and arthritis, than do White persons. Higher rates of disseminated manifestations among non-White persons likely are caused in part by difficulty seeing and recognizing erythema migrans rash on darker skin, which can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed or missed diagnoses. Other factors, including differential risk behaviors and knowledge, likely create and perpetuate the differences in Lyme disease diagnoses.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease-United States [^111xLYzG]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The term "chronic Lyme disease" is used by some health care providers as a diagnosis for various constitutional, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been provided a wide range of medications as treatment, including long courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Studies have not shown that such treatments lead to substantial long-term improvement for patients, and they can be harmful. This report describes cases of septic shock, osteomyelitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and paraspinal abscess resulting from treatments for chronic Lyme disease. Patients, clinicians, and public health practitioners should be aware that treatments for chronic Lyme disease can carry serious risks.

Lyme disease is a well-known condition caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Features of early infection include erythema migrans (an erythematous skin lesion with a bull's-eye or homogeneous appearance), fever, headache, and fatigue. If left untreated, the spirochete can disseminate throughout the body to cause meningitis, carditis, neuropathy, or arthritis. The recommended treatment for Lyme disease is generally a 2–4-week course of antibiotics.

Chronic Lyme disease, on the other hand, is a diagnosis that some health care providers use to describe patients with a variety of conditions such as fatigue, generalized pain, and neurologic disorders. Many of these patients have experienced significant debilitation from their symptoms and have not found relief after consultation with conventional medical practitioners. As a result, some seek treatment from practitioners who might identify themselves as Lyme disease specialists ("Lyme literate" doctors) or from complementary and alternative medicine clinics, where they receive a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.

A diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease might be based solely on clinical judgment and without laboratory evidence of B. burgdorferi infection, objective signs of infection, or a history of possible tick exposure in an area with endemic Lyme disease. There is a belief among persons who support the diagnosis and treatment of chronic Lyme disease that B. burgdorferi can cause disabling symptoms even when standard testing is negative, despite evidence that the recommended two-tiered serologic testing is actually more sensitive the longer B. burgdorferi infection has been present (6). Some practitioners use tests or testing criteria that have not been validated for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. A significant concern is that after the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is made, the actual cause of a patient's symptoms might remain undiagnosed and untreated.

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 7 days versus 14 days in Slovenia: a randomised open-label non-inferiority trial [^115tVWUF]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in Europe and the USA. Doxycycline for 10 days is the primary treatment recommendation for erythema migrans. To reduce potentially harmful antibiotic overuse by identifying shorter effective treatments, we aimed to assess whether oral doxycycline for 7 days is non-inferior to 14 days in adults with solitary erythema migrans.

Methods

In this randomised open-label non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients with a solitary erythema at the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, immunosuppressed, allergic to doxycycline, or had received antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity within 10 days preceding enrolment or had additional manifestations of Lyme borreliosis Adults were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days or 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as persistent erythema, new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, or borrelial isolation on skin re-biopsy at 2 months, in a per-protocol analysis (the population that completed the assigned doxycycline regimen according to the study protocol and did not receive any other antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity until the 2-month visit). The non-inferiority margin was 6 percentage points. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who followed the study protocol and were evaluable at the 14-day visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03153267.

Findings

Between July 3, 2017, and Oct 2, 2018, we enrolled 300 patients (150 per group: median age 56 years [IQR 47–65]; 126 [45%] of 300 male; skin culture positive 72 [30%] of 239 assessed). 295 patients completed antibiotic therapy as per protocol and 294 (98%) patients were evaluable 2 months post-enrolment. Five (3%) of 147 patients from the 7-day group versus 3 (2%) of 147 patients from the 14-day group (one patient did not attend the 2-month visit and was unreachable by telephone) had treatment failure manifesting as persistence of erythema (difference 1.4 percentage points; upper limit of one-sided 95% CI 5.2 percentage points; p = 0.64). No patients developed new objective manifestations of Lyme borreliosis during follow-up or had positive repeat skin biopsies. Two (1%) of 150 patients in the 7-day and one (1%) of 150 patients in the 14-day group discontinued therapy due to adverse events.

Interpretation

Our data support 7 days of oral doxycycline for adult European patients with solitary erythema migrans, permitting less antibiotic exposure than current guideline-driven therapy.

Erythema migrans — treatment duration: We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses; if azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States.

IDSA–AAN–ACR Lyme disease — erythema migrans treatment lists oral regimens and durations: Doxycycline for 10 days, amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil for 14 days, or azithromycin for 7 days (range: 5–10). This recommendation applies both to solitary and multiple erythema migrans, and macrolides are considered second line agents that should be reserved for patients in whom other antibiotic classes are contraindicated.

Lyme disease erythema migrans — oral antibiotic selection and special populations: Based on clinical trial and susceptibility data, the 3 widely used oral antibiotics in North America, doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, appear to have similar efficacy for erythema migrans, and azithromycin has been found to be effective clinically and of comparable efficacy in all trials except for 1, whose worse outcomes compared with amoxicillin in the United States are noted as unclear and may reflect that 14% of enrolled subjects had southern tick-associated rash illness rather than Lyme disease. For suspected early Lyme disease presenting as an acute febrile illness without an erythema migrans skin lesion, the same antibiotic regimen as used for erythema migrans should be effective, but there is a lack of systematic studies. In children, although the AAP recommends doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for erythema migrans in children of any age, some clinicians would reserve doxycycline for young children who cannot tolerate beta-lactam antibiotics, and the decision to use doxycycline in young children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women without beta-lactam contraindication should be individualized and made with careful deliberation; further study is needed to establish the safety profile of doxycycline in children and in pregnant and lactating women.

### Does this patient have erythema migrans? [^114cziPc]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Erythema migrans, while not pathognomonic, is the most common manifestation of early Lyme disease. Accurate diagnosis of this rash is essential to initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Objective

To determine the sensitivity of history and physical examination characteristics for the diagnosis of erythema migrans.

Data Sources

Structured MEDLINE searches of articles written only in English, 1966 through March 2007.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they enrolled at least 15 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of erythema migrans and reported original data regarding the history and physical examination characteristics of the patients.

Data Extraction

One author abstracted data from the studies.

Results

We separately analyzed the studies from Europe and analyzed both Lyme-endemic and nonendemic areas of the United States to search for potential differences in the clinical presentation. Thirty-two studies from Europe, 20 studies from the United States, and 1 from Europe and the United States met inclusion criteria for a total of 8493 patients. Sensitivity was calculated for each of the variables. No studies included patients without erythema migrans, so specificity data and likelihood ratios could not be determined. Many patients do not recall a tick bite. Associated systemic symptoms, such as fever and headache, are frequently reported. Nausea and vomiting are rare. A solitary lesion is the most frequent presentation in both US (81%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 72%-87%) and European patients (88%; 95% CI, 81%-93%). Central clearing is less common in the endemic United States (19%; 95% CI, 11%-32%) vs Europe (79%; 95% CI, 69%-86%) and the nonendemic United States (80%; 95% CI, 63%-90%).

Conclusions

Our analysis of the current available literature suggests that there is no single element in the history or physical examination that is highly sensitive by itself for the diagnosis of erythema migrans. Clinicians should be aware of the wide variability in the clinical presentation of erythema migrans and the need to factor in multiple components of the clinical examination and epidemiological context.

If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2 to 3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample.

### To test or not to test? Laboratory support for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis: a position paper of ESGBOR, the ESCMID study group for Lyme borreliosis [^1133s75b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The most frequent clinical manifestations are erythema migrans and Lyme neuroborreliosis. Currently, a large volume of diagnostic testing for LB is reported, whereas the incidence of clinically relevant disease manifestations is low. This indicates overuse of diagnostic testing for LB with implications for patient care and cost-effective health management.

Aim

The recommendations provided in this review are intended to support both the clinical diagnosis and initiatives for a more rational use of laboratory testing in patients with clinically suspected LB.

Sources

This is a narrative review combining various aspects of the clinical and laboratory diagnosis with an educational purpose. The literature search was based on existing systematic reviews, national and international guidelines and supplemented with specific citations.

Implications

The main recommendations according to current European case definitions for LB are as follows. Typical erythema migrans should be diagnosed clinically and does not require laboratory testing. The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis requires laboratory investigation of the spinal fluid including intrathecal antibody production, and the remaining disease manifestations require testing for serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Testing individuals with non-specific subjective symptoms is not recommended, because of a low positive predictive value.

### Comparison of phenoxymethylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and doxycycline for erythema migrans in general practice. A randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up [^115T4ecD]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the three most commonly used antibiotics for erythema migrans (EM) in Norwegian primary care.

Methods

A randomized, parallel, controlled trial was carried out. Treatments were open to the patients, but blinded for the GPs and investigators. Patients eligible for inclusion were aged ≥ 18 years and clinically diagnosed with EM. Block randomization was processed in blocks of six. Patients were assigned to receive one of three antibiotic treatments for 14 days: phenoxymethylpenicillin (PCV), amoxicillin, or doxycycline. The primary outcome was the duration of EM in days in the three treatment groups. Patients kept a diary for the 14 days of treatment, in which they registered concomitant symptoms and side effects. The patients consulted their GP after 14 days of treatment and had a 1-year follow-up to monitor any development of disseminated Lyme borreliosis (LB). EMs with a duration of more than 14 days were followed until resolution. ClinicalTrials.govNCT01368341 and EU Clinical Trials Register 2010–023747–15.

Results

One hundred and eighty eight patients (PCV: n = 56, amoxicillin: n = 64, doxycycline: n = 68) were included by 44 Norwegian general practitioners (GPs) from June 2011 to November 2013. Follow-up was completed by December 2014. The median duration of EM was altogether 14 days (range 3–293). For the PCV group median duration was 14 days (range 5–91), for amoxicillin 13 days (range 4–179) and for doxycycline 14 days (range 3–293). The duration of EM did not differ significantly between the three antibiotic groups (p 0.277). None of the patients developed disseminated LB within the 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

We did not find 14 days of PCV, doxycycline, and amoxicillin treatments to differ in effectiveness or safety in the treatment of clinically diagnosed EM in primary care.

Clinical Considerations and Common Pitfalls

Timing of Testing — Window Period

As with all serologic tests, clinicians must consider the timing of a patient's illness when ordering and interpreting Lyme disease tests. Serologic analysis has low sensitivity during the first few weeks of infection while the antibody response is still developing. This period is known as the window period and is common to all serologic tests. Patients with illnesses suspicious for early Lyme disease but lacking typical EM can present a diagnostic dilemma because serologic test results might be negative at this point. In these cases, treatment can be administered at the discretion of the clinician, but serologic analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis (Figures 2, 3).

Figure 3
Clinical approach to diagnosis of early Lyme disease, United States. *See Figure 1. †Given the gradual geographic expansion of Lyme disease, testing may be warranted for patients with signs and symptoms of Lyme disease who were exposed in areas that border known disease-endemic regions. ‡For a more detailed discussion of symptoms as they relate to pretest probability, see section on exposure and pretest probability. §For recommended 2-tiered testing protocol, see Figure 2. STARI, Southern tick−associated rash illness; EM, erythema migrans.

Background Seropositivity

Background seropositivity is a major consideration when testing for Lyme disease. In a seroepidemiologic study conducted in New York, 5% of study participants were found to have antibodies against B. burgdorferi. Seropositivity can result from previous exposure because IgM and IgG against B. burgdorferi can remain for many years after initial infection (which, incidentally, is why serologic testing is not useful as a test of cure). However, in the seroepidemiologic study in New York, 59% of seropositive patients denied a prior diagnosis of Lyme disease. In such persons, seropositivity might indicate a false-positive result or be due to a prior undiagnosed infection that either resolved spontaneously or was treated incidentally with antimicrobial drugs prescribed for another indication.

Reinfection

Because of antibody persistence, serologic diagnosis of patients with possible reinfection poses a major dilemma for clinicians. In cases of suspected reinfection, a detailed history and physical examination, including a thorough skin examination, are essential because most patients will have EM. For patients without EM, serologic analysis is still recommended but results should be interpreted with caution. In these cases, it might be helpful to conduct acute-phase and convalescent-phase serologic analysis to detect an increase in EIA titer or an increase in the number of antibody bands that might indicate active infection.

### Notes from the field: update on Lyme carditis, groups at high risk, and frequency of associated sudden cardiac death – United States [^114uxf3A]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

This report describes the investigation performed by state public health partners and CDC to define high-risk groups and the frequency of death in patients with Lyme carditis. In reported cases, sudden cardiac death remains infrequent when Lyme carditis is recognized and treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, two additional suspected sudden cardiac deaths associated with Lyme carditis were discovered, bringing the total number of cases identified during this investigation to five (three confirmed [1] and two suspected). These cases highlight the public health and clinical challenge that Lyme carditis poses and the need for better primary prevention strategies.

Health care providers should consider Lyme disease as a cause of cardiac symptoms in patients who live in or have visited a high-incidence Lyme disease region, especially during summer and fall months and regardless of whether the patient reports erythema migrans. Additionally, health care providers should investigate the potential for cardiac involvement in patients who have other signs or symptoms of Lyme disease, particularly if they report chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or syncope. Patients with Lyme carditis should be diagnosed and treated according to current treatment guidelines. It is recommended that health care providers remind patients at risk for Lyme disease about common signs and symptoms † and steps they can take to prevent infection. § Patients who think they might have Lyme disease or Lyme carditis are encouraged to see their health care provider promptly.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^116oEMi8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Early Lyme Disease

Two adequate and well-controlled trials were performed in subjects with early Lyme disease. All subjects presented with physician-documented erythema migrans, with or without systemic manifestations of infection. Subjects were assessed at 1 month posttreatment for success in treating early Lyme disease (Part I) and at 1 year posttreatment for success in preventing the progression to the sequelae of late Lyme disease (Part II).

A total of 355 adult subjects (181 treated with cefuroxime axetil and 174 treated with doxycycline) were randomized in the 2 trials, with diagnosis of early Lyme disease confirmed in 79% (281/355). The clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease in these subjects was validated by 1) blinded expert reading of photographs, when available, of the pretreatment erythema migrans skin lesion, and 2) serologic confirmation (using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunoblot assay ["Western" blot]) of the presence of antibodies specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. The efficacy data in Table 11 are specific to this "validated" patient subset, while the safety data below reflect the entire patient population for the 2 trials. Clinical data for evaluable subjects in the "validated" patient subset are shown in Table 11.

Cefuroxime axetil and doxycycline were effective in prevention of the development of sequelae of late Lyme disease.

While the incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse reactions was similar in the 2 treatment groups (cefuroxime axetil - 13%; doxycycline - 11%), the incidence of drug-related diarrhea was higher in the cefuroxime axetil arm versus the doxycycline arm (11% versus 3%, respectively).

Erythema migrans (EM) is the most common objective manifestation of Lyme disease, accounting for about 90% of cases. Establishing the diagnosis of EM is important because appropriate treatment with oral antibiotics at an early stage of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi results in excellent outcomes. This article includes a discussion of the epidemiology of EM and its clinical, differential, and laboratory diagnosis. The treatment of EM and the prevention of Lyme disease are also discussed.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease — testing approach and practical limitations in early erythema migrans — In untreated patients with erythema migrans of short duration (2 weeks or less), none of the currently available serologic or direct detection tests is sufficiently sensitive for accurate diagnostic use, necessitating clinical diagnosis, though in atypical lesions laboratory testing may aid assessment. If the patient will not be treated empirically, the most practical approach is serologic testing on an acute-phase serum sample or, if negative, paired samples collected at least 2–3 weeks apart; an alternative or supplement is direct detection of B. burgdorferi, which is generally more sensitive at the time of initial clinical presentation compared with acute-phase single-sample serology. The most potentially useful direct detection method is real-time PCR for B. burgdorferi on a skin punch biopsy of at least 2-mm diameter, but it is not standardized, is typically available only at large reference laboratories because currently there are no FDA-cleared molecular assays, and shipping can increase turnaround time by several days; plasma or serum PCR baseline sensitivity is generally ≤ 50% at initial presentation, cultures may require long incubation periods sometimes exceeding 8 weeks, and PCR directly on blood is substantially less sensitive than PCR on skin lesion samples.

### The impact of immunosuppression on erythema migrans. A retrospective study of clinical presentation, response to treatment and production of Borrelia antibodies in 33 patients [^1111ycsW]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the potential influence of immunosuppression on erythema migrans, the hallmark of early Lyme borreliosis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study to assess the impact of immunosuppression on erythema migrans in 33 patients with a malignant or autoimmune disease, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation. Only patients with active disease status and/or current immunosuppressive therapy were included. Pre-treatment clinical parameters, such as presentation of the skin lesion and presence of extracutaneous signs and symptoms, the disease course during a median follow-up of 9 months after therapy and serum anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies before therapy and by the end of follow-up in the 33 immunosuppressed patients were statistically compared with 75 otherwise healthy patients with erythema migrans. The 75 control patients were matched for sex, age and antibiotic therapy.

Results

With the exception of the site of erythema migrans lesions, which were found more often on the trunk than on the legs in the immunosuppressed patients (vice versa in immunocompetent patients), we found no significant differences for all investigated parameters between the two groups.

Conclusions

It appears that immunosuppression does not influence clinical presentation, response to therapy, or production of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies of patients with erythema migrans. It is thus not necessary to treat immunosuppressed patients with erythema migrans differently from immunocompetent patients.

### Assessment of antibiotic prescriptions for Lyme disease after modification of reporting language for positive screening test results [^116sgDaJ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The revised Lyme disease ELISA test result text resulted in a 70% decrease in tests in which the patient was treated without confirmed Lyme disease at a practice using the standard 2-tiered testing algorithm. This simple low-cost intervention may be associated with a substantial reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use for Lyme disease. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of Lyme disease have been associated with antibiotic adverse effects, expenses, and delays in appropriate diagnosis. At the population level, antibiotic overuse may accelerate antibiotic resistance.

This study has limitations. First, we did not have clinical information about patients with positive ELISA test results and may have misclassified some appropriate treatments (eg, patients with erythema migrans and a positive ELISA result but negative WB result). Some antibiotics ordered may not have been prescribed for Lyme disease. However, we do not expect the frequency of misclassification to have changed before vs after the intervention. Second, the demographic characteristics and treatment frequency for patients at CHA differed from patients at Atrius. While confounding may explain baseline differences in antibiotic prescribing between the sites, it would not explain the change found at Atrius after their modifications to the reporting language.

The findings of this quality improvement study suggest the potential utility of shifting the way in which test results are reported for changing clinician prescribing behavior.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113XNPPA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Lyme disease — diagnostic testing selection and performance note that, given the risk of co-transmission, testing for multiple endemic pathogens should be considered by clinicians, but early localized LD is most commonly diagnosed clinically because erythema migrans occurs in approximately 70%-80% of patients and diagnostic testing in patients with a characteristic EM rash and appropriate exposure history is contraindicated. Culture of tissue biopsies is no longer routinely performed due to variable sensitivity (60%-90%) and long turnaround time. Although nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is available, performance on whole blood, other blood fractions, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for LD or neuroinvasive LD is not recommended due to low sensitivity (range: 18%-22.5%). NAAT has the highest clinical yield when performed on erythema migrans tissue biopsies (median sensitivity 68%) or synovial fluid (median sensitivity 77.5%) for suspected LD arthritis. For classic "bulls-eye" EM with recent tick exposure, a diagnosis of LD solely based on EM is sufficient, and in suspected joint infection serologic testing will be positive in nearly all patients, which in many cases limits the need for additional molecular testing on synovial fluid; in suspected neuroinvasive LD, current recommendations include serologic assessment in blood and CSF using an antibody index assay.

### Diagnosis and management of Lyme disease [^114ngnnq]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. Transmission occurs primarily through the bite of an infected deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Identification of an erythema migrans rash following a tick bite is the only clinical manifestation sufficient to make the diagnosis of Lyme disease in the absence of laboratory confirmation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a two-tier serologic testing protocol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay initially, followed by the more specific Western blot to confirm the diagnosis when the assay samples are positive or equivocal. The treatment of Lyme disease is determined mainly by the clinical manifestations of the disease. Doxycycline is often the preferred agent for oral treatment because of its activity against other tick-borne illnesses. Preventive measures include avoiding areas with high tick burdens, wearing protective clothing, using tick repellants (e.g., diethyltoluamide [DEET]), performing frequent body checks and bathing following outdoor activities, and instituting environmental landscape modifications (e.g., grass mowing, deer exclusion fencing) to reduce the tick burden. Although there is controversy regarding treatment of post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease, there is no biologic or clinical trial evidence indicating that prolonged antibiotic therapy is of benefit.

### Tick-borne disease [^113HfHxg]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne diseases in the United States include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, and relapsing fever. It is important for family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. A petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Various other rashes or skin lesions accompanied by fever and influenza-like illness also may signal the presence of a tick-borne disease. Early, accurate diagnosis allows treatment that may help prevent significant morbidity and possible mortality. Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases.

Early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) clinical features — The most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease is an expanding, erythematous, often annular skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans, which occurs at the site of inoculation of B. burgdorferi into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Patients with erythema migrans may have concomitant constitutional symptoms (~65% in the US and ~37% in Europe), such as fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and headache. In untreated patients, the spirochetal bacteria may disseminate to other anatomic sites leading to regional lymphadenopathy, additional erythema migrans skin lesions, certain neurologic and cardiac manifestations, and/or arthritis.

### Diagnosis of Lyme disease [^114KtSDv]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Lyme disease:

- **Definition**: Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease that principally affects the skin, nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and heart.
- **Pathophysiology**: Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinni.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of Lyme disease in the US is estimated at 15.9–381.4 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The host-pathogen interaction elicits an inflammatory response with the production of cytokines, matrix glycosaminoglycans, extracellular matrix proteins, antibodies resulting in erythema migrans, and dissemination of the disease leads to multiple erythema migrans, meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, carditis, and arthritis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil are about 90% effective in treating erythema migrans.

### Azithromycin is equally effective as amoxicillin in children with solitary erythema migrans [^113Y34Qo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Comparison of clinical efficacy and adverse effects of treatment with azithromycin and amoxicillin in children with solitary erythema migrans (EM).

Methods

Consecutive patients younger than 15 years with untreated solitary EM referred to our institution 2002–2003 were included in this unblinded prospective clinical study in which patients were alternatively treated with either azithromycin for 5 days or amoxicillin for 14 days. The efficacy of treatment of acute disease, development of minor and major manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and adverse effects of treatment were surveyed by follow-up visits during the first year after inclusion.

Results

Eighty-four patients received azithromycin and 84 amoxicillin. Pretreatment characteristics in the 2 groups were comparable with the exception that patients in azithromycin group more often reported a tick bite at the site of later EM (69% versus 52%; P = 0.0400), had more often EM on the trunk (50% versus 26%; P = 0.0025) and reported longer duration of symptoms (median 3 versus 2 days; P = 0.0283). The posttreatment period revealed no significant differences between azithromycin and amoxicillin groups including the duration of EM (median 3 days; P = 0.8984) and the appearance of minor (12% versus 21%; P = 0.2146) and major manifestations (2.6% in each group) of Lyme borreliosis. Adverse effects of treatment were observed in 21% of patients treated with azithromycin and in 16% treated with amoxicillin, and the appearance of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction was recorded in 7% and 15%, respectively (P = 0.1438).

Conclusions

Comparison of azithromycin and amoxicillin for the treatment of children with solitary EM revealed comparable efficacy and adverse effects of treatment.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^113AMmuK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is a tickborne disease caused by spirochetes within the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. mayonii and is transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes scapularis or I. pacificus ticks (commonly known as blacklegged ticks). Lyme disease is the most common vectorborne disease in the United States and causes an estimated 300,000 illnesses annually. Cases occur primarily in the northeast and upper midwest regions (Figure 1); however, ecologic and environmental changes have catalyzed a gradual geographic expansion.

Figure 1
Lyme disease cases (black dots) reported by surveillance, United States, 2005–2010. One dot is placed randomly within the county of residence for each confirmed case. States with the highest incidence of clinician-diagnosed Lyme disease in a large health insurance claims database (gray areas) are also shown. Transmission also occurs in small regions of northern California, Oregon, and Washington. Adapted from.

There are 3 stages of B. burgdorferi infection: early localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated. The classic sign of localized infection is erythema migrans (EM), which is defined as a gradually expanding annular lesion > 5 cm in diameter. Approximately 70%–80% of persons with Lyme disease have EM. Accompanying signs and symptoms might include fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, or arthralgias. If the infection is not treated, the bacteria might spread hematogenously and cause early disseminated Lyme disease, which can manifest as multiple EM skin lesions, facial palsy, meningitis, or carditis. Recurrent large-joint arthritis is the hallmark of late disseminated disease. Late neurologic Lyme disease is uncommon in the United States. Symptoms might include peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, or encephalomyelitis.

### Comparative study of cefuroxime axetil versus amoxicillin in children with early Lyme disease [^1162CoHg]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Cefuroxime axetil has been shown to have efficacy comparable to doxycycline in adults with early Lyme disease (LD). Because of toxicity, doxycycline is usually avoided in children. For children who are unable to tolerate amoxicillin, there is currently no proven alternative oral therapy for LD. This randomized, unblinded study compared 2 dosage regimens of cefuroxime axetil (20 mg/kg/d and 30 mg/kg/d) with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d), each given for 20 days. Children were enrolled if they were 6 months to 12 years of age, had erythema migrans, and met other eligibility requirements. Serologic testing occurred at entry and after 6 months. Follow-up evaluations for safety, tolerability, and efficacy occurred at 10 and 20 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Forty-three children were randomized (13 in the amoxicillin group, 15 in each cefuroxime axetil group); 39 completed 12 months of follow-up. At the completion of treatment, there was total resolution of erythema migrans in 67% of the amoxicillin group, 92% of the low-dose cefuroxime group, and 87% of the high-dose cefuroxime group, and resolution of constitutional symptoms occurred in 100%, 69%, and 87%, respectively. All patients had a good outcome, with no long-term problems associated with LD. One patient, who was well at the first 2 follow-up visits, was treated with doxycycline because of new constitutional symptoms. Mild diarrhea occurred in a small number of participants in each group (1 patient was diagnosed and treated for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which occurred after completing the full course of study medication). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred. The number of patients in this trial was not sufficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups; however, both amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil seem to be safe, efficacious treatments for children with early LD.

### Electronic health record data for Lyme disease surveillance, Massachusetts, USA, 2017–2018 [^114oHXYX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of EHR-based algorithm criteria for Lyme disease, we observed that a diagnosis code for Lyme disease and a prescription for a relevant antibiotic within 14 days, or a positive Western blot was associated with high sensitivity (100%) and PPV (82%) for chart review–confirmed Lyme disease in accordance with CSTE criteria.

A key challenge with Lyme disease surveillance using EHR data is that no 1 criterion is both sensitive and specific. Diagnosis codes are variably assigned to patients and do not reliably differentiate between current acute disease versus remote resolved disease. Combining this criterion with an antibiotic prescription, however, increased positive predictive value. Likewise, surveillance using Lyme disease test results alone is imperfect. A first-tier Lyme disease EIA is prone to false positives and misses infections diagnosed clinically and treated empirically without testing. Indeed, Lyme disease guidelines recommend treating patients in disease-endemic areas who have a classic erythema migrans rash without performing any laboratory tests. Likewise, focusing surveillance on second-tier Western blots alone is specific but misses patients for whom the Western blot is not ordered.

### Lyme disease: part I. advances and perspectives [^114UQ4XD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Lyme disease (LD) is an increasingly recognized multisystem, insect-borne zoonosis. Prevalent worldwide, it has a variety of presentations at different stages of infection. The characteristic rash with central clearing known as erythema chronicum migrans, or simply erythema migrans, appears in its first stage. Typical features may be absent, and important variations are evident among cases seen in different parts of the world. LD may be difficult to diagnose clinically; knowledge about its epidemiology and transmission may be of assistance when the diagnosis is unclear. Based upon our experience with LD and a comprehensive literature review, we provide an update of LD epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management. We also cover the three clinical stages of LD that parallel those of syphilis, another spirochetal disease.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^1139tBpJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans by blacklegged ticks. Patients with an erythema migrans lesion and epidemiologic risk can receive a diagnosis without laboratory testing. For all other patients, laboratory testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but proper interpretation depends on symptoms and timing of illness. The recommended laboratory test in the United States is 2-tiered serologic analysis consisting of an enzyme-linked immunoassay or immunofluorescence assay, followed by reflexive immunoblotting. Sensitivity of 2-tiered testing is low (30%-40%) during early infection while the antibody response is developing (window period). For disseminated Lyme disease, sensitivity is 70%-100%. Specificity is high (> 95%) during all stages of disease. Use of other diagnostic tests for Lyme disease is limited. We review the rationale behind current US testing guidelines, appropriate use and interpretation of tests, and recent developments in Lyme disease diagnostics.

### Erythema migrans [^117JzmuC]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Erythema migrans (EM) is the most common objective manifestation of Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Systemic symptoms are usually present. Most patients do not recall a preceding tick bite. Despite a characteristic appearance, EM is not pathognomonic for Lyme disease and must be distinguished from other similar appearing skin lesions. EM is a clinical diagnosis; serologic and PCR assays are unnecessary. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are indicative of either an alternative diagnosis, or coinfection with another tick-borne pathogen. When EM is promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobial agents, the prognosis is excellent. Persons in endemic areas should take measures to prevent tick bites.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis — diagnosis and treatment emphasize that babesiosis has no easily recognized clinical features such as the erythema migrans skin lesion of Lyme disease; a diagnosis should be considered in a patient who resides in or has traveled to an endemic area, experiences clinical symptoms that are consistent with babesiosis, and has characteristic laboratory test abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with the identification of Babesia parasites by microscopic evaluation of blood smears or amplification of Babesia DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and the diagnosis of acute babesiosis cannot be confirmed solely by the presence of Babesia antibody in a serum sample collected at a single time point. Treatment with a combination of atovaquone plus azithromycin for 7 to 10 days achieves cure in most cases, delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with severe disease, and prolonged antibiotic therapy should be reserved for highly immunocompromised patients.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: a review [^113LzWnx]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), and babesiosis are emerging tick-borne infections.

Objective

To provide an update on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tick-borne infections.

Evidence Review

Search of PubMed and Scopus for articles on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of tick-borne infections published in English from January 2005 through December 2015.

Findings

The search yielded 3550 articles for diagnosis and treatment and 752 articles for prevention. Of these articles, 361 were reviewed in depth. Evidence supports the use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved serologic tests, such as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), followed by Western blot testing, to diagnose extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme disease. Microscopy and polymerase chain reaction assay of blood specimens are used to diagnose active HGA and babesiosis. The efficacy of oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil for treating Lyme disease has been established in multiple trials. Ceftriaxone is recommended when parenteral antibiotic therapy is recommended. Multiple trials have shown efficacy for a 10-day course of oral doxycycline for treatment of erythema migrans and for a 14-day course for treatment of early neurologic Lyme disease in ambulatory patients. Evidence indicates that a 10-day course of oral doxycycline is effective for HGA and that a 7- to 10-day course of azithromycin plus atovaquone is effective for mild babesiosis. Based on multiple case reports, a 7- to 10-day course of clindamycin plus quinine is often used to treat severe babesiosis. A recent study supports a minimum of 6 weeks of antibiotics for highly immunocompromised patients with babesiosis, with no parasites detected on blood smear for at least the final 2 weeks of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence is evolving regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, HGA, and babesiosis. Recent evidence supports treating patients with erythema migrans for no longer than 10 days when doxycycline is used and prescription of a 14-day course of oral doxycycline for early neurologic Lyme disease in ambulatory patients. The duration of antimicrobial therapy for babesiosis in severely immunocompromised patients should be extended to 6 weeks or longer.

In this trial and in a supporting maxillary puncture trial, 15 evaluable patients had non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae as the identified pathogen. Ten (10) of these 15 patients (67%) had their pathogen (non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae) eradicated. Eighteen (18) evaluable patients had Streptococcus pneumoniae as the identified pathogen. Fifteen (15) of these 18 patients (83%) had their pathogen (Streptococcus pneumoniae) eradicated.

Safety: The incidence of drug-related gastrointestinal adverse events was statistically significantly higher in the control arm (an oral antimicrobial agent that contained a specific beta-lactamase inhibitor) versus the cefuroxime axetil arm (12% versus 1%, respectively; P < .001), particularly drug-related diarrhea (8% versus 1%, respectively; p = 0.001).

Early Lyme Disease: Two adequate and well-controlled studies were performed in patients with early Lyme disease. In these studies all patients had to present with physician-documented erythema migrans, with or without systemic manifestations of infection. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 20-day course of treatment with cefuroxime axetil 500 mg twice daily or doxycycline 100 mg 3 times daily. Patients were assessed at 1 month posttreatment for success in treating early Lyme disease (Part I) and at 1 year posttreatment for success in preventing the progression to the sequelae of late Lyme disease (Part II).

STARI — epidemiology and etiologic evidence indicates that STARI has been reported predominantly in the southeastern and south-central United States, where the lone star tick is the most abundant human-biting tick, and that lone star ticks are not able to transmit B. burgdorferi. To date, no infectious agent has been identified in STARI patients, except in 1 instance where B. lonestari was detected by PCR in a skin lesion and in the lone star tick that had bitten the patient. Recent data suggest that STARI and Lyme disease–associated erythema migrans produce different host metabolic biosignatures, there are no known extracutaneous sequelae associated with STARI, and it remains unknown whether antibiotic treatment affords clinical benefit or which antibiotics would be useful.

### Management of tick bites and early Lyme disease: a survey of Connecticut physicians [^116TRmuF]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines have been published for the treatment of Lyme disease (LD). These guidelines have been challenged as inadequate. Two common LD management problems are antibiotic prophylaxis of deer tick bites (deer ticks may carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes LD) and antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, the pathognomonic rash of LD. A 1-page questionnaire was sent to a 13% (573/4300) sample of Connecticut physicians to define how they treat deer tick bites and erythema migrans. Questionnaires were returned by 320 (56%) of 573 physicians. Questionnaires were analyzed for the 267 physicians who saw patients with LD. Seventy (26%) of the 267 surveyed physicians prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with tick bites. B burgdorferi serology was ordered by 31% of physicians for patients with tick bites. Most surveyed physicians treated erythema migrans with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a mean of 21 days. Serology was ordered by 49% of physicians for patients with erythema migrans. Most physicians did not use prophylaxis for patients with deer tick bites. In addition, most of the physicians surveyed followed established guidelines for treating patients with erythema migrans. However, many of the physicians surveyed do serologic testing for patients with tick bites and/or erythema migrans. Serologic testing for these patients is usually not necessary.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for early Lyme disease. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116bvzsy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of patients with early Lyme disease has trended toward longer duration despite the absence of supporting clinical trials.

Objective

To evaluate different durations of oral doxycycline treatment and the combination of oral doxycycline and a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of patients with early Lyme disease.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Single-center university hospital.

Patients

180 patients with erythema migrans.

Intervention

Ten days of oral doxycycline, with or without a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, or 20 days of oral doxycycline.

Measurements

Outcome was based on clinical observations and neurocognitive testing. Efficacy was assessed at 20 days, 3 months, 12 months, and 30 months.

Results

At all time points, the complete response rate was similar for the three treatment groups in both on-study and intention-to-treat analyses. In the on-study analysis, the complete response rate at 30 months was 83.9% in the 20-day doxycycline group, 90.3% in the 10-day doxycycline group, and 86.5% in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (P > 0.2). The only patient with treatment failure (10-day doxycycline group) developed meningitis on day 18. There were no significant differences in the results of neurocognitive testing among the three treatment groups and a separate control group without Lyme disease. Diarrhea occurred significantly more often in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (35%) than in either of the other two groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Extending treatment with doxycycline from 10 to 20 days or adding one dose of ceftriaxone to the beginning of a 10-day course of doxycycline did not enhance therapeutic efficacy in patients with erythema migrans. Regardless of regimen, objective evidence of treatment failure was extremely rare.

Lyme disease coinfections — epidemiology and treatment considerations — Among patients presenting with B. burgdorferi infection, the rate of human granulocytic anaplasmosis coinfection varies between 2.0% and 11.7%, and epidemiologic studies in endemic areas suggest that about 2–10% (range 2%-40%) of early Lyme disease patients experience babesiosis coinfection. In North America, there are 6 different pathogens besides B. burgdorferi that are transmitted by I. scapularis ticks; three of them, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, and Ehrlichia muris eauclarensis (the latter only endemic to the Midwest region of the US), require special treatment considerations in patients presenting with erythema migrans. Beta-lactam antibiotics are ineffective for A. phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia muris eauclarensis, and B. microti infections, doxycycline is highly effective against both A. phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia muris eauclarensis and is the treatment of choice for these infections, B. microti infections will require specific antimicrobial treatment, and other potential coinfections include B. miyamotoi and B. mayonii, which are treated with the same antibiotic regimens as Lyme disease, and Powassan virus/deer tick virus infections for which treatment is mainly supportive.

Introduction

Early-stage Lyme-associated erythema migrans most commonly manifests as a targetoid patch.

### Subjective symptoms after treatment of early Lyme disease [^111e7X7B]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists over the significance and even the existence of post-Lyme disease symptoms because of the high rate of similar background symptoms in the general population.

Methods

A European, prospective clinical trial in which doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil were compared in the treatment of adult patients with erythema migrans included a control group to address this question. Evaluations of patients were conducted at baseline, 14 days, and 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Control subjects were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Subjective symptoms that newly developed or intensified since the onset of erythema migrans or the date of enrollment for controls were referred to as "new or increased symptoms".

Results

Doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil had comparable efficacy. At both 6 and 12 months, the frequency of new or increased symptoms in patients with erythema migrans did not exceed the frequency of such symptoms in a control group of individuals of similar gender and age without a clinical history of Lyme disease. At 12 months after enrollment, only 5 (2.2%) of 230 evaluable patients reported new or increased symptoms, and in none of the patients were these symptoms of sufficient severity to be functionally disabling.

Conclusion

No significant differences were identified between doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of European patients with erythema migrans. The frequency of nonspecific symptoms in patients did not exceed that of a control group at ≥ 6 months after enrollment. We advocate inclusion of appropriate non-Lyme disease control groups in future studies in which nonspecific subjective symptoms are assessed after antibiotic therapy.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Lyme disease, more specifically with respect to testing for erythema migrans, AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to make a clinical diagnosis rather than obtain laboratory testing in patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have one or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans.

### Tickborne diseases: diagnosis and management [^113At6N3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Tickborne diseases that affect patients in the United States include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, and tickborne relapsing fever. Tickborne diseases are increasing in incidence and should be suspected in patients presenting with flulike symptoms during the spring and summer months. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and death. Location of exposure, identification of the specific tick vector, and evaluation of rash, if present, help identify the specific disease. Lyme disease presents with an erythema migrans rash in 70% to 80% of patients, and treatment may be initiated based on this finding alone. RMSF presents with a macular rash starting on the wrists, forearms, and ankles that becomes petechial. RMSF has a higher rate of mortality than other tickborne diseases; therefore, empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended for all patients, including pregnant women and children, when high clinical suspicion is present. Testing patient-retrieved ticks for infections is not recommended. Counseling patients on the use of protective clothing and tick repellents during outdoor activities can help minimize the risk of infection. Prophylactic treatment after tick exposure in patients without symptoms is generally not recommended but may be considered within 72 hours of tick removal in specific patients at high risk of Lyme disease.

### Late disseminated Lyme disease: associated pathology and spirochete persistence posttreatment in rhesus macaques [^112riB9k]. The American Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

The first well-documented indication of Lyme disease (LD) in the United States occurred in the early 1970s, manifesting as an outbreak of asymmetric large joint oligoarthritis in the community of Lyme, Connecticut. Steere et alspeculated that the tight geographic clustering in a sparsely populated, heavily wooded area and the peak incidence in the summer and early fall months were suggestive of an arthropod-vectored disease. This hypothesis was later confirmed by Burgdorfer et al, who isolated Treponema -like spirochete bacteria from adult Ixodes dammini (scapularis) ticks on Shelter Island, New York. The spirochetes were named Borrelia burgdorferi after their discoverer. Currently, LD is known to be caused by multiple closely related genospecies classified within the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex, representing the most common tickborne human disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Although approximately 30,000 physician-reported cases occur annually in the United States, the annual incidence has been estimated to be 10-fold higher by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Current antibiotic therapy guidelines outlined by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) are successful in the treatment of LD for most patients with LD, especially when administered early in disease immediately after identification of erythema migrans (EM). Although EM is considered an early localized reaction and clinical hallmark of LD, EM is not pathognomonic and is not observed in 100% of cases, which results in delays in treatment that range from weeks to months after initial exposure. Chronic subjective symptoms (ie, musculoskeletal pains, cognitive dysfunction, radicular pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, and/or fatigue) and, less commonly, objective clinical signs (ie, arthritis and/or neurologic deficits), which remain for months to years after completion of recommended antibiotic therapy in patients with well-documented LD, are classified into posttreatment LD syndrome (PTLDS).

Development of clinical recommendations — All recommendations are labeled "strong" or "weak", and the words "we recommend" indicate strong recommendations while "we suggest" indicate weak recommendations. For recommendations in which comparators are not formally stated, the comparison is implicitly "not using the intervention" (either not using a specific treatment or diagnostic test). Strong recommendations in the setting of lower-quality evidence were only assigned when panelists believed they conformed to paradigmatic conditions, including that low-quality evidence suggested benefit in a life-threatening situation or when low-quality evidence suggested benefit and high-quality evidence suggested harm. For good practice statements, identification and wording followed the GRADE working group, and a good practice statement is described as necessary to healthcare practice, supported by a large body of indirect evidence, and indicating that implementation would clearly result in large net positive consequences.

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 10 days versus 15 days [^117GdokU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of 10-day doxycycline treatment in patients with erythema migrans has been assessed in the United States but not in Europe. Experts disagree on the significance of post-Lyme borreliosis symptoms.

Methods

In a noninferiority trial, the efficacies of 10 days and 15 days of oral doxycycline therapy were evaluated in adult European patients with erythema migrans. The prevalence of nonspecific symptoms was compared between patients with erythema migrans and 81 control subjects without a history of Lyme borreliosis. The efficacy of treatment, determined on the basis of clinical observations and microbiologic tests, was assessed at 14 days and at 2, 6, and 12 months. Nonspecific symptoms in patients and controls were compared at 6 months after enrollment.

Results

A total of 117 patients (52%) were treated with doxycycline for 15 days, and 108 (48%) received doxycycline for 10 days. Twelve months after enrollment, 85 of 91 patients (93.4%) in the 15-day group and 79 of 86 (91.9%) in the 10-day group had complete response (difference, 1.6 percentage points; upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 9.1 percentage points). At 6 months, the frequency of nonspecific symptoms in the patients was similar to that among controls.

Conclusions

The 10-day regimen of oral doxycycline was not inferior to the 15-day regimen among adult European patients with solitary erythema migrans. Six months after treatment, the frequency of nonspecific symptoms among erythema migrans patients was similar to that among control subjects.

### Identifying erythema migrans rash in patients with Lyme… [^114njCmV]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Immediately following tick removal, patients often develop an erythematous inflammatory papule as a localized reaction to the bite. It is often misidentified by patients as indicative of Lyme infection, which may take five to 10 days or longer to develop and only after the tick has been attached for two to three days. However, other tick-borne agents may be transmitted within the first hour of feeding. Our medical practice diagnoses close to 100 cases of Lyme disease annually. The typical erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease is almost always a solid, blanching, erythematous patch, rather than the bull's-eye appearance. In some instances. Borrelia may produce a necrotic lesion similar to the eschar described in rickettsial infections. Unfortunately, we have treated many patients with Lyme disease who delayed seeking treatment because their rash was not the classic bull's-eye presentation.

IN REPLY: I agree that the classic bull's-eye rash of Lyme disease is not always seen and that, when present, erythema migrans may initially appear as a red annular patch before the characteristic rings develop. The rash often evolves and expands over several weeks. Although it is common for patients to mistake the transient inflammatory papules from recent tick bites for erythema migrans, the lesions differ in size, appearance, and duration. Erythema migrans — with or without the bull's-eye pattern — remains the classic presenting rash for Lyme disease, but only the bull's-eye pattern is pathognomonic. The red patches of developing erythema migrans that Dr. Dardick has observed in patients with early Lyme disease are less diagnostic because they may resemble other common skin conditions, such as contact dermatitis. However, Lyme disease should still be considered in these cases, even when initial test results are negative.

Retesting the patient later will often yield a positive result. When followed over time, many of these lesions eventually develop the classic bull's-eye pattern before fading. In the South, the rash of southern tick-associated rash illness closely mimics the erythema migrans rash of Lyme disease, but both conditions respond to doxycycline. I concur that clinicians need to suspect Lyme disease in high-incidence areas, even when the classic erythema migrans rash is absent or only developing.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Lyme disease — direct detection versus serology in erythema migrans — In patients with solitary or multiple erythema migrans (mean duration of illness ≥ 1 week), the most sensitive acute-phase method before antibiotics was real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on skin biopsy (80.9%), whereas conventional 2-tiered antibody testing on acute-phase serum was least sensitive (40.4%). Intermediate performance included culture of 2 mm skin biopsy samples (51.1%) and high-volume (≥ 9 mL) plasma culture by microscopy (44.9%), with subsequent investigations showing high-volume plasma culture sensitivity might exceed 70% when growth detection was by PCR rather than microscopy. Additional data indicate skin biopsy culture typically shows approximately 40–60% sensitivity, with some reports exceeding 70%, and plasma whole-blood PCR sensitivities are mostly in the 30–50% range in the United States, with lower yields also reported; multiple PCR assays on the same sample can improve sensitivity.

Recommendations for treating of Lyme disease are generally very similar in guidelines for the United States and Europe. One difference is that phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) is recommended for treatment of erythema migrans and borrelial lymphocytoma by some of the guidelines in Europe but is not part of the treatment recommendations in the United States. Another difference is the recommendation by some authorities in Europe to use intravenous ceftriaxone to treat erythema migrans, as well as other manifestations of Lyme disease, in pregnant women; whereas in the United States, antimicrobial drug treatment of Lyme disease for pregnant women is the same as that for nonpregnant patients, except that doxycycline is not recommended for pregnant women. Postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline has been shown to reduce the risk for Lyme disease after an I. scapularis tick bite and is recommended for consideration for tick bite prophylaxis in the United States. A recently published study conducted in Europe has also shown that a single 200-mg dose doxycycline successfully prevented Lyme disease after a tick bite. To what extent doxycycline will be used in Europe after a tick bite is unknown; the standard of care has been observation.

### Cefuroxime axetil (cefuroxime axetil for oral suspension) [^111Vj7tv]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

A total of 355 adult patients (181 treated with cefuroxime axetil and 174 treated with doxycycline) were enrolled in the 2 studies. In order to objectively validate the clinical diagnosis of early Lyme disease in these patients, 2 approaches were used: 1) blinded expert reading of photographs, when available, of the pretreatment erythema migrans skin lesion; and 2) serologic confirmation (using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunoblot assay ["Western" blot]) of the presence of antibodies specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. By these procedures, it was possible to confirm the physician diagnosis of early Lyme disease in 281 (79%) of the 355 study patients. The efficacy data summarized below are specific to this "validated" patient subset, while the safety data summarized below reflect the entire patient population for the 2 studies.

Analysis of the submitted clinical data for evaluable patients in the "validated" patient subset yielded the following results:

*95% confidence interval around the satisfactory difference for Part I (-0.08, +0.05).

†95% confidence interval around the satisfactory difference for Part II (-0.13, +0.07).

‡n's include patients assessed as unsatisfactory clinical outcomes (failure + recurrence) in Part I (cefuroxime axetil - 11 [5 failure, 6 recurrence]; doxycycline - 8 [6 failure, 2 recurrence]).

### Lyme disease: part II. management and prevention [^113DWkov]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Lyme disease (LD) is most often diagnosed clinically, and the differential diagnosis of erythema migrans may be challenging. Recent advances have raised questions about the efficacy of traditional diagnostic modalities, but may soon facilitate consistent identification of patients with Lyme borreliosis. Therapeutic recommendations vary with the stage of disease, and treatment usually leads to complete resolution. The management of patients with "chronic Lyme disease" is controversial. A number of preventative measures have been evaluated; those involving the avoidance of tick bites with protective clothing and insect repellents remain the simplest and most effective.

STARI — treatment and observation in endemic regions states that we make no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotics (no recommendation, knowledge gap), but when STARI cannot be distinguished from Lyme disease–associated erythema migrans in an endemic for both conditions, antibiotic therapy directed toward Lyme disease is indicated. In geographic areas where both STARI and Lyme disease are endemic and there are abundant lone star ticks, physicians and patients may choose observation rather than antibiotic treatment for erythema migrans; this decision should be guided by both patient and physician preferences and should be accompanied by patient counseling about the manifestations of Lyme disease and the importance of prompt evaluation should any of these manifestations arise.

### Skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis: diagnosis and management [^113mWsdU]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem infectious disease caused by tick-transmitted spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The three characteristic cutaneous manifestations are erythema migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Erythema migrans occurs in acute Lyme borreliosis, lymphocytoma is a subacute lesion, and acrodermatitis is the typical manifestation of late Lyme borreliosis. Clinical appearances of erythema migrans and lymphocytoma (when located on the ear or breast) are characteristic, whereas acrodermatitis is often confused with vascular conditions. The diagnosis of erythema migrans is made clinically. Serologic analyses often yield false-negative results and are not required for the diagnosis. However, serologic proof of the diagnosis in lymphocytoma (approximately 90% positive) and acrodermatitis (100% positive) is mandatory. Histopathologic examination often adds substantial information in patients with skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and is recommended in clinically (and serologically) undecided cases of erythema migrans or lymphocytoma and is obligatory in acrodermatitis. Polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia-specific DNA (rather than culture of the spirochete) and immunohistochemical investigations (lymphocytoma) are sometimes necessary adjuncts for the diagnosis. Antibacterial treatment is necessary in all patients to eliminate the spirochete, cure current disease, and prevent late sequelae. Oral doxycycline, also effective against coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is the mainstay of therapy of cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Other first-line antibacterials are amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil. Erythema migrans is treated for 2 weeks, lymphocytoma for 3–4 weeks, and acrodermatitis for at least 4 weeks.

### Time to diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease by patient race [^113oRDow]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Early diagnosis of Lyme disease (LD) requires prompt recognition of the erythema migrans (EM) rash and/or viral-like symptoms. Untreated infection can progress to disseminated disease, which is associated with more significant, prolonged morbidity. Therefore, identifying and addressing gaps in early diagnosis are paramount; however, large, clinic-based studies have been lacking.

### Efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy in early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis: a network meta-analysis [^1138yVsm]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Controversies about the choice of antibiotic agent and treatment modality exist in the management of erythema migrans in early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis (LB).

Objective

To conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) of all randomized clinical trials on various antibiotic agents and treatment modalities in early cutaneous LB.

Data Sources

Electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted from inception until July 2017. The reference lists of the included studies were hand searched, authors were contacted, and ongoing trials were searched at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Study Selection

One reviewer screened the titles and abstracts of the 9975 reports identified by the electronic searches. Full-text copies of 161 potentially relevant articles were obtained, and 2 reviewers independently assessed those articles for inclusion. Adults with a physician-confirmed early localized skin infection who were treated with antibiotics of any dose or duration were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study, patient, and intervention characteristics. Network meta-analyses on treatment effects and adverse outcomes were calculated with a frequentist approach using the R package netmeta. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidance for NMA was used to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment effects for response to treatment (resolution of symptoms) and treatment-related adverse events.

Results

Overall, 19 studies (2532 patients) were included. The mean patient age ranged between 37 and 56 years, and the percentage of female patients ranged from 36% to 60%. The antibiotics investigated were doxycycline, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, azithromycin, penicillin V, and minocycline. Pooled effect sizes from NMAs did not suggest any significant differences in treatment response by antibiotic agent (eg, amoxicillin vs doxycycline odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.41–3.87), dose, or duration (eg, doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 3 weeks, vs doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 2 weeks, odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.49–3.34). Treatment failures were rare at both 2 months (4%; 95% CI, 2%-5%) and 12 months (2%, 95% CI, 1%-3%) after treatment initiation. There were also no differences in the effect sizes among antibiotic agents and treatment modalities for treatment-related adverse outcomes, which were generally mild to moderate. Certainty of evidence was categorized as low and very low mostly because of imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations (high risk of bias) of the included studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

This NMA suggests that neither the antibiotic agent nor treatment modality contributed to comparative effectiveness or drug-related adverse outcomes. This finding is relevant for physicians treating patients with LB and for patient decision making.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of erythema migrans and Lyme arthritis [^1122VAg7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Most patients with erythema migrans, the pathognomonic rash of Lyme disease, do not recall a deer tick bite. The rash is classically 5 to 68 cm of annular homogenous erythema (59%), central erythema (30%), central clearing (9%), or central purpura (2%). Serologic testing is not indicated for patients with erythema migrans, because initially, the result is usually negative. Successful treatment of a patient with erythema migrans can be accomplished with 20 days of oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. Patients with Lyme arthritis usually present with a mildly painful swollen knee. Patients with Lyme arthritis have markedly positive serology and can usually be successfully treated with 28 days of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin. Some patients may have persistent effusion despite 4 to 8 weeks of antibiotics and may need synovectomy. Persistent effusion is not due to persistent infection. Antibiotic therapy for more than 8 weeks for patients with Lyme disease is not indicated. Chronic Lyme disease due to antibiotic resistant infection has not been demonstrated.

### Is doxycycline appropriate for routine treatment of young children with erythema migrans? [^115JzewK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The frequency of permanent staining of teeth of young children from doxycycline is thought to be lower than from older tetracyclines, but the precise risk is uncertain. Until more definitive data become available, doxycycline should not be used routinely to treat young children with erythema migrans, a manifestation of Lyme disease for which other antimicrobials are highly effective.

Lyme disease — preferred antibiotic regimens for erythema migrans — For patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and for patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin. Evidence is based on both US and European studies in which Borrelia species are similarly susceptible to antimicrobials in in vitro studies, and although erythema migrans will resolve without antibiotic treatment, evidence indicates that currently used antibiotic regimens lead to faster resolution of the skin lesion and associated symptoms and effectively prevent development of disseminated manifestations of Lyme disease.

### Cefuroxime axetil [^113bEDqj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.6 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

1.7 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated gonorrhea, urethral and endocervical, caused by penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase–producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and uncomplicated gonorrhea, rectal, in females, caused by non-penicillinase–producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

1.8 Early Lyme Disease (erythema migrans)

Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) caused by susceptible strains of Borrelia burgdorferi.

1.10 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil tablets and other antibacterial drugs, cefuroxime axetil tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Prophylaxis with single-dose doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease after an ixodes scapularis tick bite [^114XKnAR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite will prevent Lyme disease.

Methods

In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At base line, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi. Entomologists confirmed the species of the ticks and classified them according to sex, stage, and degree of engorgement.

Results

Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than of those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P < 0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions. Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P < 0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks (8 of 142 bites [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 bites [0 percent], P = 0.02) and particularly after bites from nymphal ticks that were at least partially engorged with blood (8 of 81 bites [9.9 percent], as compared with 0 of 59 bites from unfed, or flat, nymphal ticks [0 percent]; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

A single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours after an I. scapularis tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme disease.

Lyme disease erythema migrans — treatment duration: We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States. Evidence notes that durations in clinical studies have varied from 5 to 10 days, that 5-day regimens have included 6 doses with 2 doses taken on day 1, and that no difference in outcomes has been associated with the duration of therapy, including trials showing equivalent efficacy of 10 days compared with 20 days of doxycycline and similar efficacy of 10 days compared with 15 days. Rationale states that shorter durations of antibiotic exposure may reduce adverse effects and cost.

### Lyme disease in children [^116yrre9]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disorder caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks in the northern hemisphere. The disease is common in children. In addition to frequently recognized manifestations such as erythema migrans, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme arthritis, rarer manifestations, including eye and ear disease, are increasingly understood. Clinical diagnosis is supported by serologic confirmation. Improvement of laboratory methodology, especially polymerase chain reaction-based tests, is continuing. Actual treatment recommendations based on controlled studies reflect expanding scientific knowledge. In the United States, license of a vaccine to prevent infection in children is awaited. Lyme borreliosis is an intriguing human example of bacterial persistence in the presence of the host immune system. Chronic Lyme arthritis is a model of chronic arthritis resembling forms of arthritis of unknown cause, such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of early Lyme disease in patients with microbiologically confirmed erythema migrans [^117HNkQU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Lyme disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical and serologic picture rather than on microbiological confirmation.

Objective

To examine the clinical presentation and treatment outcome of early Lyme disease in patients with microbiologically confirmed erythema migrans.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

31 university-based or clinician-practice sites in 10 endemic states.

Participants

10 936 participants enrolled in a phase III trial of Lyme disease vaccine; 118 participants had erythema migrans in which Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by culture or polymerase chain reaction.

Measurements

Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome were noted. Skin biopsies of erythema migrans were performed for culture and detection of B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction; serologic responses were determined by Western blot.

Results

The 118 patients with microbiologically confirmed erythema migrans presented a median of 3 days after symptom onset. Early erythema migrans commonly had homogeneous or central redness rather than a peripheral erythema with partial central clearing. The most common associated symptoms were low-grade fever, headache, neck stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia, or fatigue. By convalescence, 65% of patients had positive IgM or IgG antibody responses to B. burgdorferi. Most patients responded promptly to antibiotic treatment.

Conclusions

In major endemic areas in the United States, Lyme disease commonly presents as erythema migrans with homogeneous or central redness and nonspecific flu-like symptoms. Clinical outcome is excellent if antibiotic therapy is administered soon after symptom onset.

### Outpatient treatment of Lyme disease [^114VmH6m]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (B burgdorferi) in the Upper Atlantic Coast and Borrelia mayonii in the Upper Midwest and West Coast. It can cause a range of manifestations including erythema migrans, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, carditis, and arthritis. Recent guidelines advocate for outpatient treatment for many of these conditions. Scenarios will be presented that outline treatment of these manifestations.

### Early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) and its mimics (Southern tick-associated rash illness and tick-associated rash illness) [^112uVCNS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Erythema migrans, an expanding erythematous skin lesion that develops days to weeks following an Ixodes species tick bite, is the most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease. Presentations in the United States differ somewhat from that in Europe, presumably because of the different etiologic agents. Diagnosis is based on the appearance of the skin lesion, rather than on laboratory testing. After treatment with an appropriate oral antibiotic for 10 to 14 days, the prognosis is excellent. Two conditions that cause a similar skin lesion following a tick bite, but are of unknown cause, are Southern tick-associated rash illness in the United States and tick-associated rash illness in Japan.

Lyme disease is now the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States. The highest incidence is in children aged 5 to 9 years with a male predominance. The most common manifestation, erythema migrans, is sometimes not recognized, leading to risk of complications. Testing for Lyme disease should only be done if there is a consistent clinical syndrome with exposure in a Lyme-endemic area. Most forms of Lyme disease are successfully treated with short courses of oral therapy. Prevention and management of tick bites is important.

### Lyme borreliosis: diagnosis and management [^111aJVbn]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is the most common vectorborne disease in the northern hemisphere. It usually begins with erythema migrans; early disseminated infection particularly causes multiple erythema migrans or neurologic disease, and late manifestations predominantly include arthritis in North America, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) in Europe. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, complemented by serological confirmation of infection once an antibody response has been mounted. Manifestations usually respond to appropriate antibiotic regimens, but the disease can be followed by sequelae, such as immune arthritis or residual damage to affected tissues. A subset of individuals reports persistent symptoms, including fatigue, pain, arthralgia, and neurocognitive symptoms, which in some people are severe enough to fulfil the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of such persistent symptoms following antimicrobial treatment varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Persistent active infection in humans has not been identified as a cause of this syndrome, and randomized treatment trials have invariably failed to show any benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment. For prevention of Lyme borreliosis, post-exposure prophylaxis may be indicated in specific cases, and novel vaccine strategies are under development.

Erythema migrans — diagnostic testing strategy: In patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have 1 or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans, we recommend clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In patients with 1 or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for, erythema migrans, we suggest antibody testing on an acute-phase serum sample followed, if negative, by a convalescent-phase sample rather than direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture on blood or skin (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence); if needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2–3 weeks after the acute-phase sample.
