## Question

Medications that cause tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications cause tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify tachycardia mechanistically. Then, I should identify high-risk drug classes and specific agents with strong evidence. Next, I will verify mechanisms and quantify risk where possible. After that, I need to consider special populations and monitoring strategies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and outline management principles, ensuring I double-check any claims against guidelines and key reviews before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and taxonomy. Tachycardia here includes sinus tachycardia, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, with drug-induced forms arising via increased automaticity, triggered activity, or reentry, and with some drugs specifically precipitating torsades de pointes in the setting of QT prolongation, which is a distinct but critical subtype of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^962b59b1] [^7dae49fd].

> I will now examine sympathomimetic and beta-agonist agents because they are prototypical causes of sinus tachycardia. Short-acting beta-agonists like albuterol predictably cause dose-related tachycardia and tremor, with risk amplified by hypoxemia and comorbidities, and long-acting beta-agonists have similar but less pronounced effects. Decongestants such as pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine also provoke tachycardia via alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation, and stimulants like amphetamines and cocaine are classic culprits of marked sinus and supraventricular tachycardia, warranting careful vital sign monitoring in intoxication [^91431c41] [^203edaf7] [^8bae1757] [^c74a09c8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anticholinergics. I initially thought they uniformly cause tachycardia, but wait, let me verify the mechanism. Anticholinergics reduce vagal tone and can increase heart rate, yet clinically significant tachycardia is variable and often context dependent. Case reports and series document tachycardia with scopolamine and with first-generation antihistamines, and diphenhydramine has been associated with transient fetal tachycardia, so I should keep these on the list while acknowledging heterogeneity in risk and presentation [^6cd9194f] [^78e158d2].

> Next, I should review vasodilators and positive chronotropes. Hydralazine and minoxidil commonly cause reflex tachycardia due to baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic activation, and cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, produces a dose-related increase in heart rate of about 5–7 bpm and is contraindicated in heart failure due to arrhythmic risk. I need to ensure I flag these as high-yield offenders in patients presenting with new-onset sinus tachycardia after starting these agents [^9e9d27bd] [^ce5d5d02] [^17387c91].

> I will now examine antidepressants, especially tricyclics. TCAs cause dose-dependent tachycardia and autonomic dysfunction, with observational data linking them to increased heart rate and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, so I should double-check for anticholinergic burden and orthostatic hypotension when patients on TCAs present with palpitations or syncope [^5787f343].

> Let me consider antiarrhythmic drugs, where the irony of proarrhythmia is well known. Class IA and III antiarrhythmics can precipitate torsades de pointes via IKr blockade and QT prolongation, with risk magnified by bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, and polypharmacy. Sotalol and dofetilide carry explicit TdP risk in heart failure populations, and amiodarone, while less TdP-prone, can worsen bradyarrhythmias and is proarrhythmic in other ways, so I should confirm QT intervals and electrolytes before and during therapy and avoid QT-prolonging combinations [^57405a62] [^bea11e4a] [^639cd057].

> But wait, what if the culprit is outside cardiology. Numerous noncardiac drugs prolong QT and can trigger torsades, including macrolides, fluoroquinolones, pentamidine, antimalarials, many antipsychotics, methadone, and ondansetron. I should routinely screen medication lists against curated risk catalogs and correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia to mitigate TdP risk, especially in older adults, females, and those with bradycardia or structural heart disease [^b182a526] [^8c8c2c18] [^7e112efa].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, beta-agonists can cause maternal and fetal tachycardia, so I should coordinate obstetric monitoring and consider alternatives when feasible. In pediatrics, OTC cough and cold sympathomimetics are a frequent source of toxicity with tachycardia and dysrhythmias, reinforcing the need for caregiver counseling and avoidance. In heart failure, QT-prolonging drugs and cilostazol should be avoided or used with enhanced ECG monitoring given elevated TdP risk and proarrhythmic potential [^b29d72a5] [^8bae1757] [^e6d50e33].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized list, while keeping verification front and center. High-certainty, high-frequency causes include short-acting beta-agonists, sympathomimetic decongestants, stimulants, hydralazine, minoxidil, cilostazol, TCAs, and class IA and III antiarrhythmics. Moderate-certainty contributors include anticholinergics, first-generation antihistamines, and a long list of QT-prolonging noncardiac drugs that primarily threaten via torsades rather than sinus tachycardia. I should confirm each case against the medication history, temporal relation, and ECG findings before assigning causality [^91431c41] [^203edaf7] [^8bae1757] [^9e9d27bd] [^ce5d5d02] [^17387c91] [^5787f343] [^57405a62] [^b182a526].

> Next, I should review management principles and make sure they align with guidelines. Immediate steps include discontinuation of the offending agent, correction of electrolytes, and ECG monitoring for QT prolongation or tachyarrhythmias. For torsades, IV magnesium is first-line and all QT-prolonging drugs must be stopped. For stable narrow-complex SVT, vagal maneuvers and adenosine are initial therapy, with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as second-line if needed. In stimulant intoxication, benzodiazepines and alpha-2 agonists can blunt hyperadrenergic symptoms, while beta-blockers may be contraindicated in cocaine toxicity due to unopposed alpha stimulation. I should double-check for drug–drug interactions and genetic susceptibility when QT effects are disproportionate [^2c7d3a37] [^921fbe68] [^3e27117c] [^c74a09c8] [^8c8c2c18].

> Finally, I should confirm prevention and risk stratification steps. Before prescribing QT-prolonging agents, I need to check baseline ECG, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and concomitant QT drugs. In heart failure or congenital long QT, avoid QT-prolonging drugs when alternatives exist. Use authoritative, regularly updated lists such as CredibleMeds to guide safe prescribing, and counsel patients to report palpitations or syncope promptly. If a patient presents with unexplained tachycardia, I should systematically review all prescription, OTC, and herbal products and correlate timing with symptom onset to avoid missing a drug-induced cause [^b182a526] [^8c8c2c18] [^7093ea46] [^851e100f].

Medications that cause tachycardia include **sympathomimetics** (e.g. epinephrine, pseudoephedrine, albuterol), **anticholinergics** (e.g. atropine, scopolamine), **vasodilators** (e.g. hydralazine, minoxidil), **stimulants** (e.g. amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine), and **QT-prolonging drugs** (e.g. antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antibiotics) [^962b59b1] [^b182a526]. Mechanisms include direct β-adrenergic stimulation, vagal blockade, reflex sympathetic activation, and torsades de pointes from QT prolongation [^91431c41] [^7e112efa]. Risk is higher with overdose, interactions, or underlying heart disease; management centers on stopping the drug, correcting electrolytes, and using beta-blockers or magnesium as indicated [^2c7d3a37] [^7e112efa].

## Clinical implications and risk factors

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, sex, genetics, and comorbidities (e.g. heart disease, hyperthyroidism) influence susceptibility to drug-induced tachycardia [^8c8c2c18].

- **Drug-related factors**: Dose, route, interactions, and polypharmacy increase risk, especially with QT-prolonging drugs or sympathomimetics [^8c8c2c18] [^91431c41].

- **Clinical scenarios**: Overdose, withdrawal (e.g. beta-blocker or clonidine), and acute illness can precipitate tachycardia [^c74a09c8].

---

## Management strategies

- **Immediate actions**: Stop the offending drug, stabilize ABCs, and monitor ECG and vitals [^962b59b1].

- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Beta-blockers for sympathomimetic-induced tachycardia; magnesium and electrolyte correction for QT-related tachyarrhythmias; benzodiazepines for stimulant toxicity [^2c7d3a37] [^c74a09c8].

- **Long-term strategies**: Avoidance of culprit drugs, patient education, and risk stratification for future therapy [^8c8c2c18].

### Drug-induced arrhythmias: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^962b59b1]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Many widely used medications may cause or exacerbate a variety of arrhythmias. Numerous antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobial drugs, psychotropic medications, and methadone, as well as a growing list of drugs from other therapeutic classes (neurological drugs, anticancer agents, and many others), can prolong the QT interval and provoke torsades de pointes. Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed. Awareness of drugs that may cause arrhythmias and knowledge of distinct arrhythmias that may be drug-induced are essential for clinicians. Consideration of the possibility that a patient's arrythmia could be drug-induced is important.

Conservative and medical treatment—general considerations—reducing the number of medications that cause hypotension can be helpful, provided that it does not worsen conditions such as hypertension and heart failure; several narrative and systematic reviews have evaluated the benefits of lifestyle and medical therapies, and while results have generally been positive in uncontrolled trials and short-term controlled trials, those of long-term, placebo-controlled prospective trials have been less encouraging; furthermore, only the most motivated patients will commit to medical therapy to prevent a handful of yearly syncopal episodes.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS supraventricular tachycardia guideline—class of recommendation, level of evidence, and guideline-directed medical therapy are defined and organized as follows: The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk, and the Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports; unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE, where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence, and when >1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically. The term “guideline-directed medical therapy” refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations; for these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions, and recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.

### Treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome with medication: a systematic review [^b94bab2a]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome has been recognized for decades, but treatment is largely based on anecdotal experience and expert opinion. Pharmacologic treatment is inconsistent and unstandardized. We did a systematic review to identify controlled studies from which informed treatment decisions can be made.

Method

Through a standard systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we identified all English-language studies of a medication treatment for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that included a comparison or control group and followed outcomes for at least 1 week of treatment.

Results

A total of 626 studies were identified by the search criteria, and 8, involving a total of 499 patients, met the criteria. No studies were adequately similar to allow for meta-analysis. Of the identified 8 studies, 2 were randomized controlled trials and 4 had been subjected to peer review. In individual studies, there was some favorable effect with fludrocortisone, beta blockers, midodrine, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of high-quality data about effectiveness of medication in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Nonetheless, 2 randomized trials and 6 other reports show some favorable effects of medication.

### ECG manifestations: the poisoned patient [^dbc60524]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Despite that drugs have widely varying indications for therapeutic use, many unrelated drugs share a common cardiac pharmacologic effect if taken in overdose. The purpose of this article is to group together agents that cause similar electrocardiographic effects,review their pharmacologic actions, and discuss the electrocardiographic findings reported in the medical literature.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^c1b7e0ba]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Physiological sinus tachycardia—definition and causes: Sinus tachycardia is regarded as physiological when it is the result of appropriate autonomic influences, such as in the setting of physical activity or emotional responses. Physiological sinus tachycardia may result from pathological causes, including infection with fever, dehydration, anemia, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism, in addition to exogenous substances, including caffeine, drugs with a beta-agonist effect (eg, albuterol, salmeterol), and illicit stimulant drugs (eg, amphetamines, cocaine). In these cases, tachycardia is expected to resolve with correction of the underlying cause.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest medications and wide QRS complex tachycardia—key evidence and cautions are as follows: High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV versus a standard 1 mg) has been studied and, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation, improved survival to hospital admission but did not improve survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival; vasopressin is no longer recommended in advanced cardiovascular life support algorithms. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit in 2 randomized controlled trials for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) during cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 2 to 4 g IV magnesium did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient cardiac arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge; exceptions include marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which IV magnesium is warranted. For prophylaxis after acute myocardial infarction, routine lidocaine or procainamide was associated with increased mortality while beta blockers were associated with a significantly lower mortality; an RCT of 1073 patients found high-dose amiodarone led to higher mortality, and a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For stable wide QRS tachycardia, differentiation between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy and ventricular tachycardia (VT) is often possible by history and the 12-lead ECG; patients with wide QRS tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have VT until proven otherwise, and verapamil given to a patient with VT may cause severe hypotension or syncope except in verapamil-sensitive VT (intrafascicular reentry) in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize initially.

Regarding medical management for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, more specifically with respect to pharmacologic therapy, CCS 2020 guidelines recommend to offer the following medications to improve symptom control in patients with POTS:

- midodrine 2.5-15 mg every 4 hours up to TID

- propranolol 10-20 mg QID (also to reduce standing HR and improve exercise capacity).

### Treatment of persistent ventricular tachycardia: drugs or ablation? [^1c974d60]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce the mortality risk associated with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can frequently terminate VT episodes painlessly, but do not prevent recurrent episodes. For patients with symptomatic recurrences, frequent asymptomatic recurrences, ICD shocks, or VT storm, most clinicians recommend strategies to suppress VT. The proarrhythmic mortality risk of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) may be mitigated by the presence of an ICD, but these medications are limited by high recurrence rates, and unfavorable side effect profiles. Catheter ablation is an alternative or adjunctive option, but is also limited by incomplete efficacy and procedural risk.

### Adverse effects of β-agonists [^91431c41]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonists have pharmacologically predictable dose-related and potency-related adverse effects, including tachycardia and tremor, and they also affect serum potassium and glucose. These effects all show tolerance with continued exposure. The potential for arrhythmia is increased by comorbidity and hypoxemia. Nonpharmacologically predictable effects include airway hyperresponsiveness to nonspecific and specific stimuli, including allergen and exercise, and increased airway inflammation. Genetic variants of the beta-adrenergic receptor alter susceptibility to adverse effects of beta-agonists on airway function. The impact of the enantiomers of beta-agonists on adverse effects remains unclear. The two epidemics of asthma death among young people were temporally associated with introduction of potent short-acting beta-agonists (isoproterenol and fenoterol) and appear to be related to adverse effects of these drugs on airway function and airway hyperresponsiveness rather than to cardiotoxicity. Compared with short-acting agents, long-acting beta-agonists show similar but less pronounced pharmacologically predictable effects, and they have not been shown to increase airway hyperresponsiveness in adults. Postmarketing surveillance studies have not suggested significant adverse effects of long-acting beta-agonists on morbidity and mortality.

### Multicenter study of antiarrhythmic medications for treatment of infants with supraventricular tachycardia (...) [^80c59711]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-centered study to compare 6 months of medical treatment with digoxin or propranolol in infants with SVT Background: SVT is the most common sustained arrhythmia of infancy. Neither digoxin nor propranolol has been evaluated for pediatric use in a controlled trial in the context of SVT, yet both medications are used frequently. Our survey identified that, among the wide range of medications used to manage infant SVT, the two most commonly used ones are digoxin and propranolol. Digoxin and propranolol are both well established, widely used medications in both infants and adults. Eighty-five percent of survey respondents reported using one or both to manage infant SVT, but did not rationalize their choice nor determine whether one or the other is better to reduce risk of SVT recurrence or whether one is associated with fewer adverse events. Furthermore, pediatric cardiologists and electrophysiologists differed in medication choice.

Table 2. Commonly used medications for the chronic treatment of supraventricular tachycardia Digoxin Propranolol Sotalol Amiodarone Flecainide Propafenone Verapamil Atenolol Nadolol Digoxin is a sodium-potassium exchange pump inhibitor that has neuro-humoral effects and effects on cardiac conduction. Its efficacy as an antiarrhythmic drug is attributed to direct atrioventricular nodal blocking properties, combined with parasympathetic activation, which slows sinus rate, decreases conduction velocity, and increases atrioventricular nodal refractoriness. For decades, digoxin has been reported to be the preferred medication to prevent recurrence of SVT in infants, and it remains a common choice. Propranolol is also reported to be effective in SVT.

Retrospective reviews have not always found differences in recurrence rates among infants treated with digoxin versus propranolol: some report equal efficacy in preventing recurrent SVT, while others report a lower recurrence with propranolol. Digoxin and propranolol have a wide range of reported efficacy for preventing recurrence of SVT and neither digoxin nor propranolol is fully effective; treatment failures can reach 26% and additional antiarrhythmics are often required.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^7dae49fd]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia—synopsis and diagnostic features—explains that polymorphic VT refers to a wide-complex tachycardia of ventricular origin with differing QRS configurations beat-to-beat, and the most critical feature for diagnosis and treatment is what is known or suspected about the patient’s underlying QT interval. It is often difficult to know whether the tachycardia is pVT or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Most VF begins with pVT and if pVT is prolonged it will usually degenerate into VF. Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic VT associated with a prolonged heart rate—corrected QT interval; the risk for developing torsades increases when the corrected QT interval is greater than 500 milliseconds and accompanied by bradycardia. Other causes include catecholaminergic polymorphic VT provoked by exercise or emotion; “short QT” syndrome with corrected QT interval less than 330–370 milliseconds; idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract polymorphic VT; and digitalis toxicity with bidirectional VT in which the axis of alternate QRS complexes shifts by 180°. Conversely, polymorphic VT not associated with a long QT is most often due to acute myocardial ischemia. There are no RCTs examining the acute pharmacological treatment of polymorphic VT, and supportive data, with and without long corrected QT interval, are largely based on case reports and case series.

### Ventricular tachycardia after initiation of fingolimod [^b5161cd6]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is used for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It is well known to cause bradyarrhythmias. We present a 63-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia 2weeks after fingolimod initiation. Further evaluation showed that the patient's ventricular tachycardia was most likely secondary to her medication. Medical practitioners need to be aware of such possible life-threatening side effects while using fingolimod.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 211: critical care in pregnancy [^b29d72a5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 211—special considerations for pregnant women in critical care prioritize maternal stabilization, accurate gestational age assessment, and cautious medication and imaging use. Maternal stabilization is the first priority when caring for critically ill pregnant women, and if the woman is stable, it is important to determine the fetal gestational age because this is likely to affect the plan of care. When possible, prenatal care records should be obtained and reviewed to ascertain the best available dating, and if gestational age remains uncertain, bedside ultrasound evaluation can establish an estimated gestational age for immediate decision-making. Pregnancy often modifies drug effects or serum levels, and drugs that cross the placenta may have fetal effects; sedative and parasympatholytic drugs alter fetal heart rate tracing. Medications commonly used in critical care may have adverse pregnancy effects such as decreased placental perfusion or increased risk of malformations; examples include tachycardia and decreased BP with beta-agonists, and negative inotropic effects on cardiac function with magnesium. Known adverse effects on the woman and the fetus must be carefully monitored, potential drug interactions considered, and risk–benefit ratios assessed; neither necessary medications nor diagnostic imaging should be withheld from a pregnant woman because of fetal concerns, although attempts should be made to limit fetal exposure to ionizing radiation and teratogenic medications when feasible.

### Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: terminology, mechanism, diagnosis, and emergency therapy [^a4a5ac5b]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: a clinical review [^0e111dff]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome was defined in adult patients as an increase >30 beats per minute in heart rate of a symptomatic patient when moving from supine to upright position. Clinical signs may include postural tachycardia, headache, abdominal discomfort, dizziness/presyncope, nausea, and fatigue. The most common adolescent presentation involves teenagers within 1-3 years of their growth spurt who, after a period of inactivity from illness or injury, cannot return to normal activity levels because of symptoms induced by upright posture. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is complex and likely has numerous, concurrent pathophysiologic etiologies, presenting along a wide spectrum of potential symptoms. Nonpharmacologic treatment includes (1) increasing aerobic exercise, (2) lower-extremity strengthening, (3) increasing fluid/salt intake, (4) psychophysiologic training for management of pain/anxiety, and (5) family education. Pharmacologic treatment is recommended on a case-by-case basis, and can include beta-blocking agents to blunt orthostatic increases in heart rate, alpha-adrenergic agents to increase peripheral vascular resistance, mineralocorticoid agents to increase blood volume, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. An interdisciplinary research approach may determine mechanistic root causes of symptoms, and is investigating novel management plans for affected patients.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b182a526]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Medications that could prolong the QT interval and induce torsades de pointes (TdP) are organized by risk categories and defined as follows: “Known risk of TdP” drugs “prolong the QT interval and are clearly associated with a known risk of TdP, even when taken as recommended”; “Possible risk of TdP” drugs “can cause QT prolongation but currently lack evidence for a risk of TdP when taken as recommended”; “Conditional risk of TdP” drugs are “associated with TdP but only under certain circumstances of their use (eg, excessive dose, in patients such as those with hypokalemia, or when taken with interacting drugs) or by creating conditions that facilitate or induce TdP”; and “Drugs to avoid in congenital long QT” “pose a special risk of TdP for patients with congenital long-QT syndrome and include those in the above 3 categories plus additional drugs that do not prolong the QT interval per se but have a special risk because of their adrenaline-like actions.” The table notes that “The CredibleMeds online lists are revised regularly and should be consulted before clinical decisions are made on the safe use of any of these medicines,” that “†Removed from the market,” and that “HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; QT, QT interval; and TdP, torsades de pointes.”

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^6fe21175]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Identifying causes and risk for QT prolongation

If patients have QTc prolongation, correctable causes should be identified. First, electrolytes should be measured and any abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia) should be corrected before treatment. Patients with cancer specifically are at risk for electrolyte imbalance, especially during cancer treatment, because of the following: (1) poor oral intake and conditions that promote loss of potassium and/or magnesium, like salt‐losing nephropathy secondary to platinum salts; (2) diarrhea or emesis from mucositis; (3) fever with sweating; (4) treatment with laxatives; (5) alcohol abuse; and (6) treatment with corticosteroids. Drugs with potentially synergistic effects with cancer therapy to prolong QTc should be identified and modified or stopped. Table 3 provides a selective list of commonly used noncancer treatment drugs that prolong QTc and some safer alternatives, and an exhaustive list can be obtained fromand is updated frequently. 188 Other causes of baseline QTc prolongation include structural heart disease 189 and genetic inherited arrhythmias, including Brugada syndrome, congenital long QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. These patients should be evaluated by a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist before cancer therapy with potential QT‐prolonging drugs. A comprehensive review of all medications that need to be avoided or the strategy for monitoring during the treatment should be defined carefully in these patients before cancer therapy. 190

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^3244051f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). QTc prolongation is influenced by many factors including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval. In addition, ED patients may present with conditions that may predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects, but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation. This review discusses commonly encountered medications that are associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^487f48c5]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope—arrhythmic and drug-induced mechanisms—Bradycardia from subsidiary pacemaker sites can present with slow rates (25–40 b.p.m.) and “predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially of the torsade de pointes type.” Syncope or near-syncope occurs at the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia before vascular compensation develops, and several drugs can cause brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including QT‑prolonging agents across antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, psychotropics, antimicrobials, and non‑sedating antihistamines. Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is caused by drugs prolonging the QT interval, being particularly frequent in long QT syndrome. Under‑reporting is substantial, with only 1% of adverse drug reactions reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Is there a rationale and role for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma? [^8e2ed2ab]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Evidence of Anticholinergic Bronchodilators in Asthma

Historically, short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators have not been considered appropriate for the control of asthma, except in some cases for the acute treatment of asthma attacks in patients with chronic stable asthma,, and in those who experience adverse events from SABAs, such as tachycardia, arrhythmia and tremor. Although short-acting anticholinergics are considered less effective rapid bronchodilators than SABAs such as salbutamol,, there are data to suggest that, for acute exacerbations, ipratropium in combination with a SABA as reliever medication improves lung function to a greater extent than a SABA alone. In a double-blind, randomised trial, Rodrigo and Rodrigoinvestigated the effects of high-dose ipratropium plus the SABA albuterol (registered generic name for salbutamol in the USA) in adults with acute asthma, in the emergency department. Patients receiving high-dose ipratropium plus albuterol had a greater improvement in peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 s compared with patients who received albuterol alone. The risk of hospital admission was 49% lower in the ipratropium/albuterol arm.Further, a meta-analysis has indicated that the addition of a short-acting anticholinergic to a SABA is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation in children.Thus, in adults or children, the main justification for the use of short-acting anticholinergic drugs in acute asthma is reduction of the elevated airway smooth muscle and cholinergic tone during an acute crisis, although administration of multiple doses has been associated with a reduction in hospitalisations and risk of hospitalisation.

### Evaluation and management of patients after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock [^070c9725]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

There has been a tremendous increase in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) after several large clinical trials demonstrated their ability to effectively reduce mortality in selected populations of patients with cardiac disease. Thus, the nonelectrophysiologist will often encounter patients who have received an ICD shock.

Objective

To assess options for the evaluation and management of patients who have received an ICD shock.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature search using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases to identify articles published from January 1990 to September 2006, using the Medical Subject Headings defibrillators, implantable; defibrillators, implantable/adverse effects; anti-arrhythmic agents; electric countershock; quality of life; tachycardia therapy; algorithm; ventricular tachycardia/diagnosis; and supraventricular tachycardia/diagnosis. Case reports were excluded and articles were limited to those published in English. Scientific statements and guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society were also reviewed, as were the reference lists of retrieved articles, to identify any additional articles for inclusion.

Evidence Synthesis

There are multiple causes of both appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks. Irrespective of appropriateness, receiving ICD shocks substantially impairs a patient's quality of life. A variety of techniques are available using ICD programming to reliably limit the occurrence of appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks. Antiarrhythmic medications can also effectively reduce the occurrence of shocks.

Conclusions

Through the use of effective ICD programming and antiarrhythmic medications, the occurrence of ICD shocks can be reduced while maintaining the lifesaving ability of the ICD. A basic understanding of the range of available options is fundamental for evaluation and management of the patient who has received an ICD shock.

Implications

Bidirectional tachycardia is an uncommon and unique arrhythmia. It typically occurs in patients with digitalis toxicity, but it can also be associated with other causes. There has been controversy regarding the origin and the mechanism of bidirectional tachycardia. Treatment of bidirectional tachycardia involves the correction of reversible factors and the use of some antiarrhythmic medication.

### Common types of supraventricular tachycardia: diagnosis and management [^9c09b8f4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The most common types of supraventricular tachycardia are caused by a reentry phenomenon producing accelerated heart rates. Symptoms may include palpitations (pulsation in the neck), chest pain, lightheadedness or dizziness, and dyspnea. It is unusual for supraventricular tachycardia to be caused by structurally abnormal hearts. Diagnosis is often delayed because of the misdiagnosis of anxiety or panic disorder. Patient history is important in uncovering the diagnosis, whereas the physical examination may or may not be helpful, and usually necessitates use of a Holter monitor or an event recorder to capture the arrhythmia and confirm a diagnosis. Treatment consists of short-term or as needed pharmacotherapy using calcium channel or beta blockers when vagal maneuvers fail to halt or slow the rhythm. In those who require long-term pharmacotherapy, atrioventricular nodal blocking agents or class IC or III antiarrhythmics can be used; however, these agents should generally be managed by a cardiologist. Catheter ablation is an option in patients with persistent or recurrent supraventricular tachycardia who are unable to tolerate long-term pharmacologic management. If Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is present, expedient referral to a cardiologist is warranted because ablation is a potentially curative option.

### Dry eye syndrome and sicca complex are commonly found in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^15007795]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Medications Associated with DES

DES can be the adverse effect of many commonplace prescription medications in any clinical setting. This study proposes that the frequency distribution of DES symptoms endorsed among the POTS patient population is independent of the medications taken that are known to cause eye dryness and DES is a result of POTS pathology. In order to address the impact of medications on patients with POTS, a Chi-squared test for independence was performed. Every patient that filled out the symptom survey had an outpatient medication list that was reviewed. We defined a medication group as patients who, since their last clinic visit, have been managed in the outpatient setting with at least one medication that falls into the following groups: beta-2 agonists, loop diuretics, anticholinergics, or H1 receptor antagonists. Many other medications have pharmacologic monographs listing dry eye or mouth symptoms as possible adverse effects.This list includes beta blockers, hypnotics, neuroleptics, retinoids, and retroviral therapy. However, this study simplifies its categories by only taking into account the aforementioned known physiologic mechanisms for DES.

Furthermore, patients with POTS are commonly prescribed pyridostigmine for autonomic symptom management. This study took particular consideration towards this known anticholinesterase, which should counteract eye dryness. Patients enrolled in this study were also sorted into pyridostigmine and non-pyridostigmine groups. Pyridostigmine groups are not mutually exclusive categories from dry eye inducing medication groups. As such, pyridostigmine and DES Medication categories are used in separate Chi squared tests because patients would otherwise be organized into more than 2 variables and the study groups would not be independent.

With a confidence P-value of 0.05, we crafted two null hypotheses. Firstly, the prevalence of patients presenting to our POTS clinic with DES is independent of the medications they take that are labeled and known to cause dry eye symptoms. Secondly, the likelihood of patients presenting to our POTS clinic with DES is independent of whether they are on pyridostigmine, a medication known to increase lacrimation and prevent dry eyes.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Administer the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg/m2as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days.

• Repeat treatment cycles following recovery or return to baseline organ function, approximately every 2 to 6 weeks. Base dosage on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), calculatedusing the actual height and weight before the start of each cycle. To prevent drug incompatibilities, do not administer other medications through the same intravenous line. Administer subsequent cycles no sooner than 14 days from the starting day of the previous cycle and provided the patient’s ANC is ≥0.75 × 109/L.

• Provide supportive care, such as intravenous fluids, antihyperuricemic treatment, and alkalinize urine throughout the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration to reduce the effects of tumor lysis and other adverse reactions.

• Discontinue clofarabine injection if hypotension develops during the 5 days of administration.

• Monitor renal and hepatic function during the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8)].

• Monitor patients taking medications known to affect blood pressure. Monitor cardiac function during administration of clofarabine injection.

2.2 Recommended Dosage Reduction for Renal Impairment

• Reduce the dose by 50% in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) between 30 and 60 mL/min. There is insufficient information to make a dosage recommendation in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Potential Concomitant Medications and Medications to Avoid

• Consider prophylactic antiemetic medications as clofarabine injection is moderately emetogenic.

• Consider the use of prophylactic steroids to mitigate Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) or capillary leak syndrome (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and pulmonary edema).

• Minimize exposure to drugs with known renal toxicity during the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration since the risk of renal toxicity may be increased.

• Avoid concomitant use of medications known to induce hepatic toxicity.

### Clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^0356776b]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kumar and colleagues performed a large‐scale multicenter retrospective study including more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients and found that bradycardia was prevalent and associated with higher mortality among them.Their findings are of great interest because infection and high fever are, in general, associated with tachycardia. Several concerns have been raised.

To further clarify the mechanism of COVID‐19 associated bradycardia, it is of great interest to investigate the type of bradycardia: sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation. Noncardiac causes should be carefully excluded, including sedation, conduction‐suppressive medications, and hypothyroidism.

The causality between bradycardia and mortality remains unclear. Bradycardia might be a marker of the advanced stage of COVID‐19 or a direct cause of death. Bradycardia might be more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 associated myocarditis with incremental troponin level. On the other hand, bradycardia might cause low cardiac output accompanying cardiogenic shock. If bradycardia is harmful, aggressive intervention to bradycardia, including pacemaker therapy, would be beneficial. In their study, was the dominant cause of death in patients with bradycardia respiratory failure or heart failure?

### Current concepts in the mechanisms and management of drug-induced QT prolongation and torsade de pointes [^7e112efa]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is characterized by a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) and increased risk of a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). We review mechanisms, predispositions, culprit agents, and management of this potentially fatal phenomenon. Virtually all drugs that prolong QTc block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (I(kr)). Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose-dependent manner, others do so at any dose. Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common. Implicated drugs include class 1A and III antiarrhythmics, macrolide antibiotics, pentamidine, antimalarials, antipsychotics, arsenic trioxide, and methadone. Treatment for TdP includes immediate defibrillation for hemodynamic instability and intravenous magnesium sulfate. Potassium levels should be maintained in the high normal range, and all QT prolonging agents must be promptly discontinued.

### Advanced management of electrical storm: beyond antiarrhythmics [^5113eba1]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Electrical storm is a life-threatening condition caused by recurrent ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), either ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). This condition portends a grim prognosis, and acute management requires emergent pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.Commonly, rhythm control may be the sole focus when managing electrical storm, especially at institutions with limited resources. Beyond rhythm management, the use of certain proven diagnostic studies and interventions that are known to improve outcomes is key to maximise survival. To highlight the utility of a contemporary algorithm for advanced management of patients with refractory VAs, we present a case involving a previously healthy patient who presented with acute onset of electrical storm and cardiogenic shock and required several urgent investigations and interventions to achieve electrical and haemodynamic stability and an overall favourable outcome.

Vasovagal syncope—natural history and treatment framing—is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Ventricular tachycardia after naloxone administration in an adolescent [^08e9e7de]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Naloxone is a medication with a largely benign safety profile that is frequently administered in the emergency department to patients presenting with altered mental status. Ventricular tachycardia has been reported after naloxone administration in adult patients with prior use of opiate or sympathomimetic medications. However, no such reports exist in the pediatric population or in patients who have no known history of opiate or sympathomimetic medication use. We describe a case of ventricular tachycardia after naloxone administration in a 17-year-old male with no known prior use of opiate or sympathomimetic agents who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status of unknown etiology. Emergency physicians may wish to prepare for prompt treatment of ventricular arrythmias when administering naloxone to pediatric patients presenting with altered mental status.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^7093ea46]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Drugs that cause TdP: incidence interpretation and prescribing guidance indicate uncertainty in attribution and emphasize individualized risk–benefit decisions. The proportion of sudden arrhythmic deaths that are due to TdP is unclear because few individuals are being monitored at the time of death, and when TdP occurs in outpatient settings first responders are likely to observe ventricular fibrillation, making it impossible to determine whether ventricular fibrillation was preceded by QT prolongation and then TdP. Use of a QT-prolonging drug must be based on risk-benefit analysis in individual patients, and where efficacy of alternatives is equivalent, the non–QT-prolonging agent should be preferred; where benefit clearly outweighs risk, QT prolongation should not limit necessary therapy. The only class of drugs for which reasonable TdP incidence data are available is the antiarrhythmic agents.

### Cardiac safety parameters of olanzapine: comparison with other atypical and typical antipsychotics [^8225b319]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Alterations of electrocardiogram results and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported since the beginning of neuroleptic treatment. In particular, a temporal association exists between some antipsychotics and prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc), an event that may increase the risk for developing a potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes if it significantly exceeds normal intraindividual and interindividual variation. Although the incidence of serious adverse cardiac events in response to antipsychotic medications is relatively low, any possibility for the occurrence of cardiotoxicity warrants continued study. The present article reviews important differences among antipsychotic drugs in the potential for, and occurrence of, serious adverse cardiac outcomes and suggests that olanzapine, as therapeutically administered to patients with schizophrenia and related psychoses, does not contribute significantly to a QTc prolongation that could result in potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias.

### Mechanisms and risks of electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation when using antipsychotic drugs [^82f59267]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews cardiac electrophysiology, with a focus on the assessment of the electrocardiographically determined corrected QT (QTc) interval and its role as a marker for potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Presently, using the QTc interval as a surrogate for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is handicapped, in part, by the limitations of currently available group-derived formulas to estimate the QTc interval. Regulatory agencies have sharpened their interest in this arena. Substantial progress almost certainly awaits the application of individual rather than group-derived formulas to estimate the QTc interval. Until this refinement arrives, clinicians are advised to exercise caution when administering antipsychotic drugs with the potential to significantly prolong the QT interval. Caution is particularly urged in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Sudden cardiac death and psychiatric or neurological disease—risk signals and drug effects—states that the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is increased in patients with seizure disorders and schizophrenia; whether this is due to disease-related factors, cardiovascular comorbidity, or therapies is uncertain, and drug interactions may also contribute. Antipsychotic agents known to produce marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes include thioridazine and haloperidol, while generally newer antipsychotics also prolong QT with fewer reported torsades cases; it is not known whether differences reflect intrinsic drug effects or exposure differences between newer and older agents.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)—“Nonpharmacologic treatments should be attempted first with all patients” and include withdrawing medications that might worsen POTS, enhanced salt and fluid intake, compression garments, and limiting deconditioning; for suspected hypovolemia, patients “should drink at least 2–3 L of water per day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to approximately 10–12 g/day.” Exercise is advised with a “regular, structured, graduated, and supervised exercise program,” and initially “exercise should be restricted to non-upright exercises.” For rescue volume expansion, “1 L of normal saline infused over 1 hour decreases orthostatic tachycardia and improves symptoms for several hours to 2 days”; although not trial-tested, “this approach is recommended as rescue therapy,” whereas “Long-term infusions of intravenous saline are not recommended for routine care.” To reduce tachycardia and palpitations, “low-dose propranolol (10–20 mg PO) acutely lowers standing heart rate,” while higher doses are less tolerated; ivabradine may help, with “Approximately 60% of patients with POTS treated with ivabradine in an open-label study” showing symptom improvement. For cholinergic augmentation, “Pyridostigmine is a peripheral acetylcholinesterase inhibitor,” and “The drug blunts orthostatic tachycardia and can improve chronic symptoms but is limited by adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, and increased urinary urgency and frequency.” For venous return and vasoconstriction, midodrine “significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but to a lesser degree than intravenous saline” and “should be administered 3 times daily,” with dosing “only … during daytime hours” due to supine hypertension risk.

COPD and heart disease frequently coexist and people with both disorders have particularly high cardiovascular mortality. There are concerns about giving β-blockers to people with concomitant COPD that include reduced basal lung function, diminished effectiveness of emergency β-agonist treatments, reduced benefit of long-acting β-agonist treatment and difficulty in discriminating between asthma and COPD. β-Blockers appear to reduce lung function in both the general population and those with COPD because they are poorly selective for cardiac β1-adrenoceptors over respiratory β2-adrenoceptors, and studies have shown that higher β-agonist doses are required to overcome the β-blockade. COPD and cardiovascular disease share similar environmental risks and both disease states have high adrenergic and inflammatory activation. β-Blockers may therefore be particularly helpful in reducing cardiovascular events in this high-risk group. They may reduce the background inflammatory state, and inhibit the tachycardia and hypertension associated with both the endogenous adrenaline and high-dose β-agonist treatment associated with acute exacerbations of COPD. Some studies have suggested no increased and, at times, reduced mortality in patients with COPD taking β-blockers for heart disease. However, these are all observational studies and there are no randomised controlled trials. Potential ways to improve this dilemma include the development of highly β1-selective β-blockers or the use of non-β-blocking heart rate reducing agents, such as ivabridine, if these are proven to be beneficial in randomised controlled trials.

### Association of antidepressant medication type with the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the ARIC study [^5787f343]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study did not show a reduced risk of CVD with SSRI usage compared with use of TCAs and other non‐SSRI antidepressants. Specifically, there were no differences in incidence of AF, HF, MI, and ischemic stroke across classes of antidepressants (SSRI versus non‐SSRI) over 26 years in a study sample in which at least 13% were prescribed antidepressants at some point during the study. These results do not support the presence of a protective effect of SSRIs as compared with other antidepressant medications for CVD.

TCA medications are well known to cause tachycardia and autonomic dysfunction, leading to orthostatic hypotension and ECG changes in a dose‐dependent manner. 1, 4 This observation is particularly important given that tachycardia has been linked to increased risks of coronary heart disease and death in many studies. 33, 34, 35 Cohen et al 36 have found that receiving a TCA prescription is associated with an increased risk of MI as compared with other antidepressants; however, this study was limited by the risk of information bias attributable to using an administrative database to determine exposure and the limited duration of follow‐up. Other reports have suggested that both SSRIs and TCAs are associated with autonomic changes, 37 which were linked with increased AF risk in a large population‐based cohort. 38 Additionally, increased activation of serotonin receptors has been associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, particularly AF. 12, 13 In summary, based on the findings of the current study as well as other reports in the literature, there is not good evidence to support a differential association of SSRIs versus non‐SSRIs on CVD events. We did not, however, compare CVD risk in patients taking all antidepressants with those not taking antidepressants.

### Arrhythmias in patients with heart Failure prescribed dofetilide or Sotalol [^bea11e4a]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) associated with QT interval prolongation. TdP can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA).More than 200 medications can cause QT prolongation/TdP, including commonly prescribed antimicrobials, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiarrhythmics, and many others.Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is an independent risk factor for drug-induced TdP. Patients with HFrEF demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to drug-induced QT lengthening.Guidelines recommend enhanced electrocardiogram monitoring or avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs in patients with HFrEF.

At least 50% of patients with HF have preserved ejection fraction.QT prolongation is predictive of diastolic dysfunctionand is associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest.QT intervals are longer in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) than in those without HF.Patients with HFpEF demonstrate enhanced response to drug-induced QT lengtheningand are at increased risk of drug-induced QT prolongation compared to patients with normal ventricular function.However, it remains unknown whether patients with HFpEF are at increased risk for drug-induced TdP and/or SCA.

About 40% to 50% of patients with HFpEF have atrial fibrillation,for which the antiarrhythmic agents dofetilide and sotalol are used commonly.Dofetilide and sotalol cause TdP in 0.8% to 1.3%, and 1.7% to 3.6%, of patients, respectively, with an increased risk in those with HFrEF. Assessment of the potential for enhanced risk of proarrhythmia and SCA in patients with HFpEF is important.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with HFpEF are at increased risk for drug-induced VT and SCA compared to patients who do not have HF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia—High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

### Transient fetal tachycardia after intravenous diphenhydramine administration [^78e158d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal tachycardia is attributable to a variety of etiologies, including an untreated maternal medical condition or an indicator of potential fetal compromise. Maternal medication administration may also affect the fetal heart rate.

Case

A 28-year-old nulliparous patient at 41 weeks of gestation was treated for pruritus with intravenous diphenhydramine after epidural administration of fentanyl. Within 14 minutes, the fetal heart rate increased from a baseline of 155 beats per minute (bpm) to more than 200 bpm while maintaining moderate variability. This was accompanied by an increase in uterine contractions occurring every 1.5 minutes. The fetal tachycardia lasted 51 minutes; several hours later, a healthy neonate was delivered.

Conclusion

Diphenhydramine may produce transient fetal tachycardia as well as increased maternal uterine activity.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome—clinical features and risks include that marked QT prolongation with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs and most cases display a “short-long-short” sequence before tachycardia. QT intervals, uncorrected for rate, are generally greater than 500 ms, prominent U waves are common, and marked QTU prolongation may be evident only on postpause beats. Genetic susceptibility may contribute, with commoner DNA variants having frequencies ranging up to 15% of some populations. Presentations include incidental detection, palpitations, syncope due to prolonged episodes of torsades de pointes, or sudden cardiac death. The QT-prolonging agent d-sotalol increased mortality in a large randomized clinical trial, and in the DIAMOND trial, 3.3% of patients with severe heart failure (HF) had torsades de pointes during the first 72 h of dofetilide therapy. An up-to-date list is maintained at www.torsades.org and www.qtdrugs.org.

### Race, sex, and neighborhood socioeconomic disparities in ablation of ventricular tachycardia within a national Medicare cohort [^98887ff8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Our understanding and management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) has evolved significantly over the past several decades. Numerous antiarrhythmic medications may suppress VT and reduce the risk of recurrence, but these medications may be poorly tolerated or ineffective and carry the risk of numerous adverse effects and toxicities.Although implantable cardioverters‐defibrillators (ICDs) can prevent sudden death from VT and ventricular fibrillation,,ICD discharges are painful and traumatic. Defibrillation, particularly when repeated, has been associated with prolonged anxiety, depression, and decreased quality of life.

Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of VT and improvements in technology have facilitated the development of catheter ablation as a safe and reliable method for VT suppression.Current guidelines recommend considering ablation for patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy with recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmic medications, or when antiarrhythmic medications are not desired.Yet, little is known about whether and to what degree disparities exist in treatment of VT with ablation.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a retrospective observational study to assess whether race, sex, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with catheter ablation during hospitalization with VT in the Medicare population.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^0ec41809]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Up till recently, it was largely under-recognised as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12-19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 min of standing from a supine position and in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology and management.

### Antiarrhythmic medication in neonates and infants with supraventricular tachycardia [^06d52408]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, no association was found between either the various medications or the SVT mechanisms and outcome. Furthermore, there was no difference in outcome between infants who had a single therapy or who needed more than one prophylactic medication to control the arrhythmia. This indicates that, even if initially the arrhythmia is difficult to control and the prophylactic treatment complex to adjust, this may not imply an unfavorable outcome. In contrast to our findings, a study conducted between 1971 and 1997 including 109 neonates with SVTs found that initial treatment difficulties were significant risk factors for prolonged arrhythmias. However, these findings may not be directly comparable to our findings due to a cohort including more patients with pre-excitation (1/3 of the cohort) and different drug regimens (3/4 of the patients received digoxin).

In our cohort, infants with fetal tachycardias had a significantly higher risk of persistent tachycardias; 59% of the infants with a history of fetal tachycardia continued with antiarrhythmic treatment for more than one year. This result suggests that this group of patients may need longer prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy. In a historic study with 17% fetal SVT in the cohort, fetal SVT was not identified as a risk factor for prolonged SVT problems. Other authors also report favorable outcomes after fetal SVT, but always in small cohorts with 20–30 patients: 70–90% patients were asymptomatic without medication after the age of 1 year. Some difference from our results might be explained by their inclusion of neonates with atrial flutter, who are known to have excellent prognosis. Furthermore, some groups give prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment to all infants with a history of fetal tachycardia, whether or not the tachycardia persists postnatally.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^1577e5db]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a syndrome in which the sinus heart rate is inexplicably faster than expected and associated symptoms are present. The heart rate at rest, even in a supine position, can exceed 100 beats/min; minimal activity accelerates the rate rapidly and substantially. Patients with IST may require restriction from physical activity. Mechanisms responsible for IST are understood incompletely. It is important to distinguish IST from so-called appropriate sinus tachycardia and from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with which overlap may occur. Because the long-term outcome seems to be benign, treatment may be unnecessary or may be as simple as physical training. However, for patients with intolerable symptoms, therapeutic measures are warranted. Even at high doses, β-adrenergic blockers, the first-line therapy, often are ineffective; the same is true for most other medical therapies. In rare instances, catheter- or surgically- based right atrial or sinus node modification may be helpful, but even this is fraught with limited efficacy and potential complications. Overtreatment, in an attempt to reduce symptoms, can be difficult to avoid, but is discouraged.

### Relationships among achieved heart rate, β-blocker dose and long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure with atrial fibrillation [^0b022167]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

It is not clear why the clinical benefits observed by achieving target doses of β-blockers and target heart rates in those with HF and sinus rhythm are not seen in the setting of AF, but there are several potential mechanisms. The variability in R-R intervals in AF leads to a reduction in cardiac output and an increase in left atrial pressure independent of effects on heart rate or atrial activity.This phenomenon may be particularly prominent in patients with LV dysfunction.This reduced cardiac output could be further decreased with the acute haemodynamic changes of β-blocker therapy.The combination of these effects may lead to adverse haemodynamic changes that prevent patients from achieving the long-term benefits from β-blocker therapy. This hypothesis could be tested by looking at the effects of β-blocker therapy in patients with HF and AF stratified by cardiac output prior to initiation of therapy. Alternatively, the loss of atrial contraction and the consequently lower stroke volume that occurs when AF is present may, in the patient with HF, require a higher heart rate to maintain clinical stability. The heart rate-lowering effects of β-blockers in sinus rhythm are primarily through effects on the sinus node, while in AF these changes are through effects on the atrioventricular node. The benefit shown with the use of ivabradine suggests that the beneficial effects of these agents may be specific to effects on the sinus node.Regardless, further clarification of the mechanisms underlying the differences between patients with HF in AF and sinus rhythm, may suggest how to optimise the management of these patients.

Admission tachycardia

We found that patients admitted with a heart rate >120 bpm had an improved prognosis, which seems primarily related to a reduction in repeat hospitalisation. This has not previously been reported in this population, to the best of our knowledge. This analysis was not prespecified, and could represent a chance finding. While this group tended to be younger, we also suspect that those with significant tachycardia at admission may be more likely to have AF as a cause rather than a consequence of HF. This includes the subset of patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, a condition known to have a more benign prognosis than other causes of HF once rate and/or rhythm are controlled.Alternatively, elevated heart rates may provide beneficial haemodynamic compensation during times of stress in these patients.Finally, patients with tachycardia on admission may have larger changes in heart rate with therapy, a metric known to be important in predicting response to therapy which was also associated with reduced outcomes in patients with HFrEF.Regardless, this is an interesting finding which should be prospectively validated in future studies.

### Long QT syndrome caused by noncardiac drugs [^b7424d48]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use (including antibiotics, histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications) incidentally block potassium channels in myocardial cells, prolong the QT interval, and may trigger malignant arrhythmias. Although the odds for a given patient for developing arrhythmias are small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily identified from their medical history. The list of risk factors includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated and the most important preventive measure is to avoid concurrent administration of 2 or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug. We performed a computerized literature search using the key words "long QT," "torsade," "drug-adverse effects," and "drug-ventricular arrhythmias," searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes. The references in each of these reports also were reviewed to identify additional publications. In addition, we reviewed the published reviews and the Internet sites dealing with drug-induced arrhythmias. All the original articles quoted in these reviews and Web sites were examined critically.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: the PROCAMIO study [^064d835f]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an uncommon but dangerous medical condition, with an extremely variable clinical presentation, from being almost asymptomatic to producing cardiac arrest. When the clinical condition as the patient seeks medical attention is not compromised (i.e. blood pressure is maintained and there are no overt signs of heart failure) VT is usually referred to as ‘stable’ or ‘well tolerated’. Although it may remain stable for minutes or even hours, the condition produces justified concern and requires prompt intervention for termination because haemodynamic instability and deterioration leading to collapse can develop at any time. Termination can be achieved with electrical cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, and pacing techniques. Following guidelines recommendations, intravenous procainamide, and amiodarone are drugs of choice for the treatment of haemodynamically stable VT with a class II recommendation. – However, although both drugs are well known and have been in conventional clinical use for decades, – there is no scientific evidence to base the use of one drug vs. the other in this clinical context. Controlled trials with amiodarone have been performed in other clinical contexts – (i.e. hypotensive VT or cardiac arrest) and procainamide has been compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs,but no controlled prospective trial have focused in comparing these two agents in well-tolerated VT.

The PROCAMIO is a multicentre, prospective and randomized study that compares the safety and efficacy of intravenous procainamide and amiodarone in the acute treatment of wide QRS complex monomorphic tachycardias (presumably VT) which are haemodynamically well tolerated.

Sustained monomorphic VT always involves a differential diagnosis with supraventricular tachycardia. However, the majority of wide QRS complex tachycardias presenting at Emergency Departments are in fact VTs, even if the haemodynamic tolerance is acceptable.As such, the present trial refers to ‘wide QRS complex tachycardia (probably of ventricular origin)’ rather than to ‘VT’, assuming some uncertainty in diagnosis.

### QT interval and drug therapy [^1867e14d]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The QT interval is an important component of the electrocardiogram, which when prolonged can predict the risk of developing the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes. There is growing understanding of the genetics associated with cardiac arrhythmias and an increasing number of drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Consequently, assessment of the effect of drugs on the QT interval has become a significant aspect of drug development, regulatory assessment and clinical care. Here, we review the QT interval and the risks associated with drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval.

### Drugs and Brugada syndrome patients: review of the literature, recommendations, and an up-to-date website (www.brugadadrugs.org) [^952a8248]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, the Brugada syndrome has been recognized as an important cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals at a relatively young age. Importantly, many drugs have been reported to induce the characteristic Brugada syndrome-linked ECG abnormalities and/or (fatal) ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the literature on the use of drugs in Brugada syndrome patients, to make recommendations based on the literature and on expert opinion regarding drug safety, and to ensure worldwide online and up-to-date availability of this information to all physicians who treat Brugada syndrome patients.

Methods

We performed an extensive review of the literature, formed an international expert panel to produce a consensus recommendation to each drug, and initiated a website (www.brugadadrugs.org).

Results

The literature search yielded 506 reports for consideration. Drugs were categorized into one of four categories: (1) drugs to be avoided (n = 18); (2) drugs preferably avoided (n = 23); (3) antiarrhythmic drugs (n = 4); and (4) diagnostic drugs (n = 4). Level of evidence for most associations was C (only consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard-of-care) as there are no randomized studies and few nonrandomized studies in Brugada syndrome patients.

Conclusion

Many drugs have been associated with adverse events in Brugada syndrome patients. We have initiated a website (www.brugadadrugs.org) to ensure worldwide availability of information on safe drug use in Brugada syndrome patients.

### Drug-induced proarrhythmia and use of QTc-prolonging agents: clues for clinicians [^ade7e1ab]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Use of drugs with the potential for prolongation of the QTc interval and proarrhythmia is a growing challenge facing clinicians. Many pharmaceutical agents have been denied approval for human use, approved with restrictions and warnings regarding proarrhythmia, or withdrawn from the market based upon arrhythmic risk. Despite known risk factors for QTc prolongation and drug-induced arrhythmia, precise prediction of the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in an individual patient remains difficult. The mechanism of drug-induced TdP typically involves use of an agent that blocks the I(Kr) cardiac potassium current, often in combination with risk-amplifying factors such as high drug levels, reduced drug metabolism, polypharmacy, and patient-specific factors such as gender, age, and genetic polymorphism. For the clinician, an integrated approach involving appreciation of the risk factors for proarrhythmia combined with computer-based risk assessment is the best method for reducing the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia in clinical practice.

### Toxicity of cough and cold medications in children-AAFP (...) [^8bae1757]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Cough and cold preparations have been shown to decrease symptoms in adolescents and adults, but a comparison of OTC preparations and placebo in younger children showed no significant difference in reducing cough. The side effects of these medications are potentially harmful. One study of 249, 038 exposures to OTC cough and cold preparations in children younger than six years cited 72 major adverse effects and four deaths. Several years ago, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that physicians educate parents and caregivers about the risks of using medicines containing codeine and dextromethorphan in children. In addition, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration has recommended that all phenylpropanolamine preparations be removed from the market. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle and can reduce nasal congestion.

Toxic effects include hypertension, tachycardia, and central nervous system stimulation. Cerebral hemorrhage and stroke are other possible toxic effects. Dysrhythmias and myocardial infarction have also been reported. PPA toxicity can present with similar toxic effects, except that bradycardia might occur in place of the tachycardia that occurs with the use of pseudoephedrine. Chlorpheniramine and brompheniramine are antihistamines used in many cough and cold preparations, although histamine does not seem to be a factor in cold symptoms in children. These agents can cause CNS depression and other anticholinergic symptoms. Other possible symptoms of toxicity include tachycardia, blurred vision, agitation, hyper-activity, and seizures. Torsades de pointes has also occurred. Dextromethorphan has been known to cause lethargy, stupor, hyperexcitability, abnormal limb movements, and coma.

Toxicity may occur for several reasons: unclear labeling, dosing errors, and use of adult formulations rather than those appropriate for children. The authors conclude that OTC cough and cold medications are not effective in children and are associated with many potential toxicities. They recommend that, if a parent insists on giving one of these medications to a child, the physician should negotiate discontinuation within two days if the child fails to improve.

### Excessive postural tachycardia and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in youth: associations with distress, impairment, health behaviors, and medication recommendations [^17cbbfd4]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Among adolescents with fatigue and postural dizziness, it is unclear how health behaviors and emotional distress relate to the presence of excessive postural tachycardia. We prospectively evaluated adolescents aged 13-22 years presenting with symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction between September 2017 and December 2018. Patients underwent standard 10-minute, 70-degree head-up tilt testing. Clinician diagnoses and recommendations were recorded from the medical record. Patients completed validated self-report measures of lifestyle factors, autonomic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and functional disability. Of 179 patients, 58 were diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and 59 had excessive postural tachycardia, with 90.5% concordance between the 2 groups. Presence of excessive postural tachycardia was associated with greater baseline fluid intake and likelihood of medication prescription in their treatment plan. Medication findings were replicated for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome diagnosis. Presence of excessive postural tachycardia or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome did not differentiate patients on perceived symptom severity, emotional distress, disability, or health behaviors but did appear to determine treatment recommendations.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^4903eba4]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID symptom management—commonly used medications are outlined with typical doses, indications, and notable side effects. Propranolol 5–10 mg BID to QID is used for IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia), POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), OH (orthostatic hypotension), NCS (neurocardiogenic syncope), and episodic hypertension, with bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, depression, and asthma exacerbation noted. Midodrine 2.5–10 mg TID to QID targets POTS, OH, NCS, and hypotension and can cause supine hypertension, scalp paresthesias, and piloerection. Fludrocortisone is started at 0.05 mg QD for 1 week then increased by 0.05 mg QD every week to a max dose of 0.2 mg QD for POTS, OH, NCS, or hypotension, with hypokalemia, edema, and headache listed. Pyridostigmine 30–60 mg BID to TID is noted for POTS, OH, AN, and GI dysmotility with constipation, with diarrhea and muscle twitching reported. H1 and H2 antihistamines in combination have a sample regimen of cetirizine 10 mg daily or levocetirizine 5 mg daily plus famotidine 20 mg daily or bid for MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) symptoms, with listed adverse effects for cetirizine and famotidine. Low‑dose naltrexone sample regimen starts 1 mg QD for 4 weeks then increases by 1 mg QD every 4 weeks to a max dose of 4.5 mg QD being studied for fatigue, PEM/PESE (postexertional malaise/postexertional symptom exacerbation), and headache, and often requires compounding with diarrhea and nausea noted. Methylphenidate 5–10 mg BID to TID is listed for POTS, OH, NCS, brain fog, and fatigue with headache, tachycardia, insomnia, and risk of PEM/PESE exacerbation during the drug’s duration of action. Amantadine 100 mg QD to BID is described for fatigue and brain fog, is contraindicated for ESRD (end‑stage renal disease) with withdrawal risks if abruptly discontinued, and may cause dry mouth, OH, neuropsychiatric symptoms, livedo reticularis, nausea, and abdominal pain. Gabapentin 100–300 mg QHS to TID, then increased 100–300 mg every week, is described for neuropathic pain and poor sleep quality with need for renal dosing and brain fog, sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea. The table additionally lists COVID‑19 vaccine with an annual booster to lower risk of subsequent COVID infection sequelae and reduce the severity and duration of PASC, while vaccine reaction or worsening of symptoms is noted. A general principle states that medication use in Long COVID generally follows standard practice regarding indications and dosing with extra attention to starting doses lower and ramping up slowly, prioritizing patient preference, using caution with medications that may worsen some symptoms while improving others, and tapering off if no noticeable benefit.

### Incidence, diagnosis, and management of QT prolongation induced by cancer therapies: a systematic review [^934d8282]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Management of QTc Prolongation

When a prolonged QTc interval is detected (>500 ms or an increase of >60 ms longer than baseline), the patient should be evaluated carefully, with discontinuation of all offending drugs immediately (if appropriate). Strategies previously discussed to identify causes of QTc prolongation should be considered. Patients who experience associated syncope or presyncope, palpitations, or QTc >500 ms and/or bradycardia (HR, <60 bpm) should be evaluated immediately in a monitored setting. An ECG should be repeated every 24 hours until resolution of QTc prolongation is confirmed. A prolonged QTc increases the risk of a potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia called TdP (Figure 4 A). Most of the data on the risk of TdP in relation to QTc prolongation are from large registries of patients with congenital long QT syndromes. 193, 194 These data show that each 10‐ms increase in QTc contributes approximately a 5% to 7% increase in risk for cardiac events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and/or death. Other risk factors for TdP beyond QTc have been described in settings outside of cancer therapy (Table 5) and, thus, the extrapolation to the cancer population is less clear. 195 Although some medications are associated with QTc prolongation, not all drugs that prolong the QTc cause TdP. Therefore, the risk assessment of TdP attributable to drugs should not only be based on QTc alone but considered in the context of other predisposing TdP risk factors. 196 Recurrence of TdP is frequent and, hence, the occurrence of a single event mandates urgent clinical evaluation and monitoring.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^c74a09c8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant intoxication—assessment and hyperadrenergic symptom management—clinicians should assess hyperadrenergic signs and symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation, and ongoing monitoring and management of vital signs—especially heart rate and blood pressure—is critical to prevent complications from sympathomimetic toxicity. GABAergic agents are the primary treatment for stimulant-related hyperadrenergic symptoms, and significant hyperadrenergic symptoms should typically be managed in an acute care setting. For cocaine intoxication with cardiovascular disease, beta blockers are generally contraindicated; many experts recommend alternative medications such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, noting these classes may be most beneficial for hypertension and vasospasm but may result in poor control of reflex tachycardia. Limited data indicate that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine for more severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms) are beneficial for stimulant-induced agitation, can be useful for hypertension and tachycardia, and thus should be considered in the management of the hyperadrenergic state of stimulant intoxication; clinicians should monitor for medication side effects with usual care. If considering pharmacotherapy with a beta blocker, one with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (e.g., labetalol) is preferred due to low risk of unopposed alpha stimulation, and clinicians should consider consulting with a specialist in these instances; additionally, calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and vasospasm but not necessarily tachycardia, and benzodiazepines appear safe for non-cardiovascular related symptoms.

### A community-based trial of commercially available compression tights in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^d5302d84]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Compression garments reduce heart rate and symptoms in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in an acute laboratory setting. Patients taking medications controlling heart rate have less benefit from compression than those not on medications. The effectiveness of commercially available garments in a community-based setting, with and without medication use, is not known.

Objectives

The authors sought to evaluate commercially available compression tights in a community-based setting both with, and without, medications modulating heart rate, using a clinical trial with 2 before-after protocols conducted in a randomized crossover fashion.

Methods

Participants (N = 26) held medications during protocol #1 and took medications as normal during protocol #2. For each, participants completed 4, 10-minute active stand tests in the morning (AM) and afternoon (PM) with the garments on (ON) and off (OFF) (AM-OFF, AM-ON, PM-ON, and PM-OFF). Heart rate (Holter monitor) and symptoms (Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptom Score [VOSS]) were measured for each standing test.

Results

Protocol #1: Standing heart rate was reduced (105 [99-116] beats/min vs 119 [105-130] beats/min; P < 0.001) and symptoms improved (P < 0.001), during AM-ON vs AM-OFF. Standing heart rate (P = 0.04) and symptoms (P = 0.004) increased when compression was removed after several hours. Protocol #2: Standing heart rate was reduced (84 [77-90] beats/min vs 89 [84-100] beats/min; P < 0.001), and symptoms improved (P = 0.03), during AM-ON vs AM-OFF. Standing heart rate (P = 0.02) and symptoms (P < 0.001) increased when compression was removed after several hours.

Conclusions

Commercially available compression tights reduced heart rate and symptoms both acutely and after several hours of use. This additional benefit persisted whether concomitant medications were used. (Compression Garments in the Community With POTS [COM-COM-POTS]; NCT04881318).

### An international consensus study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome diagnostic criteria using the Delphi method [^019a1ba0]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) impedes research and clinical management of patients receiving antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this study was to develop NMS diagnostic criteria reflecting a broad consensus among clinical knowledge experts, represented by an international multispecialty physician panel.

Participants

Eleven psychiatrists, 2 neurologists, 2 anesthesiologists, and 2 emergency medicine specialists participated in a formal Delphi consensus procedure.

Evidence

A core bibliography consisting of 12 prominent, current reviews of the NMS literature was identified by an objective, comprehensive electronic search strategy. Each panel member was given a copy of these references and asked to examine them before commencing the survey process.

Consensus Process

After reviewing the core bibliography, panel members were asked to list any clinical signs or symptoms or diagnostic studies that they believed, on the basis of their knowledge and clinical experience, were useful in making a diagnosis of NMS. In subsequent survey rounds, panel members assigned priority points to these items, and items that failed to receive a minimum priority score were eliminated from the next round. Information about individual panel member responses was fed back to the group anonymously in the form of the group median or mean and the number of members who had ranked or scored each survey item. The a priori consensus endpoint was defined operationally as a change of 10% or less in the mean priority score for any individual item, and an average absolute value change of 5% or less across all items, between consecutive rounds. The survey was conducted from January 2009 through September 2009.

Results

Consensus was reached on the fifth round regarding the following criteria: recent dopamine antagonist exposure, or dopamine agonist withdrawal; hyperthermia; rigidity; mental status alteration; creatine kinase elevation; sympathetic nervous system lability; tachycardia plus tachypnea; and a negative work-up for other causes. The panel also reached a consensus on the relative importance of these criteria and on the following critical values for quantitative criteria: hyperthermia, > 100.4°F or > 38.0°C on at least 2 occasions; creatine kinase elevation, at least 4 times the upper limit of normal; blood pressure elevation, ≥ 25% above baseline; blood pressure fluctuation, ≥ 20 mm Hg (diastolic) or ≥ 25 mm Hg (systolic) change within 24 hours; tachycardia, ≥ 25% above baseline; and tachypnea, ≥ 50% above baseline.

Conclusions

These diagnostic criteria significantly advance the field because they represent the consensus of an international multispecialty expert panel, include critical values, provide guidance regarding the relative importance of individual elements, and are less influenced by particular theoretical biases than most previously published criteria. They require validation before being applied in clinical settings.

### Postoperative anticholinergic poisoning: concealed complications of a commonly used medication [^6cd9194f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Scopolamine is a potent anticholinergic compound used commonly for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Scopolamine can cause atypical anticholinergic syndromes due to its prominent central antimuscarinic effects.

Case Report

A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) 20 h after hospital discharge for a right-knee meniscectomy, with altered mental status (AMS) and dystonic extremity movements that began 12 h after her procedure. Her vital signs were normal and physical examination revealed mydriasis, visual hallucinations, hyperreflexia, and dystonic movements. Laboratory data, lumbar puncture, and computed tomography were unrevealing. The sustained AMS prompted a re-evaluation that revealed urinary overflow with 500 mL of retained urine discovered on ultrasound and a scopolamine patch hidden behind her ear. Her mental status improved shortly after patch removal and physostigmine, with complete resolution after 24 h with discharge diagnosis of scopolamine-induced anticholinergic toxicity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although therapeutically dosed scopolamine transdermal patches rarely cause complications, incomplete toxidromes can be insidiously common in polypharmacy settings. Providers should thoroughly evaluate the skin of intoxicated patients for additional adherent medications that may result in a delay in ED diagnosis and curative therapies. Our case, as well as rare case reports of therapeutic scopolamine-induced anticholinergic toxicity, demonstrates that peripheral anticholinergic effects, such as tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, and hyperpyrexia are often not present, and incremental doses of physostigmine may be required to reverse scopolamine's long duration of action. This further complicates identification of the anticholinergic toxidrome and diagnosis.

### Phenytoin as an effective treatment for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia due to QT prolongation in a patient with multiple drug intolerances [^0e3eb7c8]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 69-year-old woman presenting with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by QT prolongation. Owing to known intolerances to a majority of antiarrhythmic medications, one remaining option was to initiate phenytoin. Phenytoin's narrow therapeutic window, multiple drug interactions and side effect profile make it an infrequently used antiarrhythmic. It is, however, a potent antiarrhythmic agent, which may be useful in treatment of ventricular tachycardia, especially in patients with multiple drug intolerances.

### Tetrabenazine (Xenazine) [^ce7607c9]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.8 QTc Prolongation

XENAZINE causes a small increase (about 8 msec) in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. QT prolongation can lead to development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The use of XENAZINE should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc, including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].

XENAZINE should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.9 Hypotension and Orthostatic Hypotension

XENAZINE induced postural dizziness in healthy volunteers receiving single doses of 25 or 50 mg. One subject had syncope, and one subject with postural dizziness had documented orthostasis. Dizziness occurred in 4% of XENAZINE-treated patients (vs. none on placebo) in the 12-week, controlled trial; however, blood pressure was not measured during these events. Monitoring of vital signs on standing should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^17387c91]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Cilostazol—Used primarily for intermittent claudication, cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor believed to heighten the risk of fatal arrhythmias in patients with HF; this increased risk is presumed to occur within 1 month of initiation. It produces a dose-related increase in heart rate of 5 to 7 bpm and increases ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia regardless of dose. Cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with HF of any severity.
