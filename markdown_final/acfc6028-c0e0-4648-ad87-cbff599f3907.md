## Question

IV metronidazole dosing for trichomonas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intravenous metronidazole dosing for Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including when IV therapy is appropriate, what dose to use, how long to treat, and how to adjust for special populations and follow-up testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether IV metronidazole is indicated for trichomoniasis at all. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability that would justify IV use. Next, I will check guideline-supported oral regimens and see if any guidance exists for IV dosing in trichomonas. After that, I need to extrapolate a reasonable IV regimen from labeled anaerobic infection dosing if no direct guidance exists. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety, and follow-up testing, and then synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the indication question, because I need to ensure we are not overcomplicating therapy. Trichomoniasis is treated orally in essentially all patients; major guidelines recommend oral nitroimidazoles and do not list IV metronidazole as a standard regimen for uncomplicated T. vaginalis infection, which implies IV therapy is not routine for trichomonas unless there is a compelling reason such as severe intolerance to oral therapy or a need for parenteral therapy in the context of a broader anaerobic infection or inpatient management scenario [^11488KRC] [^1131F4wt] [^115PQwis].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale before jumping to dosing. Metronidazole has excellent oral bioavailability, and oral and IV routes achieve similar systemic exposure, so IV is generally unnecessary for trichomonas unless oral therapy is not feasible or the patient is being managed parenterally for other indications; this supports reserving IV for select scenarios rather than routine use [^112APtUZ].

> I should confirm what the guidelines actually recommend for oral therapy, since that anchors the standard of care. For women, the preferred regimen is metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, with metronidazole 2 g orally once as an alternative; for men, metronidazole 2 g orally once is recommended, with tinidazole 2 g once as an alternative, and these oral regimens are supported by randomized data showing superior cure with the 7-day multidose regimen in women compared with single-dose therapy [^11488KRC] [^1131F4wt] [^113hTRS5].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any authoritative source provides a direct IV regimen for trichomonas. I need to check CDC, WHO, and FDA materials; I find no guideline-endorsed IV regimen specifically for T. vaginalis, which means there is no validated IV trichomonas protocol, so any IV dosing would be off-label extrapolation from anaerobic infection dosing and should be used cautiously with clinical judgment [^notfound].

> Let me consider a reasonable extrapolation if IV is truly necessary. The FDA-labeled IV regimen for serious anaerobic infections uses a loading dose of 15 mg/kg IV once, followed by 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 7–10 days; for a typical 70 kg adult, that approximates 500 mg IV every 6 hours, and given the similar systemic exposure by IV and oral routes, it is plausible to align duration with the oral trichomonas regimen, targeting 7 days when treating trichomonas rather than extending to 10 days unless there are additional anaerobic indications [^116J4Bwj] [^1121JS6H] [^111aBDGa] [^112APtUZ].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot take anything by mouth at all and we must rely solely on IV therapy. In that narrow circumstance, I would use metronidazole 15 mg/kg IV once as a loading dose, then 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 7 days, rounding to practical 500 mg increments for a 70 kg adult, and reassess clinically; if adherence to the 6-hour schedule is a concern, I should plan for transition back to oral therapy as soon as feasible given comparable bioavailability and guideline preference for oral regimens [^116J4Bwj] [^112APtUZ] [^11488KRC].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In pregnancy, metronidazole is considered acceptable and is used orally; there is no validated IV trichomonas regimen in pregnancy, so if IV is contemplated, it should be for compelling reasons and with obstetric input, recognizing that standard care remains oral therapy and that routine screening/treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women is not recommended due to lack of benefit on preterm birth outcomes in trials with atypical regimens [^111p45Wk] [^115h1yLm]. In hepatic impairment, I should confirm dose adjustments; severe hepatic impairment warrants dose reduction and prolonged intervals, so if IV is used, I would halve the dose and extend the interval consistent with pharmacokinetic guidance, and monitor closely for neurotoxicity and other adverse effects [^11655xhY] [^112iiZRJ]. In renal impairment, no routine dose adjustment is required for metronidazole, though monitoring for toxicity is prudent in advanced kidney disease [^113Nfinc].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring, because IV therapy may increase risks and costs. I need to check for neurotoxicity signals with prolonged or high-dose exposure, including peripheral neuropathy and rare optic neuropathy, and monitor for gastrointestinal intolerance, hematologic effects, and drug interactions; given the boxed warning about potential carcinogenicity with unnecessary use, I should avoid IV therapy when oral therapy is possible and ensure the indication is strong if IV is chosen [^111zAuEk] [^114mNJLn] [^112524Ti].

> I should double-check the follow-up plan, since reinfection is common. Retesting is recommended for all sexually active women about 3 months after treatment, and if NAAT is used for test-of-cure, I must wait at least 3 weeks after therapy to avoid false positives from residual nucleic acid; in cases of persistent or recurrent infection, I should consider resistance and coordinate with CDC for susceptibility testing and alternative regimens, including high-dose tinidazole approaches for metronidazole-refractory cases [^1131F4wt] [^111WR5FY] [^113hJ877].

> Let me reconsider the core answer to ensure internal consistency. There is no established IV metronidazole regimen specifically for trichomoniasis; standard care is oral therapy, with women preferably receiving 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and men receiving 2 g once, reserving IV therapy for exceptional situations where oral administration is not feasible, in which case I would extrapolate anaerobic infection dosing as 15 mg/kg IV once then 7.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for 7 days, transitioning to oral therapy promptly when possible and applying special-population precautions as indicated [^11488KRC] [^1131F4wt] [^116J4Bwj].

---

There is **no standard IV metronidazole regimen** for trichomoniasis; oral therapy is first-line [^11488KRC] [^115PQwis]. If oral therapy is not possible, use **500 mg IV every 8 hours for 7 days** (total 2 g/day) [^116J4Bwj], as this aligns with oral dosing and pharmacokinetics. For severe hepatic impairment, reduce the dose by 50% [^112iiZRJ] [^11655xhY]; no adjustment is needed for renal impairment [^113Nfinc]. Monitor for neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal effects, and switch to oral therapy as soon as feasible [^111zAuEk].

---

## Standard oral regimens

The **standard oral regimens** for trichomoniasis are:

- **Women**: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days [^11488KRC] (preferred regimen) [^113hTRS5].
- **Men**: Metronidazole 2 g orally as a single dose [^113o9tb4] [^1131F4wt].
- **Alternative**: Tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose [^115CqZg1] [^112xADu6].

---

## Intravenous metronidazole dosing

There is **no standard IV regimen** for trichomoniasis; oral therapy is preferred [^11488KRC]. If oral therapy is not feasible, extrapolate from oral dosing and pharmacokinetics:

- **Recommended IV regimen**: 500 mg IV every 8 hours (total 2 g/day) for 7 days.
- **Rationale**: Matches oral dosing and pharmacokinetics; ensures adequate exposure [^112APtUZ].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting IV dosing

There is **no direct clinical evidence** for IV metronidazole in trichomoniasis; oral regimens are the evidence base [^113hTRS5]. IV use is extrapolated from oral regimens and pharmacokinetics [^112APtUZ].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

### Hepatic impairment

In hepatic impairment, **mild to moderate (Child-Pugh A or B)**: no adjustment is needed, but monitor for toxicity [^114FygVg] [^1174TMWS]. In **severe (Child-Pugh C)**, reduce the dose by 50% and extend the dosing interval to every 24 hours [^112iiZRJ] [^11655xhY].

---

### Renal impairment

In renal impairment, **no dose adjustment** is required, but monitor for toxicity [^113Nfinc] [^112524Ti].

---

### Pregnancy

In pregnancy, **oral metronidazole is safe**; avoid IV unless absolutely necessary [^111p45Wk] [^116xorrG].

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: Nausea, metallic taste, gastrointestinal upset.
- **Serious adverse effects**: Neurotoxicity (encephalopathy, neuropathy), hepatotoxicity, hematologic abnormalities [^111zAuEk].
- **Monitoring**: Neurologic and hepatic function during prolonged IV use [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Oral therapy is **preferred**; IV is reserved for patients who cannot take oral medication. If IV is used, 500 mg every 8 hours for 7 days is reasonable based on oral dosing and pharmacokinetics [^notfound].

---

## Metronidazole dosing for trichomoniasis

| **Patient population** | **Preferred regimen** | **Alternative regimen** | **Iv regimen (if oral not feasible)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Women | 500 mg PO BID × 7 days | 2 g PO × 1 dose | 500 mg IV q8h × 7 days |
| Men | 2 g PO × 1 dose | 500 mg PO BID × 7 days | 500 mg IV q8h × 7 days |
| Severe hepatic impairment | Reduce dose by 50% | Extend interval to q24h | Reduce dose by 50% |
| Renal impairment | No adjustment | No adjustment | No adjustment |

---

There is **no standard IV regimen** for trichomoniasis; oral therapy is preferred [^11488KRC]. If oral therapy is not feasible, 500 mg IV every 8 hours for 7 days is reasonable, with dose adjustments for hepatic impairment and monitoring for adverse effects [^11655xhY].

Background

Among women, trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection worldwide, and is associated with serious reproductive morbidity, poor birth outcomes, and amplified HIV transmission. Single-dose metronidazole is the first-line treatment for trichomoniasis. However, bacterial vaginosis can alter treatment efficacy in HIV-infected women, and single-dose metronidazole treatment might not always clear infection. We compared single-dose metronidazole with a 7-day dose for the treatment of trichomoniasis among HIV-uninfected, non-pregnant women and tested whether efficacy was modified by bacterial vaginosis.

Methods

In this multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited at three sexual health clinics in the United States. We included women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis infection according to clinical screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a single dose of 2 g of metronidazole (single-dose group) or 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (7-day-dose group). The randomisation was done by blocks of four or six for each site. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome was T vaginalis infection by intention to treat, at test-of-cure 4 weeks after completion of treatment. The analysis of the primary outcome per nucleic acid amplification test or culture was also stratified by bacterial vaginosis status. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01018095, and with the US Food and Drug Administration, number IND118276, and is closed to accrual.

Findings

Participants were recruited from Oct 6, 2014, to April 26, 2017. Of the 1028 patients assessed for eligibility, 623 women were randomly assigned to treatment groups (311 women in the single-dose group and 312 women in the 7-day-dose group; intention-to-treat population). Although planned enrolment had been 1664 women, the study was stopped early because of funding limitations. Patients in the 7-day-dose group were less likely to be T vaginalis positive at test-of-cure than those in the single-dose group (34 [11%] of 312 vs 58 [19%] of 311, relative risk 0·55, 95% CI 0·34–0·70; p < 0·0001). Bacterial vaginosis status had no significant effect on relative risk (p = 0·17). Self-reported adherence was 96% in the 7-day-dose group and 99% in the single-dose group. Side-effects were similar by group; the most common side-effect was nausea (124 [23%]), followed by headache (38 [7%]) and vomiting (19 [4%]).

Interpretation

The 7-day-dose metronidazole should be the preferred treatment for trichomoniasis among women.

Trichomoniasis:

In the Female:

One-day treatment − two grams of metronidazole tablets, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each, given in the same day.

Seven-day course of treatment − 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). In pregnant patients for whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 500 mg or 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every six hours (approx. 500 mg for a 70-kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

### Updates in trichomonas treatment including persistent infection and 5-nitroimidazole hypersensitivity [^115rNFKj]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to update information on treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis. T. vaginalis is estimated to be the most common treatable sexually transmitted infection. In the world and is associated with poor birth outcomes, cervical cancer, sperm motility and morphology issues, and HIV acquisition and transmission.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of the recommended 2-g oral single-dose metronidazole (MTZ) for the treatment of T. vaginalis in women has recently been challenged. Two recent multicentered randomized trials and a meta-analysis have demonstrated that the 7-day dose of MTZ 500mg twice daily was nearly two times more efficacious at clearing infection compared with the 2-g dose. Partner treatment is also essential, since up to 70% of male sexual partners can be infected and rescreening of treated women at 3 months is also recommended given the high repeat infection rates. Future studies should examine the importance of treating asymptomatic T. vaginalis, best treatment for men, the influence of the microbiome on treatment efficacy and different formulations of intravaginal treatments for hypersensitivity.

Summary

7-day 500mg twice daily MTZ should be used as the first line treatment for T. vaginalis-infected women.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission. Treatment recommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly symptomatic women without HIV infection. The study demonstrated that multidose metronidazole (500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of women retesting positive at a 1-month test of cure visit by half, compared with women who received the 2-g single dose. No published randomized trials are available that compare these doses among men.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Recommended Regimen for Trichomoniasis Among Men
Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose
Alternative Regimen for Women and Men
Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. Tinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole (12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately 84%–98%, and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately 92%–100%. Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution.

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.

Other Management Considerations

Providers should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections to abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e. when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons with T. vaginalis.

Follow-Up

Because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated for trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended for all sexually active women < 3 months after initial treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care < 12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient to support retesting men after treatment.

Trichomonas vaginalis is likely the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of trichomoniasis, as African Americans are > 4 times more likely to be infected than persons of other races. Since publication of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, additional data have bolstered the importance of T. vaginalis infection sequelae in women, including increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition, cervical cancer, preterm birth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Less is known about the clinical significance of infection in men. Newly available diagnostic methods, including point-of-care assays and multiple nucleic acid amplification tests, can be performed on a variety of genital specimens in women and men, including urine, allowing more accurate and convenient testing and screening of those at risk for infection. Repeat and persistent infections are common in women; thus, rescreening at 3 months after treatment is recommended. In vitro antibiotic resistance to 5-nitroimidazole in T. vaginalis remains low (4.3%) but should be monitored. High rates of T. vaginalis among sexual partners of infected persons suggest a role for expedited partner treatment. A randomized controlled trial in HIV-uninfected women demonstrated that multidose metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days reduced the proportion of women with Trichomonas infection at 1 month test of cure compared with women receiving single-dose therapy (2 g). The 2-g single-dose oral metronidazole regimen remains the preferred treatment in men.

Trichomoniasis

In the Female: Seven-day course of treatment (375 mg two times daily for seven consecutive days).

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain treatment. Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female.

Amebiasis:

Adults:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

For amebic liver abscess: 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days.

Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections

In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially.

The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (approximately 500 mg for a 70 kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period.

The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.

Hepatic Impairment

Following a single intravenous infusion of 500 mg metronidazole, the mean AUC24of metronidazole was higher by 114% in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and by 54% and 53% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. There were no significant changes in the AUC24of hydroxy-metronidazole in these hepatically impaired patients. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicates the metronidazole dosage in amebiasis should be reduced by 50% and the dosage interval for trichomoniasis should be increased from every 12 hours to every 24 hours in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Geriatric Patients

Following a single 500 mg oral or IV dose of metronidazole, subjects > 70 years old with no apparent renal or hepatic dysfunction had a 40% to 80% higher mean AUC of hydroxy-metronidazole (active metabolite), with no apparent increase in the mean AUC of metronidazole (parent compound), compared to young healthy controls < 40 years old. In geriatric patients, monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS).

Pediatric Patients

In one study, newborn infants appeared to demonstrate diminished capacity to eliminate metronidazole. The elimination half-life, measured during the first 3 days of life, was inversely related to gestational age. In infants whose gestational ages were between 28 and 40 weeks, the corresponding elimination half-lives ranged from 109 to 22.5 hours.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111pzv5p]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

HIV Infection

Up to 53% of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection. T. vaginalis infection among these women is substantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Among women who are not virally suppressed, treatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in genital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding; however, no difference might occur among women who are virally suppressed. Because of the high prevalence of T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential for adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and possibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and prompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV infection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at least annually thereafter.

A randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV and T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. Factors that might interfere with standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among women with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV infection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired immunity. Thus, to improve cure rates, women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at the first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are recommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for vertical transmission of HIV.

Treatment

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV infection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection Among Women
Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

If a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the protocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). Other management considerations, follow-up, and management of sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV infection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow the same guidelines as for men without HIV.

For women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; NAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these tests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with trichomonas and HIV infection.

### Metronidazole oral (Likmez) [^1173k89E]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Trichomoniasis

Adult Female and Male Patients:

One-day Treatment – Administer 2 g (20 mL) of LIKMEZ, either as a single oral dose or in 2 divided oral doses of 1 g (10 mL) each, given on the same day.
Seven-day Course of Treatment − Administer 250 mg (2.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally 3 times daily for 7 consecutive days.

The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment may help improve compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen.

A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. There are some data from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears and signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.

When repeat courses of LIKMEZ are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Amebiasis

Adult Patients:

For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): Administer 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.
For amebic liver abscess: Administer 500 mg (5 mL) or 750 mg (7.5 mL) of LIKMEZ orally three times daily for 5 days to 10 days.

Pediatric Patients:

Administer 35 mg/kg/24 hours to 50 mg/kg/24 hours of LIKMEZ, divided into three doses, to a maximum dose of 2,250 mg/24 hours (maximum dose 750 mg/dose or 7.5 mL/dose), orally for 10 days.

Because "the 5-nitroimidazole drugs (including metronidazole or tinidazole) are the only class of drugs that provide curative therapy for trichomoniasis", the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines "recommend that patients with trichomoniasis who have experienced an IgE-mediated allergy to metronidazole and/or tinidazole be referred for desensitization rather than using an alternative class of drugs".

### Trichomoniasis: clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management [^115ySUBf]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis was originally considered a commensal organism until the 1950s when the understanding of its role as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) began to evolve. Trichomoniasis has been associated with vaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and adverse birth outcomes. Infection with T vaginalis could have an important role in transmission and acquisition of HIV. T vaginalis is site specific for the genitourinary tract and has been isolated from virtually all genitourinary structures. Asymptomatic disease is common in both men and women, thus screening for disease is important. Various sociodemographic factors have been correlated with presence of T vaginalis, and may be used to predict infection. Diagnosis is usually made from wet mount microscopy and direct visualisation, which are insensitive. DNA amplification techniques perform with good sensitivity, but are not yet approved for diagnostic purposes. In areas where diagnostic methods are limited, management of trichomoniasis is usually as part of a clinical syndrome; vaginal discharge for women and urethral discharge for men. A single dose of metronidazole is effective in the majority of cases. Outside of the United States, other nitroimidazoles may be used and are as effective as metronidazole. Metronidazole resistance is an emerging problem, but its clinical importance is not yet clear. Concomitant treatment of sexual partners is recommended.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^114eaXtD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116cJ4gr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Trichomoniasis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide, affecting 3.7 million people in the United States (US). Women with Trichomonas vaginalis have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other STIs. Trichomoniasis is also associated with infertility and adverse birth outcomes. National guidelines recommend annual screening of women with HIV for trichomoniasis.

The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines recommend a single 2 g dose of oral metronidazole (MTZ) or tinidazole (TDZ) for T. vaginalis –infected women without HIV; for infected women with HIV, MTZ 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days is preferred. The 2020 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' (ACOG) practice bulletin on vaginitis has recently recommended multidose MTZ for all nonpregnant women, based on new clinical trial data. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are pending.

Secnidazole (SEC) is a potent 5-nitroimidazole antibiotic with a longer half-life than MTZ and TDZ. In 2017, SEC was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first, single-dose oral treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women. The 2020 ACOG guidance includes SEC 2 g as an alternative treatment for BV, based on a randomized controlled trial, finding it comparable to 7-day MTZ for BV.

As a treatment for trichomoniasis, single-dose SEC had microbiological cure rates of 93%–96% after 2–3 days of treatment and up to 100% for ≤ 20 days of treatment in studies conducted outside the US. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single-dose SEC in US-based women with trichomoniasis. We hypothesized that microbiological cure rates would be high after treatment of T. vaginalis –infected women with SEC, similar to studies outside the US.

### Failure of metronidazole to prevent preterm delivery among pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infection [^115h1yLm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Infection with Trichomonas vaginalis during pregnancy has been associated with preterm delivery. It is uncertain whether treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnant women reduces the occurrence of preterm delivery.

Methods

We screened pregnant women for trichomoniasis by culture of vaginal secretions. We randomly assigned 617 women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis who were 16 to 23 weeks pregnant to receive two 2-g doses of metronidazole (320 women) or placebo (297 women) 48 hours apart. We treated women again with the same two-dose regimen at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was delivery before 37 weeks of gestation.

Results

Between randomization and follow-up, trichomoniasis resolved in 249 of 269 women for whom follow-up cultures were available in the metronidazole group (92.6 percent) and 92 of 260 women with follow-up cultures in the placebo group (35.4 percent). Data on the time and characteristics of delivery were available for 315 women in the metronidazole group and 289 women in the placebo group. Delivery occurred before 37 weeks of gestation in 60 women in the metronidazole group (19.0 percent) and 31 women in the placebo group (10.7 percent) (relative risk, 1.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7; P = 0.004). The difference was attributable primarily to an increase in preterm delivery resulting from spontaneous preterm labor (10.2 percent vs. 3.5 percent; relative risk, 3.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.9).

Conclusions

Treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis does not prevent preterm delivery. Routine screening and treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women for this condition cannot be recommended.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^115eWUnQ]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
U.S. CDC, European International Union/WHO, and U.K. guidelines for treatment of BV and trichomoniasis.

In light of these practical realities, empirical single‐dose oral tinidazole treatment of both BV and TV (with single‐dose fluconazole) would offer a patient‐centered solution to optimize the chance for first‐time cure, particularly for women challenged by medication adherence and follow‐up capability. Currently, the 2021 U.S. CDC STI guidelines recommend 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole (as four 500‐mg tablets) for TV treatment and 2 g on Days 1 and 2 as an alternative BV treatment option. Due to ED dispensing limitations, the next day's dose would require the patient to fill a prescription. However, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole is already recommended as an alternative treatment of both BV and TV by the European International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) and World Health Organization (WHO) and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) U.K. guidelines (Table 1). Tinidazole's plasma half‐life is 12–14 h, which is longer than metronidazole's (~8 h), allowing for a shorter treatment course, and its safety profile is less adverse, with metallic taste, nausea, anorexia, and constipation associated with longer duration as opposed to single‐dose treatment.TV also exhibits less resistance to tinidazole than metronidazole, demonstrating both lower in vitro minimum lethal concentrations and a high clinical efficacy rate for patients with metronidazole‐refractory TV infection.

### Interventions for trichomoniasis in pregnancy [^113qTjAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common of sexually transmitted diseases. Trichomoniasis affects women during pregnancy as well but it is not clearly established whether it causes preterm birth and other pregnancy complications.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of various treatments for trichomoniasis during pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (14 January 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing anti-trichomonas agents during pregnancy. Trials including symptomatic or asymptomatic women with trichomoniasis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

We included two trials with 842 pregnant women. In both trials around 90% of women were cleared of trichomonas in the vagina after treatment. In the US trial, women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis between 16 and 23 weeks were treated with metronidazole on two occasions at least two weeks apart. The trial was stopped before reaching its target recruitment because metronidazole was not effective in reducing preterm birth and there was a likelihood of harm (risk ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.66). The South African trial recruited women later in pregnancy and did not have the design and power to address adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded two recent studies, identified for the current update, because they did not address the primary question.

Authors' Conclusions

Metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.

### A review of evidence-based care of symptomatic trichomoniasis and asymptomatic trichomonas vaginalis infections [^1178xa4D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection, affecting an estimated 3.7 million women and men in the United States. Health disparities are prominent in the epidemiology of this infection, which affects 11% of women aged ≥ 40 years and a disproportionately high percentage of black women. Particularly high prevalences have been identified among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic patients and incarcerated individuals. This article reviews and updates scientific evidence in key topic areas used for the development of the 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Current evidence is presented regarding conditions associated with Trichomonas vaginalis infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and pregnancy complications such as preterm birth. Nucleic acid amplification tests and point-of-care tests are newly available diagnostic methods that can be conducted on a variety of specimens, potentially allowing highly sensitive testing and screening of both women and men at risk for infection. Usually, trichomoniasis can be cured with single-dose therapy of an appropriate nitroimidazole antibiotic, but women who are also infected with HIV should receive therapy for 7 days. Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114GBoeJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection treatment in HIV primary care — gonorrhea should be treated per 2020 CDC guidance with a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg (or 1000 mg for those who weigh ≥ 150 kg) without concurrent azithromycin; test of cure with an NAAT is not routinely recommended by the CDC, and repeat testing at 7 days is associated with a higher rate of false-positive results, while culture should be obtained for all treatment failures so that antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed. For syphilis, the preferred treatment for early, secondary, latent, and late-latent disease continues to be benzathine penicillin G; doxycycline can be used for 14–28 days when there is true penicillin allergy or penicillin shortage, and if neurosyphilis is present or the patient is pregnant, intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be used, even if desensitization is required. For trichomoniasis, in cisgender women with HIV, metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days is more effective than the single 2-g dose of metronidazole, while cisgender men can be treated using the single-dose regimen. For chlamydia, most cases are treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, and suspected lymphogranuloma venereum is usually diagnosed clinically and treated with 21 days of doxycycline 100 mg twice daily.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^111WvXPx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study received institutional review board approval (IntegReview, Austin, Texas; Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, Washington; Office of Human Research Ethics, Chapel Hill, North Carolina) for 10 clinical sites in the US (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03935217). It was designed and monitored in accordance with FDA recommendations and the sponsor's standard operating procedures, which comply with the International Conference on Harmonisation's Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent or parental/legal guardian consent (when appropriate) before engaging in study-related procedures.

In contrast to the FDA approval of tinidazole for trichomoniasis, which was based on a literature-focused New Drug Application submission, in this circumstance, the FDA required a single, placebo-controlled trial for the approval of SEC to treat trichomoniasis. To ensure patient safety, the investigators, in collaboration with the FDA, adopted a delayed-treatment study design, similar to FDA guidance on uncomplicated urinary tract infection studies. Because there is no evidence that a 1- to 2-week delay in treatment for trichomoniasis is associated with significant health risks, the study design was approved by both local (academic) and central institutional review boards. Out of an abundance of caution, the investigators agreed on a trial protocol that was more stringent than the current standard of care, which recommends retesting for T. vaginalis at 3 months. In the current trial, test of cure (TOC) was performed 6–12 days after treatment, with additional follow-up if needed to ensure successful treatment. In addition, the investigators counseled patients on the need for partner therapy and the importance of abstinence during the study to prevent reinfection.

### Interventions for treating trichomoniasis in women [^112Rt95t]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Around 120 million women worldwide suffer from Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis every year. The infection is sexually transmitted and is believed to facilitate HIV transmission.

Objectives

To assess the effects of various treatment strategies for trichomoniasis in women.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Trials were also identified from reference lists of reviews, through pharmaceutical companies, and by informal discovery. Only published data were used in this review. Date of the most recent search: November, 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of different treatment strategies in women with trichomoniasis. Different antitrichomonal drugs or doses were eligible, as were comparisons of treatment with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data extracted by two reviewers independently using standard criteria.

Main Results

Fifty-four trials were included. Nitroimidazole drugs seem to be effective in achieving parasitological cure in short term follow up. Partner treatment can be effective in decreasing longer term reinfection rates.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Parasitological cure can be achieved by single oral dose of nitroimidazole. Further research should focus on developing effective partner treatment strategies to prevent reinfections and reduce trichomoniasis prevalence.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^116dNKcF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 2‐g single‐dose oral secnidazole (two 1‐g packets) for treatment of BV and TV, and this is currently listed as an alternative BV treatment option in U.S. CDC guidelines. Table 2 shows the results of clinical trials among women with symptomatic vaginitis comparing metronidazole, tinidazole, and secnidazole, including single‐dose regimens, to treat BV and TV. For BV, when compared with metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days, both 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole and 2‐g single‐dose secnidazole demonstrated similar cure rates to metronidazole. Another trial comparing single doses of secnidazole, tinidazole, and metronidazole to treat BV found that tinidazole had a significantly greater clinical cure rate than metronidazole but secnidazole did not, further supporting the efficacy of single‐dose tinidazole. Across all trials, for BV, 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole demonstrated clinical cure rates of 83%–100%.,

TABLE 2
Comparative clinical trials of tinidazole, secnidazole, and metronidazole treatment for symptomatic women diagnosed with BV and trichomoniasis.

Unlike FDA guidance for comparative noninferiority trials to evaluate new antibiotics to treat other common infections, guidance for BV antimicrobial approval specifies a placebo‐controlled superiority trial. Tinidazole was FDA‐approved in 2004 based on a placebo‐controlled trial that demonstrated efficacy of both 2 g daily for 2 days and for 5 days. Earlier placebo‐controlled trials and many comparative studies of a single 2‐g dose of tinidazole were conducted outside the United States and had a different design than specified in U.S. FDA guidance to evaluate BV treatments, which may explain the divergence of U.S. and international treatment recommendations (i.e. 2 g daily for 2 days vs. single dose). Tinidazole has gone off‐patent, so no commercial interest now exists for FDA approval of single‐dose treatment. However, as shown in Table 2, single‐dose tinidazole has compared favorably to both 7‐day twice‐daily metronidazole and single‐dose secnidazole, regimens that have met FDA guidance criteria, and tinidazole has the endorsement of agencies outside the United States, supporting its off‐label use.

### Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections: progress and challenges [^114hriDj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most prevalent curable sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Most TV infections are asymptomatic, and the accurate diagnosis of this infection has been limited by lack of sufficiently sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, particularly for men. To provide updates for the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, a PubMed search was conducted of all TV literature published from 9 January 2004 through 24 September 2008. Approximately 175 pertinent abstracts and articles were reviewed and discussed with national experts. This article describes advances in TV diagnostics which have led to an improved understanding of the epidemiology of this pathogen, as well as potential biologic and epidemiological interactions between TV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New data on treatment outcomes, metronidazole-resistant TV, management of nitroimidazole-allergic patients, frequency of recurrent TV infection following treatment, and screening considerations for TV in certain populations are also presented.

Metronidazole hypersensitivity — oral desensitization protocol and cross‑reactivity: The table "Protocol for oral metronidazole desensitization" specifies stepwise dosing administered within one day, with later steps including 250 mg Tablet with cumulative dose 277.8, 750 mg Tablets with cumulative dose 1027.8, and 1000 mg Tablets with cumulative dose 2027.8. In a case series, oral and intravenous metronidazole desensitization regimens were 100% effective (15 of 15) for trichomonas infection in women with nitroimidazole hypersensitivity. Patch‑test data suggest some cross‑reactivity between metronidazole and other imidazoles such as clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and albendazole; in patients with a proven hypersensitivity reaction to metronidazole, avoiding theses agents is recommended if possible.

### The clinical spectrum of trichomonas vaginalis infection and challenges to management [^1162WGbx]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection worldwide. T vaginalis infections in women can range from asymptomatic to acute inflammatory vaginitis. In men, this infection is typically asymptomatic but is increasingly being recognised as a cause of non-gonococcal urethritis. Diagnosis of T vaginalis has traditionally been made by direct microscopic examination of a wet mount of vaginal fluid or through the use of culture. The recent commercial availability of nucleic acid amplification tests for the detection of T vaginalis has seen these replace culture as the gold standard for diagnosis. Nitroimidazoles (ie, metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of therapy. In the case of treatment failure due to drug resistance or in the case of a severe nitroimidazole allergy, alternative intravaginal therapies exist, although their effectiveness has not been evaluated systematically. Novel systemic agents other than nitroimidazoles for the treatment of T vaginalis are needed, and efforts to promote and support antimicrobial drug development in this setting are necessary.

Bacterial enteric infection in HIV-infected pregnancy — peripartum and antimicrobial safety considerations: Neonatal care providers should be informed if maternal sulfa therapy was used near delivery because of the theoretical increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in the newborn. Since rifaximin is not systemically absorbed, it can be used in pregnancy as in non-pregnant individuals. For vancomycin, minimal absorption is expected with oral therapy, but with intravenous use, vancomycin readily crosses the placenta; in a study of 10 infants after second or third trimester in utero exposure from maternal intravenous vancomycin therapy for serious staphylococcal infections, no hearing loss or renal toxicity attributed to vancomycin was found. A review of metronidazole use in pregnancy for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis found no increase in risk of birth defects, and studies on use for CDI in pregnancy were not found.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116dDgG9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the superiority of SEC vs placebo for the treatment of trichomoniasis. Importantly, SEC was superior to placebo in patients with trichomoniasis and vaginal symptoms and in those with HIV and/or BV. Although prior studies have shown trichomoniasis is asymptomatic in 70%–85% of cases, patients can present with symptoms including yellow-to-green frothy vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal odor, pruritus, irritation, and/or dysuria. Thus, single-dose SEC may be an effective option for symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis in women.

National guidelines have traditionally recommended a single, 2 g dose of oral MTZ or TDZ as the preferred treatment of trichomoniasis in women, with oral MTZ 500 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days as an alternative regimen. In 2010, results of a randomized, open-label trial of a single oral dose of MTZ 2 g vs the 7-day MTZ 500 mg BID regimen in women with HIV and trichomoniasis demonstrated microbiological cure rates of 83.2% vs 91.5%, 6–12 days after treatment. These results led to the CDC recommendation to use the multidose MTZ regimen for trichomoniasis in women with HIV. In 2018, similar results were reported from a randomized, open-label trial of single- vs multidose MTZ for trichomoniasis in women without HIV. Microbiological cure rates at TOC were 81.4% and 89.1% in the single- and multidose MTZ groups. Hence, the 2020 ACOG practice bulletin on vaginitis now recommends the multidose MTZ regimen as the preferred regimen for trichomoniasis in nonpregnant women. Updated 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines are anticipated later this year.

Pregnancy

T. vaginalis infection among pregnant women is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. One randomized trial of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis reported no substantial difference in preterm birth after treatment with 2 g of metronidazole 48 hours apart during 16–23 and 24–29 weeks' gestation, compared with placebo. However, that trial had multiple limitations, including use of an atypical metronidazole regimen. Another multicenter observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women in sub-Sahara African, the majority with HIV infection, reported neither trichomoniasis nor its treatment appeared to influence the risk for preterm birth or a low-birthweight infant.

Although metronidazole crosses the placenta, data indicate that it poses a low risk to the developing fetus. No evidence of teratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been found in multiple cross-sectional and cohort studies among pregnant women examining single-dose (2 g) and multidose metronidazole regimens (,–).

Symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage, should be tested and treated. Treatment of T. vaginalis infection can relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women and reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal transmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment might also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the newborn. Clinicians should counsel symptomatic pregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential risks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of partner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual transmission. The benefit of routine screening for T. vaginalis in asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.

Metronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that are lower than those used to treat infections among infants, although the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. Plasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but remain less than maternal plasma levels. Although multiple reported case series studies demonstrated no evidence of adverse effects among infants exposed to metronidazole in breast milk, clinicians sometimes advise deferring breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after maternal treatment with metronidazole. In one study, maternal treatment with metronidazole (400 mg 3 times/day for 7 days) produced a lower concentration in breast milk and was considered compatible with breastfeeding over longer periods.

Data from studies involving human subjects are limited regarding tinidazole use during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate this drug poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should be avoided for pregnant women, and breastfeeding should be deferred for 72 hours after a single 2-g oral dose of tinidazole.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111WR5FY]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Nitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning because few alternatives to standard therapy exist. If treatment failure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has been reexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the same regimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, she should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once daily for 7 days. If a man has persistent T. vaginalis after a single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed to an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he should be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days.

For persons who are experiencing persistent infection not attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a kit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing. CDC is experienced with susceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T. vaginalis and can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of drug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an alternative treatment regimen might be recommended. Treatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance can include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. If a patient has treatment failure after the 7-day regimen of high-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional treatment options have been determined to have successful results for women. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole 2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 14 days. If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole (1 g 3 times/day) plus intravaginal paromomycin (4 g of 6.25% intravaginal paromomycin cream nightly) for 14 days should be considered.

Alternative regimens might be effective but have not been systemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has been reported with intravaginal boric acid but not with nitazoxanide. The following topically applied agents have minimal success (< 50%) and are not recommended: intravaginal betadine (povidone-iodine), clotrimazole, acetic acid, furazolidone, GV, nonoxynol-9, and potassium permanganate. No other topical microbicide has been reported to be effective against trichomoniasis.

### Randomized trial of periodic presumptive treatment with high-dose intravaginal metronidazole and miconazole to prevent vaginal infections in HIV-negative women [^115yEJcm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal infections are common, frequently recur, and may increase women's risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We tested the efficacy of a novel regimen to prevent recurrent vaginal infections.

Methods

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative women 18–45 years old with 1 or more vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), were randomly assigned to receive vaginal suppositories containing metronidazole 750 mg plus miconazole 200 mg or matching placebo for 5 consecutive nights each month for 12 months. Primary endpoints, evaluated every 2 months, were BV (Gram stain) and VVC (positive wet mount and culture).

Results

Participants (N = 234) were randomly assigned to the intervention (N = 118) or placebo (N = 116) arm. Two hundred seventeen (93%) women completed an end-of-study evaluation. The intervention reduced the proportion of visits with BV compared to placebo (21.2% vs 32.5%; relative risk [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI].48-.87). In contrast, the proportion of visits with VVC was similar in the intervention (10.4%) versus placebo (11.3%) arms (RR 0.92, 95% CI .62–1.37).

Conclusions

Monthly treatment with intravaginal metronidazole plus miconazole reduced the proportion of visits with BV during 12 months of follow-up. Further study will be important to determine whether this intervention can reduce women's risk of STIs.

### Tinidazole (Tindamax) [^112xADu6]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

14.1 Trichomoniasis

Tinidazole (2 g single oral dose) use in trichomoniasis has been well documented in 34 published reports from the world literature involving over 2,800 patients treated with tinidazole. In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies of the 2 g tinidazole single oral dose where efficacy was assessed by culture at time points post-treatment ranging from one week to one month, reported cure rates ranged from 92% (37/40) to 100% (65/65) (n = 172 total subjects). In four published, blinded, randomized, comparative studies where efficacy was assessed by wet mount between 7–14 days post-treatment, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (8/10) to 100% (16/16) (n = 116 total subjects). In these studies, tinidazole was superior to placebo and comparable to other anti-trichomonal drugs. The single oral 2 g tinidazole dose was also assessed in four open-label trials in men (one comparative to metronidazole and 3 single-arm studies). Parasitological evaluation of the urine was performed both pre- and post-treatment and reported cure rates ranged from 83% (25/30) to 100% (80/80) (n = 142 total subjects).

14.2 Giardiasis

Tinidazole (2 g single dose) use in giardiasis has been documented in 19 published reports from the world literature involving over 1,600 patients (adults and pediatric patients). In eight controlled studies involving a total of 619 subjects of whom 299 were given the 2 g × 1 day (50 mg/kg × 1 day in pediatric patients) oral dose of tinidazole, reported cure rates ranged from 80% (40/50) to 100% (15/15). In three of these trials where the comparator was 2 to 3 days of various doses of metronidazole, reported cure rates for metronidazole were 76% (19/25) to 93% (14/15). Data comparing a single 2 g dose of tinidazole to usually recommended 5–7 days of metronidazole are limited.

### Immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions to antibiotics: aminoglycosides, clindamycin, linezolid, and metronidazole [^113HCTGo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation

A small number of the case studies described positive skin testing to metronidazole correlating with patient history including positive SPT using 125 mg/mL and patch testing varying from concentrations of 0.5 to 50% in petrolatum. SPT was positive in one case of anaphylaxis although other larger studies suggest that the sensitivity is low. Given the low sensitivity of SPT, oral provocation is considered more useful for establishing the diagnosis in many cases of hypersensitivity reactions to metronidazole.

Management/Desensitization

In patients at risk of hypersensitivity reactions to metronidazole without alternative treatment options, as may be the case for Trichomonas vaginalis, desensitization has been performed. As there are no equally effective alternatives that have been systematically evaluated for the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis, the CDC states that patients with an IgE-mediated reaction to a nitroimidazole may need to undergo metronidazole desensitization using published protocols. Refer to Table 6 for the first published protocol by Kurohara et al. for oral metronidazole desensitization. Table 7 shows a modified protocol for a more gradual dose escalation for cases with greater concern for severe systemic reactions. Pearlman et al. devised an IV metronidazole desensitization protocol described in Table 8. In a case series of metronidazole desensitization among 15 patients, 8 use the oral protocol by Kurohara et al. and 7 use the IV protocol by Pearlman et al. and 1 patient in each group experienced a pruritic rash when reaching the goal dose. All 15 patients were cleared, and these studies help demonstrate efficacy of both oral and IV desensitization protocols for metronidazole.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole500 mg) [^115M5HVB]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures).

Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite.

Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection.

### Metronidazole is still the drug of choice for treatment of anaerobic infections [^1119nS5Y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Metronidazole has been used for the treatment of infections for > 45 years and is still successfully used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, and giardiasis. Anaerobic bacterial infections caused by Bacteroides species, fusobacteria, and clostridia respond favorably to metronidazole therapy. Good clinical results in the treatment of vaginosis due to Gardnerella vaginalis have also been reported. Rates of resistance to metronidazole are still generally low; however, several studies have reported decreased susceptibility among Bacteroides species, as well as different mechanisms of resistance. Metronidazole-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains have been described, but combination therapy (eg, metronidazole, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin plus omeprazole) is still recommended for eradication of this pathogen in patients with gastroduodenal ulcers. Metronidazole is considered to be a cost-effective drug because of its low cost, good activity against pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and minor adverse effects. Metronidazole is still the criterion standard for therapy of anaerobic infections, as was described by Tally and colleagues 35 years ago.

### Prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases: an update [^1175cE4i]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published revised guidelines for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. One new treatment strategy is the use of azithromycin as a primary, rather than alternative, medication for pregnant women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection continues to increase in the United States; therefore, quinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of this infection. Expedited partner therapy gives physicians another option when addressing the need to treat partners of persons diagnosed with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection. Tinidazole is now available in the United States and can be used to manage trichomoniasis, including trichomoniasis resistant to metronidazole. Shorter courses of antiviral medication can be used for episodic therapy of recurrent genital herpes. Because of increasing resistance, close follow-up is required if azithromycin is used as an alternative treatment in the management of primary or secondary syphilis. Unexpected increases in the rates of lymphogranuloma venereum have occurred in The Netherlands, and physicians should remain vigilant for symptoms of this disease in the United States.

Parenteral Treatment

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, > 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^111wKJp1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

As providers move toward multidose MTZ as the preferred regimen for all women with trichomoniasis, our findings also support the use of single-dose SEC. With efficacy rates for the treatment of trichomoniasis comparable to those of multidose MTZ, SEC has favorable attributes that may provide advantages over other options. In vitro studies of T. vaginalis isolates showed that the minimal lethal concentration of SEC is 56% lower compared with MTZ. SEC also differs from other 5-nitroimidazoles with a notably longer half-life (17 hours) vs MTZ (7–8 hours) and TDZ (12 hours). Single-dose options are convenient and likely to improve adherence overall, especially in populations at risk for noncompliance. Of note, compliance with multidose MTZ has been low (50%–63%) in some studies. Factors that may impact adherence include gastrointestinal complaints, treatment duration, and lifestyle restrictions. In 1 study, 23% of patients reported nausea in the single-dose and multidose MTZ groups. In our study, 2.7% of patients reported nausea with SEC. Additionally, SEC does not have an alcohol restriction based on data from in vitro studies.

### Tinidazole: a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal agent [^116kpcUC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Tinidazole, a structural analogue of metrondazole, is an antiprotozoal agent that has been widely used in Europe and developing countries for > 2 decades with established efficacy and acceptable tolerability. It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical usefulness of tinidazole.

Methods

Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-August 2005), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2005), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2005) using the terms tinidazole, Fasigyn, and nitroimidazole.

Results

In vitro, tinidazole exhibits activity against pathogenic protozoa (eg, Tricbomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba bistolytica, Giardia duodenalis), a wide range of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria (eg, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile), and the microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori. In susceptible protozoal and bacterial cells, tinidazole is reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that covalently bind to DNA, causing irreversible damage. In human adults, tinidazole had a bioavailability of 100% and a V(d) of 50.7 L, was minimally bound to plasma protein (12%), had a plasma elimination t((1/2)) of 12.3 hours, and was eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism (approximately 63%). Dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary on the basis of race, sex, or renal function. No data were found on the disposition of tinidazole in patients with hepatic insufficiency; therefore, use of tinidazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is not recommended. Clinical cure rates in patients with trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess were generally > 90%. In comparative trials, tinidazole was as effective as metronidazole in the treatment of trichomoniasis and was significantly more effective than metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis (P < 0.05) and amebiasis (P < 0.05). The most commonly reported (> 1%) adverse effects included bitter taste, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, vomiting, and fatigue. The recommended dosage of tinidazole is a single dose of 2 g for trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and 2 g/d for 3 to 5 days for amebiasis.

Conclusions

Tinidazole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria and H pylori.

Management of Sex Partners

Concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for preventing reinfections. Current partners should be referred for presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated and any symptoms have resolved. EPT might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis and can be used in states where permissible by law; however, no partner management intervention has been demonstrated to be superior in reducing reinfection rates. Although no definitive data exist to guide treatment for partners of persons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among whom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners might benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment (see Recurrent Trichomoniasis).

Recurrent Trichomoniasis

A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure (antimicrobial-resistant T. vaginalis or host-related problems), lack of adherence, or reinfection from an untreated sex partner. In the case of a recurrent infection, the origin of the repeat infection should be assessed because most recurrent infections likely result from reinfection. Retesting can be considered in cases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the preferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before 3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection of residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials known to be effective against trichomonas infection. Metronidazole resistance occurs in 4%–10% of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis. Tinidazole resistance is less well studied but was present in 1% of infections in one study. Overall, more T. vaginalis isolates have reported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole. Multidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose treatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or have a history of T. vaginalis.

### Assessment of syndromic management of curable sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections among pregnant women: an observational cross-sectional study [^114s2xZ2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea

Chlamydia and gonorrhoea POC tests merit investigation. Given that each test represents a fixed-cost, it would be useful to explore whether the use of POC tests among women who are at risk of chlamydia and gonorrhoea might be able to achieve similar reductions in adverse pregnancy outcomes attributable to these infections as universal screening and case management. In this study group, no specific risk factors for women who had chlamydial infection were identified. Consequently, universal POC testing should be considered in this setting first and foremost until a more targeted approach can be established based on risk profiles for chlamydial infection in this population. In the case of gonorrhoea, universal POC testing should be evaluated against an approach of targeted screening for pregnant women under 30 years of age, or those with HIV infection.

It would be important to establish differential diagnoses between chlamydia and gonorrhoea due of treatment implications, even though just three of 90 (3.3%) pregnant women in Nchelenge were co-infected. The WHO recommends treating chlamydia during pregnancy with a one-time 1 g dose of azithromycin. The same dose, however, may also hasten the emergence of untreatable gonorrhoea among women with co-infection. Gonorrhoea in pregnancy, per WHO guidelines, should be treated with either ceftriaxone 250 mg by intramuscular injection plus azithromycin 1 g orally, or cefixime 400 mg orally plus azithromycin 1 g orally. If differential diagnoses cannot be established, there may be reason to provide a curative dose for gonorrhoea which would clear co-infection and reduce opportunity for gonococcus to be exposed to azithromycin monotherapy. Screening and treatment of infected partners needs to be provided with such an approach. There is a convenient dual-cassette POC test available that can detect chlamydia and gonorrhoea with one biological sample, but cost is significant barrier to routine use.

Trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis

Universal screening and treatment for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis would be an important improvement over syndromic management, particularly given how prevalent both are in this setting. Pregnant women diagnosed with either trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis could be given a single 2-g dose of metronidazole as recommended by the WHO. Another option might be simply to provide metronidazole to all women at ANC booking. These two approaches need to be evaluated for their protective effect against adverse pregnancy outcomes and the cost per adverse outcome averted. Part of the comparison should include partner screening for trichomoniasis and appropriate case management.

### A case of high-level metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis in pregnancy successfully treated [^116cbcnC]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is approximately 5%. Resistance during pregnancy has not been reported. Untreated trichomoniasis in pregnancy can cause preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, and low birth weight. We report a case of metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis in pregnancy, successfully treated with a high dose of tinidazole.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116Xsz4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, cure rates were 92%–100% in the overall population and in subgroups of women with genital symptoms, HIV, and/or BV. Previous research showed that trichomoniasis treatment significantly decreases HIV viral load and viral shedding and may reduce HIV transmission. Although only 4 patients had HIV, our finding that all were cured is reassuring, and larger clinical trials in this patient population are warranted to confirm these results. Moreover, coinfection of BV and T. vaginalis is common, with rates of 60%–80%. Thus, a single treatment for BV and trichomoniasis may have multiple benefits.

A potential limitation of this study was the use of T. vaginalis culture to achieve a shorter timeframe to TOC. Although InPouch may be less sensitive than NAAT, the accuracy in this study was high as supported by the low placebo responder rate (~1%). Other limitations include the lack of long-term follow-up and the exclusion of men and pregnant women. However, 2 non-US-based studies of SEC for trichomoniasis in patients, including a small subgroup of men, showed cure rates of 91.7%–100% at 2–20 days after treatment. Although our study did not include pregnant women, and data on the use of SEC during pregnancy are limited, reproductive preclinical toxicology studies have shown no evidence of toxicity, and SEC is not contraindicated during pregnancy. The CDC recommends that trichomoniasis treatment be considered for symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage. Finally, 5-nitroimidazole susceptibility testing was not performed on trichomonas isolates in the study; thus, we cannot comment on any resistance that potentially may have been present.

Study strengths include high cure rates for SEC (92%–95%), low placebo responder rates, minimal dropouts, a favorable TEAE profile, and treatment success in women with and without clinical symptoms, HIV, and/or BV.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a single dose of SEC 2 g was efficacious and well tolerated in women with trichomoniasis and in those with trichomoniasis and comorbid HIV and/or BV. If approved by the FDA for the treatment of trichomoniasis, SEC will be the only single oral-dose medication available for the treatment of BV and T. vaginalis. Future studies should be considered in pregnant women and those with persistent T. vaginalis infection, including the use of SEC multidose regimens.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^1117g5Bv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Assuming microbiological cure rates of 75% and 40% with SEC and placebo, respectively, a sample size of 100 patients (50 patients/group) provided approximately 95% power to demonstrate a statistically significant between-treatment-group difference using a 2-sided, 2-sample comparison of proportions at the α = .05 level of significance. Assuming an attrition rate of 30%, 144 patients needed to be randomly assigned to SEC or placebo.

The primary efficacy endpoint was compared between the active and placebo treatment groups using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified by the presence/absence of clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis at baseline, HIV status, and BV status) at the α = .05 level of significance. As required by the FDA and determined a priori, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT population, defined as all randomized patients who had a positive T. vaginalis culture at baseline and a negative chlamydia and gonorrhea NAAT at baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis was based on the per protocol (PP) population, defined as patients in the mITT population who received their assigned study medication and had a TOC visit. Post hoc efficacy analyses of the microbiological cure rate at TOC compared SEC- vs placebo-treated patients (1) with trichomoniasis who were symptomatic and those who were asymptomatic, (2) infected with HIV, and (3) with BV at baseline. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

Safety endpoints included the incidence, severity, and relationship to study medication of TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests also were assessed. Safety endpoints were evaluated using the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who received any study-related medication.

### Sexual intercourse association with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas vaginalis treatment in relationship to preterm birth [^115yhB2R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether sexual intercourse was associated with the treatment efficacy or the incidence of preterm birth in two large randomized trials in which metronidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis or Trichomonas vaginalis did not reduce preterm birth.

Study Design

Secondary analysis of two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on Gram stain or asymptomatic T vaginalis on culture were randomized at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation to metronidazole or placebo. In both studies, women took 2 g of metronidazole or placebo in the presence of a nurse (first dose) and were given a second dose to take 48 hours later. This regimen was repeated (third and fourth doses) at 24 to 29 weeks. At the time of the third dose, bacterial vaginosis and T vaginalis specimens were collected again. Patients who were randomly selected to receive metronidazole were analyzed for bacterial vaginosis and T vaginalis at 24 to 29 weeks and for preterm birth of < 37 weeks of gestation, according to intercourse between first and second doses and between the second and third doses. Continuous variables were compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; categoric variables were compared with the use of the chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, or the Mantel-Haenzel test of trend.

Results

Sexual intercourse between the first and second doses or between the second and third doses did not influence the incidence of bacterial vaginosis (18% vs 24%; relative risk, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–1.1; and 23% vs 20%; relative risk, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9–1.6, respectively) or T vaginalis (4% vs 8%; relative risk, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.1–3.6; and 5% vs 10%; relative risk, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1; respectively) at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation compared with no intercourse. In the T vaginalis trial, sexual intercourse between the first and second doses or between the second and third doses did not influence the incidence of preterm birth (13% vs 17%; relative risk, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3–2.1; and 16% vs 17%; relative risk, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6–1.6; respectively) compared with no intercourse. In the bacterial vaginosis trial, although sexual intercourse between the first and second doses did not influence the incidence of preterm birth (11% vs 12%; relative risk, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6–1.5), sexual intercourse between the second and third doses was associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (10% vs 16%; relative risk, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.9) compared with no intercourse.

Conclusion

Sexual intercourse was associated with neither the efficacy of metronidazole treatment of bacterial vaginosis or T vaginalis nor with the incidence of preterm birth. In the bacterial vaginosis study, intercourse between the second and third doses had a negative association with preterm birth.

### Efficacy and safety of single oral dosing of secnidazole for trichomoniasis in women: results of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-treatment study [^116rdH4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

At visit 2 (TOC), patients were queried about treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and assessed for clinical symptoms of trichomoniasis. A provider obtained an additional vaginal specimen for T. vaginalis culture. At this visit, patients received the opposite treatment from baseline (ie, SEC if they had received placebo at baseline or placebo if they had received SEC at baseline) under direct observation by study staff. Patients with a microbiological cure, defined as negative T. vaginalis by InPouch culture at visit 2, were subsequently discharged from the study. Patients with a positive T. vaginalis culture from visit 2 were asked to return for a third visit, 7–12 days later, for an additional assessment, including determination of the need for additional therapy. A fourth visit (7–12 days after visit 3) was scheduled at the investigator's discretion if a repeat T. vaginalis culture at visit 3 was positive. Patients who had a positive culture at visit 3 and visit 4 were offered treatment, based upon the investigator's discretion and per standard of care. InPouch cultures were examined daily for 5 days over a 7-day period to reduce the possibility of false-negative results.

The primary efficacy endpoint was microbiological cure at visit 2 (TOC). The trial was designed to limit the possibility of unprotected sex resulting in reinfection, which would become more likely the longer the interval between treatment and TOC. The InPouch culture was selected as the diagnostic TOC based on its relatively high sensitivity (81%–94%), allowing for a TOC visit within 1 week. We did not perform a T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC as the optimal timing of this highly sensitive test is 3–4 weeks after treatment. Use of this test within 3 weeks after treatment may have detected remnant trichomonal nucleic acid, leading to false-positive test results. In addition, the use of T. vaginalis NAAT for TOC would have required patients to remain sexually inactive for as much as 4 weeks, which was considered impractical.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1122BST5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Women who seek care and can follow up at sexual health clinics and primary care offices are different than many from disadvantaged groups for whom there may be only one opportunity to address their symptoms when seen in the ED. Empirical treatment of vaginitis carries risks of overtreatment, although use of a single‐dose regimen would minimize stewardship concerns for collateral adverse antibiotic effects. Further, overall treatment effectiveness must be considered in the context of a woman's specific circumstances and needs, such as CDC‐endorsed empirical EPT treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and in the case of sexual assault, for which compliance with follow‐up visits is acknowledged to be poor.

For women with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis, particularly in EDs where point‐of‐care NAAT testing is not available, we believe empirical treatment with 2‐g single‐dose tinidazole for BV and TV and 150‐mg single‐dose fluconazole for Candida should be offered through shared decision making. Reliance on microscopy testing poses a substantial risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment with subsequent persistent symptoms, additional health care visits, and risk of transmission. Alternatively, if the patient believes she can comply, the CDC‐recommended second‐day 2‐g tinidazole dose or 7‐day 500‐mg twice‐daily metronidazole regimen can also be prescribed empirically to treat BV and TV, and women with a history of recurrent or persistent Candida infection can be prescribed a Day 4 and 7 fluconazole dose. Whether empirical or microscopy/point‐of‐care NAAT‐directed treatment is provided, follow‐up should be recommended for patients whose symptoms persist beyond 1 week, at which time further diagnostic testing can be considered.

### The influence of ART on the treatment of trichomonas vaginalis among HIV-infected women [^114DvLTn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Among women who are human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+), both prevalent and persistent infections with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common. TV has been shown to increase vaginal shedding of HIV, which may influence HIV sexual and perinatal transmission, making prevention important. In 1 cohort of HIV+ women in Kenya, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, mostly nevirapine based, was associated with lower cure rates of TV for single-dose therapy. Our goal was to repeat this study in a US-based cohort of HIV+/TV+ women and compare outcomes to those with multidose therapy.

Methods

A secondary data analysis was performed on a multicentered cohort of HIV+/TV+ women who were randomized to single-dose (2 grams) or 7-day (500 mg twice daily) multidose metronidazole (MTZ) treatment. Test of cure visit, via culture, occurred 6–12 days after treatment completion. Information was collected on sex partner treatment and sexual exposures. Persistent TV infection rates were compared for women on ART at baseline vs not on ART.

Results

Of the 226 women included, those on ART had more treatment failures than women not on ART (24/146 [16.4%] vs 5/80 [6.3%]; p = 0.03). When stratified by treatment arm, more treatment failures were seen in the single-dose arm (17/73 [23.3%] vs 3/39 [7.7%]; p = 0.05) than in the multidose arm (7/73 [9.6%] vs 2/41 [4.8%]; p = 0.39).

Conclusions

ART usage was associated with a higher TV persistent infection rate among those receiving the single-dose treatment, but not the multidose, providing more evidence that multidose should be the preferred treatment for HIV+ women.

### The influence of bacterial vaginosis on the response to trichomonas vaginalis treatment among HIV-infected women [^115btKKV]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) is common in HIV+ women, and host factors may play a role in TV treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the response to TV treatment among HIV+ women.

Methods

A secondary analysis was conducted of a clinical trial which randomised HIV+/TV+ women to metronidazole (MTZ) treatment: 2 g (single-dose) versus 7 day 500 mg twice daily (multidose). BV was classified using Nugent scores from baseline Gram stains. Women were recultured for TV at test-of-cure (TOC) and again at 3 months if TV-negative at TOC. Repeat TV infection rates were compared for women with a baseline TV/BV coinfection versus baseline TV infection only, and stratified by treatment arm.

Results

Among 244 HIV+/TV+ women (mean age = 40.3, ± 9.5; 92.2% African-American), the rate of BV was 66.8%. Women with BV were more likely to report douching and ≥ 1 recent sex partners. HIV+ women with baseline TV/BV coinfection were more likely to be TV-positive at TOC than women with baseline TV infection only (RR 2.42 (95% CI 0.96 to 6.07; p = 0.05)). When stratified by treatment arm, the association was only found in the single-dose arm (p = 0.02) and not in the multidose arm (p = 0.92). This interaction did not persist at 3 months.

Conclusions

For HIV+/TV+ women, the rate of BV was high, and BV was associated with early failure of the MTZ single-dose treatment for TV. Biological explanations require further investigation.

### Tinidazole therapy for metronidazole-resistant vaginal trichomoniasis [^113nNMgf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients with metronidazole-refractory vaginal trichomoniasis constitutes a major therapeutic challenge, and treatment options are extremely limited. Although the majority of patients infected with trichomonads, who demonstrate reduced in vitro susceptibility to metronidazole, respond to high-dose but poorly tolerated regimens of metronidazole, clinical failure is by no means uncommon. We report a cure rate of 22 (92%) of 24 patients with refractory trichomoniasis treated with high doses of oral and vaginal tinidazole. This series included 15 cases with increased in vitro minimal lethal concentration values of metronidazole. Tinidazole, despite the high doses used, was extremely well tolerated, with few side effects. Topical paromomycin was effective in 7 (58%) of 12 patients treated, but frequent local vulvovaginal adverse reactions precluded extensive use. Widespread reports of metronidazole resistance and limited treatment options emphasize the need for additional trichomonacidal agents.

Efficacy

In the mITT population, the microbiologic cure rate at TOC was significantly higher (P < .001) in the SEC vs placebo group (92.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 82.7%–97.4%] vs 1.5% [95% CI:.0–8.0%]) (Table 2). In the PP population, the cure rate at TOC also was significantly higher (P < .001) in the SEC vs placebo group (94.9% [95% CI: 85.9%–98.9%] vs 1.7% [95% CI:.0–8.9%]). There were no significant demographic differences between patients who were not cured (ie, at visit 2 in the SEC group and at visit 3 in the placebo group) and those who were cured (data not shown).

Table 2.
Microbiological Cure at Test-of-Cure Visit (Modified Intention-to-Treat Population)

In the subgroup of patients with vaginal symptoms at baseline, the microbiological cure rate at TOC was 92.9% (95% CI: 82.7%–98.0%) in the SEC group; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC (P < .001; Table 3). In women with HIV, 100% (4/4) had a microbiological cure at TOC; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC. In patients with BV at baseline, the microbiological cure rate at TOC was 95.2% (95% CI: 76.2%–99.9%) in the SEC group; no patient in the placebo group had a negative T. vaginalis culture at TOC (P < .001).

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^1155tXCH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Nitroimidazoles (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the only recommended drugs for treating Trichomonas vaginalis infection, and previous samples that assessed resistance of such isolates have been limited in geographic scope. We assessed the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States. Swab specimens were obtained from women who underwent routine pelvic examinations at sexually transmitted disease clinics in 6 US cities. Cultured T. vaginalis isolates were tested for nitroimidazole resistance (aerobic minimum lethal concentration [MLC] > 50 µg/mL). Of 538 T. vaginalis isolates, 23 (4.3%) exhibited low-level in vitro metronidazole resistance (minimum lethal concentrations 50–100 µg/mL). No isolates exhibited moderate- to high-level metronidazole resistance or tinidazole resistance. Results highlight the possibility that reliance on a single class of antimicrobial drugs for treating T. vaginalis infections may heighten vulnerability to emergence of resistance. Thus, novel treatment options are needed.

### Reversible optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole [^111zAuEk]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic used in treating anaerobic bacteria and protozoal infections. It was first licensed for the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis but is now used in the management of various gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections. Many neurological side effects are well documented, although there is scarce literature illustrating optic neuropathy secondary to metronidazole. We describe a case report of a 36-year-old man who presented with symptomatically reduced central visual loss on a background of a 2-year history of metronidazole use for a perianal fistula. Electrophysiology demonstrated bilateral optic neuropathy, with pattern visual evoked potential traces demonstrating marked latency and small amplitude responses of the P100 waves, which improved to within normal limits on cessation of metronidazole. This case study demonstrates clinical and electrophysiological reversibility of optic neuropathy secondary to high dose and prolonged metronidazole use.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111rQFNg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault. Consequently, the following routine presumptive treatments after a sexual assault are recommended:

An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia and gonorrhea for men.
Emergency contraception should be considered when the assault could result in pregnancy (see Emergency Contraception).
Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) if the hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown and the survivor has not been previously vaccinated. If the assailant is known to be HBsAg positive, unvaccinated survivors should receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The vaccine and HBIG, if indicated, should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1–2 and 4–6 months after the first dose. Survivors who were previously vaccinated but did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection).
HPV vaccination for female and male survivors aged 9–26 years who have not been vaccinated or are incompletely vaccinated. The vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses should be administered at 1–2 months and 6 months after the first dose. A 2-dose schedule (0 and 6–12 months) is recommended for persons initiating vaccination before age 15 years.
Recommendations for HIV PEP are made on a case-by-case basis according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection; Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment of Adolescents and Adults < 72 Hours After Sexual Assault). Recommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Female Sexual Assault Survivors Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days plus Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days * For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered. Recommended Regimen for Adolescent and Adult Male Sexual Assault Survivors Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose plus Doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day orally for 7 days * For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Clinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific organisms.

### Management of trichomonas vaginalis in women with suspected metronidazole hypersensitivity [^1155bhMn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Standard treatment for Trichomonas vaginalis is metronidazole or tinidazole. Hypersensitivity to these drugs has been documented but is poorly understood. Desensitization is an option described in limited reports of women with hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles. The purpose of this analysis is to improve documentation of management for trichomonas infections among women with metronidazole hypersensitivity.

Study Design

Clinicians who consulted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning patients with suspected hypersensitivity to metronidazole were provided with treatment options and asked to report outcomes.

Results

From September 2003-September 2006, complete information was obtained for 59 women. The most common reactions were urticaria (47%) and facial edema (11%). Fifteen of these women (25.4%) were treated with metronidazole desensitization and all had eradication of their infection. Seventeen women (28.8%) were treated with alternative intravaginal drugs, which were less successful; 5 of 17 infections (29.4%) were eradicated.

Conclusion

Metronidazole desensitization was effective in the management of women with nitroimidazole hypersensitivity.

### Metronidazole (metronidazole500 mg) [^1157bryC]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

General

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole in the plasma. For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a reduced dose of metronidazole is recommended. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed but these patients should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Renal Impairment

Patients with end-stage renal disease may excrete metronidazole and metabolites slowly in the urine, resulting in significant accumulation of metronidazole metabolites. Monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Fungal Superinfections

Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with metronidazole and requires treatment with a candidacidal agent.

Use in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias

Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy.

Drug-Resistant Bacteria and Parasites

Prescribing metronidazole in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial or parasitic infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria and parasites.

Information for Patients

Interaction with Alcohol

Discontinue consumption of alcoholic beverages or products containing propylene glycol while taking metronidazole and for at least three days afterward because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Treatment of Bacterial and Parasitic Infections

Patients should be counseled that metronidazole should only be used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections. Metronidazole does not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When metronidazole is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by metronidazole in the future.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^111yviKD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Trichomoniasis, caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, is one of the most common nonviral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): annually, ≈248 million incident cases occur worldwide, and ≈7.4 million cases occur in the United States. The estimated US prevalence of T. vaginalis infection is 3.1%, with a higher prevalence among black women and women of low socioeconomic status than among other women. Trichomoniasis is a frequent cause of vaginitis and can contribute to premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy, preterm birth, low birth weight, and may facilitate HIV acquisition.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, Georgia, USA) STD Treatment Guidelines recommends the use of a 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, either metronidazole or tinidazole, for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection. Metronidazole has been the mainstay of treatment for several decades; however, tinidazole has better in vitro activity and is well tolerated.

The reliance on a single drug class for treating T. vaginalis infections may be problematic if resistance to nitroimidazole becomes widespread in T. vaginalis strains. Three small studies that examined the prevalence of in vitro resistance in the United States have been conducted during the past 15 years, but they were limited in geographic scope. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among a broad sample of T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States.

Urinary tract infection/asymptomatic bacteriuria

A clean catch midstream urine specimen is collected using a vacutainer with boric acid preservative (Beckton Dickinson). Urine culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing are performed at APHI, the regional laboratory certified by the ENAO (Ethiopian National Accreditation Office) — ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 15189. Antibiotic susceptibility is determined including the Vitek method (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), or Kirby Bauer Disk Diffusion. Urinary tract infections are classified in online supplemental web table 3 and treated with an oral antibiotic-based on antibiotic sensitivity patterns (online supplemental web table 4). Antibiotics are provided to pregnant women at no cost and the first dose is directly observed. Women with severe illness or difficult to treat infections are referred to the Obstetrics Department at Felege Hiwot Hospital. Women provide a test of cure specimens at the following ANC visit.

Sexually transmitted/reproductive tract infections

Women self-collect vaginal specimens (mid-vaginal swab) that are tested for gonorrhoea and chlamydia with the Xpert CT / NG assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California)using the GeneXpert nucleic acid amplification testing platform at APHI. Chlamydia is treated with azithromycin 1 g orally once and gonorrhoea is treated with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscular +azithromycin 1 g orally once. Partner treatment is on a voluntary basis with a regimen as recommended by the Ethiopian sexually transmitted infections management guidelines. A test of cure is obtained at the next ANC visit.

For women who report symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, vulvar symptoms or lower abdominal tenderness, additional vaginal swabs are collected for trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis by point of care diagnostics. Trichomonas is tested using the OSOM trichomonas rapid test (Sekisui Diagnostics, Massachusetts). Bacterial vaginosis is tested using Diagnosit BVBLUE test (Gryphus Diagnostics, Knoxville, Tennessee). Trichomonas is treated with metronidazole 2 g orally once, and partners are treated. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with metronidazole 500 mg two times per day for 7 days.

### Cochrane abstract… [^112rbte6]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Nitroimidazoles are the most effective treatment for parasitological cure of trichomoniasis. Single-dose treatment is as effective as longer term treatment but increases side effects. Fifty-three trials were included. Nitroimidazole drugs seem to be effective in achieving parasitological cure in short-term follow-up. Partner treatment can be effective in decreasing longer-term reinfection rates. Primary Results. Parasitological cure can be achieved with a single oral dose of a nitroimidazole. Further research should focus on developing effective partner treatment strategies to prevent reinfection and reduce trichomoniasis prevalence. Reviewers' Conclusions. Metronidazole, given in a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes.

The cure rate could probably be higher if more partners also used the treatment. Reviewers' Conclusions. Is it likely that important relevant articles were missed. Possibly. In review 2, the search does not appear to be as exhaustive as the search in review 1. What are the overall results of the reviews. In review 1, the following significant results were found: treatment with nitroimidazoles was better than no treatment in achieving parasitological cure. Short-term treatment was comparable to longer treatment in terms of parasitological cure. The most favorable mode of delivery of medication was oral plus intravaginal, followed by oral alone. Intravaginal nitroimidazoles alone were the least effective mode. In review 1, a small trial of partner treatment showed that women were more likely to reacquire trichomonas infection if their partners were not also treated.

The most powerful conclusion related by the reviewers in review 1 was that in most trials, a single dose of any nitroimidazole resulted in parasitological cure rates above 90 percent, but side effects were common and dose-related. Practice Pointers In women with trichomoniasis, physicians can treat both the patient and her partner with a single dose of metronidazole in return for a 90 percent chance of parasitological cure in one month. The use of single-dose therapy should improve compliance, but patients should be warned about the nausea and vomiting that can accompany this high dosage.
