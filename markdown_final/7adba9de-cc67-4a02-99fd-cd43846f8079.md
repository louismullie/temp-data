## Question

How about ones for hypothyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage hypothyroidism, including when to treat subclinical disease, how to dose levothyroxine, how to monitor, and what to do about persistent symptoms, with attention to special populations and alternatives to LT4 monotherapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing overt from subclinical hypothyroidism. Then, I should verify treatment thresholds, especially for subclinical disease. Next, I will review levothyroxine dosing strategies by age and comorbidity. After that, I need to check monitoring intervals and targets, including nuances in central hypothyroidism. Then, I will examine how to evaluate persistent symptoms and when, if ever, to consider combination therapy. Finally, I should consider special populations such as pregnancy, children, and the elderly, and close with a concise, clinically actionable algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump ahead. Primary hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with low free T4, whereas subclinical hypothyroidism is an elevated TSH with normal free T4; central hypothyroidism, in contrast, presents with low or inappropriately normal TSH and low free T4, so I need to ensure I'm not misclassifying central disease as primary before I anchor on TSH targets. Hold on, I should verify persistence before labeling subclinical disease; TSH can fluctuate, and a meaningful fraction of mildly elevated TSH values normalize on retesting, so repeating labs after an interval is prudent to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment [^116EJtt3].

> Now, treatment thresholds. For overt hypothyroidism, treatment is indicated to prevent cardiovascular and neurocognitive complications, and levothyroxine remains the standard of care. I should confirm that this is consistent across major guidelines, which it is [^114GYrqH] [^113yC48n]. For subclinical hypothyroidism, I need to be precise: a TSH persistently above 10 mIU/L is generally an indication to treat, whereas TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L warrants individualized consideration based on symptoms, TPOAb positivity, cardiovascular risk, and patient preference; importantly, high-quality evidence shows no consistent benefit of thyroid hormone therapy on quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms when TSH is below 10, so routine treatment in that range is not supported [^115ZWXFL] [^1168sTdk] [^111trvZ4] [^115B19e5]. Wait, let me verify the nuance about pregnancy and planning pregnancy; guidelines suggest lower thresholds and sometimes prophylactic LT4 in TPOAb-positive women contemplating pregnancy, but newer randomized data have not shown clear benefit, so I should frame this as controversial and shared decision-making rather than a blanket rule [^112Cg569] [^115FGSxK].

> Next, I should review levothyroxine dosing. Full replacement in otherwise healthy adults is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day. However, I need to adjust for age, cardiac disease, and etiology, starting low and titrating slowly in older adults or those with ischemic heart disease to avoid precipitating angina or arrhythmias, which is a strong recommendation in ATA guidance [^116fJhFR] [^114q7F9o]. For mild subclinical hypothyroidism, typical starting doses are 25–75 mcg/day with careful titration, and for young healthy adults with overt disease, some guidelines allow full replacement up front; I should double-check that both approaches are acceptable, which they are, with clinical judgment applied [^111zQiJu] [^113osNwi]. But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy? Dosing needs to be individualized and often increased early in gestation, and T3-containing preparations should be avoided during pregnancy, so I need to ensure I'm not inadvertently prescribing a combination product in that setting [^112xgmVK].

> I will now examine monitoring and targets. After initiation or dose changes, I should recheck TSH in about 6–8 weeks and adjust in 12.5–25 mcg increments. Once stable, annual monitoring is reasonable, though I need to remember that clinical manifestations can lag behind biochemical normalization by weeks to months, so I should not overcorrect too quickly [^114BCykN]. For central hypothyroidism, TSH is unreliable, so I must target free T4 in the upper half of the reference range, tailoring downward in older or comorbid patients to avoid overtreatment; I should confirm this approach is guideline-concordant, which it is [^112GQShE] [^1113UfcP]. Hold on, I should verify age-specific TSH ranges; older adults often have a higher physiologic TSH set point, so aiming for a TSH around 4–6 mIU/L may be appropriate in the elderly rather than forcing younger reference intervals [^114q7F9o].

> Persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH deserve a structured approach. Let me first confirm adherence, absorption, and drug interactions; calcium, iron, PPIs, and some foods impair LT4 absorption, and I should separate these by several hours; if adherence is solid and TSH is at goal, I should evaluate for alternative etiologies such as sleep apnea, depression, anemia, or menopause before attributing symptoms to thyroid disease [^116eKkHk]. I need to ensure I'm not conflating non-thyroidal illness with primary hypothyroidism; euthyroid sick syndrome has low T3 and sometimes low T4 with normal or low TSH and should not be treated with thyroid hormone, so I should avoid that pitfall [^112qkTRq]. If, after addressing contributors, symptoms persist and the patient prefers, a cautious, time-limited trial of LT4+LT3 can be considered, but I must monitor closely for atrial arrhythmias and bone loss, especially in older adults, and discontinue if there is no clear benefit [^115a2k8B].

> Combination therapy is controversial, so I should review the evidence carefully. Randomized trials show heterogeneous results, with some suggesting improved mental health or well-being in subsets but no consistent superiority over LT4 monotherapy for quality of life or major outcomes; meta-analyses likewise fail to show robust, reproducible benefits, and long-term safety data are limited, so routine use is not recommended [^113femUC] [^116P44TG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that combination therapy improves TSH control; that would be misleading — combination regimens can alter T3/T4 ratios without necessarily improving TSH-targeted biochemical control, reinforcing that any trial should be individualized, time-limited, and continuation contingent on demonstrable patient-reported benefit [^113femUC].

> Special populations require tailored strategies. In pregnancy, I should confirm diagnosis promptly, increase LT4 dose by about 30% as soon as pregnancy is recognized in most treated women, avoid T3-containing products, and monitor TSH every 4 weeks initially, targeting trimester-specific ranges; I should double-check that these are standard recommendations, which they are [^112xgmVK]. In children, congenital hypothyroidism mandates urgent treatment within the first two weeks of life at 10–15 mcg/kg/day, with subsequent dosing by age; acquired hypothyroidism in older children uses weight-based dosing with careful growth monitoring, and I need to ensure I'm using pediatric-specific guidance rather than extrapolating adult targets [^112H5uQ7] [^114uw91K]. In the elderly, I should start low, titrate slowly, and accept a higher TSH target to minimize cardiovascular risk from overtreatment; this is a strong, evidence-based approach [^114q7F9o].

> I should also address what not to do. Desiccated thyroid extract is not recommended as routine therapy due to supraphysiologic T3 content and lack of long-term outcome data. Compounded thyroid hormones should be avoided given potency and safety concerns. And LT3-only therapy lacks sufficient evidence for general use and carries risks of overtreatment if not meticulously monitored, so I need to counsel patients accordingly [^115HDbf5] [^115U3S99] [^114BWuN8]. Let me reconsider one more pitfall: treating euthyroid patients with nonspecific symptoms is not indicated and may cause harm; I should confirm biochemistry before initiating lifelong therapy and avoid using thyroid hormone for obesity, depression, or unconfirmed hypothyroid symptoms [^11527wum] [^1121spBy].

> To synthesize a practical algorithm, I should confirm the diagnosis with repeat TSH and free T4, classify overt versus subclinical versus central, and screen for reversible causes of TSH elevation. Treat overt disease with LT4, consider treatment for subclinical disease when TSH is above 10 mIU/L or when TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L with compelling symptoms, TPOAb positivity, or cardiovascular risk. Start LT4 using weight-based dosing adjusted for age and comorbidity, titrate to TSH targets in primary disease and free T4 targets in central disease, monitor at 6–8 week intervals initially, then annually. And if symptoms persist despite biochemical euthyroidism, reassess adherence, absorption, and comorbidities before considering a time-limited, closely monitored trial of combination therapy, discontinuing if no benefit is observed [^114GYrqH] [^115ZWXFL] [^116fJhFR] [^112GQShE] [^115a2k8B].

---

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the **standard first-line therapy** for hypothyroidism, with dosing individualized by weight, age, and comorbidities, and titrated to normalize TSH [^113SVBJx] [^116fJhFR] [^114GYrqH]. Combination LT4/LT3 is **not routinely recommended** due to inconsistent benefits and potential harms; reserve it for select patients with persistent symptoms despite optimized LT4, using a 14:1 LT4:LT3 ratio and close monitoring [^1164Lxwn] [^113femUC]. Subclinical hypothyroidism is generally **not treated unless TSH > 10 mIU/L or symptoms are significant**, with treatment individualized [^114LBMH9] [^115B19e5] [^116EJtt3]. During pregnancy, increase LT4 by 30–50% immediately and monitor TSH every 4 weeks to keep TSH within trimester-specific targets [^112xgmVK]. Regular TSH monitoring, dose adjustments, and patient education on adherence and drug–food interactions are essential to maintain euthyroidism and minimize complications [^114BCykN] [^116eKkHk].

## Indications for thyroid hormone replacement therapy

Thyroid hormone replacement is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Overt hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH with low free T4 [^111oyTAQ].
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: TSH > 10 mIU/L regardless of symptoms; TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L with symptoms, positive TPOAb, or cardiovascular risk factors [^115ZWXFL] [^1168sTdk].
- **Pregnancy**: TSH > 2.5 mIU/L in women planning pregnancy or during pregnancy, especially if TPOAb positive [^111ipzVk].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4 [^112qkTRq].

---

## Choice of thyroid hormone preparation

Levothyroxine (LT4) is the **standard of care** because of its stability, predictable absorption, and long half-life allowing once-daily dosing [^113yC48n] [^114GYrqH]. Liothyronine (LT3) is reserved for select cases due to its short half-life, rapid onset, and higher risk of adverse effects; it is not recommended as first-line therapy [^114BWuN8]. Desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) is **not routinely recommended** because of variability in T3/T4 content and supraphysiologic T3 exposure [^115HDbf5].

---

## Dosing strategies

Initial dosing is individualized by **weight, age, cardiovascular status, and etiology** [^113SVBJx]:

| **Patient population** | **Initial dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 1.6 mcg/kg/day | Adjust to lean body weight in obesity |
| Elderly or cardiovascular disease | 12.5–25 mcg/day | Titrate slowly every 6–8 weeks |
| Pregnancy | Increase by 30–50% | Immediate adjustment upon confirmation |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism | 25–75 mcg/day | Lower doses; titrate to TSH target |

---

Titration involves adjusting the dose every 6–8 weeks based on **TSH** until the target is achieved, then monitoring every 6–12 months [^114BCykN].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

- **Primary hypothyroidism**: Monitor TSH every 6–8 weeks until stable, then every 6–12 months [^114BCykN].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Monitor free T4; TSH is unreliable [^112GQShE].
- **Pregnancy**: Monitor TSH every 4 weeks during pregnancy; adjust dose to trimester-specific targets [^112QYPbZ].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **immediate dose increase** by 30–50% is recommended upon confirmation, with TSH monitored every 4 weeks and maintained within trimester-specific targets [^notfound].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **start low and go slow** — begin with low doses and titrate slowly to avoid cardiovascular complications — and consider higher TSH targets (up to 7.5 mIU/L in patients over 80) [^114q7F9o].

---

### Patients with persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH

For patients with persistent symptoms despite normalized TSH, **evaluate for other causes** and consider combination LT4/LT3 therapy in select cases, with close monitoring for adverse effects [^114uoLJV] [^112Chvgh].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Overtreatment can cause **iatrogenic hyperthyroidism**, leading to osteoporosis, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular complications. Undertreatment results in persistent hypothyroid symptoms and increased cardiovascular risk. Adverse effects include palpitations, anxiety, insomnia, and bone loss, particularly with excessive dosing or LT3 use.

---

## Patient education and adherence

Emphasize **adherence** — consistent daily dosing, fasting administration, and avoidance of interfering foods and medications (calcium, iron, PPIs, soy) — and arrange regular follow-up with periodic TSH monitoring and dose adjustments [^114BCykN].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Sustained-release T3**: Under development to mimic physiologic T3 rhythms and potentially improve outcomes in select patients [^115a2k8B].
- **Personalized medicine**: Genetic variants (e.g. DIO2 polymorphisms) may guide LT4/LT3 combination therapy in refractory cases [^115gM4sL].
- **Thyroid hormone analogs**: Investigated for specific indications but not yet standard care [^112MEmSp].

---

Levothyroxine remains the **cornerstone of hypothyroidism management**, with individualized dosing and monitoring to maintain euthyroidism. Combination therapy is reserved for select refractory cases, and emerging therapies may offer future options for persistent symptoms.

Objective

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Hypothyroidism [^114GYrqH]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated. The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors. The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints. In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

### Treatment… [^112qkTRq]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is defined as failure of the thyroid gland to produce sufficient thyroid hormone to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Untreated hypothyroidism can contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, infertility, cognitive impairment, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest that about one in 300 persons in the United States has hypothyroidism. 1 The prevalence increases with age, and is higher in females than in males. 2 It is estimated that nearly 13 million Americans have undiagnosed hypothyroidism. 3 Hypothyroidism may occur as a result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Primary gland failure can result from congenital abnormalities, autoimmune destruction, iodine deficiency, and infiltrative diseases. Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common etiology of hypothyroidism in the United States.

Central causes of hypothyroidism typically present with other manifestations of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, and are characterized by inappropriately normal or low levels of TSH relative to insufficient thyroid hormone. Drugs classically associated with thyroid dysfunction include lithium, amiodarone, interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These include weight gain, fatigue, poor concentration, depression, diffuse muscle pain, and menstrual irregularities. Symptoms with high specificity for hypothyroidism include constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, proximal muscle weakness, and hair thinning or loss.
8. Symptoms of hypothyroidism may vary with age and sex. Infants and children may present more often with lethargy and failure to thrive. Women who have hypothyroidism may present with menstrual irregularities and infertility. In older patients, cognitive decline may be the sole manifestation.

Examination findings associated with hypothyroidism include but are not limited to goiter, delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes, thin or brittle hair, dry skin, and peripheral edema. SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis defined by a normal-range free T. MYXEDEMA COMA Myxedema coma is a rare but extremely severe manifestation of hypothyroidism that most commonly occurs in older women who have a history of primary hypothyroidism. Mental status changes including lethargy, cognitive dysfunction, and even psychosis, and hypothermia are the hallmark features of myxedema coma.

Levels of scientific substantiation in hypothyroidism in adults clinical practice guidelines — evidence levels for recommendations are defined as: Level 1 "Prospective, randomized, controlled trials — large"; Level 2 "Prospective controlled trials with or without randomization — limited body of outcome data"; Level 3 "Other experimental outcome data and nonexperimental data"; and Level 4 "Expert opinion". Per the table note, "Levels 1, 2, and 3 represent a given level of scientific substantiation or proof. Level 4 or Grade D represents unproven claims". The text also notes that "many recommendations are based on weak scientific data (Level 3) or consensus opinion (Level 4)". Methodologically, the guideline states that "in some grading systems 'should not' implies that there is substantial evidence", yet "the grading method employed in this guideline enables authors to use this language even when the best evidence level available is 'expert opinion'.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Psychosocial, behavioral, and mental health conditions — management with levothyroxine replacement therapy: The treatment goals of hypothyroidism are the same for patients with psychosocial, behavioral, and mental health conditions, as for the general population. However, referral to a mental health professional should be considered if the severity of the symptoms is not sufficiently explained by the severity of the biochemically confirmed thyroid dysfunction or another medical condition, or if the mental health condition is impairing effective management of levothyroxine replacement therapy.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

Nonthyroidal illness therapy dosing guidance — De Groot's review suggests that if LT4 therapy is to be initiated, it should be at a "replacement dose" of approximately 50 μg/d in divided doses, and the review also suggests that T3 be followed and adjusted such that it is "at least near normal" before the next scheduled dose.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — natural history and evidence for treatment notes that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years and about 2% to 5% develop "overt" thyroid dysfunction; one retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for heart disease events and overall mortality, but the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events, and it did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of "overt" hypothyroidism versus no treatment.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40 in 10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B19e5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefit of thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain. New evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier from inception until July 4, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (eg, quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models for meta-analyses were applied.

Main Outcomes and Measures

General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms after a minimum follow-up of 3 months.

Results

Overall, 21 of 3088 initially identified publications met the inclusion criteria, with 2192 adults randomized. After treatment (range, 3–18 months), thyroid hormone therapy was associated with lowering the mean thyrotropin value into the normal reference range compared with placebo (range, 0.5–3.7 mIU/L vs 4.6 to 14.7 mIU/L) but was not associated with benefit regarding general quality of life (n = 796; SMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; I² = 66.7%) or thyroid-related symptoms (n = 858; SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.14; I2 = 0.0%). Overall, risk of bias was low and the quality of evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was judged moderate to high.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, the use of thyroid hormone therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms. These findings do not support the routine use of thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

Levothyroxine for euthyroid depression — We recommend against the routine use of levothyroxine for the treatment of euthyroid individuals with depression due to a paucity of controlled data examining treatment efficacy in this setting. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. To our knowledge, there are no controlled studies of LT4 therapy in depression, and there are no randomized placebo controlled trials of LT4 therapy for bipolar disorder or depression, with or without concomitant antidepressant therapy; available open-label studies used supraphysiologic doses of LT4 (250–500 μg/d). One randomized trial of T3 potentiation of tricyclic antidepressant nonresponders compared 37.5 μg daily of LT3 to 150 μg daily of LT4, and found greater responses to LT3, compared to LT4, but the study had no placebo arm. Depression is not more common in patients with SCH, LT4 therapy does not improve it when co-existing with mild hypothyroidism, and depressed patients had a slightly higher TSH when compared with controls (1.9 versus 1.5 mIU/L).

However, the study's methodology is not without weaknesses. One significant issue is the high heterogeneity observed in some outcomes, suggesting substantial variability across studies, which could stem from differences in study populations, interventions, or methodologies. This raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, by excluding studies not published in English, the study potentially overlooks significant research, introducing language bias and raising concerns about publication bias, particularly regarding studies with negative or inconclusive results. These strengths and weaknesses collectively highlight the study's comprehensive yet somewhat restricted approach to evaluating thyroid hormone therapies.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

4 Discussion

4.1 Clinical Indications for Treatment with Thyroid Hormones

In line with international guidelines, this survey confirms that LT4 is the preferred treatment among Canadian endocrinologists for patients with hypothyroidism.

Approximately half of the respondents believed that thyroid hormones are never warranted in treatment‐naïve, biochemically euthyroid patients. However, one‐third would consider thyroid hormone therapy for euthyroid women with infertility associated with high thyroid antibody levels. Similarly, 42% of thyroid experts across European countries would also support treatment in these patients. This variation in practice may reflect the recommendation of the 2017 ATA guideline to consider low‐dose LT4 treatment for thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)‐positive euthyroid women undergoing assisted conception, given its potential benefits in improving pregnancy success compared to limited risk. However, more recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials have found no benefit of LT4 in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity, whether pregnant or planning pregnancy, irrespective of the use of assisted conception. Furthermore, an ongoing discussion over the years on the definition of the reference range of thyroid function tests in pregnancy might also affect the response to this question. International guidelines recommend local population‐ and pregnancy‐specific reference intervals for TSH and free T4, according to the laboratory assays used, even though this is not feasible for most centers. Therefore, many centers use the nonpregnant TSH upper reference limit of 4.0 mU/L, a value that may not be applied uncritically to pregnant women.

A mere 7.4% of Canadian endocrinologists indicated prescribing LT4 for patients with a growing goiter, compared to one‐third of European endocrinologists. This different European attitude, more evident in its Eastern regions, could be due to the former presence of areas of low‐iodine intake in which the treatment with thyroid hormones was reported as beneficial for nodular goiter. Accumulating evidence over the past decades has led to abandoning this treatment option based on a lack of clinically significant efficacy.

Overall, treating euthyroid individuals with LT4 has potential risks, and previous studies have shown associations with suppressed TSH in hypothyroid individuals and increased morbidity and mortality. Several factors might explain why physicians adhere to outdated treatment practices, including healthcare resources, patient‐related factors (expectations, age, and culture), and physician characteristics (age, gender, and work institution). This emphasizes the need for a greater focus on disseminating the latest research and guidelines to encourage physicians to follow evidence‐based practices.

### Canadian endocrinologists' perspectives on treatment with thyroid hormone substitutions in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients: a 2023 THESIS questionnaire survey [^113bVAsD]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

An extensive survey conducted in twenty‐eight European countries, known as THESIS (Treatment of Hypothyroidism in Europe by Specialists: An International Survey), examined endocrinologists′ prescribing preferences for patients with persistent symptoms. In some countries, up to 40% would consider LT4 + LT3 for patients with persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite normalization of thyrotropin (TSH). In contrast, only a few considered DTE in the treatment of hypothyroid patients. Reasons for reluctance to prescribe DTE include the insufficient evidence demonstrating its superiority compared to LT4 therapy, the paucity of studies investigating potential adverse effects, both in the short and the long term, as well as DTE′s unavailability in most European countries.

At variance with European countries, DTE is approved for use in Canada, which may influence local prescribing patterns. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate Canadian endocrinologists′ perspectives regarding hypothyroidism treatment via a nationwide Canadian survey as part of the international THESIS project. Understanding physicians′ treatment preferences is crucial as they affect patient experience and outcomes, contribute to data on practice variation, and identify areas for further research to improve the treatment of hypothyroidism.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

Hypothyroidism treatment — future research priorities include strategies to avoid iatrogenic thyroid disease in treated individuals and to aid compliance with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, and a better understanding of maternal-fetal physiology during pregnancy with development of improved titration of LT4 for hypothyroid pregnant patients. Additional needs are further studies of soft gel LT4 capsules; further study and improved standardization of compounded formulations of LT4 and/or liothyronine (LT3); development of additional biomarkers of euthyroidism, which may supplement the use of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as a biomarker; and improved understanding of how triiodothyronine (T3) levels are affected by age and disease status with reference ranges indexed to age and health status, including clarification of the relative importance of maintaining specific serum T3 concentrations. Research is encouraged into the relationship between serum T3 and T3 concentrations in specific tissues; development of more accurate assays to measure serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (FT3), total T3, and free thyroxine (FT4); development of a sustained release T3 preparation that can be prospectively tested in clinical trials, e.g., in combination with LT4 in a physiologic ratio of about 14:1; and, if such a preparation is unavailable, studying when, if ever, the use of LT3 would be beneficial in selected patients with apparent decreased T4 to T3 conversion and disproportionately low serum T3 levels. Long-term outcome research using thyroid extracts that includes documentation of the consequences of excursions in serum T3 concentrations, development of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile, and pursuit of research into developing thyroid stem cells as a potential avenue for understanding thyrocyte physiology and as a possible future treatment for hypothyroidism are also identified.

### Effects of antithyroid drugs on radioiodine treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1172N27M]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of adjunctive antithyroid drugs on the risk of treatment failure, hypothyroidism, and adverse events after radioiodine treatment.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline, Embase) searched to August 2006 and contact with experts. Review methods Three reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. Pooled relative risks for treatment failure and hypothyroidism after radioiodine treatment with and without adjunctive antithyroid drugs were calculated with a random effects model.

Results

We identified 14 relevant randomised controlled trials with a total of 1306 participants. Adjunctive antithyroid medication was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.52; P = 0.006) and a reduced risk for hypothyroidism (0.68, 0.53 to 0.87; P = 0.006) after radioiodine treatment. We found no difference in summary estimates for the different antithyroid drugs or for whether antithyroid drugs were given before or after radioiodine treatment.

Conclusions

Antithyroid drugs potentially increase rates of failure and reduce rates of hypothyroidism if they are given in the week before or after radioiodine treatment, respectively.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

LT3-only therapy for hypothyroidism — evidence, safety, and monitoring: At the present time there is insufficient evidence to suggest that LT3-only therapy is a safe and efficacious treatment of hypothyroidism in the general population, and currently there is no evidence that LT3-only therapy is cost-effective relative to the standard of care represented by LT4. The LT3-only therapy appears more favorable for patients affected by dyslipidemia and obesity, but at the present time there is not sufficient evidence that this modality is superior to the standard LT4 therapy, and presently no data are available on the long-term effects of LT3-only therapy. Although not recommended, if used, LT3-only therapy should be monitored with measurements of fasting serum TSH levels before the administration of the dose, aiming to target serum TSH within the lower tertile of the reference range, and for dose adjustment it may be helpful to measure serum T3 levels in the morning (trough) and 2 hours after the administration of the dose (peak), aiming to maintain the values within the reference range; serum FT4 assessment is of no value in this scenario.

### Central hypothyroidism: advances in etiology, diagnostic challenges, therapeutic targets, and associated risks [^1116i226]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Central hypothyroidism is a rare disorder resulting from impaired thyroid hormone production due to deficiencies in TSH secretion from the pituitary or TRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of central hypothyroidism, with an emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on genetic and acquired causes, particularly those related to hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and the effects of surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions. Diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies, including levothyroxine therapy and monitoring, are analyzed.

Results

Early diagnosis requires simultaneous measurement of free T4 and TSH to prevent neurological sequelae, especially in congenital cases. Central hypothyroidism is associated with risks such as growth and developmental impairment, as well as metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances. Levothyroxine therapy is crucial for correcting hormonal deficits and improving patient outcomes; however, careful dosing is necessary to avoid potential complications, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Conclusions

Personalized treatment and continuous monitoring are essential to optimize clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life in affected individuals. A thorough understanding of central hypothyroidism's etiology and management is necessary to improve early detection and therapeutic strategies.

Hypothyroidism therapy — biomarkers, tissue euthyroidism, and combination therapy uncertainties note that replication of the endogenous circadian rhythm in T3 may also optimize therapy, but current exogenous therapies do not reproduce endogenous serum T3 excursions or serum T3 rhythms. LT4 therapy results in a higher serum T4/T3 ratio than in the nonthyroidic state, and it is not known whether there is a detrimental effect of this abnormal serum T4/T3 ratio. Serum TSH is considered to be the best marker currently available, yet normal serum TSH may be documented despite biochemical parameters indicating tissue hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, and the biologic activity of serum TSH is not always concordant with its measured concentrations. Animal studies show that a normal serum T3 is not necessarily accompanied by a normal T3 concentration in all tissues, and commercially available tests to indicate tissue status in humans are not available. In combination therapy studies, a study that appeared to show a benefit at 3 months no longer showed maintenance of this benefit at 12 months, and the serum T3 response has not been rigorously assessed in many trials with restoration of serum T3 to "normal" generally not an endpoint.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

Thyroid extracts versus levothyroxine in adults with primary hypothyroidism — recommendation: We recommend that levothyroxine be considered as routine care for patients with primary hypothyroidism, in preference to use of thyroid extracts. Although there is preliminary evidence from a short-duration study that some patients may prefer treatment using thyroid extracts, high-quality controlled long-term outcome data are lacking to document superiority of this treatment compared to levothyroxine therapy. Furthermore, there are safety concerns related to the use of thyroid extracts, such as the presence of supraphysiologic serum triiodothyronine levels and a paucity of long-term safety outcome data. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Primary hypothyroidism… [^111oyTAQ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is defined as low levels of blood thyroid hormone due to destruction of the thyroid gland. This destruction is usually caused by autoimmunity or an intervention such as surgery, radioiodine, or radiation. It can be classified as clinical when diagnosed by characteristic clinical features, raised levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, and reduced levels of thyroxine hypothyroidism is diagnosed on the basis of characteristic clinical features, a serum TSH above the reference range, and T. 4 below the reference range.

A number of guidelines quote serum TSH of 5 to 10 mU per L as mild hypothyroidism, and greater than 10 mU per L as severe hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis with findings of a serum TSH above the reference range and serum T 4 within the reference range. Primary hypothyroidism occurs after destruction of the thyroid gland because of autoimmunity or medical intervention such as surgery, radioiodine, or radiation. Secondary hypothyroidism occurs after pituitary or hypothalamic damage and is caused by insufficient production due to pituitary or hypothalamic hypofunction. Secondary hypothyroidism is not covered in this review. Euthyroid sick syndrome is diagnosed when T 3 levels are low, serum T 4 is low, and TSH levels are normal or low. Euthyroid sick syndrome is not covered in this review.

If both a raised TSH level and antithyroid antibodies were present, the OR for women was 38, and the OR for men was 173. Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with depression. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism may have depression that is refractory to antidepressant drugs and thyroid hormone alone. Memory impairment, hysteria, anxiety, somatic complaints, and depressive features without depression have been described in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism.

American Thyroid Association — acquired pediatric hypothyroidism and OHI are managed primarily with levothyroxine. "Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism; it is more common in females compared to males, and the incidence increases during adolescence". Severe cases may present with "TSH values > 1000 mIU/L". For OHI, "LT4 replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with OHI with the dose adjusted for weight or body surface area", using age bands where "The LT4 dose for patients 1–3 years of age is 4–6 μg/kg/d, for patients 3–10 years the LT4 dose is 3–5 μg/kg/d, and for patients 10–16 years the LT4 dose is 2–4 μg/kg/d", and "LT4 may also be dosed based on body surface area calculated at 100 μg/m²/d". Expectations should be realistic because "Reduction in pretreatment weight should not be presumed with initiation of LT4 replacement therapy".

### Evaluating the effectiveness of combined T4 and T3 therapy or desiccated thyroid versus T4 monotherapy in hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116P44TG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of thyroid hormone replacement therapies in hypothyroidism, revealing that combined T4 + T3 therapy and desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) offer distinct biochemical profiles compared to T4 monotherapy yet do not significantly impact a range of clinical outcomes. Notably, combined therapy does not alter TSH levels but significantly affects total T4 and T3 levels, suggesting specific biochemical changes without corresponding clinical benefits regarding lipid profile, cardiovascular risk markers, and quality of life measures. However, a significant improvement in mental health and well-being with combined therapy emerges as a potential benefit, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies. The observed high heterogeneity across studies underscores the complexity of thyroid hormone therapy and the importance of individual patient factors in treatment decisions, paving the way for more tailored and nuanced approaches to managing hypothyroidism.

### Hypothyroidism (primary) [^114BvYSq]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is six times more common in women, affecting up to 40/10,000 each year (compared with 6/10,000 men).

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for clinical (overt) hypothyroidism? What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hypothyroidism? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: levothyroxine, and levothyroxine plus liothyronine.

Combination LT4, LT3 treatment in primary hypothyroidism — randomized evidence and outcomes are summarized as follows: In adults with primary hypothyroidism, 13 original RCTs were reviewed, with treatment durations ranging from 5 weeks to 1 year and the majority 6 months or shorter; females accounted for 80% or more of participants in specific trials; seven had a cross-over design and the rest a parallel design; all included trials had some level of blinding except for one study. Effects on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) varied: eight studies found no difference versus LT4 alone, two reported significantly higher TSH with combination therapy, and two reported significantly lower TSH, including suppression to 0.07 mIU/L in a highest dose combination group using a 5:1 ratio of LT4 to LT3. Health-related quality-of-life/mood results across 13 trials were heterogeneous, with two trials showing marked superiority of combination treatment on multiple measures, two showing superiority on a minority of measurements (including improvements at 3 months but not 12 months in one trial), and eight trials showing no statistically significant superiority over LT4.

### Critical approach to hypothyroid patients with persistent symptoms [^115gM4sL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common condition, and numerous studies have been published over the last decade to assess the potential risks associated with this disorder when inappropriately treated. The standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism remains levothyroxine (LT4) at doses to achieve biochemical and clinical euthyroidism. However, about 15% of hypothyroid patients experience residual hypothyroid symptoms. Some population-based studies and international population-based surveys have confirmed dissatisfaction with LT4 treatment in some hypothyroid patients. It is well established that hypothyroid patients treated with LT4 exhibit higher serum thyroxine:triiodothyronine ratios and can have a persistent increase in cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, variants in deiodinases and thyroid hormone transporter genes have been associated with subnormal T3 concentrations, persistent symptoms in LT4-treated patients, and improvement in response to the addition of liothyronine to LT4 therapy. The American (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines have recently evolved in their recognition of the potential limitations of LT4. This shift is reflected in prescribing patterns: Physicians' use of combination therapy is prevalent and possibly increasing. Randomized clinical trials have recently been published and, while they have found no improvement in treating hypothyroid patients, a number of important limitations did not allow generalizability. Meta-analyses have reported a preference rate for combination therapy in 46.2% hypothyroid patients treated with LT4. To promote discussions about an optimal study design, the ATA, ETA, and British Thyroid Association have recently published a consensus document. Our study provides a useful counterpoint on the controversial benefits of treating hypothyroid patients with combination therapy.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Role of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism [^112Chvgh]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^1117tFt3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism is a highly prevalent global health problem that can substantially affect patients' wellbeing. Lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone (replacement therapy) is needed when the diagnosis of persistent thyroid hormone deficiency is confirmed; consequently, levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in Western countries, and this is likely to increase further in the foreseeable future.

Long term adverse health outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction and treatment targets to optimise these outcomes, generally monitored by serial measurements of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), have been extensively investigated. In particular, the cardiovascular effect of thyroid dysfunction and the negative ramifications of clinical (overt) thyroid hypofunction, mediated by changes in systemic vascular resistance, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and accelerated atherosclerosis, are well documented. One of the targets for treatment with thyroid hormone replacement is to reverse such adverse effects. Current guidelines in Europe and the US recommend that replacement therapy should be aimed at resolving symptoms and achieving "normalisation" of TSH. However, no specific optimal target for TSH exists in the context of thyroid hormone replacement. This uncertainty is reflected in the guidelines proposed by the American Thyroid Association Task Force and the statement issued by the British Thyroid Association Executive Committee, which suggest a wide range for TSH, 0.4–4.0 mIU/L, as an indication for optimal replacement, after emphasising the scarcity of relevant evidence. TSH concentrations in this wide target range may be achieved by different doses of levothyroxine. However, from a physiological standpoint, a continuum of effects may plausibly occur across the spectrum of normal TSH concentrations; the same human heart might behave differently at a pace dictated by a TSH concentration of 0.4 mIU/L compared with one of 4 mIU/L, both of which are considered normal. Evidence indicates that TSH and circulating thyroid hormone concentrations are quite tightly regulated on an individual basis, but determining an individual's set point is not part of routine clinical practice, and replacement treatment is generally targeted in a wide reference range.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113KeiYf]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism — thyroxine dosing and cardiac considerations are described as follows: Thyroxine therapy is thought to reverse cardiovascular changes, and in older patients or those with known or suspected ischemic heart disease or cardiac dysfunction the initial dose should be "≈25% to 50% of the anticipated replacement dose, and the dose should then be increased in stepwise fashion at 6- to 8-week intervals". Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is noted as controversial but "from a cardiac perspective, treatment appears to offer benefit with minimal risk", with case reports of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) improving on thyroid hormone replacement; however, despite small trials showing cardiac function improvement with short-term T3, "trials evaluating clinical outcomes in HF patients are not available".

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115LrQCf]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Children with subclinical hypothyroidism — many clinicians consider it reasonable to initiate levothyroxine to avoid potential risk to growth and development, but treatment is generally not recommended when thyrotropin is 5–10 mIU/L; for thyrotropin > 10 mIU/L with signs and symptoms of primary thyroid disease and/or risk factors for progression, levothyroxine may be reasonable. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Management of primary hypothyroidism: statement by the British thyroid association executive committee [^111sUrae]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of primary hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (L-T4) is simple, effective and safe, and most patients report improved well-being on initiation of treatment. However, a proportion of individuals continue to suffer with symptoms despite achieving adequate biochemical correction. The management of such individuals has been the subject of controversy and of considerable public interest. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the European Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism. These guidelines have been based on extensive reviews of the medical literature and include sections on the role of combination therapy with L-T4 and liothyronine (L-T3) in individuals who are persistently dissatisfied with L-T4 therapy. This position statement by the British Thyroid Association (BTA) summarises the key points in these guidelines and makes recommendations on the management of primary hypothyroidism based on the current literature, review of the published positions of the ETA and ATA, and in line with best principles of good medical practice. The statement is endorsed by the Association of Clinical Biochemistry, (ACB), British Thyroid Foundation, (BTF), Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and Society for Endocrinology (SFE).
