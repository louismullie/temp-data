## Question

Management of postop ileus and small bowel obstruction

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing postoperative ileus from small bowel obstruction. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and imaging thresholds. Next, I will review nonoperative management for ileus and SBO, including nutrition and decompression. After that, I need to determine indications and timing for surgery in SBO, including special scenarios like early postoperative obstruction. Finally, I will consider prevention strategies, special populations, and how to monitor and define outcomes using core outcome sets to align with best practice and research standards.

> Let me first confirm the clinical distinction, because mislabeling ileus as obstruction delays appropriate care and increases morbidity. Postoperative ileus is a functional, adynamic state with delayed GI transit after surgery, typically resolving within 3–5 days, whereas small bowel obstruction is mechanical and may require intervention if ischemia or complete obstruction is present; I should double-check that persistent ileus beyond 5 days warrants reassessment for mechanical causes, which multiple sources support [^114oYALX] [^112Ptw9E].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to management. I initially thought plain abdominal radiographs might suffice early on, but hold on, I should verify their utility; in the early postoperative period, plain films rarely change management and may prolong stay, so CT is preferred when obstruction is suspected or symptoms persist beyond 5 days, as it characterizes level, severity, transition point, and ischemia risk and guides decisions on conservative versus operative care [^112hJZLF] [^112EdT5A] [^114kRHNP]. I need to ensure I also consider water-soluble contrast when the diagnosis is uncertain or to help predict resolution; a contrast challenge can both aid diagnosis and prognosticate nonoperative success in adhesive SBO [^113qPxV4] [^111nfsWC].

> Next, I should review nonoperative management for postoperative ileus. Let me think about the basics: correction of electrolytes, early ambulation, and multimodal analgesia to minimize opioids are foundational. I should confirm that routine nasogastric tubes are avoided unless there is severe distension or intractable vomiting, and that early feeding within 24 hours is safe and associated with faster GI recovery and shorter length of stay, which ERAS guidance supports [^115ENUjh] [^113j3HK6] [^116EXMwB]. I should also consider adjuncts with modest evidence like chewing gum and, in selected open colorectal cases, alvimopan to accelerate recovery, while remembering that many pharmacologic strategies have mixed or limited evidence in humans [^117CvnZU] [^1144TD7j] [^116Bf5NY].

> Now, for nonoperative management of adhesive SBO, I need to ensure I apply the right selection criteria. In the absence of peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, or CT signs of ischemia, conservative therapy with NPO, IV fluids, and nasogastric decompression is appropriate. I should double-check that most patients improve within 3–5 days, and that prolonged observation beyond 5–7 days without improvement increases the risk of missed ischemia and should prompt reconsideration of surgery [^1138bjgk] [^116PT8rb] [^116CmJ2u]. Hold on, I should verify nutrition: if oral intake is not feasible beyond several days, parenteral nutrition should be considered, especially in malnourished patients or when the GI tract is nonfunctional, but I must not delay enteral access if the gut is usable [^112Q6ivV].

> I will now examine indications and timing for surgery in SBO. Emergent exploration is required for generalized peritonitis, suspected strangulation or ischemia, or clinical deterioration; otherwise, I should confirm that persistent obstruction beyond about 3–5 days of nonoperative care or failure to improve by days 5–7 are reasonable thresholds to proceed, acknowledging that complete obstructions have a higher failure rate with conservative therapy [^112zPWLr] [^116CmJ2u] [^116PT8rb]. Let me reconsider early postoperative SBO: most cases resolve with decompression, and waiting up to 10–14 days can be safe if the patient remains stable, but I need to ensure I exclude fixable causes like hernia, internal herniation, or trocar-site defects that warrant earlier intervention [^114oYALX] [^111nfsWC].

> Choosing the operative approach requires careful judgment. I should confirm that laparoscopy is feasible and may reduce length of stay and complications in selected patients, but conversion risk rises with marked bowel distension, multiple prior operations, or unstable patients; in those cases, open surgery is prudent, and surgeon experience with advanced laparoscopy is essential to safety and outcomes [^113UVawe] [^114iKks5] [^114GepBW]. Hold on, I should verify that no randomized trials definitively compare laparoscopic versus open adhesiolysis yet, so retrospective data and expert guidance must be weighed carefully in shared decision-making [^114GepBW].

> Special scenarios deserve forethought. In early postoperative obstruction after benign gynecologic surgery, I need to check for rare but important causes like internal herniation, volvulus, or foreign-body obstruction, and maintain a low threshold for CT and early reintervention when the clinical course deviates from expected ileus resolution [^115TR4Mv]. In children with postoperative SBO, I should double-check that prolonged observation beyond 48 hours yields diminishing returns and that strangulation can occur early, prompting timely operative consideration if no improvement [^113Qn5Kn]. For malignant bowel obstruction, I need to ensure that decompressive strategies like nasointestinal tubes have limited success and that goals-of-care discussions guide interventions focused on palliation rather than cure [^115uji6A].

> Prevention is as critical as treatment, so I should confirm ERAS elements that mitigate ileus. Minimally invasive approaches, opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia with regional techniques, early feeding within 24 hours, elimination of routine NG tubes, and goal-directed fluids are core measures; alvimopan can be offered after open colorectal resections to hasten recovery, and chewing gum is a low-risk adjunct [^115ENUjh] [^113j3HK6] [^1144TD7j] [^117CvnZU]. But wait, what if the patient has a loop ileostomy? I should verify that early ileostomy closure reduces obstruction risk, albeit with a trade-off of higher surgical site infection, and that preoperative bowel stimulation of the distal limb may reduce post-closure ileus in trials [^111C5inE] [^115TAVpB].

> I need to ensure my monitoring and outcomes align with consensus core outcome sets. For ASBO, mortality, need for surgery, ischemia, and small bowel resection are key quality markers. For POI, time to tolerance of diet, need for NG decompression, and length of stay are patient-important endpoints. Consistent use of these outcomes improves comparability and quality of care [^111wd5v7] [^116cqhhN] [^111xi2Br]. Hold on, I should verify that standardized pathways and adherence tracking help translate these outcomes into real-world practice improvements, which is emphasized in perioperative quality initiatives [^1157Z9rf].

> Let me summarize the decision flow to ensure internal consistency. If bowel function has not returned by postoperative day 5, I should reassess for mechanical obstruction with CT and consider contrast. If there are no signs of ischemia, I continue nonoperative care with NG decompression, fluids, and nutrition planning. If there is peritonitis, continuous pain, fever, tachycardia, acidosis, or CT evidence of ischemia, I proceed to urgent surgery. If no improvement by days 5–7, I should escalate to operative management, choosing laparoscopic versus open based on patient factors and surgeon expertise. Throughout, I apply ERAS principles to prevent recurrence and use core outcomes to benchmark care [^114oYALX] [^1138bjgk] [^115ENUjh] [^111wd5v7].

Postoperative ileus (POI) and small bowel obstruction (SBO) are common after abdominal surgery, with POI typically resolving within 3–5 days [^112Ptw9E] and SBO often requiring longer management [^116CmJ2u]. POI is managed with **early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, and early feeding** [^112P9mzX]; **alvimopan is used selectively** for open colorectal surgery [^1144TD7j]. SBO is managed conservatively with NG decompression and IV fluids [^116nHuvB]; surgery is indicated for peritonitis, ischemia, or failure of nonoperative care within 3–5 days [^112zPWLr] [^116CmJ2u]. CT is the **diagnostic gold standard** to distinguish POI from SBO and detect complications [^112EdT5A] [^116nHuvB]. Early recognition, structured pathways, and close monitoring reduce morbidity, length of stay, and costs [^115HhGsQ] [^116EXMwB].

---

## Definitions and pathophysiology

Postoperative ileus is a **transient impairment of gastrointestinal motility** after surgery, typically resolving within 3–5 days [^112Ptw9E]; it reflects neurogenic, inflammatory, and pharmacologic mechanisms, including autonomic dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, and opioid effects [^116Bf5NY]. Small bowel obstruction is a **mechanical blockage** of the small intestine — most often from adhesions, hernias, or neoplasms [^113V7zqS] — and can lead to ischemia, perforation, and sepsis if untreated [^1151bNNn].

---

## Clinical presentation and differentiation

| **Feature** | **Postoperative ileus** | **Small bowel obstruction** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | Typically within 3–5 days post-op | Often after return of bowel function |
| Symptoms | - Abdominal distension <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Absent bowel sounds | - Crampy abdominal pain <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Distension <br/> - High-pitched bowel sounds |
| Imaging | - Diffuse bowel distension <br/> - No transition point | - Distended loops with transition point <br/> - Air-fluid levels [^notfound] |

---

CT is the **diagnostic gold standard**, identifying transition points, causes, and complications such as ischemia or perforation [^112EdT5A].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors for **postoperative ileus** include open surgery, prolonged operative time, opioid use, electrolyte disturbances, and intra-abdominal complications [^1134JXXj] [^115ENUjh]. Risk factors for **small bowel obstruction** include prior abdominal surgery, adhesions, hernias, malignancy, and inflammatory bowel disease [^113V7zqS].

---

## Management strategies

### Postoperative ileus

- **Supportive care**: Early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, and correction of electrolyte imbalances [^115ENUjh] [^112P9mzX] [^111ujv1s].
- **Early feeding**: Initiate within 24 hours postoperatively to promote motility and reduce length of stay [^116EXMwB].
- **Pharmacologic agents**: Alvimopan is recommended for open colorectal surgery to accelerate GI recovery [^1144TD7j].

---

### Small bowel obstruction

- **Initial management**: Nasogastric decompression, IV fluids, and close monitoring [^116nHuvB].
- **Indications for surgery**: Peritonitis, ischemia, or failure of nonoperative management within 3–5 days [^112zPWLr] [^116CmJ2u].
- **Surgical approach**: Laparoscopic adhesiolysis is preferred when feasible, with open surgery reserved for complex cases or hemodynamic instability [^116nHuvB] [^114iKks5].

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications of **postoperative ileus** include prolonged hospital stay, increased costs, and delayed recovery [^114awCCS]. Complications of **small bowel obstruction** include ischemia, perforation, sepsis, and recurrence, with significant morbidity and mortality if not managed promptly [^113V7zqS].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies include **minimally invasive surgery** to reduce tissue trauma and adhesion formation [^113UVawe], and **enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)** protocols with early feeding, opioid minimization, and early mobilization [^115ENUjh]. Adhesion barriers may also reduce recurrence in high-risk patients [^116JSa9j].

---

## Economic impact

Postoperative ileus significantly increases healthcare costs due to prolonged hospitalization and resource utilization [^114awCCS]. Small bowel obstruction likewise increases costs from prolonged stays, surgical interventions, and complications [^115uji6A].

---

## Current guidelines and consensus statements

Current guidelines emphasize **multimodal care** for postoperative ileus, including early feeding, opioid minimization, and selective use of alvimopan [^115ENUjh] [^1144TD7j]. For small bowel obstruction, they recommend initial conservative management with timely surgical intervention for complications or nonresolution [^1138bjgk] [^112zPWLr].

---

Postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction require **distinct yet overlapping management strategies**. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and adherence to evidence-based protocols are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.

Comparison between patients with and without small bowel resection during the index SBO episode management

Patients who underwent a small bowel resection during the index SBO episode had a similar rehospitalization rate and a nonsignificantly higher operation rate for small bowel obstruction recurrence, as well as similar overall mortality, compared to those who had no resection (Supplemental Table S3, online electronic supplementary material). Symptoms of SBO occurrence (considering patients who responded to follow-up evaluation) were similar between the two groups [35.0% (7/20) vs. 34.7% (17/49), OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.3–3.0; p = 0.981].

### Mechanisms and treatment of postoperative ileus… [^113EvPng]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

The etiology of postoperative ileus can best be described as multifactorial. A multimodality treatment approach should include limiting the administration of agents known to contribute to postoperative ileus, using thoracic epidurals with local anesthetics when possible, and selectively applying nasogastric decompression. Given in combination, these drugs showed no additional effects over reserpine therapy alone in the skin incision and laparotomy-only groups; however, administration of these drugs resulted in a complete reversal of the inhibition of gastrointestinal motility induced by laparotomy, evisceration, and manipulation. These results support the involvement of NO release in postoperative ileus. The role of NO in the pathogenesis of postoperative ileus in humans remains unclear. Experimental evidence13, 35 has shown that antagonists to vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, and inhibitors of NO synthesis improve postoperative bowel motility.

Administration of 6 mg of this drug shortened the median time to passage of first flatus, the median time to the first bowel movement, and the length of hospital stay in a study82 of 79 patients, of which 15 underwent partial colectomy and 63 underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Other experimental studies37 indicate that opioid agonists working at the κ receptor may be beneficial by serving as an analgesic and decreasing postoperative ileus. Questions remain about the role of these agents in patients not treated with opioids for postoperative pain and about whether the beneficial effects of these agents are seen in patients undergoing other surgical procedures. Early postoperative enteral feeding via oral or nasoenteric administration has been suggested as a way to decrease the duration of postoperative ileus.

The logic behind early enteral feeding is that food intake can stimulate a reflex that produces coordinated propulsive activity and elicit the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, causing an overall positive effect on bowel motility. 86 The role of early postoperative enteral feeding remains unclear because some studies support and others refute its benefit on shortening postoperative ileus. 87–91. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy may improve postoperative ileus by allowing the clinician to reduce the amount of opioid given by 20% to 30%. 97 An additional benefit on bowel motility may be derived from the anti-inflammatory properties of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 98 In most experimental and clinical studies, 99–102 giving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs resulted in decreased nausea and vomiting and improved gastrointestinal transit.

### American society for enhanced recovery and Perioperative Quality Initiative joint consensus statement on postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction within an enhanced recovery pathway for elective colorectal surgery [^1157Z9rf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

The primary driver of length of stay after bowel surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, is the time to return of gastrointestinal (GI) function. Traditionally, delayed GI recovery was thought to be a routine and unavoidable consequence of surgery, but this has been shown to be false in the modern era owing to the proliferation of enhanced recovery protocols. However, impaired GI function is still common after colorectal surgery, and the current literature is ambiguous with regard to the definition of postoperative GI dysfunction (POGD), or what is typically referred to as ileus. This persistent ambiguity has impeded the ability to ascertain the true incidence of the condition and study it properly within a research setting. Furthermore, a rational and standardized approach to prevention and treatment of POGD is needed. The second Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts to review the published literature and provide consensus recommendations on this important topic with the goal to (1) develop a rational definition for POGD that can serve as a framework for clinical and research efforts; (2) critically review the evidence behind current prevention strategies and provide consensus recommendations; and (3) develop rational treatment strategies that take into account the wide spectrum of impaired GI function in the postoperative period.

1 Introduction

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common iatrogenic condition associated with abdominal surgery, characterized by a prolonged absence of gastrointestinal (GI) transit in response to surgical intervention. Clinically, patients suffering from POI manifest as intolerance to oral intake, abdominal distension, and impaired GI propulsion, without evidence of mechanical obstruction. It is widely accepted that a transient, self‐limiting form of POI represents a normal physiological response to abdominal surgery, typically resolving without significant complications. However, when POI becomes pathologic and prolonged, it contributes to increased patient morbidity, discomfort, and dissatisfaction, leading to extended hospital stays and higher healthcare costs.

The severity and duration of POI are largely determined by the extent of surgical trauma, with intestinal surgery being particularly associated with a high incidence of complications. Notably, patients experiencing POI face a complication rate as high as 60%, with 20% requiring admission to intensive care. Even with the implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, POI continues to pose a significant clinical challenge, particularly in colorectal surgery, where its incidence can reach 20%.

### Feasibility of laparoscopy for small bowel obstruction [^115TFEXe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic adhesiolysis in small bowel obstruction is feasible but can be convenient only if performed by skilled surgeons in selected patients. Performing an accurate selection of obstructed patients is essential in order to avoid an increase in morbidity due to laparotomic conversion. This review suggests the predictive factors for achieving this result, considering the number and kind of previous laparotomies, the previous surgical treatment causing adherences and grade of adherential syndrome, the time from the onset of obstructive symptoms and grade of intestinal dilatation on X-ray investigations, the association with intestinal ischemia or necrosis and consequent signs of peritonitis, the grade of the comorbidities and the hemodynamic condition.

The convenience of laparoscopic management of the correctly selected patients with small bowel obstruction is demonstrated, despite of a longer surgical operating time, by the short hospital stay, the early oral intake and especially by the lower postoperative morbidity. On the other hand the main disadvantage is the increased small bowel obstruction recurrence; furthermore the mortality rate remains unmodified.

Definitively the laparoscopic adhesiolysis for small bowel obstruction is satisfactorily carried out when early indicated in patients with a low number of laparotomies resulting in a short hospital stay and a lower postoperative morbidity. Although a higher small bowel obstruction recurrence remains the major postoperative risk of the laparoscopic management of these patients.

Ileus Prevention

21. Patients should be offered a regular diet within 24 hours after elective colorectal surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.

A 2019 Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 17 RCTs that compared early feeding (ie, within 24 hours of surgery) versus "later commencement" after lower GI surgery. In this review, early feeding was associated with a 2-day decrease in length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.95; 95% CI, 0.91–2.99). However, perioperative management strategies varied significantly within the included trials and the mean LOS in the control group ranged from 6 to 24 days. Furthermore, the risk of complications such as anastomotic leak, wound infection, pneumonia, and mortality were not affected by early feeding. Even symptoms of nausea and vomiting were not significantly higher in the early feeding group in this review. Early enteral feeding is associated with faster return of GI function and with shorter time to flatus and first bowel movement. Although there is heterogeneity between trials, the overall body of evidence supports the benefits of early feeding.

### The 16 golden hours for conservative treatment in children with postoperative small bowel obstruction [^113Qn5Kn]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Conservative treatment of postoperative small bowel obstruction in children is widely accepted, provided that there are no clinical signs of bowel strangulation. However, the length of time surgery can be safely deferred remains unclear.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the time limit for observant management of postoperative small bowel obstruction.

Methods

The medical records of 128 children with 174 episodes of postoperative small bowel obstruction were reviewed.

Results

Spontaneous resolution occurred in 63% of cases, 85% within 48 hours of admission. Bowel compromise was noted in 31% of the operated cases, and about half of them underwent bowel resection, accounting for 6% of all admissions. None of the cases treated surgically within 16 hours of admission was associated with bowel strangulation or need for resection.

Conclusions

In children presenting with postoperative small bowel obstruction, prolonging observant treatment for more than 48 hours yields only a small benefit in terms of spontaneous resolution. Bowel strangulation can occur within 16 hours of admission. On the basis of these findings, we suggest raising the index of suspicion for compromised bowel after 16 hours and making the decision for surgery at around 48 hours.

### Risk factors of early postoperative bowel obstruction for patients undergoing selective colorectal surgeries [^1179sXhP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative bowel obstruction, either mechanical or functional, was a common and severe complication that might affect the recovery of bowel function and lead to prolonged hospitalization and rising medical costs. Previous studies showed that postoperative bowel obstruction could even increase mortality and morbidity in patients following abdominal surgery. Postoperative bowel obstruction might be classified based on the time duration from the initial surgery. Early postoperative bowel obstruction was defined as occurring within the first 30 days after surgery. Edna et al. found that the incidence of postoperative small bowel obstruction after the colorectal was 9%. The reason causing postoperative bowel obstruction was either mechanical obstruction from adhesions or paralytic ileus in abdominal surgery.

Previous studies found that cystotomy, lysis of adhesions, concomitant bowel surgery postoperative transfusion were independent risk factors for the development of small bowel obstruction after benign gynecologic surgery. Several studies focused on the incidence and management of postoperative bowel obstruction. The risk factors of postoperative bowel obstruction after colorectal surgery have not been adequately documented. We aimed to develop and validate a nomogram for predicting the risk factors of early postoperative obstruction for patients after colorectal surgery, which may help us identified these patients with a high risk of early postoperative obstruction and may improve the patients' quality of life and reduce the length of hospital stay and costs of hospitalization.

### Postoperative ileus: etiologies and interventions [^112P9mzX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

This article will review the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus, with emphasis on potential therapeutic targets, and examine the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Proposed mechanisms include actuation of spinal and local sympathetic neural reflexes, inflammatory mediation, and exacerbation by anesthetic or surgical procedures. Some procedures or agents have shown clinical benefit, and these include use of laparoscopic surgery, thoracic epidurals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opiate antagonists. Other procedures may be helpful with low risk of adverse effects. These include early feeding and ambulation, laxatives, and possibly neostigmine.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to postoperative ileus prevention (ERASS), ERAS 2019 guidelines recommend to offer a multimodal approach including the following measures to minimize the development of postoperative ileus:

- limiting opioid administration through multimodal anesthesia and analgesia techniques

- using minimally invasive surgical techniques when feasible

- eliminating routine placement of nasogastric tubes

- using goal-directed fluid therapy.

### Establishing core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in studies of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction: protocol for a nested methodological study [^114bwQJ8]. Colorectal Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastrointestinal recovery describes the restoration of normal bowel function in patients with bowel disease. This may be prolonged in two common clinical settings: postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction. Improving gastrointestinal recovery is a research priority but researchers are limited by variation in outcome reporting across clinical studies. This protocol describes the development of core outcome sets for gastrointestinal recovery in the contexts of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction.

Method

An international Steering Group consisting of patient and clinician representatives has been established. As overlap between clinical contexts is anticipated, both outcome sets will be co-developed and may be combined to form a common output with disease-specific domains. The development process will comprise three phases, including definition of outcomes relevant to postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction from systematic literature reviews and nominal-group stakeholder discussions; online-facilitated Delphi surveys via international networks; and a consensus meeting to ratify the final output. A nested study will explore if the development of overlapping outcome sets can be rationalized.

Dissemination and Implementation

The final output will be registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative. A multi-faceted, quality improvement campaign for the reporting of gastrointestinal recovery in clinical studies will be launched, targeting international professional and patient groups, charitable organizations and editorial committees. Success will be explored via an updated systematic review of outcomes 5 years after registration of the core outcome set.

### Management of ileus and small-bowel obstruction following benign gynecologic surgery [^117NUcww]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe practice preferences for the diagnosis and management of ileus and small-bowel obstruction (SBO) following benign gynecologic surgery.

Methods

A secondary descriptive analysis was performed on data from a multicenter case-control study of patients who underwent gynecologic surgery and subsequently developed ileus or SBO. Information was collected regarding interventions such as type of imaging ordered for diagnosis, diet alterations, antiemetic administration, and need for reoperation.

Results

In total, 144 cases were identified. Abdominal X-ray was the most common imaging modality, occurring in 54 (37.5%) cases. Sixty-nine (65.1%) of the 106 women who underwent imaging were given definitive radiologic diagnoses of either ileus (50 [72.5%]) or SBO (19 [27.5%]); 57.9% (n = 11) of the SBO diagnoses and 90.0% (n = 45) of the ileus diagnoses were managed conservatively. Eighteen (12.5%) patients underwent reoperation for bowel obstruction. There were no significant differences in rate of reoperation between cases involving the use of single antiemetics and those involving the use of multiple antiemetics (P = 0.18), or between diet statuses on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.08).

Conclusion

Most study centers initially performed an abdominal X-ray for diagnostic purposes. The majority used a multimodal treatment approach. None of the management options decreased the likelihood of reoperation.

### Small bowel obstruction [^114kRHNP]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying patients with small bowel obstruction who need operative intervention and those who will fail nonoperative management is a challenge. Without indications for urgent intervention, a computed tomography scan with/without intravenous contrast should be obtained to identify location, grade, and etiology of the obstruction. Most small bowel obstructions resolve with nonoperative management. Open and laparoscopic operative management are acceptable approaches. Malnutrition needs to be identified early and managed, especially if the patient is to undergo operative management. Confounding conditions include age greater than 65, post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, virgin abdomen, pregnancy, hernia, and early postoperative state.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^115Z3JbH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative ileus is a common and distressing complication after intestinal surgery. It presents clinically as impairment of intestinal motility, characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, and delayed recovery of defaecatory function. For patients, this increases the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia, venous thromboembolic events, and malnutrition. For healthcare systems, it leads to a substantial economic burden associated with increased medical, nursing, dietitian, and laboratory costs. Accordingly, postoperative ileus is now recognized as a research priority by expert and public stakeholder groups.

Numerous clinical interventions have been evaluated in efforts to prevent postoperative ileus, but few have led to meaningful patient benefit. A key challenge for researchers is the absence of a standardized and agreed framework to describe the effectiveness of new interventions in clinical studies. Common outcomes include the time taken until first passage of flatus/stool, time until tolerance of oral diet, and the return of bowel sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these are sufficiently relevant to patients and healthcare professionals when evaluating new treatments and implementing them in clinical practice.

A solution to this problem is the development of an agreed core outcome set developed through patient–clinician consensus. Core outcome sets provide a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in all studies of a defined clinical condition and are supported by the Core Outcome Measures in Effective Trials (COMET) Initiative. The present report describes the international development and final content of an agreed core outcome set for postoperative ileus relevant to patients undergoing intestinal surgery.

### Recurrent small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic surgery for gallstone ileus [^111dWHhx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Gallstone ileus is an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction. A patient presenting with gallstone ileus was managed in our department by laparoscopic enterolithotomy. Postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent small bowel obstruction due to the presence of a second gallstone. It is therefore important to exclude the possibility of multiple gallstones at the initial operation.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (surgical management), ESPGHAN 2018 guidelines recommend to minimize the number of surgical interventions in patients with pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction in order to avoid potential complications (such as adhesion formation, prolonged paralytic ileus post-surgery) and diagnostic uncertainty regarding the pseudo‐obstructive or true occlusive nature of future obstructive episodes.

### Postoperative ileus on a gynecologic oncology service – do abdominal X-rays have a role? [^112hJZLF]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to estimate the role of abdominal radiographs in the management of the patient with gastrointestinal dysfunction in the early postoperative period following intra-abdominal gynecologic surgery.

Methods

Hospital records were reviewed for 84 patients from the gynecologic oncology service having a clinical diagnosis of either ileus or bowel obstruction immediately after intra-abdominal gynecologic surgery. Patient history, clinical signs and symptoms, findings of plain radiographs, and clinical course were studied to determine whether plain abdominal radiographs were useful in the management of these patients.

Results

At least one set of abdominal X-rays was obtained for 56 (66.7%) patients, of which 24 (42.9%) were considered radiographically diagnostic. A lower preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score correlated with a greater likelihood of having abdominal films (P = 0.005). No single clinical finding correlated with either the decision to obtain films or X-ray diagnosis of ileus or bowel obstruction. Use of any nonsurgical treatment modality was not significantly different for patients who had films versus those who did not. Mean length of hospital stay was significantly prolonged for patients who had abdominal X-rays. Seven patients were subjected to reoperation; however, no association was found between X-ray diagnosis of ileus or bowel obstruction and the need for reoperation.

Conclusion

Plain abdominal radiographs have little clinical utility in the evaluation of patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction in the early postoperative period following intra-abdominal gynecologic surgery. Diagnostic studies such as CT scanning or a GI contrast study may be more helpful in the management of these patients.

### Clinical perspective on postoperative ileus and the effect of opiates [^115nd8mz]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2004). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus (POI) is a mandatory period of cessation of intestinal function, after abdominal surgery. Over the last decade research has continued into this field, and while we continue to learn about pathogenesis, few controlled data are available for management. The clinical manifestations of POI are reviewed. Management techniques are also reviewed, including the use of postoperative care plans with early ambulation and diet, the effects of epidural anaesthesia, benefits of laparoscopic approaches for intestinal resection, and potential avenues for prevention using novel medications.

### Clinical outcome in acute small bowel obstruction after surgical or conservative management [^1136KhUU]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute small bowel obstruction (SBO) accounts for about 20% of all surgical emergencies in Western societies. Small bowel obstruction is caused mainly by postoperative adhesions (more than 75% of all cases). The operative procedures usually associated with SBO are colectomy, hysterectomy, and appendectomy. Other causes of SBO are Crohn's disease (7%), neoplasm (5–10%), hernia (2%), or radiation-induced enteritis (1%). In a series of 29,790 patients with a single previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, Ellis et al. reported that within the following 10 years 34.6% of them were readmitted with a mean of 2.1 times for a disease related to adhesions. About 10% of patients have "spontaneous" SBO with no previous abdominal surgery. The management of SBO is based on clinical evaluation, biological tests, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. Conservative treatment with bowel rest, nasogastric tube decompression, and fluid resuscitation is successful in a variable proportion of patients. In conservative management, regular reassessment is mandatory for early recognition of signs of bowel ischemia that would require a surgical operation. Patients with clinical degradation or with a CT scan evoking strangulated SBO need urgent surgery. In a significant proportion of patients both therapeutic options are valid; the choice of the treatment depends mainly on the clinician's assessment, and therefore it represents a common clinical challenge. On the one hand, successful conservative treatment may leave adhesions that could cause recurrence; on the other hand, surgery may be the source of new adhesions like any other abdominal surgery. Landercasper et al. reported a 42% risk of SBO recurrence by 10 years, which is lessened in surgically treated patients compared to their conservatively treated counterparts. Another retrospective study analyzed the pattern of recurrence after one or more episodes of SBO; the rate of SBO recurrence was shown to increase proportionally to the number of previous SBO episodes.

In the present study, we report a long-term follow-up of patients treated with surgical versus conservative approach for SBO. The aim was to compare the rate of SBO recurrence, resulting in new hospitalization with or without surgery, as well as the occurrence of SBO symptoms, such as recurrent abdominal pain, at home.

### Postoperative ileus: a review [^111ujv1s]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperatively, some patients experience a prolonged inhibition of coordinated bowel activity, which causes accumulation of secretions and gas, resulting in nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and pain. This prolonged inhibition can take days or weeks to resolve and often is referred to as postoperative paralytic ileus lasting more than three days after surgery. This article reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options of postoperative ileus.

Methods

The relevant literature from 1965 to 2003 was identified and reviewed using MEDLINE database of the U.S. Medical Library of Medicine. Both retrospective and prospective studies were included in this review.

Results

The pathophysiology of postoperative ileus is multifactorial. The duration of postoperative ileus correlates with the degree of surgical trauma and is most extensive after colonic surgery. However, postoperative ileus can develop after all types of surgery including extraperitoneal surgery. A variety of treatment options have been used to decrease the duration of postoperative ileus. However, it is difficult to compare these studies because of small sample sizes and differences in operations performed, anesthesia protocols provided both intraoperatively and postoperatively, patient comorbidities, and in the measured end points, such as the time to the presence of bowel sounds, flatus, or bowel movements, tolerance of solid food, or discharge from the hospital. However, despite these drawbacks, some conclusions can be made.

Conclusions

Paralytic postoperative ileus continues to be a significant problem after abdominal and other types of surgery. The etiology is multifactorial and is best treated with a combination of different approaches. Currently, the important factors that could effect the duration and recovery from postoperative ileus include limitation of narcotic use by substituting alternative medications such as nonsteroidals and placing a thoracic epidural with local anesthetic when possible. The selective use of nasogastric decompression and correction of electrolyte imbalances also are important factors to consider.

Regarding surgical interventions for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend to perform timely surgical exploration in patients with SBO and generalized peritonitis on physical examination or with other evidence of clinical deterioration such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^115hiSvL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The Guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation also based on the evidence. The Guidelines present the diagnostic and therapeutic methods for optimal management and prevention of ASBO.

The practice Guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Definition

Abdominal adhesions, which can begin forming within a few hours after an operation, represent the most common cause of intestinal obstruction being responsible for 60% to 70% of SBO. Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation, in conjunction of confirmatory imaging.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^116jkG6X]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Our institution does not require ethical permission for secondary research using primary literature. The research is reported according to the Preferred Reporting terms for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA).

Target condition, search strategy, and study selection

We wrote a protocol and then developed and piloted a search string to identify imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables (including existing models) potentially predictive of SBO resolution without operative management (Online supplementary material 1). We used terms to identify studies of bowel obstruction/ileus. We included terms to identify prognostic research. We limited to adults and excluded narrative reviews, editorials, letters, etc. We searched the US National Library of Medicine PUBMED journal citation database from 2001 to 2021 inclusive. This search was supplemented by a subsequent review of references cited by included studies. The search was performed in September 2021 by two radiologists (VE, DB), one of whom had > 10 years of experience in systematic review design, data extraction, and analysis.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

We included studies investigating imaging variables potentially predictive of SBO resolution without the need for operative management (or, depending on how the research was framed, factors that predicted surgical intervention). We excluded studies limited to colonic obstruction; solely paediatric studies; studies solely of malignant obstruction; studies limited to early post-operative obstruction (a separate entity with different aetiology); studies limited to inflammatory bowel disease or chronic functional obstruction. We did not specifically set out to exclude studies that did not include intravenous contrast for CT scanning because we anticipated that the large majority would administer contrast, and contrast only influences one potential predictor variable, mucosal enhancement. We also anticipated that any representative consecutive series would include some patients in whom IV contrast is contraindicated but from whom other potential predictors could be extracted. We excluded studies reporting less than five patients in either operative or conservative groups, since these are underpowered.

### Laparoscopic versus open surgical management of small bowel obstruction: an analysis of clinical outcomes [^115qqacq]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Laparotomy is the standard surgical approach for treatment of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Laparoscopic management could be beneficial in terms of less complications and shorter hospital stay. As the minimal invasive approach is gaining more acceptances in the treatment of SBO, there is an increased need of studies to analyze outcomes. The aim of the present study was to compare the short-term clinical outcomes of laparoscopy versus laparotomy in the surgical management of non-bariatric, non-malignant SBO.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients treated for SBO during 2010–2015 was made by a comprehensive search of medical records. A matched-pair review was performed on patients managed surgically for non-bariatric, non-malignant SBO at Danderyd University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Completed laparoscopic surgeries were matched against patients treated with open surgery.

Results

Laparoscopy for SBO was initiated in 71 patients. Conversion to open surgery was performed in 42%. Results from the matched-pair analysis showed that post-operative length of stay was reduced by 60% (P < 0.001) in the laparoscopic cohort. Additionally, less major complications were reported and duration of surgery was reduced by 50% (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic management is a safe and feasible alternative to laparotomy. Hospital length of stay was significantly shorter and morbidity rate acceptable.

### Large uterine fibroids causing a closed loop small bowel obstruction following uterine fibroid embolization [^114YRqAN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

What we did and why?

The clinical presentation was most consistent with either SBO from compression by the fibroid uterus versus an ileus from inflammation caused by surrounding uterine tissue necrosis. By hospital day 2, the patient was amenable to surgical intervention. We discussed treatment options including ongoing non-surgical management, versus surgical management via myomectomy or hysterectomy. Hysterectomy was recommended over myomectomy given that myomectomy alone could still predispose the patient to future issues with mass effect or inflammation, and since the patient did not desire future fertility. The patient elected for a hysterectomy as definitive management of uterine leiomyoma.

On hospital day 2, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingectomy. We proceeded with an open approach as the bulk and shape of the fibroid uterus limited pelvic domain, resulting in a limited xyphoid-to-umbilicus distance, and restricted any lateral uterine movement that would facilitate a laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Intraoperative findings were notable for a multifibroid uterus with primarily right-sided bulk nearly reaching the umbilicus, including a large pedunculated fibroid as well as adhesions to a mass in the right pelvic sidewall thought to be an old fibroid that had detached from the uterus over time. The general surgery team joined the gynecology team intraoperatively as multiple bowel adhesions and an appendiceal adhesion to the posterior uterus were also noted.

The patient underwent lysis of adhesions and appendectomy as the appendix was almost completely adhered to the posterior uterus. The small bowel was eviscerated and ran from the terminal ileum to the ligament of Treitz where an intra-loop adhesive band was found at the distal ileum causing a closed loop obstruction (figure 2). A portion of the jejunum appeared to be congested, although it had visible peristalsis that was thought to be from evisceration of the small bowel through the laparotomy which put tension on the mesentery. Congestion improved during the course of the surgery. The patient underwent completion of the total abdominal hysterectomy and excision of the right pelvic sidewall mass without complications (figure 3). Cystoscopy was performed at the end of the case and showed bilateral ureteral jets without injury to the bladder. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 5. Pathology confirmed that the pelvic sidewall mass and the uterine fibroids were consistent with infarcted leiomyomata, as expected post-UFE.

### Core outcome set for clinical studies of postoperative ileus after intestinal surgery [^116cqhhN]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Ethics and governance

Research ethics approval was confirmed by the University of Sheffield Ethics Committee on 27 September 2019. A collaborative steering committee was convened with representation from Asia, Australasia, Europe, and North America, and included medical, allied healthcare professional, and patient investigators. The study was registered with the COMET Initiative and the protocol was reported previously. An extended description of the methods and results is provided in Appendix S1. An abridged summary is reported here.

Scope and definitions

The scope of the core outcome set was defined according to the Core Outcome Set — Standards for Development recommendations. The health condition was postoperative ileus; the population was adult patients undergoing intestinal surgery for any indication; and the setting was clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of a clinical intervention to reduce ileus. Intestinal surgery was considered to represent any intra-abdominal procedure via any surgical approach on the intestinal tract with or without formation of a stoma.

Participants

Stakeholder representation was designed to reflect the multidisciplinary management of postoperative ileus as well as the challenge it presents on an international scale. Three key stakeholder panels were defined: patients with previous experience of intestinal surgery, allied healthcare professionals (including nurses and dietitians), and medical professionals (including abdominal surgeons and perioperative clinicians). Medical and allied healthcare professionals were considered as two separate panels throughout the study to ensure that potentially diverging perspectives were captured. During each phase of the study, participants were recruited via national and international organizations as well as through social media.

### Standardized postoperative pathway: accelerating recovery after ileostomy closure [^112qMe9G]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this study we evaluated the outcome of a standardized enhanced recovery program in patients undergoing ileostomy closure.

Methods

Forty-two patients underwent ileostomy closure by a single surgeon and were managed by a standardized postoperative care pathway. On the first postoperative day, patients received oral analgesia and a soft diet. Discharge was based on standard criteria previously published for laparoscopic colectomy patients. Results were recorded prospectively in an Institutional Review Board-approved database, including demographics, operative time, blood loss, complications, length of stay, and readmission data.

Results

The median operative time and blood loss were 60 minutes and 17.5 mL, respectively, and median hospital stay was 2 days. Twenty-nine patients (69 percent) were discharged by postoperative Day 2. The complication rate was 23.8 percent; complications included prolonged postoperative ileus (n = 3), early postoperative small-bowel obstruction (n = 1), mortality not related to ileostomy closure (n = 1), minor bleeding (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1), incisional hernia (n = 1), diarrhea (n = 1), dehydration (n = 1). The 30-day readmission rate was 9.5 percent (n = 4). Two patients had reoperation within 30 days for small-bowel obstruction and a wound infection.

Conclusions

Ileostomy closure patients managed with postoperative care pathways can have a short hospital stay with acceptable morbidity and readmission rates.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^116zzqBS]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for small bowel obstruction, more specifically with respect to setting of care, EAST 2012 guidelines recommend to consider admitting patients with SBO to a surgical service, as this has been shown to be associated with a shorter length of stay and lower mortality as compared with admission to a medical service.

### Global, regional, and national burden of disease analysis on paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction in adults aged 65 and over from 1990 to 2021, with projections for 2030: a global burden of disease study 2021 analysis [^115KPJHU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, age-standardized DALYs and mortality exhibited a downward trend, likely attributed to innovations in medical technologies and improvements in treatment methods, which have significantly reduced the severity of bowel obstruction and its complications. For example, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, which emphasize early postoperative feeding, have substantially reduced the risk of postoperative bowel obstruction. Similarly, the risk of postoperative bowel obstruction is significantly reduced by early ileostomy closure after colorectal surgery. Furthermore, the application of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose membranes has demonstrated efficacy in preventing postoperative small bowel obstruction in patients.

Our findings demonstrate that regions with rapid economic development exhibit the highest incidence and prevalence of intestinal obstruction. Decomposition analysis revealed that population growth plays a vital role in increasing disease burden in these regions than in lower-SDI areas. The increased burden of bowel obstruction in high-SDI regions is closely associated with the synergistic effects of obesity, malignancy, and comorbidities. Obesity exacerbates the risk of both mechanical and paralytic bowel obstruction through multiple mechanisms, including increased intra-abdominal pressure, chronic low-grade inflammation, and disruption of enteric nervous system signaling. Malignancies, particularly colorectal and ovarian cancers, cause obstruction by compressing the lumen and spreading peritoneally. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy increase the risk of adhesive bowel obstruction further. Furthermore, surgical interventions in cancer survivors exacerbate adhesion formation, which remains a major cause of bowel obstruction. Meanwhile, comorbidities such as diabetes induce autonomic neuropathy that impairs gut motility, while polypharmacy, including opioids and calcium channel blockers, significantly increases the risk of motility disorders. Opioids, which are widely used for pain management in North America, Australia, and Central Europe, have been extensively investigated and proven to inhibit gastrointestinal motility and increase the incidence of paralytic ileus. However, the lower DALYs and mortality rates in these regions are primarily attributed to advanced medical infrastructure and the implementation of established therapeutic strategies.

### Small bowel complications after sacrocolpopexy: a case series [^114zqPPC]. Urogynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Ileus and small bowel obstructions are known but rare complications associated with minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy that can result in variable management.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of ileus or small bowel obstructions after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.

Study Design

This was a multicenter retrospective case series of postoperative ileus or small bowel obstruction after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Demographics, clinical, surgical, and complication characteristics were manually abstracted. Descriptive statistics were performed via SPSS along with associative and comparative analyses.

Results

Ileus or small bowel obstruction was diagnosed in 2.5%, 95% CI = 1.8,3.3%, of all minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy cases across institutions. Presentation for small bowel complication ranged from 1 to 2,432 days after surgery with 70% presenting within 14 days of the index surgery. Remoteness from the surgery was associated with whether the index team was involved in the management of the bowel complication. Patients who were conservatively managed were admitted for a significantly shorter amount of time with a mean length of stay of 4.52 (± 3) days compared to 10.3 (± 6, P < 0.001) days for those who were surgically managed.

Conclusions

Small bowel complication is a known rare risk following minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Conservative management resolves the majority of cases and should be considered to reduce the risk of surgical morbidity or disruption of the mesh. Given that multiple clinical teams may encounter and manage these complications, our study highlights the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion and thoughtful communication about these events.

### Meta-analysis of the risk of small bowel obstruction following open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery [^114GfQHV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

One of the potential advantages of laparoscopic compared with open colorectal surgery is a reduction in postoperative bowel obstruction events. Early reports support this proposal, but accumulated evidence is lacking.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of randomized clinical trials and observational studies by searching the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases from 1990 to August 2015. The primary outcomes were early and late postoperative bowel obstruction following laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery. Both ileus and bowel obstruction were defined as a postoperative bowel obstruction. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed, and a random-effects model was used to account for the heterogeneity among the studies.

Results

Twenty-four randomized clinical trials and 88 observational studies were included in the meta-analysis; 106 studies reported early outcome and 12 late outcome. Collectively, these studies reported on the outcomes of 148392 patients, of whom 58133 had laparoscopic surgery and 90259 open surgery. Compared with open surgery, laparoscopic surgery was associated with reduced rates of early (odds ratio 0·62, 95 per cent c.i. 0·54 to 0·72; P < 0·001) and late (odds ratio 0·61, 0·41 to 0·92; P = 0·019) postoperative bowel obstruction. Weighted mean values for early postoperative bowel obstruction were 8 (95 per cent c.i. 6 to 10) and 5 (3 to 7) per cent for open and laparoscopic surgery respectively, and for late bowel obstruction were 4 (2 to 6) and 3 (1 to 5) per cent respectively.

Conclusion

The reduction in postoperative bowel obstruction demonstrates an advantage of laparoscopic surgery in patients with colorectal disease.

### Impact of a procalcitonin-based algorithm on the quality of management of patients with uncomplicated adhesion-related small bowel obstruction assessed by a textbook outcome: a multicenter cluster-randomized open-label controlled trial [^112q5xEt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients achieving the textbook outcome, defined as patients either appropriately undergoing surgery (ischemia confirmed at operation ± resection) or appropriately managed conservatively (no need for surgery) with no major postoperative complications (Clavien–Dindo ≥ 3) and a medical length of stay < 5 days (defined as the time at which the patient is medically eligible for discharge), with no postoperative consultation, rehospitalization, or reoperation within 90 days after randomization. The textbook outcome is defined as that proposed by Kolfschoten for colon cancer resection. The primary endpoint will be analyzed by an open-label design. The centers will record all cases of (i) no readmission, (ii) no unplanned consultation for nausea, vomiting, and/or the absence of gas and/or stool, (iii) no hospitalization, (iv) no reoperation, and (v) no recurrence that could occur after the patient's discharge and before the two visits scheduled in the protocol (1 and 3 months). If the quality of the completion of the primary endpoint is not sufficient after monitoring of the first-recruited patients, the adjudication committee will be contacted.

The secondary endpoints are the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-month recurrence rates, defined as a new episode of adhesion-related small bowel obstruction, the EVAN G score to evaluate patient satisfaction at postoperative month 1, the Clavien and CCI scores to assess morbidity evaluated after the patient's discharge at postoperative month 1, the hospital length of stay, defined as the interval between admission to the emergency department and discharge from the ward, and the cumulative length of stay, defined as the total number of days of hospitalization related to ASBO at postoperative month 12.

Sample size

According to Williams, Ellozy, Fraser et al. 60% of patients were successfully managed without the algorithm. Ryan also reported that 62% of patients were not readmitted or hospitalized for ASBO at postoperative day 90. With our local data showing successful management with the algorithm in 78% of patients and assuming a 62% success rate without the algorithm, with a two-sided alpha risk of 5%, a power of 80%, an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.015, 16 anticipated clusters (centers), a coefficient of variation of 0.15 for cluster size, 372 patients would need to be recruited. By assuming 5% of patients lost to follow-up, 414 patients need to be enrolled.

### Reducing the burden of postoperative ileus: evaluating and implementing an evidence-based strategy [^114qVDai]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus remains a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Over the last decade, several advances in both medical and surgical therapies have been made to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative ileus. Despite these advances, though, the incidence of ileus remains high. This narrative review focuses on interventions aimed to prevent and treat postoperative ileus while presenting a step-by-step process for implementation of an evidenced-based strategy.

Methods

A literature search was performed using Medline/PubMed, and articles related to postoperative ileus were identified. The bibliographies of all retrieved articles were reviewed to obtain additional articles of relevance.

Results

There are many factors that can influence gastrointestinal recovery that can be categorized as management-, drug-, or surgery-related. While several strategies exist to improve gastrointestinal recovery, few have been shown to reduce length of hospital stay. These strategies are described here, along with a structured approach organized by preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative considerations.

Conclusions

Postoperative ileus is associated with a significant clinical and economic burden to the health care system. Strategies such as the development of a multidisciplinary team and the creation of a multimodal protocol are encouraged with continuous quality assurance to assess outcomes at the local level.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116nHuvB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and even some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. The present paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines to evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added paragraphs on prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

Methods

The guideline was written under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was performed prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusion.

Recommendations

Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is unsure, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric, or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes. When operative treatment is required, a laparoscopic approach may be beneficial for selected cases of simple ASBO. Younger patients have a higher lifetime risk for recurrent ASBO and might therefore benefit from application of adhesion barriers as both primary and secondary prevention.

Discussion

This guideline presents recommendations that can be used by surgeons who treat patients with ASBO. Scientific evidence for some aspects of ASBO management is scarce, in particular aspects relating to special patient groups. Results of a randomized trial of laparoscopic versus open surgery for ASBO are awaited.

### Study protocol evaluating the use of bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^1114pg23]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

Postoperative ileus is the most commonly observed morbidity following ileostomy closure. Studies have demonstrated that the defunctionalized bowel of a loop ileostomy undergoes a series of functional and structural changes, such as atrophy of the intestinal villi and muscular layers, which may contribute to ileus. A single-centre study in Spain demonstrated that preoperative bowel stimulation via the distal limb of the loop ileostomy decreased postoperative ileus, length of stay and time to gastrointestinal function.

Method

A multicentre randomized controlled trial involving patients from Canadian institutions was designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative bowel stimulation before ileostomy closure on postoperative ileus. Stimulation will include canalizing the distal limb of the ileostomy loop with an 18Fr Foley catheter and infusing it with a solution of 500 mL of normal saline mixed with 30 g of a thickening agent (Nestle © Thicken-Up ©). This will be performed 10 times over the 3 weeks before ileostomy closure in an outpatient clinic setting by a trained Enterostomal Therapy nurse. Surgeons and the treating surgical team will be blinded to their patient's group allocation. Data regarding patient demographics, and operative and postoperative variables, will be collected prospectively. Primary outcome will be postoperative ileus, defined as an intolerance to oral food in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of obstruction, that either requires nasogastric tube insertion or is associated with two of the following on or after post-operative day 3: nausea/vomiting; abdominal distension; and the absence of flatus. Secondary outcomes will include length of stay, time to tolerating a regular diet, time to first passage of flatus or stool and overall morbidity. A cost analysis will be performed to compare the costs of conventional care with conventional care plus preoperative stimulation.

Discussion

This manuscript discusses the potential benefits of preoperative bowel stimulation in improving postoperative outcomes and outlines our protocol for the first multicenter study to evaluate preoperative bowel stimulation before ileostomy closure. The results of this study could have considerable implications for the care of patients undergoing ileostomy closure.

### Early postoperative small bowel obstruction after appendectomy because of staples in pediatric patients [^116ReP2c]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO) is an important complication of laparoscopic appendectomy in children, resulting in readmission and potential for intestinal loss. We reviewed our experience with early postoperative SBO.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing an appendectomy with subsequent SBO from 2014 to 2018. Patients were excluded if a concurrent gastrointestinal procedure was done during the appendectomy, or if they had previous abdominal surgery.

Results

Of 793 appendectomies performed at our institution during the study period, only six patients met the inclusion criteria for our chart review (7.6 SBO per 1000 appendectomies), ranging in age from 4 to 19 y. Four patients had uncomplicated appendicitis, and all underwent laparoscopic appendectomy within 24 h. Five were discharged postoperatively, with one patient remaining hospitalized for persistent ileus. Median time to representation with SBO was 7 d (range, 2–37). Three patients had indications for urgent exploration and underwent re-exploration shortly after presentation. Three patients underwent initial nonoperative management, but subsequently, all patients failed to progress and required operative exploration. Staples were found to be the culprit lesion in four of six patients, all of which notably initially presented with uncomplicated appendicitis, with two patients found to have ischemic bowel at the time of exploration.

Conclusions

Although rare, pediatric patients with SBO soon after laparoscopic appendectomy should be considered for early operative management, especially if the appendicitis was uncomplicated. When staples are used for appendectomy, stray staples should not be left as they can serve as a nidus for obstruction.

### Who would avoid severe adverse events from nasointestinal tube in small bowel obstruction? A matched case-control study [^115uji6A]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SBO is a common cause of emergency department visits, and there is a dilemma in the management of SBO: conservative treatment may result in delayed intestinal ischemia and necrosis; However, unnecessary emergency surgery could increase the incidence of severe complications and the formation of new adhesive bands. With the development of instruments, the usage of NITs could lead to a reduction of intestinal pressure in the early-stage and avoid intestinal ischemia, thus transforming the case from acute SBO to subacute SBO.

Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of nasointestinal decompression through NITs for SBO; Similarly, in our center, NITs have confirmed therapeutic efficacy for SBO. The patients who have success with NITs decompression could avoid electrolyte imbalance and postoperative pneumonia, with a shortened length of hospital-stay and decreased hospital costs. However, in patients with tumors, the success rate of NITs insertion was significantly lower, which may owe to peritoneal metastasis that triggered mechanical intestinal obstruction in several portions, cannot be alleviated by single-one obstructive site decompression. Meanwhile, tumors accounted for 61.5% of the causes of obstruction in the SAE group and 19.5% in the non-SAE group (p = 0.002). These results highlight that patients with malignant bowel obstruction could barely benefit form NITs insertion. HAN's study showed that the cure rate of NITs for benign ileus was significantly higher than that for malignant ileus (38.1% vs. 6.7%, respectively; p = 0.01). As a result of a poor nutritional status, systemic deterioration and the multiple portions obstructions found in malignant small bowel obstruction, hampered the strategies for the treatment. Only 30–48.9% of the patients can be successfully treated, as mentioned in the literature. Patients with malignant bowel obstruction should be carefully selected for treatment with the aim of improving their quality of life.

### Postoperative complications of colectomy and J-pouch with ileostomy versus without ileostomy in children with inflammatory bowel diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UfjJA]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and outcomes

Two authors (IO and NT) extracted patient frequencies using a predesigned and piloted data abstraction sheet in Excel V.14.7.7. The extracted information included study details (design, location of the study and sample size), patient demographics including age and gender, disease diagnosis, average or median follow-up, and surgical details including the procedure implemented.

The primary clinical outcome was the occurrence of anastomosis leaks. The secondary outcomes included the occurrence of small bowel obstruction, pouchitis, strictures and fistula (duodenal, enterovaginal or rectovaginal) at the designated follow-up period, as defined by the study author.

A diagnosis of stricture at the anastomosis was confirmed on examination and/or endoscopy, and anastomotic leak was defined as evidence of leak on imaging (such as pelvic fluid collection adjacent to the anastomosis) or at reoperation. Small bowel obstruction was defined by a contrast-enhanced X-ray or a CT result, demonstrating findings for obstruction, in tandem with abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distention, nausea, and/or decreased or absent flatus and/or stool. Late obstruction was defined as occurring after closure of the covering ileostomy. Rectovaginal fistula could have been detected on MRI, after restorative proctocolectomy. Pouchitis was primarily diagnosed clinically by symptoms of increased stool frequency, abdominal pain, and fecal incontinence and endoscopically confirmed, and was defined as inflammation in the pouch in a symptomatic patient who may have been prescribed antibiotics in the year prior to follow-up.

Assessment of risk of bias within studies

Two reviewers (NT and IO) independently reviewed each study. The validated Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria were used to assess the quality of the studies. Items assessed included clearly stated aims, inclusion and representativeness of patients, reliable prospective data collection, appropriate and unbiased endpoints, sufficient follow-up period, follow-up loss, adequate study size calculation, contemporary groups (to address historical bias), baseline equivalence and adequate statistical analysis. Items 1 through 7 apply to non-comparative, while items 8 though 12 for comparative studies. Records were given scores of 0 through 2 for 12 criteria of bias assessment. The maximum (ideal) global score is 24 for comparative studies and is 16 for non-comparative studies.

### Management of type 1 (acute) intestinal failure [^112Q6ivV]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

PN should be considered in patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition and meet either of the following criteria: (1) inadequate or unsafe oral and/or enteral nutritional intake or (2) a non-functional, inaccessible or perforated gastrointestinal tract. Patients with a functioning/accessible gastrointestinal tract should always be considered for enteral nutrition first, if they do not meet their nutritional needs by mouth. Efforts should be made to establish enteral feeding where possible, but this should not significantly delay provision of nutrition support. In some cases, it may be appropriate to use PN as a bridge to enteral nutrition.

Typical surgical indications for type 1 IF include postoperative paralytic ileus, small bowel obstruction, bowel perforation and anastomotic leak. Malnourished patients and those who have undergone extensive surgery, especially involving bowel content spillage, may be suitable for early PN. Other non-surgical indications include obstruction related to stricturing Crohn's disease, cancer-related bowel obstruction, mucositis post chemotherapy/radiation therapy, graft versus host disease and multiorgan failure in the critically ill patient.

### A case-control study of risk factors for ileus and bowel obstruction following benign gynecologic surgery [^114ur2h7]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors leading to the development of postoperative ileus and small-bowel obstruction (SBO) after benign gynecologic surgery.

Methods

In a multicenter case-control study across the United States, data were examined from women with International Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes who underwent benign gynecologic surgery between January 2005 and June 2010 and subsequently developed an ileus or SBO. Each patient with ileus or SBO was matched to 2 control women who underwent the same benign gynecologic procedure but did not develop ileus or SBO.

Results

During the study period, 144 cases and 288 controls were identified. By conditional multivariate logistic regression, risk factors for ileus or SBO included cystotomy (odds ratio [OR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48–51.47), concomitant bowel surgery (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.18–15.78), perioperative transfusion (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.44–5.95), and lysis of adhesions (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.03–2.83).

Conclusion

Lysis of adhesions, concomitant bowel surgery, and perioperative complications such as blood transfusion and cystotomy were found to be risk factors for the development of ileus and/or SBO after benign gynecologic surgery.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: do international guidelines agree? [^114e13p3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

The search strategy returned 8352 citations. Of these, 8339 did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 13 articles for review. One article was rejected as the guidelines from the publishing body had been updated and were included in the search. Seven further articles were identified through a combination of recursive searching and Google Scholar. Therefore, 19 guidelines were included in the full review (Table 1).

Table 1
Guidelines on the management of left-sided MBO

Nature of guidelines

The majority of guidelines originated from Europe (n = 10, 53%), with a smaller number from North America (n = 4, 21%), Australia (n = 2, 11%) and Asia (n = 2, 11%). One guideline was a global consensus (Fig. 2 a). Most commonly, the guidelines formed part of a colorectal cancer guideline (n = 9, 47%) and less commonly a large bowel obstruction guideline (n = 3, 16%) or an emergency surgery guideline (n = 1, 5%). Six guidelines (32%) specifically focused on the management of MBO (Fig. 2 b).

Fig. 2
Properties of the reviewed guidelines. a Origin of the guidelines. b Context of the guidelines

Surgery

Eight of the guidelines (42%) recommended emergency surgery as the only treatment for left-sided MBO. A further nine guidelines (47%) recommended patients be offered emergency surgery or stenting as a bridge to surgery (Table 2). Of the 17 guidelines recommending emergency surgery, 6 (35%) recommended primary resection with or without anastomosis as the treatment of choice, one guideline (6%) recommended an emergency colostomy and 4 guidelines (24%) suggested multiple surgical options including defunctioning stoma (ileostomy, caecostomy, transverse loop colostomy, loop sigmoid colostomy), subtotal colectomy or primary resection (Fig. 3). Six guidelines (35%) gave no details regarding what operation should be performed. Only one guideline suggested that patients with left-sided MBO undergoing surgical intervention should be managed in an intensive care unit. Two guidelines made reference to laparoscopic surgery; one guideline suggesting it had a limited role and one guideline not recommending its use except in selected cases in specialist centres.

### Review of the pathophysiology and management of postoperative ileus [^115HhGsQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Investigations in the pathophysiology and treatment of postoperative ileus continue to evolve. Bowel rest is no longer a mandatory component of postoperative recovery. Tolerance of enteral nutrition and normalization of the abdominal examination are more accurate indications of the resolution of postoperative ileus than passage of flatus or first bowel movement. A multimodal "fast track" recovery approach incorporated into a clinical pathway provides a more rapid return of intestinal function and shortened hospital stay in patients undergoing major, uncomplicated gastrointestinal surgery.

### Postoperative ileus-an ongoing conundrum [^1163msgF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus is common and is a major clinical problem. It has been widely studied in patients and in experimental models in laboratory animals. A wide variety of treatments have been tested to prevent or modify the course of this disorder.

Purpose

This review draws together information on animal studies of ileus with studies on human patients. It summarizes some of the conceptual advances made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie paralytic ileus. The treatments that have been tested in human subjects (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and their efficacy are summarized and graded consistent with current clinical guidelines. The review is not intended to provide a comprehensive overview of ileus, but rather a general understanding of the major clinical problems associated with it, how animal models have been useful to elucidate key mechanisms and, finally, some perspectives from both scientists and clinicians as to how we may move forward with this debilitating yet common condition.

### Adhesion-related small bowel obstruction [^115NRjHk]. Colorectal Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Postoperative adhesions are the commonest cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), a frequent surgical emergency. Adhesion obstruction is potentially lethal and a crucial aspect in management is to differentiate whether there is actual, or impending, small bowel ischaemia and therefore a need for emergency surgery. There are no completely accurate imaging or haematological techniques to exclude the requirement for surgery. Modern computerized tomography (CT) has been a significant advance in noninvasive assessment of SBO and may demonstrate the cause of the obstruction and suggest the presence of bowel ischaemia. It is important to note that adhesions may not be the cause of SBO in a patient who has had abdominal surgery. Recurrent cancer, an obstructive colon lesion in the presence of an incompetent ileocaecal valve, an occult hernia, small bowel arterial or venous ischaemia, amongst others may be the cause and CT may elucidate some of these causes and help plan management. Increasing utilization of laparoscopic surgery may reduce the extent and incidence of adhesions and laparoscopic adhesiolysis, in experienced hands, may be successful in managing acute obstruction or alternatively as a planned procedure when the obstruction has resolved. Adhesive SBO remains a common surgical emergency and there is no substitute for repeated examination by a surgeon, capable of performing a laparotomy, in the optimal management of these complex patients.

### A core outcome set for clinical studies of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^111xi2Br]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a very common emergency surgical condition; obstruction is the indication for surgery in just under half of the 25 000 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in the UK. SBO is the cause of death in 3.5 people per 100 000 population each year in high income countries and 1.8 deaths per 100 000 population in low and middle income countries. The commonest cause of mechanical SBO is adhesions, usually from previous abdominal surgery, accounting for around 50% of all cases. Postoperative adhesions may affect up to 3.5% of patients by 20 years. Adhesive SBO (ASBO) typically manifests with cramping abdominal pain, abdominal distension, intolerance to enteral intake and bilious vomiting. Patients are at risk of dehydration, renal failure, infection including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition and poor wound healing. One third of cases of ASBO require treatment with surgical intervention; the remaining cases settle with supportive management only. Morbidity and mortality following treatment remains significant with reported mortality of 7.2% at 90 days post surgery.

The quality of randomised data and outcomes reporting in ASBO is limited. The most recent trials in ASBO focus on the use of water soluble contrast agents, or laparoscopic surgery. Given the challenges of delivering research in this area, it is important to maximise the utility of studies to support the literature. As studies focus on interventions in different parts of the patient pathway, the outcomes selected for reporting may differ, meaning that some key outcome data is not addressed. A systematic review of outcomes reported in trials and observational studies of ASBO identified 45 different outcome measures used across 51 studies. Such variation in reporting of outcomes results in difficulties comparing results between studies and in implementation of research findings into clinical practice.

One approach to reducing variation in practice is to develop a "Core Outcome Set" (COS). A core outcome set is an agreed, standardised set of outcomes that should be measured, as a minimum, in all studies in a particular health area. A COS is not intended to be restrictive as additional outcomes may be reported. Ensuring consistency in reported outcomes is important as thorough outcome reporting might avoid issues such as reporting bias, maximise information from each study, and reduce heterogeneity in subsequent meta‐analysis.

The aim of this study was to develop a COS for use in studies reporting outcomes of adult patients undergoing treatment for adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO).

Materials and methods

Study design and data collection

The study was a single-institution retrospective review of patients treated in the General Surgery Department of Trieste's University Hospital. Ethical committee approval was obtained according to the Italian law, and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. Were considered for inclusion in the study all the patients aged 18 or older, admitted to our institution from January 2018 to the end of December 2018 with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation or bowel obstruction, and in which the indication to emergency surgical procedure was considered as first choice of treatment or as salvage surgery when previous non-operative management failed (e.g. antibiotic treatment, percutaneous drainage, stenting). Non-traumatic gastrointestinal perforation included gastroduodenal perforation due to peptic ulcer disease, small bowel perforation, and colonic perforation with both neoplastic (colorectal cancer) and non-neoplastic (perforated diverticular disease) etiology. Bowel obstruction included small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions, tumors, gallstone ileus or foreign bodies, and large bowel obstruction caused by colorectal cancer. Exclusion criteria were: patients < 18, bowel obstruction or perforation as a complication of abdominal wall hernias, bowel obstruction or perforation which occurred as a postoperative complication, multiple simultaneous surgical procedures (more than one CPT code), missing preoperative or postoperative data.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^113Z5mFY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall 30-day morbidity was similar in both groups (12.8% vs. 30.6%, p = 0.062). There were very few non-POI morbidities, and only 2 reoperations (1 small bowel obstruction; 1 anastomotic leak). Thirty-day emergency room visits (6.4% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.97) and re-admissions (4.3% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.95) were also similar (Table 4). Among patients evaluated for postoperative bowel function, median LARS scores were similar between both groups (1-month LARS: 32.0 (11.8–38.3) vs. 34.0 (31.5–39.0), p = 0.34; 3-month LARS: 28.4 (15.8–32.0) vs. 31.0 (23.0–39.0), p = 0.26).

### Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction: a prospective evaluation in 242 consecutive abdominal operations [^116QfbPs]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction is a common but poorly defined complication of abdominal surgery. This prospective cohort study was undertaken to examine a reproducible definition of early postoperative small-bowel obstruction, determine its incidence, evaluate potential risk factors for its development, and delineate management strategies.

Methods

Two hundred twenty-five patients undergoing 242 consecutive abdominal operations during a 9-month period were prospectively evaluated from the time of admission until Postoperative Day 30. Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction was present if, within 30 days of surgery, all of the following criteria were met after the return of intestinal function: development of crampy abdominal pain, vomiting, and radiographic findings consistent with intestinal obstruction. Patients with early postoperative small-bowel obstruction were followed up until discharge or reexploration. All patients with early postoperative small-bowel obstruction were initially treated with nasogastric decompression.

Results

Two hundred forty-two abdominal procedures were performed on 119 males and 123 females aged 13 to 98 (mean, 51) years. Ulcerative colitis (n = 70), malignancy (n = 59), and Crohn's disease (n = 41) were the most common diagnoses. One hundred nineteen patients (49.2 percent) had undergone previous laparotomy, and 45 patients (18.6 percent) had previously been diagnosed with intestinal obstruction. Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction occurred in 23 cases (9.5 percent). Patients with and without early postoperative small-bowel obstruction were similar with respect to diagnosis, preoperative immunosuppression, previous laparotomy or obstruction, surgery performed, and time to return of intestinal function. Twenty episodes (87 percent) resolved with nasogastric decompression alone; all but one resolved within six days or less. Three patients (13 percent) required relaparotomy; one required small-bowel resection. Two of three patients whose symptoms did not resolve with six days of nasogastric decompression required reexploration. There were no deaths and no major morbidity.

Conclusions

Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction, defined by an objective data set, was observed in 9.5 percent of cases. No independent risk factors predisposing to early postoperative small-bowel obstruction were identified. Early postoperative small-bowel obstruction was safely and effectively managed by nasogastric decompression in the majority of cases, with low morbidity and no mortality. In general, reexploration should be reserved for those patients whose symptoms do not resolve within six days of nasogastric decompression.

### Assessing outcomes in laparoscopic vs open surgical management of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^117YR8Qg]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel obstruction is typically managed nonoperatively; however, refractory small bowel obstructions or closed loop obstructions necessitate operative intervention. Traditionally, laparotomy has long been the standard operative intervention for lysis of adhesions of small bowel obstructions. But as surgeons become more comfortable with minimally invasive techniques, laparoscopy has become a widely accepted intervention for small bowel obstructions. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of laparoscopy to open surgery in the operative management of small bowel obstruction.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of operative small bowel obstruction cases at a single academic medical center from June 2016 to December 2019. Data were obtained from billing data and electronic medical record for patients with primary diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Postoperative outcomes between the laparoscopic and open intervention groups were compared. The primary outcome was time to return of bowel function. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, VTE, and reoperation rate.

Results

The cohort consisted of a total of 279 patients with 170 (61%) and 109 (39%) patients in the open and laparoscopic groups, respectively. Patients undergoing laparoscopic intervention had overall shorter median return of bowel function (4 vs 6 days, p = 0.001) and median length of stay (8 vs 13 days, p = 0.001). When stratifying for bowel resection, patients in the laparoscopic group had shorter return of bowel function (5.5 vs 7 days, p = 0.06) and shorter overall length of stay (10 vs 16 days, p < 0.002). Patients in the laparoscopic group who did not undergo bowel resection had an overall shorter median return of bowel function (3 vs 5 days, p < 0.0009) and length of stay (7 vs 10 days, p < 0.006). When comparing surgeons who performed greater than 40% cases laparoscopically to those with fewer than 40%, there was no difference in patient characteristics. There was no significant difference in return of bowel function, length of stay, post-operative mortality, or re-admission laparoscopic preferred or open preferred surgeons.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic intervention for the operative management of small bowel obstruction may provide superior clinical outcomes, shorter return of bowel function and length of stay compared to open operation, but patient selection for laparoscopic intervention is based on surgeon preference rather than patient characteristics.

### Early postoperative small bowel obstruction [^114oYALX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Early postoperative small bowel obstruction (EPSBO) is a distinct clinical entity that is often difficult to differentiate from postoperative ileus.

Methods

A literature search was performed for articles dealing with early postoperative small bowel obstruction using Medline and Google.

Results and Conclusion

When bowel function does not return within 5 days after surgery, causes of persistent ileus should be excluded and treated. Most instances of mechanical EPSBO can be treated expectantly for at least 10–14 days with almost no risk of bowel strangulation. Some causes of obstruction (for example herniation at a laparoscopic trocar site) require early reintervention, whereas in other cases (such as radiation enteritis, carcinomatosis) reintervention may be deferred indefinitely. Many episodes of EPSBO resolve without the cause being elucidated.

### Postoperative ileus following major colorectal surgery [^116Bf5NY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative ileus (POI) is characterized by delayed gastrointestinal recovery following surgery. Current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical interventions and methodological challenges was reviewed to inform modern practice and future research.

Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was performed using search terms related to ileus and colorectal surgery. All RCTs involving an intervention to prevent or reduce POI published between 1990 and 2016 were identified. Grey literature, non-full-text manuscripts, and reanalyses of previous RCTs were excluded. Eligible articles were assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias.

Results

Of 5614 studies screened, 86 eligible articles describing 88 RCTs were identified. Current knowledge of pathophysiology acknowledges neurogenic, inflammatory and pharmacological mechanisms, but much of the evidence arises from animal studies. The most common interventions tested were chewing gum (11 trials) and early enteral feeding (11), which are safe but of unclear benefit for actively reducing POI. Others, including thoracic epidural analgesia (8), systemic lidocaine (8) and peripheral μ antagonists (5), show benefit but require further investigation for safety and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

POI is a common condition with no established definition, aetiology or treatment. According to current literature, minimally invasive surgery, protocol-driven recovery (including early feeding and opioid avoidance strategies) and measures to avoid major inflammatory events (such as anastomotic leak) offer the best chances of reducing POI.

### HAnd suture versus STApling for closure of loop ileostomy (HASTA trial): results of a multicenter randomized trial (DRKS00000040) [^114qLNUK]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of the HASTA trial was to compare hand suture versus stapling loop ileostomy closure in a randomized controlled trial.

Background

Bowel obstruction is one of the main and the clinically and economically most relevant complication following closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection. The best surgical technique for closure of loop ileostomy has not been defined yet.

Methods

HASTA trial is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled surgical trial with 2 parallel groups to compare hand suture versus stapling for closure of loop ileostomy. The primary endpoint was the rate of bowel obstruction within 30 days after ileostomy closure.

Results

A total of 337 randomized patients undergoing closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection because of rectal cancer in 27 centers were included. The overall rate of postoperative ileus after ileostomy closure was 13.4%. Seventeen of 165 (10.3%) patients in the stapler group and 27 of 163 (16.6%) in the hand suture group developed bowel obstruction within 30 days postoperatively [odds ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89–3.31 = 0.10]. Duration of surgical intervention was significantly shorter in the stapler group (15 minutes; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis of potential risk factors did not reveal any significant correlation with development of postoperative ileus. Rate of anastomotic leakage (stapler: 3.0%, hand suture: 1.8%, P = 0.48) did not differ significantly as well as all other secondary endpoints.

Conclusions

Hand-sewn anastomosis versus stapler ileo-ileostomy for ileostomy closure are equally effective in terms of postoperative bowel obstruction, with stapler anastomosis leading to a shorter operation time. Postoperative ileus after ileostomy reversal remains a relevant complication.

Recommendation: If small bowel obstruction occurs within the first 24 h of the index operation then re‐laparoscopy or re‐laparotomy will often identify a definitive cause that requires surgical correction. If proven mechanical small bowel obstruction is identified later and it fails to settle with non‐operative management, then surgery should be considered, accepting that there is an increased risk of small bowel injury.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

In the patient who has not recovered bowel function postoperatively, mechanical obstruction needs to be considered as a possible cause. This may be due to adhesions but an incisional hernia, internal herniation through a mesenteric defect and parastomal hernia should always be considered. In cases of a laparoscopic index procedure, port site hernias (especially with a 12‐mm port) can and do occur early in the postoperative period. Surgery is nearly always necessary in cases where there is an obstructed hernia, in order to prevent strangulation and bowel injury. CT scanning will clearly diagnose most of these cases. In cases where there is an equivocal obstruction administration of water‐soluble contrast and an abdominal film after 4 h may help to determine if there is a complete mechanical obstruction. Proven mechanical small bowel obstruction that fails to settle with non‐operative management is likely to require surgery. After 2 weeks, the degree of inflammation and adherence particularly after open surgery may make reoperation very hazardous due to the risk of visceral injury, in particular small bowel. In this situation nasogastric drainage, TPN and careful operative planning is necessary (daytime CEPOD activity, adequate time, direct consultant supervision or dual consultant operating). A second opinion from an experienced colleague is always useful and should be sought when there is uncertainty. A discussion with a regional intestinal failure unit is also an option.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^114iKks5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

However no randomized controlled trial comparing open to laparoscopic adhesiolysis exists up to date, and both the precise indications and specific outcomes of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for adhesive SBO remain poorly understood. The only RCT on laparoscopic adhesiolysis assessed the incidence of chronic abdominal pain after randomization to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment during diagnostic laparoscopy and it failed to demonstrate any significant differences in terms of pain or discomfort.

Although data from a retrospective clinical controlled trial suggest that laparoscopy seems feasible and better in terms of hospital stay and mortality reduction.

In a retrospective analyisis Grafen et al. compared the outcomes of laparoscopic management of ASBO to both exploratory laparotomy and secondary conversion to open surgery. 93 patients were divided into successful laparoscopy (71%), secondary conversion (26%) and primary laparotomy (3%). The first group had more simple adhesions, fewer prior operations, lower ASA score, shortest operative time, as was the duration of both intensive care unit and hospital stay; moreover they were younger and had a shorter duration of SBO prior to their operation. Despite that mortality was 6%, regardless of operative technique. The authors, moreover, found that patients who only had prior appendectomy or cholecystectomy could all be managed laparoscopically without need for secondary conversion; on the other hand a prolonged ileus (mean 4.3 days) with progressive abdominal distension and a higher number or more demanding previous operations address to a primary laparotomy. Finally the reasons for converting to open adhesiolysis were: inadequate laparoscopic control due to intestinal distension, extensive adhesions, iatrogenic perforations and resection of necrotic segments.

When deciding between an open or laparoscopic approach, the first consideration is that the surgeon be trained and capable of performing advanced laparoscopy.

With regards to patient selection, individuals with an acute small bowel obstruction and peritonitis, free air or gangrenous bowel requiring an emergent operation are best managed with a laparotomy. Patients without peritonitis who do not resolve with nonoperative management should be considered for laparoscopic adhesiolysis. In these cases, it is important to consider the bowel diameter, degree of abdominal distention, and location of the obstruction (ie, proximal or distal). Suter et al. found that a bowel diameter exceeding 4 cm was associated with an increased rate of conversion: 55% versus 32%. Patients with a distal and complete small bowel obstruction have an increased incidence of intraoperative complications and increased risk of conversion. Patients with persistent abdominal distention after nasogastric intubation are also unlikely to be treated successfully with laparoscopy.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: systematic review [^116Wh8ao]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified 6 potential predictors associated strongly with the need for surgery (5 positively and 1 negatively; 3 were derived from CT), and 3 associated strongly with ischaemia at surgery (all positively; 2 were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that appear to display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Postoperative ileus: it costs more than you expect [^114awCCS]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical impact of postoperative ileus (POI) after colectomy is difficult to quantify financially because of administrative coding limitations. Accurate data are important to allow pharmaco-economic analysis of methods aimed at reducing POI. The aim of this study was to assess the financial impact of POI for the 30-day episode of care for colectomy.

Study Design

We reviewed all colectomy patients at our institution from July 2007 to June 2008. Primary POI was defined as more than three episodes of emesis with return to NPO diet status and/or reinsertion of nasogastric tube; secondary POI was associated with intraabdominal complications. Readmission for gastrointestinal failure was defined as delayed POI (no radiologic or surgical identification of small bowel obstruction). All other complications requiring readmission were grouped together for analysis. Data reviewed included primary admission and readmission costs, reason for readmission, intervention, index and total length of stay, narcotic use, time to ambulation, and time to enteral feeds.

Results

One hundred eighty-six colectomies were eligible for analysis, with 45 cases (38 primary and 7 secondary) of POI during the index admission. The total cost was significantly higher for patients with POI ($16,612 versus $8,316; p < 0.05). However, readmission costs were not statistically different for delayed POI and other complications ($3,546 versus $6,705).

Conclusions

POI occurred in 24% (84% primary) of colectomy patients and disproportionately affected cost at the index admission. Interestingly, delayed POI was similar in cost to readmission for other serious adverse surgical complications.

### Early versus late preventive ileostomy closure following colorectal surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111C5inE]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most preventive ileostomy following colorectal surgery requires a closure procedure. The intervals between primary surgery and ileostomy closure remain controversial.

Objective

This study aimed to compare early versus late closure of preventive ileostomy following colorectal surgery.

Data Source

A systematic literature search was performed in conference papers, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the Clinicaltrials.gov database.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials published through October 2019 comparing early versus late closure of ileostomy following colorectal surgery were selected.

Main Outcome Measures

Morbidity, leak of the primary anastomosis, reoperation, surgical site infection, small-bowel obstruction/postoperative ileus, total operative time, and postoperative length of hospital stay were measured. Results were synthesized using meta-analysis and were rated as firm or weak evidence by trial sequential analysis.

Results

A total of 6 randomized controlled trials were included. Firm evidence from trial sequential analysis demonstrated that the early closure of ileostomy after colorectal surgery reduced the incidence of small-bowel obstruction/postoperative ileus and required less total operative time, but increased the incidence of surgical site infection, compared with late closure of ileostomy; postoperative length of hospital stay tended to be longer with early versus late closure of ileostomy. Weak evidence showed that there was no difference between early and late closure in morbidity, reoperation, or leak of the primary anastomosis.

Limitations

The study was limited by some evidence rated as weak from trial sequential analysis, combined analysis of small-bowel obstruction and postoperative ileus, and exclusion of the influence of chemo- or radiotherapy.

Conclusions

In selected patients, early closure of ileostomy after colorectal surgery can be considered, with a lower incidence of postoperative small-bowel obstruction/postoperative ileus and less total operative time, but a relatively high surgical site infection rate. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020160989.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^115TAVpB]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative bowel stimulation on the development of postoperative ileus (POI) after loop ileostomy closure.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (NCT025596350) including adult (≥ 18 years old) patients who underwent elective loop ileostomy closure at 7 participating hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a centralized computer-generated sequence with block randomization to either preoperative bowel stimulation or no stimulation (control group). Bowel stimulation consisted of 10 outpatient sessions within the 3 weeks prior to ileostomy closure and was performed by trained Enterostomal Therapy nurses. The primary outcome was POI, defined as an intolerance to oral food in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of obstruction, on or after postoperative day 3, that either (a) required nasogastric tube insertion; or (b) was associated with two of the following: nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension, or the absence of flatus.

Results

Between January 2017 and November 2020, 101 patients were randomized, and 5 patients never underwent ileostomy closure; thus, 96 patients (47 stimulated vs. 49 control) were analyzed according to a modified intention-to-treat protocol. Baseline characteristics were well balanced in both groups. The incidence of POI was lower among patients randomized to stimulation (6.4% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.034; unadjusted RR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.078–0.87). Stimulated patients also had earlier median time to first flatus (2.0 days (1.0–2.0) vs. 2.0 days (2.0–3.0), p = 0.025), were more likely to pass flatus on postoperative day 1 (46.8% vs. 22.4%, p = 0.022), and had a shorter median postoperative hospital stay (3.0 days (2.0–3.5) vs. 4.0 days (2.0–6.0), p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Preoperative bowel stimulation via the efferent limb of the ileostomy reduced POI after elective loop ileostomy closure.

### Urgent abdominal re-explorations [^113zHTMa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The most common cause of obstructions in postoperative period is adhesive lesions which is one of the common problems in general surgery. The risk of adhesions exists throughout the lifetime following laparotomies. Rate of early ileus following abdominal operations is 0.86%. However, difference approaches for the treatment of early ileus exist among surgical centers. Thus, UAR-requiring cases because of intestinal obstructions vary in a broad scale between 1/4 and 2/3 of all UARs. Immediate diagnosis, intubation of GIS and efficient decompression are required for a better prognosis in patients who developed intestinal obstruction. However, it is difficult to decide when to operate the patients whose clinical condition did not improve in time. Ellozy et al, suggested that an immediate operation should not be considered in these patients since 87% of postoperative small bowel obstructions can be reversed by nasogastric decompression. In our study, 4 cases (4.93%) who received postoperative early ileus diagnosis and who did not respond positively to medical treatment received UAR on the 4th day on an average (3th, 4th, 4th and 5th days). Obstruction was brid in 3 (75%) out of these four patients who survived following RL. The fourth patient who received a RL on the 5th day required a broad resection because of intestinal torsion, and this patient died in postoperative period. Postoperative ileus might not have recovered and a large intestinal segment necrosed during surgical exploration might have observed as in the case with this patient, although the patient received identical decompression and medical treatment with what the other three patients have received. However, that one out of every three patients who did not respond positively to conservative surgery can die in postoperative period should be kept in mind. On the other hand, surgery performed earlier than it is required may be risky for patients who are likely to respond positively to medical treatment.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for colorectal surgery, more specifically with respect to postoperative ileus prevention, ASCRS/SAGES 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering sham feeding (chewing gum for ≥ 10 minutes 3–4 times daily) after colorectal surgery for reduced length of hospital stay and small improvements in gastrointestinal recovery.

### Small bowel obstruction: what to look for… [^112EdT5A]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical syndrome for which effective treatment depends on a rapid and accurate diagnosis. Despite advances in imaging and a better understanding of small bowel pathophysiology, SBO is often diagnosed late or misdiagnosed, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive approach that includes clinical findings, patient history, and triage examinations such as plain abdominal radiography will help the clinician develop an individualized treatment plan. When an SBO is accompanied by signs of strangulation, emergent surgical treatment is advised. If surgery cannot be performed immediately or if a partial obstruction is suspected, then a more detailed radiologic work-up is needed. The imaging techniques used subsequently vary according to the initial findings. If a low-grade partial obstruction is suspected, volume-challenge enteral examinations such as enteroclysis and computed tomographic (CT) enteroclysis are preferred. If a complete or high-grade obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional studies such as ultrasonography or multidetector CT are used to exclude strangulation. An algorithmic approach to imaging is proposed for the management of SBO to achieve accurate diagnosis of the obstruction; determine its severity, site, and cause; and assess the presence of strangulation. Radiologists have a pivotal role in clinical decision making in cases of SBO by providing answers to specific questions that significantly affect management.

Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction after pelvic surgery — ileus and bowel obstruction: Postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction, including postoperative ileus (POI) and small bowel obstruction (SBO), is a concerning but rare outcome for pelvic surgeons and requires immediate active management. Two large retrospective reviews reported the rates of POI and SBO for women undergoing posthysterectomy vaginal vault surgery with uterosacral ligament suspension were 0.1% and 0.8%, respectively and with sacrocolpopexy (open and robotic-assisted) was 5.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Risk factors for SBO include pelvic adhesive disease, perioperative transfusion, concurrent appendectomy, operating time > 170 min, non-white race, uterine weight > 250 g, prior abdominal or pelvic surgery and increasing age. Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation with or without oral antibiotics has not been shown to reduce POI or SBO in women undergoing vaginal, laparoscopic, or open hysterectomy.

### Risk factors for prolonged postoperative ileus in colorectal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1134JXXj]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) represents a frequent complication following colorectal surgery, affecting approximately 10–15% of these patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the perioperative risk factors for PPOI development in colorectal surgery.

Methods

The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO, and LILACS databases were searched, without language or time restrictions, from inception until December 2018. The keywords used were: Ileus, colon, colorectal, sigmoid, rectal, postoperative, postoperatory, surgery, risk, factors. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Jadad scale were used for bias assessment, while the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for quality assessment of evidence on outcome levels.

Results

Of the 64 studies included, 42 were evaluated in the meta-analysis, comprising 29,736 patients (51.84% males; mean age 62 years), of whom 2844 (9.56%) developed PPOI. Significant risk factors for PPOI development were: male sex (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.25–1.63), age (MD 3.17; 95% CI 1.63–4.71), cardiac comorbidities (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.19–2.00), previous abdominal surgery (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.19, 1.75), laparotomy (OR 2.47; 95% CI 1.77–3.44), and ostomy creation (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.04–1.98). Included studies evidenced a moderate heterogeneity. The quality of evidence was regarded as very low-moderate according to the GRADE approach.

Conclusions

Multiple factors, including demographic characteristics, past medical history, and surgical approach, may increase the risk of developing PPOI in colorectal surgery patients. The awareness of these will allow a more accurate assessment of PPOI risk in order to take measures to decrease its impact on this population.

### Small bowel obstruction after transoral robotic surgery [^111QxCu3]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Head and neck surgery is not often considered a risk factor for intestinal ileus and small bowel obstruction. However, many of these patients may have had prior abdominal surgery, a known risk factor for small bowel obstruction, and may be at risk for bowel obstruction after a surgical procedure of the head and neck.

Methods

We present a case describing a patient who, after undergoing transoral robotic surgery, experienced delayed postoperative ileus and eventual small bowel obstruction requiring exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection.

Results

Although the patient required total parenteral nutrition for several days, he eventually was able to resume tube feeds, and after several months was able to tolerate an oral diet.

Conclusion

Although uncommon complications of head and neck surgery, intestinal ileus and small bowel obstruction can develop as the result of stress/inflammation, postoperative narcotic pain medication, and prior abdominal surgery.

### Enteroscopic treatment of early postoperative small bowel obstruction [^114PgF8W]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Early postoperative small bowel obstruction (EPSBO) occurs in 1% of patients undergoing laparotomy and has a mortality rate exceeding 17%. Nasogastric (NG) decompression is successful in avoiding reoperation in 73% of patients. Repeat laparotomy has been recommended when obstruction does not resolve after 14 days of NG decompression. We report four patients with EPSBO treated successfully with push enteroscopy after failed NG decompression.

Methods

Four patients who failed NG decompression underwent push enteroscopy instead of repeat laparotomy. EPSBO was diagnosed if obstruction lasting more than 14 days developed after initial resolution of postoperative ileus, high NG output persisted postoperatively for 21 days in the absence of sepsis, or radiographic signs of obstruction persisted. Small bowel series or computed tomography were utilized when radiographic assessment was necessary. The Olympus SIF 100 push enteroscope was introduced with an overtube using topical anesthesia and intravenous sedation. After maximal insertion, the enteroscope was withdrawn without evacuation of insufflated air. NG tubes were placed after enteroscopy and patients were followed clinically. Flatus, defecation, and tolerance of a general diet defined resolution of EPSBO.

Results

EPSBO resolved 24 to 36 h following enteroscopy, and all patients were discharged on general diets 48 h after return of bowel function. Readmission has not been necessary during 18- to 30-month follow-up.

Conclusions

Our experience suggests that push enteroscopy is successful in treating EPSBO and should be considered prior to reoperation. Push enteroscopy may eliminate the hazards of repeat laparotomy and reduce the morbidity, treatment cost, and lengthy hospital stays associated with this uncommon surgical complication.

### Laparoscopic versus open surgery in small bowel obstruction [^114GepBW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute intestinal obstruction is one of the most common surgical emergencies. The small bowel obstruction (SBO) is the site of obstruction in most patients (76%) and adhesions are the most common etiology (65%). Laparoscopy in SBO has no clear role yet as it may have a therapeutic and diagnostic function. In some settings laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted surgery is considered feasible and convenient more than conventional surgery for SBO; however little is known if laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted surgery is more suitable with respect to open surgery for patients with SBO.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review is to assess whether laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted surgery is feasible and safe for acute SBO, and whether laparoscopic and laparoscopy-assisted surgery present advantages compared to open surgery in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched for published randomised and prospective controlled clinical trials without language restrictions using the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and EMBASE (1980 onwards).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and non randomised controlled prospective trials evaluating laparoscopic and laparoscopy-assisted surgery versus traditional open surgery for acute SBO were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We conducted the review according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Colorectal Group as well, using Review Manager 5 to conduct the review.

Main Results

No published or unpublished randomised controlled trials or prospective controlled clinical trials comparing laparoscopy with open surgery for patients with SBO were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Although data from retrospective clinical controlled trials suggest that laparoscopy seems feasible and better in terms of hospital stay and mortality reduction, high quality randomised controlled trials assessing all clinically relevant outcomes including overall mortality, morbidity, hospital stay and conversion are needed.

### Pathogenesis and clinical and economic consequences of postoperative ileus [^116UQ4dv]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Postoperative ileus is a preventable disease with surprising economic consequences. Understanding the triad of dysmotility in conjunction with an enhanced recovery program improves patient outcome, decreases length of stay in hospital, and lowers the cost. Alvimopan and other investigational promotility medications can help attain these goals. Surgeons should avoid labeling all postoperative abdominal distention as ileus, which not only prevents timely diagnosis and treatment of early postoperative small bowel obstruction or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction but also increases patient morbidity and mortality.

### Methods for decreasing postoperative gut dysmotility [^112Ptw9E]. The Lancet: Oncology (2003). Medium credibility.

Postoperative disturbances of gastrointestinal function (postoperative ileus) are among the most significant side-effects of abdominal surgery for cancer. Without specific treatment, major abdominal surgery causes a predictable gastrointestinal dysfunction which endures for 4–5 days and results in an average hospital stay of 7–8 days. Ileus occurs because of initially absent and subsequently abnormal motor function of the stomach, small bowel, and colon. This disruption results in delayed transit of gastrointestinal content, intolerance of food, and gas retention. The aetiology of ileus is multifactorial, and includes autonomic neural dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, narcotics, gastrointestinal hormone disruptions, and anaesthetics. In the past, treatment has consisted of nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and observation. Currently, the most effective treatment is a multimodal approach. Median stays of 2–3 days after removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy) are now achievable. Recent discoveries have the potential to significantly reduce postoperative ileus in patients with cancer who have had abdominal surgery.

### A core outcome set for clinical studies of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^111wd5v7]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study reports the development of a COS for studies investigating the treatment of patients with ASBO. It has included international engagement at all phases, and ensured representation from key stakeholders, especially patients, in all aspects. The COS for adults with ASBO presented here should therefore be widely acceptable and relevant across a range of healthcare systems.

The COS for ASBO highlights some of the differences between what is typically reported, and what is considered of importance to patients and their clinicians. Outcomes related to rates of surgical intervention, small bowel strangulation, and small bowel resection are reported in approximately 35%, 14%, and 6% of studies respectively, but rated consistently as highly important here. These are important markers of quality of care; surgery when indicated carries the risk of additional morbidity, while ischaemia and small bowel resection, that may be more commonly associated with delays to timely surgical intervention, are also associated with significantly increased rates of mortality. Such outcomes are therefore relevant to patients and clinicians alike.

Markers of gastrointestinal recovery are also important in the context of ASBO, not just in the context of postoperative recovery but also in conservative management of ASBO. Time to resolution of bowel function was reported in 18% of prior studies, resumption of solid diet in 6%, and resolution in 2%. These are all considered patient important factors in recently published qualitative work addressing recovery after abdominal surgery. Failure of gastrointestinal recovery in both conservative and postoperative settings may result in malnutrition, that is associated with poor outcomes in ASBO. A recent randomised trial examining operative approach in ASBO assessed several gastrointestinal recovery items as secondary outcomes, perhaps reflecting an evolving clinical recognition of this important part of a patient's recovery. In addition, fluid balance was also considered an important outcome. This has not been identified from any previous studies, but its relationship to dehydration, kidney injury, and general nutrition, is clinically apparent.

### Alvimopan [^111uspbN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of alvimopan in the management of postoperative ileus was evaluated in 6 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies: 5 U.S. studies (Studies 1 to 4 and 6) and 1 non-U.S. study (Study 5). Patients 18 years of age or older undergoing partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis for colorectal or small bowel disease, total abdominal hysterectomy, or radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (in this procedure, resected segments of bowel are used for reconstruction of the urinary tract) under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive oral doses of alvimopan 12 mg or matching placebo. The initial dose was administered at least 30 minutes and up to 5 hours prior to the scheduled start of surgery for most patients, and subsequent doses were administered twice daily beginning on the first postoperative day and continued until hospital discharge or a maximum of 7 days. There were no limitations on the type of general anesthesia used, but intrathecal or epidural opioids or anesthetics were prohibited.

All patients in the U.S. studies were scheduled to receive intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia. In the non-U.S. study, patients were scheduled to receive opioids either by intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia or bolus parenteral administration (intravenous or intramuscular). In all studies, there was no restriction on the type of opioid used or the duration of intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia. A standardized accelerated postoperative care pathway was implemented: early nasogastric tube removal (before the first postoperative dose); early ambulation (day following surgery); early diet advancement (liquids offered the day following surgery for patients undergoing bowel resection and by the third day following surgery for patients undergoing radical cystectomy; solids by the second day following surgery for patients undergoing bowel resection and by the fourth day following surgery for patients undergoing radical cystectomy), as tolerated.

### Bowel obstruction: a narrative review for all physicians [^1151bNNn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Bowel obstruction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality accounting for nearly 30,000 deaths and more than $3 billion per year in direct medical costs; it is responsible for approximately 15% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the USA and ~ 20% of cases needing acute surgical care.

Bowel obstruction etiology is based on a mechanical intrinsic luminal obstruction or extrinsic compression (Table 1). Adynamic ileus and colonic pseudo-obstruction are caused by a lack of enteric propulsion. Colonic pseudo-obstruction and an adynamic ileus can be caused by drugs, trauma, postoperative period, metabolic disturbance, and other different basis.

Table 1
Causes of bowel obstruction in adults

Others*: carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, intussusception, ischemic stenosis, radiation stenosis, postanastomotic stenosis, gallstones, foreign bodies, bezoars

In 90% of cases, small bowel obstruction is caused by adhesions, hernias, and neoplasms. Adhesive small bowel obstruction represents 55–75% of small bowel obstruction cases while hernias and small bowel tumors account for the remainder. Large bowel obstruction is provoked by cancer in about 60% of cases; volvulus and diverticular disease are responsible of other 30%. Other various causes (carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, etc.) account for the remaining 10–15% of bowel obstructions. This review focuses on the management of bowel obstruction excluding duodenal mechanical obstruction to be better included in gastric outlet obstruction entity.

### Manual repositioning of the small bowel and omentum prevents early postoperative small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a propensity score-matched study [^1139RRBQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

From a mechanistic standpoint, one plausible explanation is that incomplete return of the small bowel to its physiological position after surgery — particularly following prolonged Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positioning — may promote non-anatomical alignment, predisposing to angulation, kinking, or localized stasis. Indeed, in some cases where reoperation was necessary, we observed the small bowel to have migrated and adhered to the upper abdomen in a configuration that could easily explain obstructive symptoms. Restoring bowel orientation may also enhance postoperative peristalsis and reduce subclinical inflammation contributing to ileus.

Its preventive effect persisted regardless of intra-abdominal infection or stoma creation, suggesting that Technique R may directly prevent EPSBO by reducing bowel malposition or minimizing postoperative adhesions and kinking.

Interestingly, we also noted a significantly lower incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses in the group that underwent Technique R. The mechanism by which Technique R may reduce the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess remains speculative. Repositioning the bowel and omentum to their natural anatomical position may help preserve physiological peristalsis and reduce abnormal angulation or folding of the bowel, which could otherwise lead to localized fluid stasis. Additionally, minimizing unnatural contact between the bowel and raw peritoneal surfaces may reduce subclinical inflammation, thereby lowering the risk of abscess formation. Although these explanations are hypothetical, they are consistent with the protective effect observed in our multivariate analysis. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to validate these observations. While this may partially explain the reduction in EPSBO, multivariate analysis suggested that Technique R itself independently contributed to this outcome. This lends further support to the notion that restoring bowel anatomy is not merely an adjunctive step but may actively prevent both mechanical and inflammatory complications. Although diabetes mellitus is known to impair postoperative bowel motility via autonomic neuropathy, it was not a significant risk factor for EPSBO in our cohort. This may reflect the relatively low prevalence of poorly controlled diabetes and the standardized perioperative glycemic management in our institutions.

5.4.3 Preoperative anaemia

Preoperative anaemia (Hb < 130 g/L in men and < 120 g/L in women) increases the risk of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis, correction of which is associated with improvement in outcomes including risk of intestinal obstruction and haemorrhage, anastomotic leak, postoperative perforation, pulmonary oedema and septic complications such as pneumonia and wound infection. Perioperative red cell transfusion in patients undergoing ileocaecal resection has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications including an anastomotic leak, ileus, intra-abdominal abscess, wound dehiscence and thrombotic events. Anaemia should be recognised and treated early, preferably with oral or intravenous iron and other haematinics as needed, and avoiding blood transfusion where possible.

### Small bowel obstruction [^113V7zqS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

### Bowel stimulation before loop ileostomy closure to reduce postoperative ileus: a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^117HH3z6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

All other preoperative tests and interventions were similar between stimulation and control group patients. Patients were explained that they could cross-over to the control group arm (or withdraw from the study altogether) at any point from the intervention start date until their surgery, without exceptions.

Loop ileostomy closures were performed in a similar fashion at all sites. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia and preoperative intravenous antibiotics were given. A parastomal/elliptical incision was used for all cases, while a midline incision was performed when necessary to complete a difficult adhesiolysis or if intraoperative complications occurred. Anastomotic technique (stapled vs. hand-sewn) and skin closure (primary vs. secondary purse-string) was left to the discretion of the treating surgeon. Epidurals were not used, and patient-controlled analgesia was administered as per individual institutional protocols.

Postoperatively, all patients were managed within a site-specific ERP. While certain ERP elements differed between sites, all patients were given regular diet by postoperative day 1. Discharge criteria were similar at all hospitals: (1) tolerating oral diet; (2) no overt abdominal distension; (3) adequate pain control; (4) absence of fever or signs of deep surgical site infections; (5) ambulating at their baseline level; and (6) passage of flatus or stool.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was postoperative ileus (POI), defined as an intolerance to oral food in the absence of clinical or radiological signs of obstruction, on or after postoperative day three, that either (a) required nasogastric tube insertion; or (b) was associated with two of the following: nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension, or the absence of flatus. Assessment of POI was performed by a trained, blinded assessor at each site. Patients were instructed not to reveal their group allocation to their surgeon, the postoperative team, or the POI assessor. Secondary outcomes included postoperative length of stay, time to first passage of flatus, overall 30-day morbidity, and 30-day readmission. In a subgroup of Quebec sites (three hospitals), bowel function, using the LARS (Low Anterior Resection Syndrome) Score, was also evaluated as an exploratory secondary outcome in patients whose index operation was a restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^113qPxV4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background of WSES guidelines

Adhesive small bowel obstruction requires appropriate management with a proper diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. Indication and length of Non Operative treatment and appropriate timing for surgery may represent an insidious issue.

Delay in surgical treatment may cause a substantial increase of morbidity and mortality. However repeated laparotomy and adhesiolysis may worsen the process of adhesion formation and their severity. Furthermore the introduction and widespread of laparoscopy has raised the question of selection of appropriate patients with ASBO good candidate for laparoscopic approach. On the other hand, several adjuncts for improving the success rate of NOM and clarifying indications and timing for surgery are currently available, such as hyperosmolar water soluble contrast medium.

No consensus has been reached in diagnosing and managing the patients with ASBO and specific and updated guidelines are lacking.

We carried out an extensive review of the English-language literature and found that there was little high-level evidence in this field, and no systematically described practical manual for the field. Most importantly, there are no standardized diagnostic criteria and therapeutic management guidelines for ASBO, therefore, we would like to establish standards for these items. The Bologna Guidelines include evidence-based medicine and reflect the international consensus obtained through earnest discussions among professionals in the field on 1–3 July, 2010, at the Belmeloro Convention Center, Bologna, Italy.

We aimed to validate and refine the first version of the guidelines, hypothesizing that a model, incorporated in a treatment algorithm, would be predictive, would prevent delayed management of strangulation and would be successfully improved.

Therefore in 2013 the guidelines have been revised and updated by the WSES Working Group on ASBO with the development of diagnosis and treatment evidence-based algorithms (Figure 1, Figure 2).

Evidence-based Algorithm for Diagnosis and Assessment of ASBO.

Evidence-based Algorithm for Management and Treatment of ASBO.

Furthermore a customary management can help to standardize care throughout a district, a region, or a state satisfying the corporate governance requirements of "clinical efficacy" and "economic efficiency" with the results of improved outcomes and decreased costs.

Improvement of performance is a mainstay of any practice management guideline.

### Partial small bowel obstruction and ileus following gynecologic laparoscopy [^115TR4Mv]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the incidence and management of partial small bowel obstruction (PSBO) and ileus after gynecologic endoscopy.

Design

Internet-based cross-sectional survey (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).

Material and Methods

An online survey was distributed to gynecologic surgeons to collect information about frequency and management of ileus and PSBO after gynecologic laparoscopy.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 58 physician respondents, 22 had managed at least 1 patient with PSBO or ileus after gynecologic laparoscopy. A total of 12 PSBOs and 14 patients experiencing ileus were identified for an overall incidence of 0.036%. Patients showed symptoms between 1 and 20 days postoperatively and had findings ranging from hypoactive (45%), to normal (30%), to hyperactive (25%) bowel sounds. Plain film radiographs (75%) were the most commonly used diagnostic modality followed by computed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen. Most patients were initially managed with intestinal rest and nasogastric tube placement for 2 to 16 days. Fifty percent required a second procedure, with reported findings that included intestinal herniation (n = 7), bowel injury (n = 4), volvulus (n = 2), and urinoma (n = 1).

Conclusion

Ileus and PSBO are rare findings after gynecologic laparoscopy. We identified 26 cases, most of which were initially managed conservatively. The majority of patients ultimately required a second operation. Surgeons should have a high index of suspicion when managing a patient with PSBO or ileus after gynecologic laparoscopy. Given the findings from the second procedures, CT scans would seem to be the diagnostic procedure of choice.

### Relationship between duration of preoperative symptoms and postoperative ileus for small bowel obstruction [^111oXoDy]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Factors associated with postoperative ileus and increased resource utilization for patients who undergo operative intervention for small-bowel obstruction are not extensively studied. We evaluated the association between total duration of preoperative symptoms and postoperative outcomes in this population.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent surgery for small-bowel obstruction (2013–2016). Clinical data were recorded. Total duration of preoperative symptoms included all symptoms before operation, including those before presentation. Primary endpoint was time to tolerance of diet. Secondary endpoints included length of stay, total parenteral nutrition use, and intensive care unit admission. Association between variables and outcomes was analyzed using univariable analysis, multivariable Poisson modeling, and t-test to compare groups.

Results

Sixty-seven patients were included. On presentation, the median duration of symptoms before hospitalization was 2 d (range 0–18 d). Total duration of preoperative symptoms was associated with time to tolerance of diet on univariable analysis (Pearson's moment correlation: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.028–0.5, P = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, ascites was correlated with time to tolerance of diet (P < 0.01), but total duration of preoperative symptoms (P = 0.07) was not. Length of stay (Pearson's correlation: 0.24, 95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.47, P = 0.07) was not statistically different in patients with longer preoperative symptoms. Symptom duration was not statistically associated with intensive care unit (P = 0.18) or total parenteral nutrition (P = 0.3) utilization.

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate that preoperative ascites correlated with increased time to tolerance of diet, and duration of preoperative symptoms may be related to postoperative ileus.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^111kFYjL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

- Consensus Development

In the Consensus Conference on July 2 nd 2010, the expert panel had two meetings and a further plenary session. The aim was to focus and clarify the diagnostic and therapeutic issues of the complex management of ASBO, leading to new clinical guidelines, updated and including a wide range of recommendations, for diagnosis, non operative management, timing for surgery, type of surgery and prevention strategies of peritoneal post-operative adhesions causing small bowel obstruction. Based on the review of the current literature, a panel of worldwide experts were invited to participate in the development of the new guidelines. All members of the expert panel were asked to define ASBO. For each step of diagnosis, treatment (conservative and surgical) and prevention of ASBO, one expert summarized the current state of the art. From the evidence based presentations and the reported statements as well as from the results of the relevant literature review, a preliminary document with the resume of the Consensus Statements and Recommendations was compiled. For every key statement, the discussion within the expert panel with the involvement of the audience, took place until a 100% consensus within the group and the audience was achieved. Comments from the audience were collected and partly included in the manuscript. In September 2010 the expert panel had further contacts for discussing and finalize the final version of the text of the guidelines recommendations. The final version of the guidelines was approved by all experts in the panel as well as the experts from the audience who played an active role in the discussion during the Consensus Conference. Each "chapter" consists of a key statement with a grade of recommendation (GoR) followed by a commentary to explain the rationale and evidence behind the statement.

- Literature Searches and Appraisal

We have used the Oxford hierarchy for grading clinical studies according to levels of evidence. Literature searches were aimed at finding randomized (i.e. level 1b evidence) or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (i.e. level 2b evidence). Alternatively, low-level evidence (mainly case series and case reports; i.e. level 4 evidence) was reviewed. Studies containing severe methodological flaws were downgraded. For each intervention, we considered the validity and homogeneity of study results, effect sizes, safety, and economic consequences.

Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library until December 2010. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. We also paid attention to studies that were referenced in systematic reviews or previous guidelines.
