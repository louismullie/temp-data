## Question

highlight key points from the most recent ESICM guidelines on prbc transfusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the key points from the most recent ESICM guidelines on PRBC transfusion for critically ill adults, including thresholds, exceptions, implementation, and supporting evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the overarching principle and whether ESICM is indeed aligned with a restrictive strategy. Then, I should verify the default hemoglobin thresholds and the single-unit approach. Next, I will examine condition-specific exceptions, especially acute coronary syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiac surgery, septic shock, and isolated troponin elevation. After that, I need to check exclusions such as active hemorrhage and neurologic injury. Finally, I will review implementation tactics, cost and equity considerations, and the strength of evidence before summarizing practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. The most recent critical care transfusion guidance aligned with ESICM favors a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy over a permissive one for most critically ill adults, supported by multiple high-quality randomized trials and professional society concordance, including the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and CHEST 2025, which explicitly note alignment with ESICM positions [^114NyeT5] [^113jZCo3] [^116xGRas].

> I need to verify the default hemoglobin thresholds. For most hemodynamically stable critically ill adults without active bleeding, transfusion is generally indicated when hemoglobin is less than 7–8 g/dL, with a single-unit transfusion followed by reassessment of hemoglobin and clinical status. Permissive thresholds of 8.5–10 g/dL are not favored in this population, and this approach reduces transfusion exposure without increasing mortality or major complications [^115vCwxP] [^117MhV1G] [^114NyeT5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are important exceptions. For acute coronary syndrome, I should confirm that a more liberal threshold is advised. The panel suggests against a restrictive strategy in ACS, favoring a hemoglobin trigger around 9–10 g/dL because restrictive approaches show a trend toward higher mortality and more cardiac events, even if not always statistically significant in pooled analyses; thus, a higher transfusion threshold is reasonable in ACS pending further definitive data [^113oKquS] [^112t3WoB].

> Next, I should review gastrointestinal bleeding. Wait, let me verify whether restrictive still applies here. Yes, even in upper GI bleeding, a restrictive strategy with a 7–8 g/dL threshold is recommended, as it reduces transfusions without worsening outcomes. This is a strong recommendation with moderate certainty and remains consistent with ESICM-aligned guidance [^117UDYnf] [^115P2Ynd].

> I will now examine cardiac surgery. The recommendation is conditional but supports a restrictive approach perioperatively, with pooled data showing no significant differences in mortality or major adverse events while substantially reducing transfusion utilization. This aligns with ESICM and STS positions and is reflected as a conditional recommendation with moderate certainty [^1152JWPk] [^113HeqjC] [^116xGRas].

> Let me consider septic shock carefully. The panel suggests against adding permissive transfusion thresholds to usual care in septic shock with end-organ hypoperfusion, noting that contemporary sepsis care already incorporates restrictive transfusion practices; TRISS and related analyses show no mortality benefit to higher thresholds, reinforcing a restrictive stance in this subgroup [^115XdJh7] [^116569xx].

> But wait, what about isolated troponin elevation without ischemia. I should double-check the certainty here. The recommendation is conditional and very low certainty, suggesting that a restrictive strategy is reasonable in the absence of overt ACS, given the lack of direct evidence; this is an area where clinical judgment and ECG/context are essential [^112jLpmm] [^115P2Ynd].

> I need to ensure I clearly state exclusions. These recommendations do not apply to patients with active hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability, nor to those with acute neurologic injury or trauma, where different thresholds and resuscitation priorities apply; in such cases, transfusion decisions should be driven by ongoing blood loss and perfusion rather than hemoglobin alone [^115P2Ynd] [^114UkkQr].

> Next, I should review implementation details. Let me verify the single-unit approach and reassessment cadence. The optimal implementation is restrictive with one RBC unit at a time and prompt hemoglobin rechecking, which in trials reduced units transfused by about 50%. This single-unit strategy should be suspended during uncontrolled bleeding and resumed once bleeding is controlled, with explicit attention to patient values and shared decision-making when transfusion conflicts with beliefs [^114UkkQr] [^117MhV1G].

> I will now examine systems-level strategies. Proven implementation tools include academic detailing, audit and feedback, standardized order sets, and computerized decision support. Institutions should also track transfusion practices via hospital databases to identify variation and guide improvement efforts, all of which facilitate adoption of restrictive protocols [^1176J5rV] [^1158niym].

> Let me think about cost and equity. A restrictive strategy reduces transfusions by roughly 36–50% and costs by about 33%, with per-unit hospital costs estimated near $207 and total costs up to $1,183. Equity may improve because restrictive approaches conserve scarce blood and reduce exposure risks, particularly relevant in resource-limited settings or during shortages [^114UWg1R] [^114oEeiD].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence and limitations. The overarching restrictive recommendation is strong with moderate certainty for most critically ill adults, but several subgroup recommendations are conditional and based on low to very low certainty, including ACS, septic shock, cardiac surgery, and isolated troponin elevation; ongoing trials like TRICS-IV in younger cardiac surgery patients may refine thresholds further [^114NyeT5] [^115P2Ynd] [^116xGRas].

> Putting this together, my practical, ESICM-aligned approach is as follows: use a restrictive default with a 7–8 g/dL trigger and single-unit transfusions with reassessment for most stable critically ill adults. Raise to 9–10 g/dL in ACS. Maintain restrictive thresholds in GI bleeding, cardiac surgery, and septic shock. Avoid applying these thresholds during active hemorrhage or in acute neurologic injury. And embed implementation supports to sustain practice change and minimize unnecessary exposure and cost [^114NyeT5] [^117Rzn5x] [^117UDYnf] [^1152JWPk] [^115XdJh7] [^115P2Ynd] [^114UkkQr].

The most recent ESICM guidance emphasizes a **restrictive transfusion strategy** for most critically ill adults, with a default threshold of **7–8 g/dL** [^114NyeT5] and transfusion of one unit at a time with reassessment [^114UkkQr]. For acute coronary syndrome, a higher threshold of **9–10 g/dL** is suggested due to potential harm with restrictive strategies [^113oKquS] [^112t3WoB]. Active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, and acute brain injury are exceptions where higher thresholds or immediate transfusion may be warranted. The guidance also highlights patient blood management, single-unit transfusion, and reassessment to minimize unnecessary transfusions and complications [^117MhV1G] [^114UWg1R].

## General principles and overarching recommendations

- **Restrictive transfusion strategy**: ESICM recommends a restrictive transfusion strategy for most critically ill adults, targeting hemoglobin levels of 7–8 g/dL [^notfound].

- **Single-unit transfusion**: Transfuse one unit at a time, followed by reassessment of hemoglobin and clinical status [^114UkkQr].

- **Patient blood management**: Emphasizes minimizing unnecessary transfusions, optimizing anemia management, and implementing blood conservation strategies [^1158niym].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and transfusion thresholds

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended transfusion threshold** | **Rationale and evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| General critically ill adults | Hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL | Strong recommendation based on multiple RCTs showing no increase in mortality or adverse outcomes with restrictive strategies [^114NyeT5] [^117MhV1G] |
| Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) | Hemoglobin < 9–10 g/dL | Conditional recommendation due to potential harm with restrictive strategies, including increased risk of myocardial infarction and mortality [^113oKquS] [^112t3WoB] |
| Acute gastrointestinal bleeding | Hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL | Strong recommendation; restrictive strategy reduces transfusions without increasing adverse outcomes [^117UDYnf] |
| Cardiac surgery | Hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL | Conditional recommendation; restrictive strategy is safe and reduces transfusion exposure [^1152JWPk] [^113HeqjC] |
| Septic shock | Hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL | Conditional recommendation; restrictive strategy does not worsen outcomes [^115XdJh7] [^116569xx] |
| Isolated troponin elevation | Hemoglobin < 7–8 g/dL | Conditional recommendation with very low certainty of evidence [^112jLpmm] |

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

- **Active bleeding and hemodynamic instability**: Higher thresholds or immediate transfusion may be warranted based on clinical judgment [^114UkkQr].

- **Acute brain injury**: Higher thresholds may be considered to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the brain.

- **Patient values and beliefs**: Clinicians should engage in shared decision-making, especially for patients with religious or personal objections to transfusion [^114UkkQr].

---

## Implementation strategies

- **Clinical decision support systems**: Implement computerized alerts and order sets to guide appropriate transfusion decisions [^1176J5rV].

- **Education and training**: Provide ongoing education to healthcare providers on restrictive transfusion practices and patient blood management [^1158niym].

- **Audit and feedback**: Regularly monitor transfusion practices and provide feedback to clinicians to improve adherence to guidelines [^1176J5rV].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of restrictive transfusion strategies

Benefits include **reduced transfusion-related adverse events** — such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and infections [^117MhV1G] — and **lower costs** due to fewer transfusions and shorter lengths of stay [^114UWg1R]. Risks are **minimal**; restrictive strategies have not shown significant increases in mortality or major adverse outcomes in most critically ill populations [^117MhV1G].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Restrictive strategy**: Hemoglobin threshold of 7–8 g/dL for most critically ill adults [^117Rzn5x].

- **ACS exception**: Higher threshold of 9–10 g/dL for acute coronary syndrome [^117Rzn5x].

- **Single-unit transfusion**: Transfuse one unit at a time with reassessment [^114UkkQr].

- **Patient blood management**: Emphasize anemia management and blood conservation strategies [^1158niym].

- **Clinical judgment**: Apply exceptions for active bleeding, hemodynamic instability, and acute brain injury [^115P2Ynd].

---

The most recent ESICM guidance supports a **restrictive transfusion strategy** for most critically ill adults, with specific exceptions for acute coronary syndrome and other special circumstances. This approach aims to balance the benefits and risks of transfusion, optimize patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs [^114UWg1R].

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^113HeqjC]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac surgery — restrictive vs permissive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies show no significant difference in 30-day mortality (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.95–1.32); hospital length of stay did not differ (MD, −0.02 days; 95% CI, −0.19 to +0.15 days), and ICU length of stay favored the permissive strategy (MD, 0.12 days; 95% CI, 0.03–0.21 days). Mazer et al enrolled 5,243 patients and reported that a restrictive strategy led to 20% less patients receiving RBC transfusions. Across seven trials including 8,208 patients, there were no important differences in outcomes or adverse events, and considering the 40% lower number of RBC units transfused to patients in the restrictive group, a restrictive strategy is the preferred approach. Representative pooled estimates include 30-d mortality 1.12 (0.95–1.32) with 8 more per 1,000 (3 fewer-21 more), infections 1.07 (0.94–1.22) with 6 more per 1,000 (5 fewer-19 more), cardiac adverse events 1.00 (0.75–1.32) with 0 fewer per 1,000 (14 fewer-18 more), renal adverse events 1.03 (0.86–1.23) with 2 more per 1,000 (7 fewer-12 more), thromboembolism 0.82 (0.36–1.88) with 2 fewer per 1,000 (8 fewer-10 more), and pulmonary adverse events 1.05 (0.89–1.24) with 6 more per 1,000 (14 fewer-30 more).

### Elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio) [^114LDvJ7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

Dosage reductions of ELREXFIO are not recommended.

Dosage delays may be required to manage toxicities related to ELREXFIO [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Recommendations on restarting ELREXFIO after a dose delay are provided in Table 2.

See Table 3 and Table 4 for recommended actions for adverse reactions of CRS and ICANS, respectively. See Table 5 for recommended actions for neurologic toxicity excluding ICANS and Table 6 for recommended actions for other adverse reactions following administration of ELREXFIO. Consider further management per current practice guidelines.

Management of CRS, Neurologic Toxicity Including ICANS

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

Management recommendations for CRS are summarized in Table 3.

Identify CRS based on clinical presentation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Evaluate and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension.

If CRS is suspected, withhold ELREXFIO until CRS resolves. Manage CRS according to the recommendations in Table 3 and consider further management per current practice guidelines. Administer supportive therapy for CRS, which may include intensive care for severe or life-threatening CRS. Consider laboratory testing to monitor for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hematology parameters, as well as pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and hepatic function.

Neurologic Toxicity Including ICANS

Management recommendations for ICANS and neurologic toxicity are summarized in Table 4 and Table 5.

At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, withhold ELREXFIO and consider neurology evaluation. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Provide supportive therapy, which may include intensive care, for severe or life-threatening neurologic toxicities, including ICANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Manage ICANS according to the recommendations in Table 4 and consider further management per current practice guidelines.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^115qdZJj]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Burn-related anemia and transfusion thresholds — Anemia after a major burn injury is ubiquitous, and the most common treatment of anemia in patients with major burns is to transfuse RBC units; however, blood transfusion is not without risks and potential morbidity and allogeneic RBC units are expensive and are increasingly a scarce resource, worldwide, with adverse effects including acute fluid overload, acute lung injury, immune responsiveness, allergic or hemolytic reactions, bacterial contamination, disease transmission, and kidney injury. In 1999, the Transfusion Requirement in Critical Care (TRICC) trial studied critically ill patients and compared a restrictive (7 g/dL) versus liberal (10 g/dL) hemoglobin threshold for administering RBCs, and in 2017 the Transfusion Requirement in Burn Care Evaluation (TRIBE) study reported that a restrictive transfusion threshold for burn patients resulted in dramatically fewer transfusions, with no worse outcomes than a liberal approach to blood transfusion.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^113wXro7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For sedation of intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients in the Intensive Care Unit, DIPRIVAN should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for General Anesthesia/MAC Sedation

DIPRIVAN must be prepared for use just prior to initiation of each individual anesthetic/sedative procedure. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. DIPRIVAN should be drawn into a sterile syringe immediately after a vial is opened. When withdrawing DIPRIVAN from vials, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe should be labelled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been opened.

DIPRIVAN must be prepared for single dose only. Any unused DIPRIVAN drug product, reservoirs, dedicated administration tubing and/or solutions containing DIPRIVAN must be discarded at the end of the anesthetic procedure or at 12 hours, whichever occurs sooner. The intravenous line should be flushed every 12 hours and at the end of the anesthetic procedure to remove residual DIPRIVAN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for ICU Sedation

DIPRIVAN must be prepared for single dose only. Strict aseptic techniques must be followed. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. A sterile vent spike and sterile tubing must be used for administration of DIPRIVAN. As with other lipid emulsions, the number of intravenous line manipulations should be minimized. Administration should commence promptly and must be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been spiked. The tubing and any unused DIPRIVAN drug product must be discarded after 12 hours.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115P2Ynd]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in critically ill adults — summary of recommendations and suggestions: These recommendations do not apply to critically ill adults with hemodynamic instability resulting from acute hemorrhage or to those with neurologic injuries or trauma. In critically ill patients, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding, we recommend a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with acute coronary syndrome, we suggest against a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we suggest a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy during the perioperative period (Conditional Recommendation, Moderate Certainty of Evidence). In critically ill patients with isolated elevation of serum troponin without other evidence of cardiac ischemia, we suggest a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy over a permissive RBC transfusion strategy (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). In patients with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, we suggest against adding permissive RBC transfusion thresholds to usual care (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). Remarks: Studies evaluating protocol-driven approaches to goal-directed therapy in septic shock were not considered in the evidence review.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^114TKnq9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of PROCRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the PROCRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue PROCRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate PROCRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT, and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116BCWR9]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults — adopting a restrictive strategy could decrease the number of patients receiving red blood cell (RBC) transfusions by approximately 40%, and on a large scale this could represent sparing 0.5 million patients from RBC transfusions. The guideline notes limitations, stating that the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, that for conditions like ACS and septic shock the number of studies was small and the inferences were not strong, and that no studies specifically addressed critically ill patients with elevated troponin levels. It also states that the studies did not assess additional aspects of the transfusion process (storage age, donor characteristics, processing, storage solutions).

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^117SuECF]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Burn blood product transfusion — users and settings — Transfusions of blood products to burn patients occurs throughout every phase of care from the emergency department to the operating room (OR). This CPG will be of most use to burn center personnel caring for patients in a burn intensive care unit (ICU) or burn unit setting, and in the OR transfusion of blood products is largely governed by the clinical status of the patient, with hemodynamic instability from significant intraoperative bleeding dictating the need for the administration of blood products rather than practice guidelines on transfusions. For RBC transfusions, guidelines surrounding transfusion triggers and strict measurement of pre and post transfusion hemoglobin levels should always be replaced by a clinically directed approach specific to the patient.

### Elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio) [^116mKMYG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Infections

ELREXFIO can cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections. In the clinical trial, in patients who received ELREXFIO according to the recommended dosing schedule, serious infections, including opportunistic infections, occurred in 42% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 infections in 31%, and fatal infections in 7%. The most common serious infections reported (≥ 5%) were pneumonia and sepsis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Do not initiate treatment with ELREXFIO in patients with active infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with ELREXFIO and treat appropriately. Withhold or permanently discontinue ELREXFIO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Administer prophylactic antimicrobial and anti-viral medications according to current practice guidelines. Consider treatment with subcutaneous or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as appropriate.

5.5 Neutropenia

ELREXFIO can cause neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. In patients who received ELREXFIO at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, decreased neutrophils occurred in 62% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophils in 51%. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 2.2% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor complete blood cell counts at baseline and periodically during treatment. Provide supportive care according to current practice guidelines. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Withhold ELREXFIO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.6 Hepatotoxicity

ELREXFIO can cause hepatotoxicity. In the clinical trial, elevated ALT occurred in 36% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 ALT elevation occurring in 3.8%; elevated AST occurred in 40% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 AST elevation occurring in 6%. Grade 3 or 4 total bilirubin elevations occurred in 0.5% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Liver enzyme elevation can occur with or without concurrent CRS.

Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold ELREXFIO or consider permanent discontinuation of ELREXFIO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Eculizumab-aagh (Epysqli) [^112UPeYU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PNH Study 1:

PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either eculizumab (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the "set-point") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes. The hemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications. Major baseline characteristics were balanced (see Table 9).

Patients treated with eculizumab had significantly reduced (p < 0.001) hemolysis resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see Table 10). These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4–14 units; 15–25 units; > 25 units). After 3 weeks of eculizumab treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health- related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of eculizumab products on thrombotic events could not be determined.

### Epoetin alfa-epbx (Retacrit) [^116rDdPd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of RETACRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the RETACRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue RETACRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate RETACRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of RETACRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating RETACRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion

and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^114wwmZG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN myelodysplastic syndromes — supportive care — The standard of care for MDS management includes supportive care measures in addition to relevant specific care, entailing observation, clinical monitoring, psychosocial support, and quality-of-life (QOL) assessment, and patients should receive support prior to transplant. Supportive care should include red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for symptomatic anemia as needed (CMV-safe [CMV-negative or leukopheresed]) or platelet transfusions for bleeding events; however, platelet transfusions are generally not used routinely in patients with thrombocytopenia in the absence of bleeding. CMV-safe blood products are recommended whenever possible for recipients who are CMV-negative, and both the number of transfusions as well as the number of packed RBCs per transfusion should be kept to a minimum in patients who are classified as non-cardiac and in patients anticipated to be heavily transfused. The Panel agreed that all directed-donor products and transfused products for patients who are potential transplant candidates should be irradiated. Antibiotics are recommended for bacterial infections and prophylaxis may be considered when starting patients on therapy, consistent with local hospital guidelines. Aminocaproic acid or other antifibrinolytic agents may be considered for bleeding episodes refractory to platelet transfusions or for profound thrombocytopenia, and hematopoietic cytokine support should be considered for refractory symptomatic cytopenias.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111MgxEP]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in critically ill adults — scope, methods, and key conclusions: A panel of experts developed six Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome questions and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach with a modified Delphi technique, examining subgroups including gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac surgery, isolated troponin elevation, and septic shock. The initial search identified a total of 3,082 studies, 38 articles were reviewed, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 22 randomized controlled trials and one cohort study; the panel formulated two strong and four conditional recommendations, and the overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. In most critically ill patients, a restrictive strategy was preferable to a permissive approach because it does not increase the risk of death or complications but does decrease RBC use significantly; subpopulation data also supported a restrictive approach, except in patients with ACS, for whom favoring a restrictive approach could increase adverse outcomes.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

Study in Complement-Inhibitor Naïve Adult Patients with PNH (Study APL2–308)

Study APL2–308 enrolled patients with PNH who had not been treated with any complement inhibitor within 3 months prior to enrollment and with Hb levels less than the lower limit of normal (LLN). Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive EMPAVELI or supportive care [excluding complement inhibitors (e.g., transfusions, corticosteroids, supplements such as iron, folate, and vitamin B12), hereafter referred to as the control arm] through the duration of the 26-week treatment period. Randomization was stratified based on the number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions within the 12 months prior to Day -28 (< 4; ≥ 4). At any point during the study, a patient assigned to the control arm treatment group who had Hb levels ≥ 2 g/dL below baseline or presented with a PNH associated thromboembolic event was offered cross-over to EMPAVELI for the remainder of the study.

A total of 53 patients were randomized, 35 to EMPAVELI and 18 to the control arm. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups (see Table 7). The mean times from PNH diagnosis to Day 1 were 5.7 and 5.5 years, respectively, for EMPAVELI and the control arm. The baseline mean total PNH RBC clone sizes (Type III) were 31% for EMPAVELI and 28% for the control arm. In the EMPAVELI group, 2.9% of patients had a history of major adverse vascular events. Two patients (5.7%) in the EMPAVELI group and 3 patients (16.7%) in the control arm group had a history of at least 1 type of thrombosis. Within 28 days prior to the first dose of EMPAVELI or the control arm, respectively, 17.1% and 27.8% of patients used anti-thrombotic agents (anti-platelet and/or anticoagulants). During Study APL2–308, 8.6% and 0% of patients on EMPAVELI and the control arm, respectively, used antithrombotic agents. Eleven of 18 patients randomized to the control transitioned to cross-over therapy with EMPAVELI due to a decreased Hb level ≥ 2 g/dL below baseline. Three patients treated with EMPAVELI required dose adjustment to 1,080 mg every 3 days. Three patients (5.7%; two patients in the EMPAVELI group and one patient in the control arm group) discontinued the study, none due to an adverse reaction.

2.7 Discontinuation for Surgery and Other Interventions

If possible, discontinue PRADAXA Oral Pellets before invasive or surgical procedures because of the increased risk of bleeding. For pediatric patients, PRADAXA Oral Pellets should be stopped 24 hours before an elective surgery (eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) or 2 days before an elective surgery (eGFR 50–80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Pediatric patients with an eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2have not been studied, avoid use of PRADAXA Oral Pellets in these patients.

Consider longer times for patients undergoing major surgery, spinal puncture, or placement of a spinal or epidural catheter or port, in whom complete hemostasis may be required [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If surgery cannot be delayed, there is an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. This risk of bleeding should be weighed against the urgency of intervention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. In adults, a specific reversal agent (idarucizumab) is available in case of emergency surgery or urgent procedures when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed. Efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Refer to the idarucizumab prescribing information for additional information.

bFrench-American-British (FAB) classification of MDS.

The frequency of RBC transfusion independence was assessed using criteria modified from the International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS. RBC transfusion independence was defined as the absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive "rolling" 56 days (8 weeks) during the treatment period.

Transfusion independence was seen in 99/148 (67%) patients (95% CI [59, 74]). The median duration from the date when RBC transfusion independence was first declared (i.e., the last day of the 56-day RBC transfusion-free period) to the date when an additional transfusion was received after the 56-day transfusion-free period among the 99 responders was 44 weeks (range of 0 to > 67 weeks). Ninety percent of patients who achieved a transfusion benefit did so by completion of three months in the study.

RBC transfusion independence rates were unaffected by age or gender.

The dose of lenalidomide was reduced or interrupted at least once due to an adverse event in 118 (79.7%) of the 148 patients; the median time to the first dose reduction or interruption was 21 days (mean, 35.1 days; range, 2 to 253 days), and the median duration of the first dose interruption was 22 days (mean, 28.5 days; range, 2 to 265 days). A second dose reduction or interruption due to adverse events was required in 50 (33.8%) of the 148 patients. The median interval between the first and second dose reduction or interruption was 51 days (mean, 59.7 days; range, 15 to 205 days) and the median duration of the second dose interruption was 21 days (mean, 26 days; range, 2 to 148 days).

Acute coronary syndrome — restrictive versus permissive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion outcomes indicate a trend toward higher mortality with the restrictive approach without statistical significance, with pooled relative risk (RR) 1.13 (95% CI, 0.67–1.91). In trial data, 30-day mortality was 9.9% in the restrictive group versus 8.3% in the permissive group (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.96–1.47), and cardiac death rates were 5.5% versus 3.2% (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.40). One-year mortality was 23.1% versus 20.4% (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.74–4.69). Point estimates for myocardial infarction (MI) or death and for recurrent MI consistently favored the permissive strategy. No significant differences were identified for hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, or adverse events. In pooled ACS data (Table 4), 30-day mortality had RR 1.13 (0.67–1.91) with an absolute difference of 10 more per 1,000 (26 fewer-73 more); infections had RR 0.87 (0.17–4.40) with 10 fewer per 1,000 (61 fewer-252 more); thromboembolism had RR 0.75 (0.46–1.24) with 5 fewer per 1,000 (10 fewer-5 more). Other guidance noted suggested an RBC threshold of 9 to 10 g/dL in patients with ACS, while "the panel opted to suggest against a restrictive approach".

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115XdJh7]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock with end-organ hypoperfusion — red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds and outcomes: In patients with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, we suggest against adding permissive RBC transfusion thresholds to usual care (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). Remarks: Studies evaluating protocol-driven approaches to goal-directed therapy in septic shock were not considered in the evidence review. Sepsis care has evolved over the last 2 decades, with usual care including prompt antibiotic and fluid administration and hemodynamic stabilization, and RBC transfusion practices in septic shock have shifted toward a restrictive approach; consequently, the addition of RBC transfusions to usual care, aiming for higher hemoglobin levels, implies a permissive transfusion strategy, whereas usual care adheres to a restrictive approach. This recommendation is informed by three RCTs and long-term follow-up of an RCT cohort, including two RCTs in general critically ill patients and one RCT in patients with cancer with higher RBC transfusion rates in the permissive groups compared with the restrictive groups. In the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial, the largest study including > 1,000 patients, similar 30-day mortality rates were reported in the permissive (35%) and restrictive (33%) approaches; in patients with cancer, lower, albeit not statistically significant, 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53–1.04; p = 0.08) and ICU mortality rates (33.6% vs 43.7%; p = 0.071) were reported in the permissive compared with the restrictive group. A pooled analysis showed no significant difference between permissive and restrictive strategies for ICU mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62–1.13) or 30-day mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72–1.21), and longer-term follow-up at 1 year reported mortality rates of 58.5% in the permissive group and 53.5% in the restrictive cohort (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85–1.09; p = 0.62); no difference was found in terms of ICU and hospital LOS between both strategies. Studies evaluating RBC transfusions as part of a resuscitation bundle were not included, because the effect of transfusions could not be isolated from the effect of other bundle elements.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guideline on blood product transfusion in burn care [^112TfZsG]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

American Burn Association blood product transfusion — Question 1 (adults with burns ≥ 20% total body surface area [TBSA]) compares a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level ≥ 7 g/ dL) with a liberal threshold (hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL); 5 studies were identified, including 3 with strong evidence and one with moderate evidence, comparing a restrictive strategy (maintain hemoglobin level ≥ 7 g/dL) to a liberal strategy (maintain hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL). Historically in the intensive care unit (ICU), RBCs were transfused if hemoglobin dropped below 10 g/dL. The TRICC trial randomized 838 stable critically ill patients to transfuse if hemoglobin dropped below 7.0 g/dL with maintenance at 7.0 to 9.0 g/dL versus transfusing when hemoglobin fell below 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL and found no difference in mortality between the 2 groups; however, the TRICC study applicability to patients with major burn injury is not clear and it did not include patients with active bleeding, a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL or less within 72 hours of admission, or those requiring transfusion of > 3 units in 12 hours.

### Propofol [^111uFJRT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For sedation of intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients in the Intensive Care Unit, propofol injectable emulsion should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for General Anesthesia/MAC Sedation

Propofol injectable emulsion must be prepared for use just prior to initiation of each individual anesthetic/sedative procedure. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. Propofol injectable emulsion should be drawn into a sterile syringe immediately after a vial is opened. When withdrawing propofol injectable emulsion from vials, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe should be labelled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been opened.

Propofol injectable emulsion must be prepared for single dose only. Any unused propofol injectable emulsion drug product, reservoirs, dedicated administration tubing and/or solutions containing propofol injectable emulsion must be discarded at the end of the anesthetic procedure or at 12 hours, whichever occurs sooner. The intravenous line should be flushed every 12 hours and at the end of the anesthetic procedure to remove residual propofol injectable emulsion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Guidelines for Aseptic Technique for ICU Sedation

Propofol injectable emulsion must be prepared for single dose only. Strict aseptic techniques must be followed. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. A sterile vent spike and sterile tubing must be used for administration of propofol injectable emulsion. As with other lipid emulsions, the number of intravenous line manipulations should be minimized. Administration should commence promptly and must be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been spiked. The tubing and any unused propofol injectable emulsion drug product must be discarded after 12 hours.

### Fitusiran (Qfitlia) [^115LUqUQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 	Bleed Management

Breakthrough Bleed Management

If breakthrough bleeding requiring on-demand treatment with CFC or BPA occurs during the first 7 days after QFITLIA initiation, manage the bleed using the patient's prior dosing regimen of CFC or BPA.

If breakthrough bleeding occurs after 7 days from the first QFITLIA dose, bleeds should be managed with a reduced dose and frequency of CFC/BPA to minimize the risk of thrombotic events. Initially, the weight-based dose of a CFC/BPA should be reduced, and the dosing interval doubled compared to the standard dose. This reduced dosing is shown in Table 2. If adequate hemostatic control is not achieved, higher doses may be used based on clinical judgement. Combination use of antifibrinolytics with CFC or BPA has not been studied.

Use of QFITLIA During Surgical Interventions

In clinical studies, patients with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors have undergone both major (N = 60) and minor (N = 71) surgical procedures without discontinuing QFITLIA prophylaxis. Utilize bleed management guidelines during the perioperative period for hemostatic management.

### Metformin hydrochloride [^1164cFxF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age).

Metformin hydrochloride should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin hydrochloride should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.

During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.

### Epoetin alfa (Epogen) [^115feVzA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 		 	Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Epogen sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse reactions [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies (14)].

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Epogen by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Epogen dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue Epogen if responsiveness does not improve.

### Azacitidine [^115Cecjf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Benefit was seen in patients who did not meet the criteria for PR or better, but were considered "improved". About 24% of azacitidine-treated patients were considered improved, and about 2/3 of those lost transfusion dependence. In the observation group, only 5/83 patients met criteria for improvement; none lost transfusion dependence. In all 3 studies, about 19% of patients met criteria for improvement with a median duration of 195 days.

Study 4 was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in patients with MDS with RAEB, RAEB-T or modified CMMoL according to FAB classification and Intermediate-2 and High risk according to IPSS classification. Of the 358 patients enrolled in the study, 179 were randomized to receive azacitidine plus best supportive care (BSC) and 179 were randomized to receive conventional care regimens (CCR) plus BSC (105 to BSC alone, 49 to low dose cytarabine and 25 to chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline). The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival.

The azacitidine and CCR groups were comparable for baseline parameters. The median age of patients was 69 years (range was 38 to 88 years), 98% were Caucasian, and 70% were male. At baseline, 95% of the patients were higher risk by FAB classification: RAEB (58%), RAEB-T (34%), and CMMoL (3%). By IPSS classification, 87% were higher risk: Int-2 (41%), High (47%). At baseline, 32% of patients met WHO criteria for AML.

### Hetastarch (hetastarch in sodium chloride) [^115mroRZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Coagulopathy

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is not recommended for use as a cardiac bypass pump prime, while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass, or in the immediate period after the pump has been discontinued because of the risk of increasing coagulation abnormalities and bleeding in patients whose coagulation status is already impaired. Monitor the coagulation status of surgery patients, as excess bleeding has been reported with HES solutions in this population. Discontinue use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection at first sign of coagulopathy1–2

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has not been adequately evaluated to establish its safety in uses over extended periods other than leukapheresis. 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has been associated with coagulation abnormalities in conjunction with an acquired, reversible von Willebrand's-like syndrome and/or Factor VIII deficiency when used over a period of days. Replacement therapy should be considered if a severe Factor VIII deficiency is identified. If a coagulopathy develops, it may take several days to resolve. Certain conditions may affect the safe use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection on a chronic basis. For example, in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage where 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is used repeatedly over a period of days for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, significant clinical bleeding may occur. Intracranial bleeding resulting in death has been reported.3

Slight declines in platelet counts and hemoglobin levels have been observed in donors undergoing repeated leukapheresis procedures using 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection due to the volume expanding effects of hetastarch and to the collection of platelets and erythrocytes. Hemoglobin levels usually return to normal within 24 hours. Hemodilution by 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may also result in 24 hour declines of total protein, albumin, calcium, and fibrinogen levels. Regular and frequent clinical evaluation and complete blood counts (CBC) are necessary for proper monitoring of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection use during leukapheresis. If the frequency of leukapheresis is to exceed the guidelines for whole blood donation, you may wish to consider the following additional tests: total leukocyte and platelet counts, leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

### Paclitaxel [^114Tzwij]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) was observed in 78% of all patients and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dL) in 16% of the cases. No consistent relationship between dose or schedule and the frequency of anemia was observed. Among all patients with normal baseline hemoglobin, 69% became anemic on study but only 7% had severe anemia. Red cell transfusions were required in 25% of all patients and in 12% of those with normal baseline hemoglobin levels.

Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs)

All patients received premedication prior to paclitaxel administration (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Hypersensitivity Reactions). The frequency and severity of HSRs were not affected by the dose or schedule of paclitaxel administration. In the Phase 3 second-line ovarian study, the 3-hour infusion was not associated with a greater increase in HSRs when compared to the 24-hour infusion. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed in 20% of all courses and in 41% of all patients. These reactions were severe in less than 2% of the patients and 1% of the courses. No severe reactions were observed after course 3 and severe symptoms occurred generally within the first hour of paclitaxel infusion. The most frequent symptoms observed during these severe reactions were dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, and tachycardia. Abdominal pain, pain in the extremities, diaphoresis, and hypertension were also noted.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111bEWar]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults — background and epidemiology: In the United States, approximately 25% of critically ill patients receive RBC transfusions, totaling approximately 1.8 million units annually. The primary indication is low hemoglobin (80%), whereas less frequently encountered indications include active bleeding (27%) and hemodynamic instability (23%). Since the publication of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, > 30 trials have examined RBC transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. Despite this evidence, significant variability exists in clinical practice regarding the indications for RBC transfusions, with most occurring in patients with hemoglobin levels of > 7 g/dL. Although RBC transfusions can be life-saving, they carry significant risks of adverse effects, including transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and immunomodulating effects that may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. These side-effects may be severe and even life-threatening. The entire process, from distribution to administration of RBCs, incurs substantial costs, which vary globally.

In trials evaluating ICU mortality, clinical teams were "encouraged strongly to transfuse one RBC unit at a time and repeat hemoglobin measurements after each unit", and using this approach "the number of RBC units transfused was decreased by 50%".

Evaluate neutrophil counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation and interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e. ANC less than 1000 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lymphopenia

ALC less than 500 cells/mm3were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate lymphocyte counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm3) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Anemia

Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials.

Evaluate hemoglobin at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 8 g/dL) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.14)].

Lipids

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and thereafter according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.

Liver Enzyme Elevations

Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations compared to treatment with placebo.

Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury.

If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded.

### Mitapivat (Pyrukynd) [^1177R1Si]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

PYRUKYND is taken orally with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole. Do not split, crush, chew, or dissolve the tablets.

2.1 Recommended Dose

PYRUKYND is taken with or without food and swallowed whole. Do not split, crush, chew, or dissolve the tablets.

The starting dosage for PYRUKYND is 5 mg orally twice daily. To gradually increase hemoglobin (Hb), titrate PYRUKYND from 5 mg twice daily to 20 mg twice daily, and then to the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg twice daily, with these dose increases occurring every 4 weeks (see Table 1). Assess Hb and transfusion requirement before increasing to the next dose level, as some patients may reach and maintain normal Hb at 5 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily.

Discontinue PYRUKYND if no benefit has been observed by 24 weeks, based on the hemoglobin and hemolysis laboratory results and transfusion requirements.

2.2 Missed Dose

If a dose of PYRUKYND is missed by 4 hours or less, administer the dose as soon as possible. If a dose of PYRUKYND is missed by more than 4 hours, do not administer a replacement dose, and wait until the next scheduled dose. Subsequently, return to the normal dosing schedule.

2.3 Interruption or Discontinuation

To reduce the risk of acute hemolysis, avoid abrupt interruption or abrupt discontinuation of PYRUKYND when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Taper the dose to gradually discontinue the medication (see Table 2). Monitor patients for signs of acute hemolysis and worsening of anemia.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Hepatic Impairment

Avoid use of PYRUKYND in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Special Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115vCwxP]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds — definitions used across studies: The hemoglobin thresholds prompting RBC transfusion varied across studies, with a restrictive threshold generally defined as a hemoglobin level of 7 to 8 g/dL and a permissive threshold typically ranging from a hemoglobin level of 8.5 to 10 g/dL; hemodynamic instability was typically defined as hypotension with mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg or systolic BP < 100 mm Hg, tissue hypoperfusion caused by acute bleeding, or both.
