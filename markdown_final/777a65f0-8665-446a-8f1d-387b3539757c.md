## Question

treatment for hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should classify severity and acuity and immediately assess symptoms to determine urgency. Next, I will determine volume status to guide therapy. After that, I need to select therapy based on severity, acuity, and volume status, including hypertonic saline protocols, fluid restriction, isotonic saline, and vaptans or urea. I will then set correction limits and monitoring cadence, anticipate and manage overcorrection, and finally tailor special scenarios like SIADH, liver disease, heart failure, and exercise-associated hyponatremia, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia by checking serum osmolality and excluding pseudohyponatremia from hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or paraproteinemia. I should also verify the sodium concentration and consider the timing of onset if known, because acute versus chronic status drives correction strategy and risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, and I need to ensure I do not delay urgent therapy while waiting for full workup if the patient is symptomatic [^116F8M1C] [^111WyraN] [^114hmeK4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify severity and acuity and immediately assess symptoms to determine urgency. Severe hyponatremia is generally less than 125 mEq/L, and acute is often defined as less than 48 hours, whereas chronic is more than 48 hours; severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise mandate emergent hypertonic saline, while mild symptoms like nausea or confusion still warrant prompt but less aggressive correction, and I should remember that even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with falls and cognitive impairment, so I should not dismiss it as benign [^111WyraN] [^114hmeK4] [^115bV1Sk].

> I need to check volume status next because it fundamentally changes therapy. Hypovolemic hyponatremia responds to isotonic saline, euvolemic etiologies like SIADH require fluid restriction and possibly urea or vaptans, and hypervolemic states such as heart failure or cirrhosis need fluid restriction and disease-directed therapy rather than saline, and I should double-check urine sodium and osmolality to refine the differential when volume status is equivocal [^114Mg1Pm] [^111y8Lh6] [^114hmeK4].

> For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, I should act immediately with 3% hypertonic saline boluses. Let me verify the dosing: 100 mL boluses repeated up to three times at 10-minute intervals or until symptoms improve, targeting a 4–6 mEq/L rise in the first 1–2 hours, and I should monitor sodium after each bolus and then every 6 hours initially. Wait, I almost said continuous infusion is preferred, but boluses achieve faster correction with less overcorrection, so I should favor boluses and stop once symptoms abate or the total rise approaches 10 mEq/L in 24 hours [^114yeaQw] [^111czwib] [^113SHKnQ].

> I should confirm correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination. For chronic hyponatremia, I need to limit the rise to about 8 mEq/L in 24 hours in high-risk patients and up to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours and 18 mEq/L in 48 hours in standard-risk patients, and if overcorrection occurs, I should promptly administer desmopressin and give hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 24-hour limit was uniformly 10 mEq/L, but I should correct that to 8–12 mEq/L depending on risk and guideline, with stricter limits in high-risk phenotypes [^114mqwBU] [^116JUkNn] [^1117skm3].

> For hypovolemic hyponatremia, I should treat with isotonic saline while closely monitoring for a sudden aquaresis once volume repletion suppresses vasopressin. Hold on, I should verify that I am not inadvertently causing rapid overcorrection by continuing saline after the hypovolemic stimulus resolves, so I will reassess sodium frequently and de-escalate fluids as soon as the volume deficit is corrected [^111WyraN] [^113SHKnQ].

> For euvolemic hyponatremia such as SIADH, fluid restriction is first-line, but I need to check for predictors of poor response like high urine osmolality above 500 mOsm/kg or high urine sodium above 133 mmol/L. If restriction fails, I should consider oral urea at 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day or a vaptan, while remembering that vaptans can cause rapid overcorrection and thirst, so I will start low, monitor closely, and avoid in acute severe presentations where rapid titration is risky [^112MGZPb] [^1114uqkz] [^112L24Fh].

> For hypervolemic hyponatremia in heart failure or cirrhosis, I should prioritize fluid restriction, treat the underlying disease, and avoid isotonic or hypertonic saline except in life-threatening emergencies. Let me verify liver-specific guidance: in decompensated cirrhosis, hypertonic saline is reserved for short-term rescue or imminent transplant, and albumin may be considered in severe cases, with strict correction limits to avoid demyelination [^112UXSyW] [^112vKGeP] [^111Sj5ax].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, I should avoid hypotonic fluids and treat suspected severe cases with 100 mL 3% saline boluses repeated up to three times, while restricting oral fluids until urination begins. In neurosurgical patients, I need to distinguish cerebral salt wasting from SIADH because CSW requires salt and volume repletion whereas SIADH requires fluid restriction. In oncology, hyponatremia is common and often SIADH-related, so I should treat the cancer and SIADH concurrently while watching for drug-induced hyponatremia from newer therapies [^116H7fVr] [^115amGD4] [^1135vqck].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to check serum sodium frequently, at least every 2–4 hours initially in severe cases, then every 6 hours, and I should monitor urine output because abrupt aquaresis is a major driver of overcorrection. If the sodium rise accelerates unexpectedly, I should double-check for aquaresis and be ready to administer desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to relower safely, documenting all changes meticulously [^111czwib] [^113SHKnQ] [^1117skm3].

> But wait, what if the patient is not improving as expected? I should verify the diagnosis and reassess volume status, urine studies, and medications that potentiate vasopressin, and if the initial therapy is inadequate, I should escalate within guideline-concordant options, for example adding urea or a carefully titrated vaptan in refractory SIADH, or repeating hypertonic saline boluses if severe symptoms persist, always respecting correction limits and adjusting the plan dynamically as new data arrive [^111y8Lh6] [^112MGZPb] [^114yeaQw].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal care. Once the acute phase is controlled, I should continue to treat the underlying cause, taper active therapies thoughtfully, and arrange follow-up to prevent recurrence, recognizing that chronic hyponatremia contributes to gait instability, cognitive decline, and fractures, so persistent correction may confer meaningful benefits beyond simply normalizing a number [^114hmeK4] [^115bV1Sk].

Treat hyponatremia by **first confirming hypotonicity and assessing symptoms** [^114hmeK4]. For severe symptoms (seizures, coma), give **3% hypertonic saline 100 mL boluses** [^114yeaQw] repeated up to three times to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly, then stop and monitor closely [^1114ke7i] [^113SHKnQ]. For chronic hyponatremia, correct **no more than 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** (≤ 12 mmol/L if low risk) to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114mqwBU]; use fluid restriction, isotonic saline for hypovolemia, and vaptans or urea for SIADH or hypervolemic cases [^112MGZPb] [^11534PiV]. Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6–12 hours, and treat the underlying cause to prevent recurrence [^111czwib] [^114hmeK4].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Before treatment, **confirm hypotonic hyponatremia** and classify by volume status and chronicity [^116F8M1C]:

- **Confirm hypotonicity**: Measure serum osmolality; hypotonic hyponatremia has osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg [^115evmgn].

- **Classify volume status**: Hypovolemic, euvolemic (e.g. SIADH), or hypervolemic (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis) [^114hmeK4].

- **Determine chronicity**: Acute (< 48 hours) vs chronic (> 48 hours); chronic cases are at higher risk of osmotic demyelination if corrected too quickly [^116uPKAA].

---

## General principles of treatment

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the precipitating condition (e.g. stop offending drugs, treat heart failure, cirrhosis, or SIADH) [^112n6Umk].

- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks and clinical monitoring are essential to avoid rapid correction and osmotic demyelination [^111czwib].

- **Avoid rapid correction**: Limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (≤ 12 mmol/L if low risk) [^114mqwBU].

---

## Treatment based on severity and symptoms

### Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (medical emergency)

Severe symptoms include seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest [^114hmeK4]. The **immediate goal** is to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly to reduce cerebral edema [^1175CAmS]. Give **3% hypertonic saline** as 100 mL IV boluses, repeated up to three times at 10-minute intervals, until symptoms improve [^114yeaQw]. Stop once symptoms resolve or sodium rises by 4–6 mmol/L; do not exceed 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours [^114hmeK4].

---

### Moderate symptomatic hyponatremia

Moderate symptoms include nausea, confusion, headache, or mild altered mental status [^notfound]. Use **hypertonic saline cautiously** with smaller boluses or slow infusion, aiming for a gradual rise, and monitor sodium closely to avoid overcorrection [^1175CAmS].

---

### Mild or asymptomatic hyponatremia

Mild or asymptomatic cases typically have sodium 130–134 mmol/L or mild symptoms [^111WyraN]. Management is **cause-specific**, guided by volume status and chronicity [^115evmgn].

---

## Treatment based on volume status

| **Volume status** | **Treatment approach** |
|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) to restore volume; sodium correction will follow as ADH is suppressed [^114xRHnt] |
| Euvolemic (SIADH) | Fluid restriction (800–1,000 mL/day); consider vaptans (tolvaptan, conivaptan) or urea if restriction fails [^112MGZPb] [^11534PiV] |
| Hypervolemic (heart failure, cirrhosis) | Fluid restriction; treat underlying disease; consider vaptans or urea cautiously [^111WyraN] [^114hmeK4] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Correct slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L/24 h) to avoid osmotic demyelination; use desmopressin if correction is too rapid [^117M8SDu] [^1117skm3].

- **Exercise-associated hyponatremia**: Restrict fluids; use hypertonic saline for severe cases [^116H7fVr].

- **Liver disease**: Use hypertonic saline only for severe symptoms or imminent transplantation; correct slowly [^112UXSyW] [^112vKGeP].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent monitoring**: Sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 6–12 hours as stable [^notfound].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for neurologic changes, urine output, and signs of overcorrection [^113SHKnQ].

- **Long-term management**: Address underlying causes, adjust medications, and arrange follow-up to prevent recurrence [^116Fduk1].

---

## Complications of treatment

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome**: Rapid correction (> 8 mmol/L/24 h) can cause irreversible neurologic injury [^112vKGeP].

- **Overcorrection**: Use desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium if needed [^1117skm3].

- **Ineffective therapies**: Fluid restriction alone often fails in SIADH; consider second-line agents [^114oZizi].

---

Effective hyponatremia management requires **confirming hypotonicity**, classifying volume status, and aligning therapy with symptom severity and chronicity, while strictly limiting correction rates and monitoring closely to prevent complications [^114hmeK4].

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia [^112cShEb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) typically occurs during or up to 24 hours after prolonged physical activity, and is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mEq/L. It is also reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in austere environments in which medical care is limited or often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to ensure a positive outcome. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of event-related fatality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH in the austere environment, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel. The panel was charged with the development of evidence-based guidelines for management of EAH. Recommendations are made regarding the situations when sodium concentration can be assessed in the field and when these values are not known. These recommendations are graded based on the quality of supporting evidence and balance between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112L24Fh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, the effect of vasopressin antagonists is yet undefined.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting & Population

In- and outpatients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all RCTs regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Vasopressin antagonists with or without fluid restriction versus placebo or no treatment with or without fluid restriction.

Outcomes

Response rate defined as normalization of serum sodium level or significant increase in serum sodium level at 3–7 days (primary) and later, change from baseline serum sodium level at 3–7 days and later, adverse events, rate of rapid sodium level correction, and rate of hypernatremia.

Results

15 RCTs were identified. Vasopressin antagonist treatment significantly increased response rate both early (RR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.27–4.37; 11 trials) and late (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.79–2.89; 4 trials). Response rates were high in trials assessing mostly euvolemic patients and those assessing mostly hypervolemic patients, with greater effect estimate in the former. Change from baseline serum sodium level was significantly increased both early (weighted mean difference, 5.27 mEq/L; 95% CI, 4.27–6.26, 13 trials) and late (weighted mean difference, 3.49 mEq/L; 95% CI, 2.56–4.41, 8 trials). Although there was an increased rate of rapid sodium correction (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26–5.08, 8 trials) with vasopressin antagonists, hypernatremia rates were not significantly higher (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.61–7.96; 5 trials), adverse events were not increased, and there were no reports of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Vasopressin antagonists are effective for the treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741–7015/12/231.

### Lixivaptan: a vasopressin receptor antagonist for the treatment of hyponatremia [^116kb9Rg]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The introduction of medications that specifically antagonize the vasopressin V2 receptor (vaptans) has provided a safe and effective means of therapy. Lixivaptan is the newest of these agents that reliably increase serum sodium levels in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. However, significant questions remain regarding the specific indications for vaptans, and their potential impact on morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^112YHSCX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically synthesize and appraise clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia In accordance with the Prisma statement, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and searched an additional 337 websites of specialist societies and guideline organizations (Additional file 6). We used AGREE II, a validated and reliable instrument, and an adequate number of reviewers to individually appraise the guidance documents. On top of the individual appraisals, we included an attempt to resolve major discrepancies and increase consistency by introducing an audiotaped group consensus meeting. During this meeting, reviewers could explain and motivate their scores and adapt them if they wanted to. This mostly resulted only in modest downgrading of domain scores by 1% to 10%. Most of the changes happened because reviewers felt they had scored inconsistently for a same rationale, or because they missed information during the initial appraisal that was in fact available in the document. Although the scores did not change substantially, the group felt the discussion further highlighted the qualitative differences between the guidance documents. In addition, even the reviewers with large deviations from the mean in their initial scores felt they agreed with the conclusion. It means that final average scores were truly a product of consensus rather than a mathematical calculation, as proposed in the original AGREE protocol. We believe that a consensus meeting is valuable in any guideline appraisal process, and particularly useful if reviewer groups have the intention to select a guideline for local use.

This study has its limitations. We based our assessment on what guideline organizations actually reported. Reporting by guideline developers may not wholly reflect what occurred in practice with respect to the AGREE criteria, and we did not seek additional clarification. However, contacting guideline developers is not standard practice when using AGREE as the instrument specifically aims to provide a framework for assessing the quality of reporting of recommendations. We aimed to summarize the existing recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia as formulated by other guideline development groups and to evaluate the quality of the guideline development process. We did not aim to summarize or critically appraise the evidence base itself. Consequently, it is difficult to assess to what extent differences between guidance documents stem from differences in development procedures rather than important limitations in the evidence base that underpin individual recommendations. Secondly, the purpose of using the AGREE instrument was not to accuse guideline development groups of being biased, but rather to highlight both strengths and weaknesses of existing guidance to suggest on how we could make improvements in the future.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

Management Principles

Figure 1 shows the application of the principles of management in a flow diagram. All principles are critical for optimizing successful patient outcomes. The principles addressing diagnosis are covered elsewhere. We have chosen to focus on the principles addressing the quantitative aspects of management in this report.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^116JUkNn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Evaluation and management of hyponatremia: an emerging role for vasopressin receptor antagonists [^113eqJq4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, collectively known as the 'vaptans', provide a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia; therefore, an updated Review of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia is particularly timely. After briefly defining hyponatremia and introducing its clinical aspects and complications, we present an approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of hyponatremia that is based primarily on the often-underused concept of free water clearance and, more specifically, the electrolyte-free water clearance. Then we review the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in the management of hyponatremia from the standpoint of their pharmacology, their mechanism of action, and available efficacy data from clinical trials.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Hyponatremia in the neurosurgical patient: epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^115amGD4]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia is an important and common electrolyte disorder in critically ill neurosurgical patients that has been reported in association with a number of different primary diagnoses. The correct diagnosis of the pathophysiological cause is vital because it dramatically alters the treatment approach.

Methods

We review the epidemiology and presentation of patients with hyponatremia, the pathophysiology of the disorder with respect to sodium and fluid balance, and the diagnostic procedures for determining the correct cause.

Results

We then present the various treatment options, including discussion of one of the newest groups of agents, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, currently under study for the treatment of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia is a serious comorbidity in neurosurgical patients that requires particular attention as its treatment varies by cause and its consequences can affect neurological outcome.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11183jyJ]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis

There is little high-level evidence to guide chronic SIAD treatment because of the difficulty of conducting randomized trials due to the heterogeneity of patients with this condition, severity of illness that makes placebo therapy ethically difficult, and the potential for resolution of conditions perpetuating the nonosmotic release of AVP, which can confound trials of SIAD treatments. However, this tendency for "autocorrection" of hyponatremia due to SIAD, if caused by a reversible underlying condition, makes rigorous RCTs even more important to confirm any apparent benefits in observational studies. A 2017 systematic review of chronic hyponatremia treatments did not identify RCTs of any treatments other than vaptans, but since then new RCTs have emerged. Published RCTs of therapies for chronic hypotonic hyponatremia to date are summarized in Table 6.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Where vaptans do and do not fit in the treatment of hyponatremia [^113bUjpN]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of hyponatremia, an exceedingly common electrolyte disorder, has been a subject of controversy for many years. The advent of vasopressin antagonists (vaptans) has added to the treatment arsenal. This review focuses on why hyponatremia should be treated and the role of these antagonists in the treatment. Upon analysis of the available literature, we conclude that there is presently no role for vaptans in acute symptomatic hyponatremia. Although numerous therapeutic approaches are available for chronic symptomatic hyponatremia, vasopressin antagonists provide a simpler treatment option. Vaptans are efficacious in raising serum sodium in long-standing 'asymptomatic' hyponatremia. However, the cost of the only Food and Drug Administration-approved oral agent (tolvaptan) makes its use prohibitive for most patients in this setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

Appraisal of guidelines and consensus statements

Four reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. AGREE II is an internationally validated, rigorously developed 23-item tool used to evaluate six domains of guideline development: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence (Additional file 3). The AGREE tool has also been used to assess consensus statements. The reviewers rated each item on a Likert scale from 1 ('Strongly Disagree') to 7 ('Strongly Agree'). We calculated a total score for each domain by summing up all the scores of the individual items in a domain for each reviewer and then standardizing this total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain, calculated as follows:

The minimum possible score for each domain equaled the number of questions multiplied by the number of reviewers, multiplied by 1 (strongly disagree). The maximum score for a domain equaled the number of questions multiplied by the number of reviewers, multiplied by 7 (strongly agree). To ensure standardization of each reviewer's approach, all reviewers completed the online training tutorial before starting the project.

In a consensus meeting among the reviewers, we discussed every item for which scores differed by more than 1 point (e.g. 1 versus 3) on the original 7-point scale. Reviewers in turn explained the rationale for their score and had the opportunity to revise their score when they considered this appropriate. We audiotaped the consensus meeting to reliably record the underlying reasons for changing scores.

Synthesis of guideline recommendations

We conducted a textual descriptive synthesis to analyze the scope, content, and consistency of the included recommendations. EN inductively coded the text manually to identify domains covered by the guidelines. These were cross-tabulated with the guidelines and recommendations were inserted into the corresponding cell. For each domain, we compared guideline recommendations to identify similarities and discrepancies. Consistent with the scope of this review, we only tabulated the information on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

This article provides an overview of the developing niche for vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists ("vaptans") in the management of hyponatremia in clinical practice. Specific areas of focus include the physiological and clinical rationale for use of this class of medications (including advantages over older and less specific therapeutic modalities), the practical limitations to the use of these new drugs (including issues of tolerability, toxicity, risk, and cost), and the unanswered question of the extent to which correcting hyponatremia will improve clinical outcomes.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113ho7wX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147wBVW]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117DP8jL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1117skm3]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment (Table 3). Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction, without clear dose recommendations, and one to avoid hypotonic infusion solution. Three additionally proposed loop diuretics and three others generally stated to treat the underlying disease, whereas one advised to consider stopping diuretics. One guideline additionally proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists as a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, whereas one guideline specifically recommended against both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Targets and limits of speed of correction

Table 4 shows the key recommendations. The key areas include targets and limits for increase in serum sodium concentration.

Seven guidance documents provided targets or aims for the increase in serum sodium concentration in case of symptomatic and/or acute hyponatremia. Seven guidance documents provided limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration that should not be surpassed. Five did so independent of symptoms. Limits usually varied between 8 to 12 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours, irrespective of whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Three guidance documents set a stricter limit of < 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours in cases where the patient was believed to be high risk for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Four discussed what to do in case of overcorrection, i.e. to stop current treatment and to consider re-lowering serum sodium concentration by starting hypotonic infusion and administering 1 to 4 μg desmopressin every 6 to 8 hours.

Results

Search results

We identified 1,402 citations, of which we excluded 1,367 after screening titles and abstracts because they did not meet our eligibility criteria (Figure 1). We assessed the full text of the remaining 39 citations and excluded 29 because they were not related to the diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia, were not clinical practice guidelines or consensus statements, or were guidelines replaced by an updated version (Additional file 4). Ultimately, we included five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Six of these documents were retrieved through searching the medical databases, the other four through the search of guideline databases and professional society websites.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the identification process for clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on hyponatremia.

Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the included clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. Eight national or regional organizations from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Spain, United States, Australia, and two international groups published these guidance documents between 2004 and 2014. One document specifically covered children, the others primarily targeted adults. Six groups reported undertaking a systematic review and appraisal of the evidence. Only three were explicit about the level of evidence that underpinned their recommendations, and only two graded the strength of the guidance recommendations themselves. Five guidance documents covered hyponatremia broadly; one specifically covered it in the setting of primary care, one in liver cirrhosis, one in neurosurgery, and one in exercise-associated hyponatremia. Three included treatment only, the seven others covered diagnosis as well. Two groups reported funding by a governmental institution, one by the professional societies they represented; the others did not report their funding sources.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^1114bcWT]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L -1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity. It is reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in environments in which medical care is limited and often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. To mitigate the risk of EAH mismanagement, care providers in the prehospital and in hospital settings must differentiate from other causes that present with similar signs and symptoms. EAH most commonly has overlapping signs and symptoms with heat exhaustion and exertional heat stroke. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of worsened morbidity and mortality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH management, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel in May 2018. The panel was charged with updating the WMS Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia published in 2014 using evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, recognition, and treatment of EAH. Recommendations are made based on presenting with symptomatic EAH, particularly when point-of-care blood sodium testing is unavailable in the field. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balanced between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^113MJDb8]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Urea for hyponatremia? [^113wC389]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Once the standard of care for cerebral edema, urea can also be used to treat hyponatremia. The 2014 European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend urea for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, while discouraging use of vasopressin antagonists. Although there is evidence that urea can diminish hypertonic injury to brain cells caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia, clinical trials are needed that include patients at high risk to develop complications from overcorrection.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^113zdkPK]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^1162Mnj7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In patients with chronic hyponatremia plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination.
Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds:

Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea.
Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact:

In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^113yKRTX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Lack of data on the role of correcting serum sodium for fracture prevention cannot justify treatment of hyponatremia with a sole purpose of lowering fracture risk. However, emerging data have demonstrated that resolution of chronic mild hyponatremia can lead to improvement in various neurocognitive aspects; thus, factors, including older age, history or high risk of falls and presence of gait or cognition disturbances, increase the likelihood that reversal of hyponatremia will be beneficial for these patients. In addition, the probability that normalization of serum sodium will lead to significant BMD improvement and fracture risk reduction is higher in subgroups, such as premenopausal females and younger individuals without major risk factors for osteoporosis. This suggestion is based on the rationale that the higher the likely contribution of hyponatremia to osteoporosis, the more likely that its restoration will improve bone metabolism. In total, the decision about correcting hyponatremia should be taken on a case-to-case basis, based on a benefit-risk ratio and always in tandem with seeking the underlying cause of hyponatremia. Determining the cause of hyponatremia is of paramount importance because it will facilitate its successful treatment and it may also reveal an unknown underlying medical condition with potentially significant sequalae. In view of the scarcity of data about the impact of hyponatremia on response to antiosteoporotic treatment, treatment of osteoporosis in patients with hyponatremia should be similar with that in normonatraemic patients in terms of the choice of treatment modality for osteoporosis, the duration of treatment, decisions about switching therapy and frequency and mode of monitoring.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have consistently demonstrated the common prevalence of hyponatremia in the hospital and intensive care settings, and how it correlates with untoward outcomes. This review discusses the classification, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of hyponatremia and how these agents may influence its management, and also examines the available treatment options and their weaknesses and strengths.

Recent Findings

This review is timely and relevant, as mild degrees of serum sodium lowering may be associated with adverse neurologic and musculoskeletal effects. These findings have the potential to transform our approach to managing hyponatremia. A major advance in our ability to treat hyponatremia was the introduction and approval of aquaretics (vaptans). Emerging data on vaptans and their potential role to treat hyponatremia in the settings of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis are presented.

Summary

Vaptans will likely play an important role in treating hyponatremia, given their clinical effectiveness and tolerability. Cost remains a hindrance for vaptans, and more studies are needed to further define their best utilization in hyponatremic patients.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2014 update [^112NVUpq]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol/L that occurs during or up to 24 hours after prolonged physical activity. It is reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in austere environments in which medical care is limited and often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to ensure a positive outcome. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of event-related fatality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH in the austere environment, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel. The panel was charged with the development of evidence-based guidelines for management of EAH. Recommendations are made regarding the situations when sodium concentration can be assessed in the field and when these values are not known. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balance between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians. This is an updated version of the original WMS Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia published in Wilderness & Environmental Medicine 2013;24(3):228–240.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

- a combination of low-dose loop diuretics and oral sodium chloride.

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

### Hyponatremia in the cancer patient [^1135vqck]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder observed in a wide variety of malignancies and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newer cancer therapies have improved patient outcomes while contributing to new cases of hyponatremia. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of vasopressin- and non-vasopressin-mediated hyponatremia. Acute and symptomatic forms of hyponatremia require urgent intervention, and recent findings support the correction of chronic "asymptomatic" hyponatremia. Optimizing hyponatremia may reduce medical costs, and improve cancer survival likelihood and quality of life. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hyponatremia in the cancer patient.
