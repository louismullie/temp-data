## Question

Dexamethasone suppression test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the dexamethasone suppression test, including indications, protocols, interpretation, pitfalls, special populations, and a practical algorithm for adrenal incidentalomas and primary aldosteronism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where DST is indicated. Then, I should verify the standard protocols and dosing. Next, I will review interpretation thresholds and the role of confirmatory testing. After that, I need to check for confounders and assay issues that can invalidate results. Then, I will consider special populations such as obesity, pregnancy, and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where DST is appropriate. For suspected Cushing's syndrome, DST is one of four first-line screening tests alongside 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, and the 48-hour low-dose DST, with the choice tailored to patient factors and local expertise [^112uPwWn] [^117CkvtN]. For adrenal incidentalomas, guidelines recommend screening all patients with adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm for autonomous cortisol secretion using a 1-mg overnight DST, with repeat testing to confirm autonomy when positive and avoidance in frail patients with limited life expectancy [^111JfTtP] [^117J8TnM] [^115QajGd]. In primary aldosteronism with an adrenal adenoma, a 1-mg DST is suggested to screen for concomitant autonomous cortisol secretion, given its frequency and implications for perioperative management and adrenal venous sampling planning [^111xxMg8] [^111VEHJW] [^117CKyYz].

> Wait, let me verify the standard protocol details so I don't gloss over timing. The overnight 1-mg DST is administered as 1 mg dexamethasone orally between 23:00 and 24:00, with serum cortisol measured between 08:00 and 09:00 the next morning; higher single doses do not meaningfully improve accuracy, so 1 mg is standard [^1133KDru] [^114NbWBh]. The 48-hour low-dose DST uses 0.5 mg every 6 hours for 48 hours, with cortisol measured 6 hours after the last dose; pediatric dosing is weight-based at 30 µg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for children under 40 kg, while those over 40 kg follow the adult protocol and threshold [^114jSrxB]. I should double-check that both approaches remain acceptable first-line options depending on patient suitability and local practice patterns [^112uPwWn].

> I need to ensure the interpretation thresholds are precise. Suppression to a post-dexamethasone serum cortisol ≤ 50 nmol/L (≤ 1.8 µg/dL) effectively excludes autonomous cortisol secretion and is the most sensitive cutoff, whereas values > 50 nmol/L indicate failure to suppress and raise concern for Cushing's syndrome or mild autonomous cortisol secretion; in patients without overt Cushingoid features, post-DST cortisol > 50 nmol/L is categorized as mild autonomous cortisol secretion without further gradation by degree of non-suppression [^113E1RW2] [^116syqo1] [^113LtEyi]. Hold on, I should verify that this threshold applies across screening contexts; yes, it is used for both general Cushing's screening and for adrenal incidentalomas, with the caveat that clinical correlation is essential in incidentalomas [^113E1RW2] [^117J8TnM].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing strategy so I don't jump to conclusions from a single abnormal DST. Abnormal screening results should be confirmed with a different first-line test such as UFC or late-night salivary cortisol, and concordant abnormalities warrant etiologic evaluation; discordant results or suspected cyclic disease call for repeat testing or alternative modalities rather than immediate imaging or invasive procedures [^112uPwWn] [^114EPhue] [^111uJ4ab]. Let me consider special confirmatory tools: the dexamethasone-CRH test can help in equivocal cases, but it requires careful timing and assay performance, and its incremental value over standard LDDST has been questioned in some studies, so I should reserve it for select scenarios [^112FfFso] [^1155w5jK] [^116FQrRd].

> I will now examine pitfalls and confounders that can invalidate DST, because false positives and negatives are common if I don't check these. Concurrent exogenous glucocorticoids, CYP3A4 inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, and barbiturates, and inhibitors like ketoconazole can markedly alter dexamethasone metabolism and lead to invalid results; measuring serum dexamethasone at the time of cortisol sampling helps verify adequate exposure and adherence, with a practical threshold around > 140 ng/mL, and low dexamethasone levels are frequently due to nonadherence, drug interactions, or malabsorption [^114KPJ6P] [^114xqX2i] [^115Fgtxc]. But wait, what if total cortisol is misleading due to binding proteins? Estrogen therapy and oral contraceptives raise CBG and can artifactually elevate total cortisol without increasing bioactive cortisol; in this setting, measuring free cortisol or using salivary cortisol/cortisone can reduce false positives, and a 48-hour low-dose DST may outperform the 1-mg test in women on oral contraceptives [^115ifiVY] [^114KPJ6P] [^115ro5Ak].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with obesity, because I recall older concerns about dexamethasone distribution. Initially, I thought obesity might reduce plasma dexamethasone levels and cause false positives; however, more recent controlled data show no significant difference in plasma dexamethasone concentrations between obese and optimal-weight participants, supporting the validity of the 1-mg DST in obesity while still emphasizing attention to drug interactions and adherence [^113kuuaf] [^114viuiM]. I should confirm that specificity remains acceptable in severe obesity cohorts; indeed, specificity around 92–97% has been reported in class 3 obesity, reinforcing the test's utility when interpreted carefully [^114viuiM] [^115bHuXQ].

> Pregnancy requires a different approach, so I need to check those nuances. Circadian variation is preserved but shifted upward, and dexamethasone suppression is blunted, increasing false-positive rates; therefore, UFC is preferred in pregnancy, and if DST is used, results must be interpreted with great caution and in clinical context [^113SkJq5]. Hold on, I should verify that nocturnal sampling strategies are also affected; yes, late-night salivary cortisol thresholds are not established in pregnancy, further limiting non-UFC options during gestation [^113SkJq5].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm dosing and thresholds. Children under 40 kg should receive 30 µg/kg/day dexamethasone divided every 6 hours for 48 hours, whereas those over 40 kg follow the adult 1-mg overnight protocol and the ≤ 1.8 µg/dL suppression threshold; midnight salivary cortisol is a useful adjunct in children, and clinical features such as growth failure and hypertension should guide pretest probability and test selection [^114jSrxB] [^1137NcU9]. Let me reconsider whether the 1-mg overnight test alone is sufficient in children; guidelines still endorse it as a screening option, but confirmation with a second test remains prudent when results are abnormal or clinical suspicion is high [^112uPwWn].

> Now, I should synthesize the adrenal incidentaloma algorithm so it is actionable. Screen all patients with adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm with a 1-mg overnight DST, avoid testing in frail patients with limited life expectancy, and if post-DST cortisol is ≤ 50 nmol/L, autonomous cortisol secretion is excluded; if > 50 nmol/L, repeat DST to confirm autonomy and assess for comorbidities attributable to cortisol excess to guide management decisions, including consideration of adrenalectomy in appropriate surgical candidates [^111JfTtP] [^117J8TnM] [^115QajGd]. I should double-check that no additional biochemical stratification by degree of non-suppression is recommended in asymptomatic patients; ENSAT/ESE advises treating > 50 nmol/L as mild autonomous cortisol secretion without further gradation in this context [^113LtEyi].

> For primary aldosteronism with an adrenal adenoma, I need to ensure the screening step is explicit. Perform a 1-mg overnight DST in all such patients because concomitant autonomous cortisol secretion is not rare and alters perioperative planning and AVS interpretation; a positive test should prompt full evaluation for Cushing's syndrome per Endocrine Society guidance, and measuring early postoperative morning cortisol helps anticipate glucocorticoid needs after adrenalectomy [^111xxMg8] [^111VEHJW] [^112KfWjM]. Hold on, I should verify cost and feasibility considerations; the panel notes DST is inexpensive and acceptable, and repeating AVS due to uninterpretable results is far costlier, supporting routine screening in this setting [^114ccn1V].

> Let me summarize key takeaways to ensure nothing critical is missing. Use the 1-mg overnight DST as a convenient, highly sensitive screening tool for hypercortisolism, confirm abnormal results with a different first-line test, and interpret results in light of confounders such as CYP3A4 inducers, oral estrogens, and adherence; measure serum dexamethasone when results are unexpected to validate exposure, and tailor test selection in special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics [^112uPwWn] [^113E1RW2] [^114xqX2i] [^113SkJq5]. I should confirm that the ≤ 1.8 µg/dL suppression threshold remains the most sensitive and widely endorsed cutoff across these contexts; yes, it is consistently recommended for initial screening and for defining mild autonomous cortisol secretion in adrenal incidentalomas [^116syqo1] [^113LtEyi].

---

The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is a **first-line screening tool** [^117CkvtN] for Cushing's syndrome, using the 1-mg overnight protocol [^1133KDru] with a serum cortisol threshold of ≤ 1.8 μg/dL (≤ 50 nmol/L) to exclude autonomous cortisol secretion [^116syqo1]. It is simple, widely available, and highly sensitive [^116cUbma], but **false positives can occur** with stress, depression, obesity, or estrogen therapy [^114KPJ6P] [^115ifiVY], and false negatives with dexamethasone malabsorption or drug interactions [^114KPJ6P]; measuring dexamethasone levels improves accuracy [^114xqX2i] [^114KPJ6P]. Abnormal results should be confirmed with a second test (UFC or late-night salivary cortisol) [^114EPhue] and, if positive, followed by ACTH measurement and imaging to localize the cause [^112uPwWn].

---

## Clinical indications

The DST is indicated to screen for **Cushing's syndrome** in patients with:

- **Clinical features**: Central obesity, moon facies, striae, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, or unexplained weight gain [^112uPwWn] [^117LvThi].

- **Adrenal incidentalomas**: Evaluate for autonomous cortisol secretion [^111JfTtP] [^117J8TnM].

- **Primary aldosteronism**: Screen for concomitant autonomous cortisol secretion in adrenal adenomas [^111xxMg8] [^111VEHJW].

---

## Protocols and procedures

Several DST protocols exist; the most commonly used are the **overnight 1-mg DST** and the **48-hour low-dose DST**.

| **Test** | **Protocol** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Overnight 1-mg DST | - 1 mg dexamethasone orally at 11 pm <br/> - Measure serum cortisol at 8 am next morning [^1133KDru] | Suppression ≤ 1.8 μg/dL (50 nmol/L) excludes autonomous cortisol secretion [^116syqo1] |
| 48-hour low-dose DST | - 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours <br/> - Measure serum cortisol at 8 am after last dose [^114jSrxB] | Suppression ≤ 1.8 μg/dL (50 nmol/L) excludes autonomous cortisol secretion [^notfound] |

---

## Interpretation of results

- **Suppression ≤ 1.8 μg/dL (50 nmol/L)**: Normal response, excludes autonomous cortisol secretion [^113E1RW2] [^116syqo1].

- **Suppression > 1.8 μg/dL (50 nmol/L)**: Suggests autonomous cortisol secretion; confirm with second test (UFC or late-night salivary cortisol) [^114EPhue].

- **Mild autonomous cortisol secretion**: Post-dexamethasone cortisol > 1.8 μg/dL without overt Cushing's features [^113LtEyi].

---

## Factors influencing test accuracy

Several factors can affect DST accuracy:

- **False positives**: Stress, depression, obesity, estrogen therapy, oral contraceptives, liver/renal impairment [^114KPJ6P] [^115ifiVY].

- **False negatives**: Dexamethasone malabsorption, drug interactions (CYP3A4 inducers), poor adherence [^notfound].

- **Assay interference**: Cross-reactivity with synthetic glucocorticoids or altered cortisol-binding proteins [^114KPJ6P] [^115ifiVY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The Endocrine Society recommends the **1-mg overnight DST** as a first-line screening test for Cushing's syndrome, with confirmation of abnormal results using a second test (UFC or late-night salivary cortisol) [^112uPwWn] [^117CkvtN]. The European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) similarly recommends the 1-mg DST for adrenal incidentalomas and primary aldosteronism with adrenal adenomas [^117J8TnM].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Specificity**: Limited by false positives in stress, depression, obesity, and estrogen therapy [^114KPJ6P] [^115ifiVY].

- **Sensitivity**: Rare false negatives in dexamethasone malabsorption or drug interactions [^114KPJ6P] [^117UDbor].

- **Assay variability**: Differences in cortisol assays and lack of standardized dexamethasone measurement [^112karUa] [^111jFFHt].

---

## Alternative and complementary tests

- **Urinary free cortisol (UFC)**: Highly specific, less sensitive than DST [^116cUbma].

- **Late-night salivary cortisol**: Non-invasive, detects loss of diurnal rhythm [^111jFFHt] [^112fUTm1].

- **Dexamethasone-CRH test**: Useful in equivocal cases, differentiates Cushing's disease from pseudo-Cushing states [^112FfFso] [^114mkUHB].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal results

Abnormal DST results require further evaluation to confirm **hypercortisolism** and identify the cause. Confirmatory testing with UFC or late-night salivary cortisol is essential [^114EPhue]; if results are positive, measure **plasma ACTH** to distinguish ACTH-dependent from ACTH-independent causes, followed by imaging (**MRI or CT**) to localize the source [^116LF6pP]. Management depends on the etiology and may include surgery, medical therapy, or radiotherapy [^notfound].

---

The DST is a **useful screening tool** for Cushing's syndrome, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and confirmed with additional tests.

### Cushing's disease, pseudo-Cushing States and the dexamethasone test: a historical and critical review [^1151FApR]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

The dexamethasone (DXM) test has been widely used for diagnosing Cushing's disease (CD). The purpose of this paper is to review its diagnostic merit based on calculation of data extracted from earlier publications. Studies presenting individual values for patients with CD and normal subjects were identified through PubMed searches and references in pertinent studies. Calculation of the retrieved data demonstrated huge variation in the relative suppressibility, negative suppression being common. Furthermore, in almost each study retrieved, the pre and post DXM values were closely correlated. Finally, the generally accepted view that DXM causes less suppression in Cushing's disease than in euadrenal controls appears unfounded. A central issue in the definition of so-called "pseudo-Cushing's states" is failure to suppress cortisol secretion with DXM. From analysis of the literature it appears quite possible that this does not reflect a specific endocrine deficit, but a physiological "stress" reaction. The above issues question the diagnostic value of the test, in particular in clinically and biochemically borderline cases.

Dexamethasone suppression testing — assay interference and thresholds: Variable absorption and metabolism of dexamethasone may influence the result of both the overnight 1-mg DST and the 48-h, 2 mg/d test. Conversely, dexamethasone clearance may be reduced in patients with liver and/or renal failure. To evaluate for false-positive and negative responses, some experts have advocated simultaneous measurement of both serum cortisol and dexamethasone for these tests to ensure adequate plasma dexamethasone concentrations [> 5.6 nmol/liter (0.22 μg/dl)], and false-positive rates for the overnight DST are seen in 50% of women taking the oral contraceptive pill because of increased CBG levels.

Cushing's syndrome — 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST) procedure and cutoffs: The DST is "a simple outpatient test", in which "1 mg dexamethasone is usually given between 2300 and 2400 h, and cortisol is measured between 0800 and 0900 the following morning". "Higher doses (1.5 or 2 mg) do not significantly improve the accuracy of the test". Suppression cutoffs measured by radioimmunoassay range "from 3.6 to 7.2 μg/dl (100–200 nmol/liter)", and "a widely cited normal response is a serum cortisol less than 5 μg/dl (< 140 nmol/liter)". In endogenous Cushing's, there is "failure of this suppression" with low-dose dexamethasone.

Primary aldosteronism and adrenal adenoma — dexamethasone suppression test recommendation and protocol: In individuals with primary aldosteronism (PA) and adrenal adenoma, we suggest a dexamethasone suppression test (2 | ⊕OOO). A dexamethasone suppression test should be performed, and a positive test should prompt further evaluation for Cushing syndrome as detailed in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines. For the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, 1 mg dexamethasone is taken orally at 23:00 to 24:00 with serum cortisol measured at 08:00 to 09:00 the next morning, and a serum cortisol > 1.8 ug/dL (50 nmol/L) suggests autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS).

Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) protocol and pediatric dosing: Dexamethasone is given in doses of 0.5 mg for 48 h, beginning at 0900 h on d 1, at 6-h intervals, i.e. at 0900, 1500, 2100, and 0300 h, and serum cortisol is measured at 0900 h, 6 h after the last dose of dexamethasone. An alternative protocol administers 48 h of dexamethasone at 6-h intervals but begins at 1200 h and obtains serum cortisol at 0800 h, exactly 2 h (rather than 6 h) after the last dexamethasone dose. For pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg, the initial adult protocol and the adult threshold for normal suppression [< 50 nmol/liter (1.8 µg/dl)] are used, whereas for patients weighing less than 40 kg the dose is adjusted to 30 µg/kg/d in divided doses.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113E1RW2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) — cutoff and accuracy: To enhance sensitivity, a lower cutoff for suppression of postdexamethasone serum cortisol to less than 1.8 µg/dl (50 nmol/liter) to achieve sensitivity rates of greater than 95% is advocated. At the 1.8 µg/dl cutoff, the sensitivity is high with specificity rates of 80%; specificity increases to greater than 95% if the diagnostic threshold is raised to 5 µg/dl (140 nmol/liter). Accordingly, we recommend use of the more stringent cutoff of 1.8 µg/dl. Prior approaches misclassified up to 15% of such patients as negative, and in adults this test has similar performance as the others recommended for initial testing, while although the 1-mg overnight test is used as a screening test for pediatric patients, there are no specific data regarding its interpretation or performance in this population.

### The dexamethasone suppression test as a predictor of suicidal behavior in unipolar depression [^112vG7nm]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-suppression on the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in unipolar depression has been found to be associated with completed suicide, with less consistent data for attempted suicide and hospitalizations for suicidality. The purpose of this study was to examine DST non-suppression as a predictor of these three aspects of suicidal behavior.

Methods

Records were reviewed for 101 patients who met criteria for major depressive disorder and/or dysthymic disorder and had a DST performed. All patients were treated naturalistically and were followed for an average of 2 years. DST suppressors and non-suppressors were compared with respect to three outcomes: (1) completed suicide; (2) attempted suicide; and (3) hospitalizations for suicidality.

Results

DST non-suppressors were significantly more likely to have completed suicide or be hospitalized for suicidality than DST suppressors, with a non-significant trend for attempts. Total suicidal events were also significantly more frequent in the non-suppressor group.

Limitations

Axis II diagnoses and severity of illness were not assessed. Knowledge of DST results may have influenced the decision to hospitalize patients.

Conclusions

DST non-suppression identifies unipolar depressed patients with a higher risk for future suicide completion or hospitalization for suicidality. Performance of DST upon initiation of treatment may be a useful adjunct in identifying suicidal risk.

Dexamethasone-CRH test (48-h, 2 mg/d low-dose dexamethasone suppression test with CRH) — protocol and performance: The protocol states CRH is given "1 µg/kg, iv, 2 h after the last dose of dexamethasone. Cortisol is measured 15 min later". In early data, patients who suppressed pre-CRH cortisol "to less than 1.4 µg/dl (< 38 nmol/liter; sensitivity 86%) were properly characterized after CRH administration". Across later studies, "in 92 patients without Cushing's syndrome, the specificity of the LDDST was 70% (95% confidence interval 63–87%), compared with a 60% specificity for the dexamethasone-CRH test (95% confidence interval 59–79%). In 59 patients with Cushing's syndrome, sensitivity was 96% for the LDDST and 98% for the dexamethasone-CRH test".

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115Gnoq3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

7.2 96‐h Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST)

As adrenal androgen production is regulated by ACTH, hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis suppression with dexamethasone can be used to confirm an adrenal source of androgen excess in selected cases. Androgen suppression confirms the presence of ACTH‐dependent hyperandrogenism and is also a clear indication of benign disease. In principle, suppression of DHEAS after dexamethasone implies that adrenal androgen secretion remains under the control of ACTH, and therefore strongly legislates against ACTH‐independent malignant disease such as adrenocortical carcinoma. As DHEAS is exclusively of adrenal gland origin, dexamethasone suppression testing is not generally needed when DHEAS is the sole androgen that is elevated. Additionally, patients with an adrenal mass and clear biochemical elevation of adrenal androgen excess do not require this test and should proceed to adrenalectomy. However, it has a diagnostic role in those patients with normal adrenal imaging with a biochemical picture suggestive of adrenal origin, for example, preferential elevation in DHEAS.

Exceptionally rarely, androgen excess from bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia has been reported, either in isolation or with concomitant glucocorticoid excess. For optimal androgen suppression that accounts for the 22h half‐life of DHEAS, the test should be undertaken as a prolonged protocol by administration of dexamethasone 0.5mg every 6h for 4 days, with androgens measured at baseline and on the morning of the fifth day. This suppresses androgens with less variability compared to 24, 48 and 72 h of dexamethasone. Androgen suppression by over 50% of the basal value supports adrenal androgen dominance.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112karUa]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Cushing's syndrome, more specifically with respect to subsequent laboratory testing, ES 2008 guidelines recommend to confirm abnormal results on initial laboratory testing using a different test drawn from the recommended initial tests (urine free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, or longer low-dose dexamethasone suppression test).

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Jpjpd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST; 48-h, 2 mg/d) — diagnostic performance: Some endocrinologists prefer to use the 48-h, 2 mg/d low-dose DST (LDDST) as an initial test because of its improved specificity as compared with the 1-mg test. Using 17OHCS or UFC, sensitivity and specificity rates are less than 70–80%. With a cutoff value for suppression of 50 nmol/liter (1.8 µg/ dl), the initially reported sensitivity was greater than 95% for adult patients, and with this approach the sensitivity for Cushing's syndrome in 36 pediatric patients was 94%. With a slightly different protocol and a lower cortisol criterion [38 nmol/liter (1.4 µg/dl)], the sensitivity was 90%. Subsequent data show that in 92 patients without Cushing's syndrome, the specificity of the LDDST was 70% (95% confidence interval 69–87%), while in 59 patients with Cushing's syndrome, sensitivity was 96% for the LDDST. Methodologic considerations include that at least 2 wk of abstinence from alcohol are needed to reduce the false-positive rate and that in healthy volunteers dexamethasone levels 2 h after the last dose were 13.0 ± 6.1 nmol/liter (469.5 ± 220.4 pg/dl).

### The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test: a reevaluation in patients with Cushing's syndrome [^115p1pcz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing has been recommended for biochemical screening when Cushing's syndrome is suspected. The criterion for normal suppression of cortisol after dexamethasone is controversial. To assess diagnostic utility (sensitivity), we report the results of low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing in 103 patients with spontaneous Cushing's syndrome. There were 80 patients with Cushing's disease (78%), 13 with the ectopic ACTH syndrome (13%), and 10 with cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas (10%). Fourteen (18%) of 80 patients with Cushing's disease suppressed serum cortisol to less than 5 micro g/dl (< 135 nmol/liter) after the overnight 1-mg test, whereas six patients (8%) actually showed suppression of serum cortisol to less than 2 micro g/dl (< 54 nmol/liter). In addition, the 2-d, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test yielded false-negative results in 38% of patients when urine cortisol was used and 28% when urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids were used. Serum cortisol after the 1-mg test correlated with baseline urinary free cortisol (r = 0.705, P < 0.001), plasma ACTH level (r = 0.322, P = 0.001), and urinary free cortisol after the 2-d test (r = 0.709, P = 0.001). This study provides evidence that low-dose dexamethasone may suppress either plasma cortisol or urinary steroids to levels previously thought to exclude Cushing's syndrome and that these tests should not be used as the sole criterion to exclude the diagnosis of endogenous hypercortisolism.

Cyclic Cushing's syndrome — test selection and follow-up emphasizes that dexamethasone suppression tests (DST) are not recommended when cyclic hypercortisolism is suspected, because results may be normal during cycling; instead, urinary free cortisol (UFC) or salivary cortisol may best demonstrate cyclicity, and when clinical suspicion is high but initial tests are normal, follow-up with repeat testing timed to symptoms is recommended.

- patients with a low clinical index of suspicion of CS, but abnormal dexamethasone suppression testing and mildly elevated urinary free cortisol

- patients who fail to suppress on dexamethasone testing due to anticonvulsant medication.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113yNRnH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage the Task Force incorporated needed changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome, particularly those with a high discriminatory value, and patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test). We recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome. Patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation. We recommend additional testing in patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various corticosteroids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

In acute, self-limited allergic disorders or acute exacerbations of chronic allergic disorders, the following dosage schedule combining parenteral and oral therapy is suggested: Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate injection, USP 4 mg per mL:

First Day

1 or 2 mL, intramuscularly

Dexamethasone Tablets, USP, 1.5 mg, one-half tablet:

Second Day

2 tablets in two divided doses

Third Day

2 tablets in two divided doses

Fourth Day

1 tablet in two divided doses

Fifth Day

One half tablet

Sixth Day

One half tablet

Seventh Day

No treatment

Eighth Day

Follow-up visit

This schedule is designed to ensure adequate therapy during acute episodes, while minimizing the risk of overdosage in chronic cases.

In cerebral edema, Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate injection, USP is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For palliative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate injection, USP or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective.

Dexamethasone suppression tests:

1. Tests for Cushing's syndrome.

Give 1 mg of Dexamethasone USP orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning.

For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of Dexamethasone USP orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.

2. Test to distinguish Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary AGTH excess from Cushing's syndrome due to other causes.

Give 2 mg of Dexamethasone USP orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.

### Overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test for screening Cushing syndrome and mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS): what happens when serum dexamethasone is below cutoff? How frequent is it? [^114xqX2i]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the frequency of "invalid" 1-mg overnight dexamethasone (Dex) suppression tests (DSTs) (1-mg DST) on a large series of patients investigated for hypercortisolism and examine the interference of substances and clinical conditions that may explain low serum Dex levels.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 1300 Dex-controlled 1-mg DST applied to patients screened for Cushing syndrome or mild autonomous cortisol secretion in a single center for which there were identified invalid tests and distinctive characteristics that may have interfered with the outcome.

Results

Among all tests, 146 (11.2%) were considered invalid (serum Dex levels < 140 ng/dL, 36 [24.7%] of which were undetectable [< 19.5 ng/dL]). In the Dex-undetectable group, 17% failed to take Dex correctly, 25% were on glucocorticoids (GCs), and 20% were on anticonvulsants and moderate CYP3A4 inducers. In the remaining 110 tests (serum Dex 20–140 ng/dL), 6.5% did not take Dex or were using GC, 22% were on anticonvulsants or CYP3A4 inducers, and another 13% had previous gastrointestinal tract abnormalities impairing drug absorption.

Conclusion

Inappropriately low serum Dex levels during the 1-mg DST may lead to false-positive results. This is associated with recurrent use of CYP3A4-inducing drugs and/or gastrointestinal abnormalities. When serum Dex is undetectable, the key reason is failure to take the medication or the use of GC (when cortisol is suppressed). Simultaneous measurement of serum cortisol and Dex allows for DST validation, improving its accuracy and avoiding unnecessary repetitions. Adherence to verbal/written recommendations and actual use of medication are critical for interpreting the test.

### Dexamethasone-suppressed cortisol awakening response predicts treatment outcome in posttraumatic stress disorder [^113WSoQo]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with several alterations in the neuroendocrine system, including enhanced cortisol suppression in response to the dexamethasone suppression test. The aim of this study was to examine whether specific biomarkers of PTSD predict treatment success in trauma-focused psychotherapy.

Methods

Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial comparing two forms of trauma-focused psychotherapy. Basal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and the response to the dexamethasone suppression test were assessed pre-treatment in 24 PTSD patients. Treatment success was measured by pre- to post-treatment decrease in self-reported PTSD severity.

Results

A more suppressed cortisol curve after dexamethasone significantly predicted greater PTSD symptom decrease in trauma-focused psychotherapy, independent of the effects of gender, pre-treatment PTSD symptom severity, and trauma history. Basal early morning cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate did not predict treatment response.

Limitations

The number of participants who completed the neuroendocrine measurements was small and a significant number of participants fulfilled criteria of co-morbid major depressive disorder.

Conclusions

This study suggests the use of the dexamethasone-suppression test for the cortisol awakening response as a biomarker for treatment response to trauma-focused psychotherapy. Measures of HPA-axis sensitivity appear to be an important predictor of positive clinical response in PTSD patients, and may lead to biomarker-based treatment matching in the future.

### Interpretation of abnormal dexamethasone suppression test is enhanced with use of synchronous free cortisol assessment [^115ifiVY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Interpretation of dexamethasone suppression test (DST) may be influenced by dexamethasone absorption and metabolism and by the altered cortisol binding.

Objective

We aimed to determine the normal ranges of free cortisol during DST in participants without adrenal disorders and to identify the population of patients where post-DST free cortisol measurements add value to the diagnostic workup.

Design and Setting

Cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary medical center.

Participants

Adult volunteers without adrenal disorders (n = 168; 47 women on oral contraceptive therapy [OCP], 66 women not on OCP, 55 men) and patients undergoing evaluation for hypercortisolism (n = 196; 16 women on OCP).

Measurements

Post-DST dexamethasone and free cortisol (mass spectrometry) and total cortisol (immunoassay).

Main Outcome Measures

Reference range for post-DST free cortisol, diagnostic accuracy of post-DST total cortisol.

Results

Adequate dexamethasone concentrations (≥ 0.1 mcg/dL) were seen in 97.6% volunteers and 96.3% patients. Only 25.5% of women volunteers on OCP had abnormal post-DST total cortisol (> 1.8 mcg/dL). In volunteers, the upper post-DST free cortisol range was 48 ng/dL in men and women not on OCP, and 79 ng/dL in women on OCP. When compared with post-DST free cortisol, diagnostic accuracy of post-DST total cortisol was 87.3% (95% CI, 81.7–91.7); all false-positive results occurred in patients with post-DST cortisol between 1.8 and 5 mcg/dL. OCP use was the only factor associated with false-positive results (21.1% vs 4.9%, P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Post-DST free cortisol measurements are valuable in patients with optimal dexamethasone concentrations and post-DST total cortisol between 1.8 and 5 mcg/dL.

### Dexamethasone (decadron) [^114NbWBh]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration: DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 0.75 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 9 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue DECADRON®Elixir and transfer the patient to other therapy.

After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response.

Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily.

If the drug is to be stopped after more than a few days of treatment, it usually should be withdrawn gradually.

The following milligram equivalents facilitate changing to DECADRON®Elixir from other glucocorticoids:

### Discriminatory value of the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test in establishing the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome [^114Dme1m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome requires a screening test of high sensitivity, followed by biochemical evaluation of the source of the tumor when the cause is ACTH dependent. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is still in common use as an aid in differential diagnosis, although its value has been queried. We have routinely used the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test for many years in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome but noticed that patients with pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome or Cushing's disease, usually showed some degree of suppression of their serum cortisol, compared to those with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. We therefore analyzed retrospectively the serum cortisol responses during the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test and the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test in 245 patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and compared the diagnostic utility of each test either alone or in combination with a standard test using CRH. Evaluation of the serum cortisol response at 24 and 48 h during the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test correctly identified 98% of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and distinguished between pituitary and ectopic causes with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 79%. In the same patients, the serum cortisol response to the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test had a slightly higher sensitivity (91%) and specificity (80%). However, the combined criteria of a more than 30% suppression of serum cortisol during the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test and/or a more than 20% increase in the CRH test had a significantly higher sensitivity (97%) and specificity (94%) than either the high-dose dexamethasone or the CRH tests alone in the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. It produced equivalent information to that when high-dose and CRH test results were combined. We therefore conclude that in our patient series, the serum cortisol response during the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test is highly sensitive in diagnosing Cushing's syndrome and, combined with the results of the serum cortisol response to the CRH test, offered a safe and cost-effective test in the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. There does not appear to be any necessity for retaining the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test in this diagnostic work-up.

Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome, patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation, and we recommend additional testing for patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

### Dexamethasone 1.5 mg (dexamethasone) [^115Fgtxc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST): False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients being treated with indomethacin have been reported. Thus, results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients.

Digitalis Glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.

Ephedrine: Ephedrine may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.

Estrogens, including Oral Contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.

Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Dexamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP 3A4. Co-adminstration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration.

Regarding availability, "In the United States, ovine-sequence CRH is available commercially (ACTHREL; Ferring Corp, Malmo, Sweden) with Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling for the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome", whereas "In Europe, the human-sequence peptide is in widespread use (Ferring) but has lower stimulatory effect than the ovine-sequence peptide (95)".

### Overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test and 24 h urine free cortisol-accuracy and pitfalls when screening for Cushing's syndrome [^116kxSES]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) is often delayed due to variable clinical features and its rarity. Simple and accurate screening tests are required to enhance screening for hypercortisolism. Both overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and urinary free cortisol (UFC) demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CS. However, each test has its own distinctive features, making it preferable in specific clinical conditions. This review will discuss the pitfalls for each of those tests.

### Comparison of the dexamethasone-suppressed corticotropin-releasing hormone test and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome [^116FQrRd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Context

The low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) is widely used in confirming a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. CRH administration at the end of an LDDST has been reported to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this test.

Objective

Our objective was to assess whether CRH administration after a standard LDDST (LDDST-CRH test) improves diagnostic accuracy in Cushing's syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Thirty-six individuals with a clinical suspicion of Cushing's syndrome each completed a standard LDDST and an LDDST-CRH test at Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, London. The LDDST involved administration of 0.5 mg oral dexamethasone given 6-hourly for 48 h. Serum cortisol was measured 6 h after the last dose of dexamethasone, with a value of 50 nmol/liter or below excluding Cushing's syndrome. Immediately after this, the LDDST-CRH test commenced with administration of a ninth dose of 0.5 mg dexamethasone. Exactly 2 h later, 100 mug human-sequence CRH was administered. Serum cortisol was measured 15 min after the CRH injection, with a value of less than 38 nmol/liter also excluding Cushing's syndrome.

Main Outcome Measure

Diagnosis or exclusion of Cushing's syndrome was the main outcome measure.

Results

Twelve subjects were diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome (eight Cushing's disease and four primary adrenal). The sensitivity of the LDDST in diagnosing Cushing's syndrome was 100%, with a specificity of 88%. In contrast, although the sensitivity of the LDDST-CRH test was also 100%, specificity was reduced at 67%. These results give a positive predictive value of 80% for the LDDST and 60% for the LDDST-CRH test.

Conclusion

This small study suggests that the addition of CRH to the LDDST does not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the standard LDDST in Cushing's syndrome.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114ccn1V]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Autonomous cortisol secretion (ACS) screening in primary aldosteronism — implementation, costs, and panel rationale include that if the result is abnormal, 2 follow-up tests (24-hour urinary free cortisol and midnight salivary cortisol) are accessible and inexpensive; repeating AVS due to uninterpretable results is much more expensive (~$2000–3000 USD) than performing a 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (~$20); individuals rarely decline the test, and any adverse effects are transient as the medication is given only once; the panel based its recommendation on evidence that ACS is not uncommon in PA and can be detected by dexamethasone suppression testing, concluding that the balance of effects probably favors net benefit and that the test is feasible, acceptable, and cost-effective; benefits outweigh potential harms, resources required are minimal (dexamethasone tablets and a plasma cortisol test), and although no published cost-effectiveness studies were found, the test is relatively cheap and commonly ordered.

Third Day

2 tablets in two divided doses

Fourth Day

1 tablet in two divided doses

Fifth Day

One half tablet

Sixth Day

One half tablet

Seventh Day

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

### Dexamethasone intensol [^117UDbor]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST): False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients being treated with indomethacin have been reported. Thus, results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients.

Digitalis Glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.

Ephedrine: Ephedrine may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase in corticosteroid dosage.

Estrogens, Including Oral Contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.

Hepatic Enzyme Inducers, Inhibitors and Substrates: Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased. Drugs which inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids. Dexamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP 3A4. Co-adminstration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration.

### An early post-operative ACTH suppression test can safely predict short-and long-term remission after surgery of Cushing's disease [^116RW9ga]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cushing's disease is caused by hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by a pituitary adenoma resulting in hypercortisolism. Surgical adenomectomy is the first line of treatment. Postoperative remission is reported in 43–95% of cases depending of factors such as adenoma size, finding of pituitary adenoma on preoperative MRI and surgeons experience. However, there is no consensus on what laboratory assays and biochemical thresholds should be used in determining or predicting remission over time. Resolution of symptoms, urinary free cortisol (UFC), plasma cortisol nadir, plasma ACTH and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) are used in various constellations. At our center withdrawal of per operative glucocorticoid substitution is followed by a suppression test with betamethasone, 2 mg/day during 48 h, initiated on postoperative day 2 for an early evaluation of the effect of surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. Like dexamethasone, betamethasone is a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, which does not interfere in biochemical assays measuring plasma or urine cortisol. Potent synthetic glucocorticoids cause a significant feedback inhibition on ACTH, which could be expected to result in very low plasma cortisol levels if all adenoma tissue is removed, while adenoma residues left behind should still be less responsive causing continued ACTH production and elevated cortisol levels.

The rationale for exchange of peroperative glucocorticoid substitution to the present test protocol is twofold: (1) to achieve an early evaluation of the effect of surgery and (2) to avoid the risk for acute hypocortisolism without necessitating a high level of clinical surveillance. After completion of the test, patients are deemed in remission and given continued glucocorticoid substitution or considered uncured and thus not in need of substitution. The present retrospective study was undertaken to clarify the ability of this early suppression test to predict short- and long-term remission after surgery of Cushing's disease and to determine the optimal cut-off values of the laboratory analyses included in the test.

### In search of HPA axis dysregulation in child and adolescent depression [^114MvyQP]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2011). Low credibility.

The Dexamethasone Suppression Test

As a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone functions to suppress the production of CRH by the hypothalamus, as well as ACTH by the pituitary gland. Hence, cortisol levels following the administration of dexamethasone represent the sum of two opposing agents acting on the HPA axis to modulate adrenal production of the hormone: one to suppress cortisol's secretion (e.g. endogeneous cortisol and exogenous dexamethasone) and the other to stimulate it (e.g. exogenous stressors; Dahl et al.). Assuming the level of exogenous stress remains constant, a normative response to orally administered dexamethasone the night before leads to a profound decrease in cortisol levels during the next day, while incomplete levels of suppression or early escape from suppression indicate dysregulation within the HPA axis's negative feedback mechanism (e.g. Burke et al; Nicolson). Such dysregulation appears to reflect tonic HPA axis arousal and is usually considered an indication of hypercortisolemia (Lopez-Duran et al.).

The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was originally applied in the late 1960s as a laboratory diagnostic tool for major depression in adults (Carroll; Carroll et al.). In the decades since, the DST has become the most extensively studied biological parameter of depression in adult (Casat et al.), as well as in child and adolescent samples (Kaufman et al; Weller and Weller). In reviews of the use of the DST in adults, it has been estimated that between 50 and 60% of depressed inpatients and approximately 40% of outpatients have abnormally high levels of cortisol (reflecting blunted suppression) following the DST (APA; Carroll). Although the diagnostic utility of the DST has been questioned more recently due to its lower specificity in inpatient samples (e.g. Dahl et al; Luby et al; Pfeffer et al; Puig-Antich et al.), its cumulatively high sensitivity led the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Laboratory Tests in Psychiatry to conclude that the test may add to diagnostic reliability in adult patients suspected of having major depressive disorder. Moreover, it has been argued that the lack of specificity of the DST does not negate its clinical relevance. Given that adult studies have consistently demonstrated that heightened cortisol response to the DST is associated with more severe depressive symptomatology, it may serve as an index of clinical severity (e.g. Steingard et al.).

### A pilot study of adrenal suppression after dexamethasone therapy as an antiemetic in cancer patients [^115d3nAP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dexamethasone has a high therapeutic index when used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. However, the chronic use of glucocorticoids has been associated with suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, the authors designed this pilot study to assess the incidence of adrenal insufficiency after dexamethasone therapy as an antiemetic in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

Methods

The rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed in 103 cancer patients, who had been treated with high-dose dexamethasone as an antiemetic for more than 3 months. When response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test was abnormal, the patient received corticosteroid replacement by prednisolone 7.5 mg daily for 1–2 weeks and after prednisolone replacement, changes in symptoms associated with adrenal insufficiency were investigated using a visual analog scale.

Results

Forty-five of the 103 patients (43.7%) showed a suppressed adrenal response to the rapid ACTH stimulation test, and the incidence of adrenal suppression was found to be significantly affected by megestrol acetate use (P = 0.035). Thirty-three patients with a suppressed adrenal function achieved an improvement in quality of life after prednisolone replacement, as determined using a self-report questionnaire (22.9 ± 14.7 to 14.8 ± 11.0, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We suggest that suppression of adrenal response is common after antiemetic dexamethasone therapy in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

### Reevaluation of the combined dexamethasone suppression-corticotropin-releasing hormone test for differentiation of mild Cushing's disease from pseudo-Cushing's syndrome [^114mkUHB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

The diagnostic accuracy of the combined dexamethasone suppression test (DST)-CRH test for the differential diagnosis between Cushing's disease (CD) and pseudo-Cushing syndrome (PCS) has recently been debated.

Objective

Our objective was to reevaluate the performance of the DST-CRH test to differentiate CD from PCS and compare it with that of midnight plasma cortisol measurement.

Setting

The study took place at three specialized tertiary care university hospitals.

Design

Fourteen patients with PCS and 17 patients with CD matched for 24-h urinary free cortisol were retrospectively studied.

Main Outcome Measure

Diagnosis or exclusion of CD was the main outcome measure.

Results

A 55 nmol/liter cortisol concentration after dexamethasone (DST) yielded 94% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 90% diagnostic accuracy. Using the historical 38 nmol/liter threshold for plasma cortisol 15 min after CRH administration, the DST-CRH test achieved 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 77% diagnostic accuracy. Increasing the threshold to 110 nmol/liter improved the specificity and diagnostic accuracy to 86 and 93.5%, respectively. However, diagnostic accuracy was not significantly different from that of the DST. A midnight plasma cortisol concentration of more than 256 nmol/liter was consistent with the diagnosis of CD with 100% sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion

The diagnostic performance of the DST-CRH test for the differential diagnosis between PCS and mild CD was lower than previously reported. Although the specificity of the test is improved using a revised cortisol threshold, its diagnostic accuracy is not better than that of the standard DST. Our study supports the preferential use of the DST and midnight plasma cortisol measurement as first-line diagnostic tests in equivocal cases.

### Assessment of the utility of the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test in confirming the diagnosis of Cushing disease [^114TZXpq]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the utility of high-dose dexamethasone suppression (HDDS) tests to confirm the diagnosis of Cushing disease (CD).

Methods

In this retrospective study, we reviewed medical records of patients who underwent either the overnight 8-mg HDDS test or the 2-day 2-mg HDDS test every 6 hours. The percentage suppression of morning serum cortisol and the percentage suppression of 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) were calculated.

Results

Of 141 patients with proven CD who underwent HDDS tests, 77 (55%) underwent the overnight 8-mg HDDS test and 64 (45%) underwent the 2-day 2-mg HDDS test every 6 hours. With the overnight 8-mg HDDS test, 73 of 77 patients (95%) had greater than 50% suppression and 48 of 77 patients (62%) had greater than 80% suppression of the morning serum cortisol in comparison with the baseline value. With the 2-day 2-mg HDDS test, only 41 of 64 patients (64%) had greater than 90% suppression of 24-hour UFC.

Conclusion

We conclude that the overnight 8-mg HDDS test accurately confirmed the diagnosis of CD with a high sensitivity of 95% with use of a criterion of greater than 50% suppression; in contrast, the sensitivity was only 62% with use of a more precise cutoff of greater than 80% suppression. The 2-day 2-mg HDDS test with a criterion of greater than 90% suppression of 24-hour UFC had a sensitivity of 64%. These results confirm the limited precision of the HDDS tests.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116UyCqa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Alternative diagnostic tests — limited utility for initial diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: The diagnostic accuracy of various other tests previously advocated for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (urinary 17-ketosteroids, 1600 h or random serum cortisol levels, and the insulin tolerance test) is too low to recommend them for testing. Other tests, such as the loperamide test, have insufficient evidence for their diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, responses to etiologic tests (e.g. pituitary, adrenal or thoracic imaging, plasma ACTH concentration, CRH stimulation test, 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test) may be both abnormal in healthy people and normal in patients with Cushing's syndrome and therefore are not helpful in establishing the diagnosis.

### Dexamethasone-suppressed corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test for diagnosis of mild hypercortisolism [^116PtjAV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

The definitive diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) in the setting of mild disease, as well as exclusion of CS in the setting of conditions that might mimic this clinical entity (pseudo-Cushing's syndrome), continues to present a significant challenge to the clinician.

Objective

The aim of the study was to review characteristics of the combined dexamethasone-suppressed CRH stimulation test in patients evaluated at an academic center for the possibility of mild CS.

Design, Patients, and Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 66 patients. A total of 51 patients underwent final statistical analysis: 21 (41%) had Cushing's disease, and 30 were considered to have pseudo-CS based on the clinical scenario, comorbidities, and follow-up. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of cortisol and ACTH levels for the diagnosis of Cushing's disease were calculated at 1 min before, and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after CRH administration. Diagnostic cutoffs for each parameter were determined by minimizing the absolute difference between sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic accuracy was characterized by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, determined using the trapezoid rule.

Results

The highest diagnostic accuracy was provided by the serum ACTH level at 15 min post-CRH, in which the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 99.7%, and a cutoff of more than 27 pg/ml (> 5.9 pmol/liter) provided a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 97% for the diagnosis of CS. A 15-min post-CRH cortisol greater than 2.5 mug/dl (70 nmol/liter) provided a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 90%, respectively.

Conclusions

Our results differ from previous studies because our data suggest that when using the combined dexamethasone-suppressed CRH stimulation test, a 15-min post-CRH ACTH value greater than 27 pg/ml (5.9 pmol/liter) had the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of CS. However, the sensitivity and specificity for this test were not statistically different from the sensitivity and specificity of other tests, such as those measuring post-CRH stimulated ACTH levels or post-CRH cortisol levels at other time points. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious about interpretation of suppression and stimulation tests in the diverse population of patients with hypercortisolism.

### Cushing's syndrome: a practical approach to diagnosis and differential diagnoses [^112fUTm1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) and identification of the aetiology of hypercortisolism can be challenging. The Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines recommends one of the four tests for initial screening of CS, namely, urinary-free cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, overnight dexamethasone suppression test or a longer low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, for 48hours. Confirmation and localisation of CS requires additional biochemical and radiological tests. Radiological evaluation involves different imaging modalities including MRI with or without different radio-nuclear imaging techniques. Invasive testing such as bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling may be necessary in some patients for accurate localisation of the cause for hypercortisolism. This best practice review discusses a practical approach for the diagnostic evaluation of CS with a brief discussion on differential diagnoses, and cyclical CS, to enhance the skills of clinicians and laboratory personnel.

### Morning salivary cortisone versus serum cortisol in the overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODNST): evaluation in a clinical setting [^111jFFHt]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ONDST) is a well‐recognised test, that is, used to screen for cortisol excess (Cushing's syndrome). If there is failure to suppress cortisol, further investigation is required to confirm the diagnosis. However, there is no agreement on the gold standard test that should be used to screen for Cushing's syndrome.

Recent developments in mass spectrometry have meant that it is possible accurately to measure steroids such as cortisone in the saliva, specifically using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. There is increasing evidence to suggest that salivary cortisone levels can be determined to spare the patient coming into hospital for an ONDST.

In the salivary gland, corticosteroid 11‐beta‐dehydrogenase isozyme 2 converts cortisol into cortisone which is inactive. Cortisone is the favoured steroid for salivary measurements over cortisol because cortisol is naturally found at lower levels in the saliva. Furthermore, it has been shown to have a more linear correlation to total serum cortisol. It is also relevant that studies have shown that salivary cortisol can be affected by confounding factors such as topical preparations containing cortisol. However, salivary cortisone levels are not affected by such factors.

There are limitations of the ONDST. For example the majority of cortisol is bound in the blood to cortisol binding globulin hormone (CBG) and to albumin. The measurement of total serum cortisol is thus dependent on the level of binding proteins in an individual, which can vary for multiple reasons between individuals, including the taking of estrogen containing preparations, pregnancy, and sepsis. Furthermore individual differences in dexamethasone metabolism cannot be accounted for without parallel measurement of serum dexamethasone levels which is rarely done in eery day clinical practice Non‐bound serum cortisol would be a superior measure of circulating cortisol but this is offered by only a limited amount of laboratories, as it is much more labour intensive and complicated. An ONDST requires the patient to attend hospital or an alternative clinical setting for the blood test. Additionally, the act of drawing blood can trigger cortisol release due to stress adding another potential interference This less relevant in relation to morning than late evening blood tests. Provision of a salivary sample does not entail either of these issues.

We report the application of salivary cortisone measurements in comparison with serum cortisol measurements in the outpatient setting in individuals undergoing an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ONDST), using 1 mg dexamethasone taken orally at midnight with 0900 cortisol and salivary cortisone measurement on the following day.

### Accuracy of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome [^116cUbma]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

The diagnosis of Cushing syndrome (CS) can be challenging. It remains to be determined which diagnostic tests are the most accurate.

Objective

To summarize the accuracy of diagnostic tests for CS using contemporary meta-analytic techniques (hierarchical models).

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (inception until August 3, 2018).

Study Selection

Studies performed in adults that determined the accuracy of one or more diagnostic tests: overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST), 2-day low-dose DST (2d DST), 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), late-night salivary cortisol (LNSC), midnight serum cortisol (MSC), and the dexamethasone-suppressed CRH (dex-CRH) and desmopressin (dex-DDAVP) tests.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data and performed methodological assessments.

Data Synthesis

One hundred thirty-nine studies (14 140 participants) were included in the analysis. The respective sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) estimates include the following: DST 98.6% (96.9%-99.4%), 90.6% (86.4%-93.6%), 10.5 (7.2–15.3), and 0.016 (0.007–0.035); 2d DST 95.3% (91.3%-97.5%), 92.8% (85.7%-96.5%), 13.2 (6.47–27.1), and 0.051 (0.027–0.095); UFC 94.0% (91.6%-95.7%), 93.0% (89.0%-95.5%), 13.3 (8.47–21.0), and 0.065 (0.046–0.092); LNSC 95.8% (93.%-97.2%), 93.4% (90.7%-95.4%), 14.6 (10.3–20.7), and 0.045 (0.030–0.066); MSC 96.1% (93.5%-97.6%), 93.2% (88.1%-96.3%), 14.2 (7.96–25.2), and 0.042 (0.026–0.069); and dex-CRH 98.6% (90.4%-99.8%), 85.9% (67.6%-94.7%), 7.0 (2.80–17.6), and 0.016 (0.002–0.118). A single study evaluated dex-DDAVP. Meta-regression and a novel network meta-analytic approach suggest that DST is the most sensitive while UFC is the least sensitive.

Conclusions

All of the included diagnostic tests for CS are highly sensitive and specific. It appears that the DST is the most sensitive while the UFC is less sensitive. The specificity of all first-line tests appears comparable.

Dexamethasone suppression test

To assess dexamethasone feedback regulation of HPA activity, we performed a modified version of the dexamethasone suppression test. Mice of both genotypes were injected i.p. with 200 μl of vehicle [2% ethanol (BDH, Dorset, UK)/0.9% saline (Sigma-Aldritch)] at 13.00 h. Venesection of the tail was used to obtain blood samples from these animals at 19.00 h the same day (near peak of circadian rise in plasma corticosterone). Blood was collected and plasma prepared as above, and processed for corticosterone measurements. At 2-weekly intervals, the same mice were injected with 2 μg/kg or 10 μg/kg dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldritch) in approximately 200 μl vehicle at 13.00 h, followed by tail blood sampling at 19.00 h.

Statistical analysis

Adrenal weight, and gene expression data obtained from unstressed animals were analysed by an independent samples t-test to determine an effect of genotype. Plasma corticosterone and ACTH data from stress experiments were analysed by two-way analysis of variance (for the effects of time and genotype. Corticosterone data from dexamethasone suppression tests were analysed by a repeated measures design two-way. Post-hoc analysis was performed using the Tukey's honestly significant difference test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○)

Rationale

Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior. Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less reliable results in patients on shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking. Furthermore, most of the published studies using dynamic testing to diagnose glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency rely on ACTH (1–24) stimulation. The panel suggests against the use of the 1 µg ACTH (1–24) test since it does not provide better diagnostic accuracy than the standard 250 µg and there are no commercially available preparations of 1 µg ACTH (1–24). If dynamic testing is employed, it should be done after holding any glucocorticoid therapy for at least 24 hours to avoid interference in steroid measurements.

R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1. with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3. using high dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4. using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5. who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6. receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

### Performance of the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test in patients with severe obesity [^114viuiM]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the performance of the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients with obesity. Special attention was paid to the influence of interfering medication on DST.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study (Mannheim Obesity Study), patients with obesity were evaluated before bariatric surgery. For evaluation of hypercortisolism, a 1 mg dexamethasone-suppression test (DST) in all subjects was performed. Medication was assessed for possible interference.

Results

Two hundred seventy-eight patients with a mean age of 42.3 years (68.8% women) and a mean BMI of 47.9 ± 8.4 kg/m(2) were screened. Insufficient suppression of cortisol after DST was found in 24 patients (8.6%). In two patients hypercortisolism was confirmed. The specificity for DST was calculated at 92.0%. Only CYP3A4 inducers (n = 22, 7.9%) and estrogen therapy (n = 17, 6.1%) were significantly associated with falsely elevated cortisol after DST. Regression analysis excluded any interrelation between DST and anthropometry.

Conclusions

Low prevalence of hypercortisolism (0.7 or < 1.8%) was found. Specificity of DST in this cohort typically screened for hypercortisolism was 92.0% (≤ 50 nmol/L). DST should be avoided in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers or estrogen therapy, due to their significant interaction. In summary, the 1 mg DST is an adequate test for screening for hypercortisolism even in patients with extreme obesity.

### Child with suspected excessive cortisol production [^1137NcU9]. PES (2021). High credibility.

Child with suspected Cushing syndrome — laboratory evaluation includes an overnight dexamethasone suppression test in which a single dose of 1 mg of dexamethasone given close to 11 pm should suppress the AM cortisol to < 1.8 ug/dl (50 nmol/L), and a midnight salivary cortisol that is a good screening test to rule out Cushings. Additional laboratory testing lists low and high dose dexamethasone suppression test, a corticotrophin releasing hormone test, and a complete metabolic panel, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plus vitamin D levels, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; blood glucose can be elevated with possible glycosuria, frank diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance can develop in children with hypercortilism, hematological and immune dysfunction with cortisol stimulating erythropoiesis leading to polycythemia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia are common, and as cortisol affects vitamin D absorption in the intestines and increased loss of calcium from the kidneys there is often osteopenia/osteoporosis.

### HPA hyperactivity with increased plasma cortisol affects dexamethasone metabolism and DST outcome [^112actU5]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

Data suggests that dexamethasone bioavailability or pharmacokinetic factors contribute importantly to the outcome of the dexamethasone suppression test, and a relationship between plasma cortisol and plasma dexamethasone levels has been shown. To evaluate these data further, we studied plasma dexamethasone pharmacokinetics in 24 patients with major depression (15 suppressors and nine nonsuppressors) who received a 1 mg IV dexamethasone bolus at 09:00 h with blood samples collected at intervals over the next 14 h. We found that nonsuppressors had significantly shorter plasma dexamethasone half-life (P = 0.003) as well as significantly lower dexamethasone levels 10 h (P = 0.02) following IV dexamethasone administration. Moreover, upon clinical improvement of patients, the shortened dexamethasone half-life and lower dexamethasone levels disappeared in the five patients who switched from nonsuppression to suppression and were restudied by IV bolus. These 10-h post IV plasma dexamethasone level findings paralleled the results of the 1 mg overnight oral DST performed in these depressed patients (N = 22) where we found significantly lower 10 h plasma dexamethasone levels in nonsuppressors on admission compared to suppressors (P = 0.002) and again at discharge (P = 0.007). Interestingly, in the few patients who switched from suppression to nonsuppression over the course of hospitalization, 10-h post dose plasma dexamethasone levels simultaneously dropped. No difference in dexamethasone half-life was observed in the patients studied by oral and IV dexamethasone administration. These findings support the concept that metabolism of dexamethasone is significantly related to the activity of the HPA axis (particularly by plasma cortisol levels), and that dexamethasone pharmacokinetics can be modified by state-dependent phenomena.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ppzwt]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Risk of bias assessment

We used a component approach to assess risk of bias for all included studies. The following components were included, which could potentially bias a reported association between medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome and outcome:

Inclusion of patients (consecutive inclusion from all patients eligible or a random sample is considered low risk of bias)
Loss to follow-up (< 5% is considered low risk of bias)
Criteria for diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome adequately reported (see below)
Outcome measurement for cortisol normalization: urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol or a low dose dexamethasone test is considered low risk of bias
Reporting of outcome definition (see below)
Description of protocol for laboratory measurements (see below)
Description of dose and duration of intervention (see below)

As criteria for diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome vary widely over time and even by study center, and per underlying etiology, adequately reporting the criteria used for diagnosis is considered a low risk of bias. Reporting of outcome definition is considered adequate if the article at least mentioned which outcome was studied, which test was used to determine the outcome, and if applicable, which cortisol level had to be measured. Description of protocol for laboratory measurements is considered adequate if the assay used for measuring cortisol is reported, or the assay for the main outcome if this was not cortisol. Description of dose and duration of intervention is considered adequate if dose (per day or per week) and duration of medical treatment are reported (average and range, or exact dose and duration if this is equal for all patients). Also considered adequate is reporting of exact treatment protocol for trials with dose increase based on cortisol levels. Referring to another published article in which the information is reported is also considered adequate.

Risk of bias assessment was conducted to explore potential heterogeneity. As there were no studies that compared two different medical agents directly, confounding was not judged at the study level, but was assessed by comparing baseline characteristics for all included studies.

### Assessment of plasma dexamethasone levels after 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test in adults with obesity [^113kuuaf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test is the most frequently used screening test for Cushing's syndrome. It has been proposed that people with obesity may have insufficient plasma dexamethasone levels for the test which may result in false positives. We sought to compare the plasma dexamethasone levels after 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test in healthy obese participants and in optimal-weight participants.

Methods

A total of 30 optimal-weight participants (BMI ≤ 25kg/m 2) and 62 obese participants (BMI > 25kg/m 2) were enroled in the study. Obese participants were further divided into class 1 (25–29.9kg/m 2) and class 2 (> 30kg/m 2). After a standard overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test, blood samples were obtained for serum cortisol and plasma dexamethasone levels. Plasma dexamethasone levels were quantified using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Results

No significant difference in plasma dexamethasone levels were found between obese and optimal-weight participants (3.31 ± 1.35 vs. 2.82 ± 1.11 nmol/L, mean ± SD; p = .09 respectively). There were also no correlations found between sex, BMI, body surface area and plasma dexamethasone levels. There was also no significant difference in the proportion of participants who achieved a plasma dexamethasone level > 3.3 nmol/L in comparison between obesity class 1, obesity class 2, and optimal-weight groups.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that obesity does not affect plasma dexamethasone levels. However, dexamethasone measurement may still be helpful in patients who are being investigated for Cushing's syndrome and suspected to have a false-positive DST.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112KfWjM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to evaluation for Cushing's syndrome, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to administer 1 mg dexamethasone PO at 23:00 to 24:00 for the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and measure serum cortisol at 08:00 to 09:00 the following morning; recognize that a serum cortisol level > 1.8 mcg/dL (50 nmol/L) suggests autonomous cortisol secretion. Consider measuring plasma metanephrine during adrenal venous sampling in patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion to help lateralize both aldosterone and cortisol secretion; recognize the importance of measuring early morning cortisol following adrenal surgery and prepare for a period of possible glucocorticoid insufficiency.

### The DEX / CRH test for major depression: a potentially useful diagnostic test [^112ViP2S]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

The dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) test has been proposed as a potential diagnostic test for major depressive disorder (MDD). A previously proposed four-step approach assesses the stage of development for a biological finding into a clinically useful diagnostic test. Using this approach, we evaluated the progress of the DEX/CRH test using meta-analysis as a part of step 1. A literature review identified 15 studies of the DEX/CRH test in patients with MDD and healthy controls. Meta-analysis estimated the effect size, heterogeneity, and confidence intervals using random effects models. Studies consistent with any step of the four-step approach were identified, and their characteristics were presented. Eleven studies reported significantly higher cortisol levels with the DEX/CRH test in patients with MDD, compared with the healthy controls (step 1). Eight eligible studies were included in meta-analysis, and had an effect size of 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 0.70–1.97). Most studies were step-1 studies (comparison of patients and healthy controls), and no step-4 studies (multicenter trials) were found. This review emphasizes that despite appearing as a promising test, the DEX/CRH has not been adequately studied for the required stages of development into a clinically useful laboratory test. Particularly, additional step-3 and step-4 studies are necessary.

### Dexamethasone suppression test findings in subjects with personality disorders: associations with posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression [^1144CUwD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies using the 1.0-mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in subjects with personality disorders have produced mixed results. However, these studies focused on major depression and did not consider the possible effects of the comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD has been shown to be associated with increased cortisol suppression. To investigate the effect of PTSD, the authors conducted a 0.5-mg DST, which is more sensitive than the 1.0-mg DST for detection of increased cortisol suppression, in a group of subjects with personality disorders.

Method

Subjects with personality disorders (N = 52) ingested 0.5 mg of dexamethasone. Pre- and postfasting blood samples were drawn for measurement of cortisol levels. A three-way analysis of covariance was used to test for the main effects of major depression, PTSD, and gender on percent cortisol suppression, with plasma dexamethasone concentration as a covariate. Secondary analyses assessed for main and interaction effects of age at which trauma(s) occurred and a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.

Results

Neither major depression nor gender had a significant effect on percent cortisol suppression. Subjects with PTSD had significantly higher percent cortisol suppression than subjects with major depression. Age at which trauma(s) occurred and a borderline personality disorder diagnosis had no significant main or interaction effects on cortisol suppression.

Conclusions

A high level of cortisol suppression was associated with PTSD in subjects with personality disorder. This finding is similar to published findings for PTSD subjects without personality disorders. Major depression, gender, age when trauma(s) occurred, and a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder did not have significant main or interaction effects on cortisol suppression.

### Two-day low-dose dexamethasone suppression test more accurate than overnight 1-mg in women taking oral contraceptives [^115ro5Ak]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, the exclusion of Cushing's syndrome could also be a requirement among women using oral contraceptives. In such patients, clinicians mandate the cessation of contraceptive use for 6 weeks before 1 mg‐DST performance.

The sensitivity and specificity of the 1 mg‐DST (overnight 1 mg dexamethasone) and 2d‐DST (0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 h for 48 h) are considered equal; however, the 2d‐DST is less frequently used in ruling out Cushing's syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, no study till date has compared the sensitivity and specificity of these two tests among women using oral contraceptives.

Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy of the overnight 1‐mg DST and two‐day low‐dose DST in healthy volunteers using oral contraceptives.

### Dexamethasone 1.5 mg (dexamethasone) [^115JE1wK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In cerebral edema, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection is generally administered initially in a dosage of 10 mg intravenously followed by 4 mg every six hours intramuscularly until the symptoms of cerebral edema subside. Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For palliative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective.

Dexamethasone Suppression Tests

1. Tests for Cushing's syndrome

Give 1.0 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning. For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.

2. Test to distinguish Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary ACTH excess from Cushing's syndrome due to other causes.

Give 2.0 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made for determination of 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion.

### Screening and diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome [^116TS5T7]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Screening studies in high-risk populations have suggested that Cushing's syndrome is more common than previously appreciated. Patients who have specific signs and symptoms or clinical diagnoses known to be associated with hypercortisolism should be considered for screening. The measurement of late-night salivary cortisol provides the most sensitive method for screening, and urine-free cortisol and low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing may be used for confirmation of the diagnosis of endogenous hypercortisolism

### Two-day low-dose dexamethasone suppression test more accurate than overnight 1-mg in women taking oral contraceptives [^1157tfiV]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

This prospective clinical study was approved on January 16, 2018 by the Ethics Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects of the CUB Hôpital Erasme‐ULB (Erasmus P2017/405 and CWB B406201733024) and was conducted from January 23, 2018 to April 3, 2018. Written consent has been obtained from each subject after full explanation of the purpose and nature of all procedures used.

We enrolled 30 healthy female volunteers, aged between 18 and 45 years, who were taking COCs for at least 6 months. The exclusion criteria were the presence of signs or symptoms of hypercortisolism, a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m 2, and the use of medications that potentially interfere with cortisol metabolism. Subclinical hypercortisolism was excluded using LSaC measurements that were performed among all the volunteers. Four participants opted out of the study for personal reasons.

Each participant underwent an overnight 1‐mg DST and a 2d low‐dose DST (intake of 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 h for 48 h) with a 1‐week break, at minimum, between the two tests. The study was designed such that the participants visited the clinic on three mornings: the first visit corresponded to the measurement of the basal cortisol value, the second to the evaluation of 1 mg‐DST cortisol response, and the third to the performance of the 2d‐DST. The levels of morning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and salivary cortisol were determined before and after the DSTs and those of CBG before the DSTs.

The level of serum cortisol was measured using competitive electrochemiluminescent tests on Cobas E (kit cortisol II for serum cortisol and cortisol kit for urinary cortisol after liquid‐liquid extraction, Roche diagnostics, Vilvoorde, Belgium). The level of ACTH was quantified using an electrochemiluminescent sandwich test on Cobas E (Kit ACTH, Roche Diagnostics, Vilvoorde, Belgium), while that of serum CBG was quantified using a competitive radio‐immunological test (Kit CBG, ZenTech, Liège, Belgium). Saliva sampling was performed using Salivettes® with a synthetic Sarstedt‐branded swab. The level of salivary cortisol was measured after separation by high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC 1260 Infinity, Agilent Technologies, Diegem, Belgium) using tandem mass spectrometry (6490 triple Quadrupole, Agilent Technologies, Diegem, Belgium).

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^113Uqxx2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

A GnRH analogue (e.g. triptorelin 3 mg or leuprorelin 3.75 mg) is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously with androgens measured at baseline and at 28 days after the injection. It is important not to measure androgens sooner than 28 days after the GnRH analogue administration, as there is usually an initial agonist phase when gonadotropins (and potentially androgens) may increase before subsequent suppression after 14–28 days. Although some advocate a 2‐ or 3‐month suppression test using longer‐acting depot formulations this extends the timeframe of investigation and in our experience is not usually necessary. Suppression of gonadotropins and consequently androgens by at least 50% with a GnRH analogue confirms gonadotropin‐dependent ovarian hyperandrogenism. GnRH antagonists such as cetrorelix can also be considered for this purpose and avoid the initial surge in serum T levels that are observed with GnRH analogues.

There are, however, a few caveats and limitations to acknowledge in this situation. First, some VOTs with completely autonomous androgen production can still retain minimal gonadotropin regulation of androgen secretion and testosterone will therefore not suppress; commonly, these ovarian tumours have gonadotropin suppression at baseline and have an increased risk of malignancy. Second, very rare cases of extra‐ovarian LH‐dependent adrenal androgen production have been reported, for example, from an adrenal tumour, with shrinkage of an adrenal tumour with LH suppression also recently described. Third, this test does not reliably discriminate between ovarian hyperthecosis and VOTs with confidence. Finally, it is uncertain how much greater localisation sensitivity arises from dynamic testing compared with basal DHEAS levels; usually raised in adrenal hyperandrogenism and normal or low with an ovarian source.

In the scenario of an isolated or predominant increase in testosterone, a GnRH analogue test should be undertaken first, particularly in cases with negative or equivocal imaging. However, if there is a concomitant increase in androstenedione or DHEAS then we recommend performing the 96‐h dexamethasone suppression test first before undertaking the GnRH test, as the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis may remain suppressed for 2–3 months following the administration of GnRH, making it therefore more difficult to interpret subsequent test results. Importantly, a positive response to GnRH analogue testing signposts a potential long‐term treatment modality in women for whom surgery may not be an option.

### Pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of Cushing's syndrome [^115Lxi4g]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

Despite many recent advances, the management of patients with Cushing's disease continues to be challenging. Cushing's syndrome is a complex metabolic disorder that is a result of excess glucocorticoids. Excluding the exogenous causes, adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas account for nearly 70% of all cases of Cushing's syndrome. The suspicion, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis require a logical systematic approach with attention paid to key details at each investigational step. A diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is usually suspected in patients with clinical symptoms and confirmed by using multiple biochemical tests. Each of the biochemical tests used to establish the diagnosis has limitations that need to be considered for proper interpretation. Although some tests determine the total daily urinary excretion of cortisol, many others rely on measurements of serum cortisol at baseline and after stimulation (e.g., after corticotropin-releasing hormone) or suppression (e.g., dexamethasone) with agents that influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Other tests (e.g., measurements of late-night salivary cortisol concentration) rely on alterations in the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion. Because more than 90% of the cortisol in the circulation is protein bound, any alteration in the binding proteins (transcortin and albumin) will automatically influence the measured level and confound the interpretation of stimulation and suppression data, which are the basis for establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Although measuring late-night salivary cortisol seems to be an excellent initial test for hypercortisolism, it may be confounded by poor sampling methods and contamination. Measurements of 24-hour urinary free-cortisol excretion could be misleading in the presence of some pathological and physiological conditions. Dexamethasone suppression tests can be affected by illnesses that alter the absorption of the drug (e.g., malabsorption, celiac disease) and by the concurrent use of medications that interfere with its metabolism (e.g., inducers and inhibitors of the P450 enzyme system). In this review, the authors aim to review the pitfalls commonly encountered in the workup of patients suspected to have hypercortisolism. The optimal diagnosis and therapy for patients with Cushing's disease require the thorough and close coordination and involvement of all members of the management team.

Table 3
Tests of HPA axis function: considerations for testing

Provocative testing is typically required for diagnosis of central AI including AS. Both standard dose (250 µg) and low dose (1 µg) ACTH stimulation tests are used in clinical practice for evaluation of central AI with significant debate about which is superior, some studies suggesting that the low dose stimulation test is significantly more sensitive but less specific with other studies not supporting this finding. Peak cortisol thresholds of 440–600 nmol/L (16–22 µg/dL) are commonly used to rule out AI but varies between studies and institutions since many factors must be considered when interpreting results (eg, cortisol assay, timing of cortisol draws relative to corticotropin administration, medications affecting cortisol binding, time of day). Clinicians must therefore refer to their local protocols for guidance. Appropriate preparation and procedures for testing of the HPA axis are required (see table 3).

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

### Assessment of 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test in patients with obesity before bariatric surgery [^115bHuXQ]. Obesity Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to examine the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome (CS) in class 3 obese patients before bariatric surgery.

Materials and Methods

The data of 1037 class 3 obese patients admitted to the endocrinology outpatient clinic for endocrinological evaluation before bariatric surgery between 2012 and 2019were reviewed retrospectively. One milligram dexamethasone suppression test (DST) was used for the evaluation of hypercortisolism in all cases and cutoff accepted as 1.8 μg/dL.

Results

The mean body mass index (BMI) was 48 ± 8.9 kg/m 2 and age was 42 ± 10 years with female preponderance (F/M: 799/238] being observed in this cohort. Insufficient cortisol suppression was found in 40 patients; confirmed hypercortisolemia was detected in 8 patients. The prevalence of pathologic DST was 3.85% and 0.77% in confirmed hypercortisolism. The specificity for 1-mg DST with the cutoff 1.8 μg/dL was calculated as 96.8%.

Conclusion

Hypercortisolism prevalence was found to be low, and 1 mg DST is a sufficient test for the screening of CS in class 3 obese patients evaluated before bariatric surgery.

Table 5.
Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and common underlying conditions

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (Table 5).

Slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (eg, 7.5 prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess, and may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with slower taper in patients with high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily to the most recent dose prior to onset of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome will usually alleviate the symptoms.

R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

If the glucocorticoid dose is in the supraphysiologic range, suppression of the HPA axis is expected and it is unnecessary to test adrenal function. Similarly, testing is unnecessary in patients unable to stop glucocorticoid treatment, for example patients with organ transplants and in cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. These patients should be educated on management of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (see section R.3).

R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○)

### Cushing's syndrome screening with the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test in metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity phenotypes [^116FpYrS]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare endocrinological disorder that poses challenges in both diagnosis and management. Frequently, the diagnosis of this condition is delayed until clinical signs and symptoms become more pronounced, often resulting in the emergence of significant comorbidities by that time. The current guidelines recommend screening adult patients who display clinical conditions such as hypertension and osteoporosis not typically associated with their age, multiple clinical features consistent with CS, as well as patients with adrenal adenoma. Obesity, as one of the most common clinical features of CS, can also be an easily misleading symptom due to its rapidly increasing prevalence in the general population. Therefore, clarifying the uncertainty regarding the need for regular screening for CS in patients with obesity becomes more important.

Previous data has shown that some individuals with obesity may remain free from obesity-related comorbidities regardless of their body mass index (BMI). This has led to the establishment of a new phenotype known as metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), which defines individuals with obesity who do not exhibit any cardiovascular diseases, glucose metabolism impairments, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.

Several studies have investigated the indication for CS screening in different populations with obesity and have reported varying prevalences of CS. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of CS screening using a 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients with obesity and determine if there is a difference in these outcomes based on the patients' metabolic health status.

### Approach to the patient with possible Cushing's syndrome [^116LF6pP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical decision making for patients with suspect hypercortisolism involves a complex diagnostic assessment. Cushing's syndrome remains one of the most challenging endocrine pathologies. Most clinical features overlap with those of common diseases found in the general population, and some patients have an atypical clinical presentation with only isolated symptoms. Recently, several studies have suggested that the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome is higher than previously thought. Therefore, efficient screening tests are needed to identify the few uncovered patients also among unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with disorders potentially related to cortisol excess. The recommended diagnostic tests are 24-h urinary free cortisol, 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and late-night salivary cortisol. Once the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the next step is the measurement of plasma ACTH. Then, dynamic test and appropriate imaging procedures are the most useful noninvasive investigations for the differential diagnosis. Patients with Cushing's disease are generally responsive to the CRH test and to high-dose glucocorticoid feedback. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling is considered the gold standard for establishing the origin of ACTH secretion, and it is recommended in patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome whose clinical, biochemical, or radiological studies are discordant or equivocal. The present clinical case shows that even if rare, the ectopic ACTH secretion should be considered also in those cases where the pretest probability is low. The management of Cushing's syndrome depends on the exact knowledge of its various causes, paying attention to the many potential diagnostic pitfalls. The choice of test, the modality of specimen collection (blood, urine, and saliva), the quality of measurement (assay methodology and standardization), and close dialogue among endocrinologists, chemical pathologists, and neuroradiologists are key factors for optimal care of patients.

### The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill patient: does it really matter? [^117E9bXk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The definition of what constitutes a 'normal' adrenal response to critical illness is unclear. Consequently, published studies have used a variety of biochemical criteria to define 'adrenal insufficiency'. These criteria have been based on the baseline cortisol level or the increment in cortisol following corticotropin administration. However, in critically ill patients there are a number of confounding factors that make interpretation of these tests difficult. Furthermore, in those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids, there is no evidence that treatment should be based on adrenal function testing. In those patients in whom the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency may be important, this diagnosis may best be made based on the free cortisol level or the total cortisol level stratified by serum albumin.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for Cushing's syndrome: a systematic review and metaanalyses [^114Xy978]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome (CS) requires the use of tests of unregulated hypercortisolism that have unclear accuracy.

Objective

Our objective was to summarize evidence on the accuracy of common tests for diagnosing CS.

Data Sources

We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and citation search for key articles) from 1975 through September 2007 and sought additional references from experts.

Study Selection

Eligible studies reported on the accuracy of urinary free cortisol (UFC), dexamethasone suppression test (DST), and midnight cortisol assays vs. reference standard in patients suspected of CS.

Data Extraction

Reviewers working in duplicate and independently extracted study characteristics and quality and data to estimate the likelihood ratio (LR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each result.

Data Synthesis

We found 27 eligible studies, with a high prevalence [794 (9.2%) of 8631 patients had CS] and severity of CS. The tests had similar accuracy: UFC (n = 14 studies; LR+ 10.6, CI 5.5–20.5; LR- 0.16, CI 0.08–0.33), salivary midnight cortisol (n = 4; LR+ 8.8, CI 3.5–21.8; LR- 0.07, CI 0–1.2), and the 1-mg overnight DST (n = 14; LR+ 16.4, CI 9.3–28.8; LR- 0.06, CI 0.03–0.14). Combined testing strategies (e.g. a positive result in both UFC and 1-mg overnight DST) had similar diagnostic accuracy (n = 3; LR+ 15.4, CI 0.7–358; LR- 0.11, CI 0.007–1.57).

Conclusions

Commonly used tests to diagnose CS appear highly accurate in referral practices with samples enriched with patients with CS. Their performance in usual clinical practice remains unclear.

### An early post-operative ACTH suppression test can safely predict short-and long-term remission after surgery of Cushing's disease [^113zBi2x]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

48 h, 2 mg/day betamethasone suppression test

The peroperative glucocorticoid substitution with hydrocortisone was ended 12 h before commencement of the suppression test and 36 h before the first evaluation of serum cortisol during betamethasone suppression (day 3). This allowed us to avoid the risk of acute hypocortisolism and at the same time evaluate the effect of surgery and decide on the need of further glucocorticoid substitution. Betamethasone was administered orally (1 mg at 8 AM, 0.5 mg at 2 PM and 0.5 mg at 8 PM) during postoperative day 2 and 3. Morning levels (8 AM) of plasma cortisol and plasma ACTH were measured before commencement of the test and after 24 and 48 h with betamethasone (postoperative day 2, 3 and 4). Urine was collected for 24 h-UFC-analysis during the third postoperative day. The test protocol is presented in Table 2 and bare resemblance to the 48 h LDDST described by Liddle in 1960.

In the present protocol, betamethasone was used as this was available and recognizable by staff in the neurosurgical ward where the patients were treated after surgery. Betamethasone and dexamethasone are both synthetic glucocorticoids with long effect duration, similar anti-inflammatory effect and negligible mineralocorticoid effect. Equipotency is reported at 1–1.25 mg dexamethasone per 1 mg betamethasone. We see no pharmacologic reason not to use our protocol with similar doses of dexamethasone.

### Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency: which test is best – the 1-microg or the 250-microg cosyntropin stimulation test? [^117LRMPg]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) for the diagnosis of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency in both nonstressed and acutely ill patients.

Methods

We performed a MEDLINE search of all English-language literature, published between 1965 and 2007, in which the 1-microg and the 250-microg CSTs were compared in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Results

The majority of published evidence suggests that the 1-microg CST is more sensitive than the 250-microg CST for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency in nonstressed patients. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the low-dose CST is unlikely to add any diagnostic sensitivity to the high-dose CST. In critically ill patients, the 1-microg test is also likely to be more sensitive than the 250-microg test when an appropriate cutoff value is used (25 microg/dL).

Conclusion

The 1-microg CST with a cortisol level determined at 30 minutes after stimulation, with use of a cutoff level of 18 to 20 microg/dL in nonstressed patients and less than 25 microg/dL or an increment of less than 9 microg/dL from baseline in critically ill patients, is the best test that is currently available for establishing the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.
