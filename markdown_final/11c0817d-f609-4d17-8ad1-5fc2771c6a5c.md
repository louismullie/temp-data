## Question

How to work up elevated AST

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach the evaluation of an elevated AST. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing the pattern of injury. Then, I should stratify severity and immediately address acute liver failure risks. Next, I will take a focused history and physical, followed by targeted initial laboratory testing. After that, I need to consider non-hepatic sources of AST, especially muscle disease, and then proceed with etiologic testing based on severity and pattern. Finally, I will plan imaging, decide when to observe versus escalate, and outline indications for liver biopsy and special populations such as pediatrics and oncology patients.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and characterize the pattern, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a transient or spurious result. Repeating the liver panel and calculating the R ratio (ALT/ULN ÷ ALP/ULN) helps distinguish hepatocellular (R > 5), mixed (R 2–5), and cholestatic (R < 2) injury, and I should also check the AST/ALT ratio since an AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 strongly suggests alcoholic liver disease, whereas ALT > AST is typical of NAFLD and chronic viral hepatitis [^116MrpTo] [^117RYf6K] [^1156xFwp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify severity because management hinges on it. Borderline is < 2× ULN, mild is 2–5× ULN, moderate is 5–15× ULN, and severe is > 15× ULN or ALT > 10,000 IU/L, and any elevation with INR > 1.5 or encephalopathy mandates urgent hepatology consultation and transplant center referral due to acute liver failure risk [^112o4UP2] [^117Nvcr7] [^114bdCmA].

> Next, I should review the history and physical with a structured checklist so I don't miss key clues. I need to check alcohol quantity and pattern, screen for viral hepatitis risks, elicit all prescription, OTC, and herbal/dietary supplements with start/stop dates, assess metabolic syndrome features, and ask about symptoms of liver disease. On exam I will look for stigmata of chronic liver disease and, importantly, signs of muscle disease that could falsely elevate AST [^115PkWRv] [^112eeqNX].

> I will now examine the initial laboratory panel to anchor severity and synthetic function. I should confirm AST and ALT, obtain ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, INR, and CBC with platelets; I need to ensure I interpret results using updated "true normal" ALT thresholds (about 29–33 IU/L in men, 19–25 IU/L in women) because many labs' ULNs overcall normality and under-recognize chronic liver disease [^1155asMt] [^112TeHbB].

> Wait, let me verify non-hepatic sources of AST before chasing liver diagnoses, especially if AST is disproportionately elevated or ALT is normal. I should check CK, LDH, and consider macro-AST with PEG precipitation when there is isolated, persistent AST elevation without other liver test abnormalities; in children, I need a low threshold to evaluate for muscular dystrophy because AST/ALT can be the earliest biochemical clue before overt weakness [^113vW8Xu] [^1157JgsG] [^1129REvX].

> For mild to moderate AST elevations (up to 5× ULN), I should double-check for common etiologies first. I will screen for hepatitis B with HBsAg, HBcAb total, and HBsAb, and for hepatitis C with HCV Ab plus RNA confirmation if positive. I will assess iron studies for hemochromatosis, consider autoimmune markers (ANA, ASMA) if cholestatic or autoimmune features emerge, and keep Wilson disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency on the radar when clinically indicated. Abdominal ultrasound helps evaluate steatosis, biliary disease, and mass lesions [^1139d42c] [^114Q45zf] [^1127L5Xo].

> For severe elevations (> 5× ULN), I need to ensure I broaden the workup urgently. I should add acute viral hepatitis serologies (HAV IgM, HBV IgM, HEV if relevant), evaluate for acetaminophen toxicity with a careful exposure history and consider N-acetylcysteine if suspected, and assess for ischemic hepatitis given the clinical context. I should also remember that massive AST/ALT elevations (> 10,000 IU/L) are classically acetaminophen, ischemic injury, or other toxins, and that marked transaminase spikes can rarely occur with choledocholithiasis before resolving after stone clearance [^114bdCmA] [^11154Hag] [^1177apKg].

> Let me consider imaging next, because pattern and severity guide modality. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line to assess biliary obstruction, steatosis, masses, and vascular abnormalities; if ultrasound is non-diagnostic and suspicion remains high, MRCP or CT can further evaluate cholestasis or infiltrative disease, and elastography can noninvasively stage fibrosis when chronic disease is suspected [^112SbFyr] [^113BTdM5].

> I should confirm the decision to observe versus escalate based on severity and trajectory. For borderline or mild, asymptomatic elevations, observation with repeat testing in 3–6 months is reasonable given notable intraindividual variability, but persistence beyond 3–6 months warrants completion of the etiologic workup. For moderate elevations, I should complete the initial panel and proceed based on results. For severe or any AST/ALT > 5× ULN with jaundice or INR > 1.5, I should not delay urgent hepatology referral and transplant center evaluation [^117CYLXn] [^1127L5Xo] [^117Gq1fp].

> But wait, what if all noninvasive tests are unrevealing and the elevation persists? I need to check whether liver biopsy is indicated to clarify diagnosis, stage disease, or adjudicate competing etiologies. Biopsy is particularly helpful when autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, drug injury, or overlapping processes remain in the differential after serology and imaging are non-diagnostic [^1156xFwp] [^1155asMt].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pediatrics. In children with isolated AST elevation, I should prioritize muscle disease screening with CK and consider macro-AST early to avoid unnecessary invasive testing; many children with persistent isolated transaminase elevations have benign courses that resolve, and macro-AST is not rare in this setting, so a conservative, targeted approach is prudent [^1129REvX] [^114bAZft] [^1134VH4e].

> For oncology and immune checkpoint inhibitor patients, I should confirm grade-based management and not overcall DILI. Grade 1 transaminase elevations can be monitored without stopping therapy, grade 2 often warrants holding and starting corticosteroids, and grade 3–4 elevations require permanent discontinuation and high-dose IV steroids. I need to ensure I exclude other causes and consider liver biopsy if steroid-refractory or if the diagnosis remains uncertain [^111LWiQR] [^115nShah].

> Let me reconsider the AST/ALT ratio and "true normal" thresholds because misclassification is common. An AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 supports alcoholic liver disease, whereas ALT > AST favors NAFLD or viral hepatitis. Moreover, many patients with chronic liver disease have AST/ALT values within conventional "normal" ranges, so applying lower ALT cutoffs (men ≤ 30, women ≤ 19–25 IU/L) improves sensitivity for chronic liver injury detection [^117RYf6K] [^112TeHbB] [^113nLMvo].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with guideline-based escalation triggers and safety nets. Any patient with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, or bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL alongside AST/ALT > 5× ULN needs urgent hepatology input. I should also remember that in acetaminophen toxicity, early AST elevation can track hepatotoxicity and guide NAC decisions, and in ischemic or toxic injuries, AST may rise and fall in parallel with the underlying insult, reinforcing the need for close monitoring and timely intervention [^114bdCmA] [^111icKmR] [^114WBWDB].

An elevated AST requires a **stepwise approach** [^112o4UP2] to confirm the abnormality, characterize the pattern, and identify the cause. Start with a **focused history and exam** to assess alcohol, medications, metabolic risk, and symptoms; repeat AST/ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, INR, and CBC/platelets; and check hepatitis B/C serologies and an abdominal ultrasound [^1127L5Xo]. If AST is > 5× ULN or there are red flags (jaundice, INR > 1.5, encephalopathy), **urgent hepatology referral is indicated** [^114bdCmA] [^113XoUqa]. Otherwise, tailor further testing to the pattern: hepatocellular injury warrants viral, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) workup [^1155asMt]; cholestatic injury prompts evaluation for biliary obstruction or cholestatic liver disease [^116VCtcF]; isolated AST elevation suggests muscle injury or macro-AST [^1129REvX] [^114bAZft]. Macro-AST should be considered if AST is persistently elevated without other causes, and liver biopsy is reserved for unresolved cases after noninvasive evaluation [^114bAZft] [^1156xFwp].

---

## Initial evaluation: confirm and characterize

- **Repeat testing**: Confirm persistent elevation and exclude lab error; transient elevations are common [^117Gq1fp].

- **History and physical examination**: Assess alcohol use, medications/supplements, metabolic risk factors, viral hepatitis risks, and symptoms (jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain) [^115PkWRv].

- **Basic laboratory tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, INR, CBC, and platelets [^1127L5Xo].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal ultrasound to assess liver parenchyma, biliary tree, and vascular structures [^112o4UP2].

---

## Pattern recognition and severity assessment

- **Hepatocellular pattern**: Disproportionate AST/ALT elevation suggests viral hepatitis, NAFLD, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or DILI [^1155asMt].

- **Cholestatic pattern**: Disproportionate ALP/GGT elevation suggests biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [^113Fviv2].

- **Severity**: AST/ALT > 5× ULN warrants urgent evaluation; > 15× ULN or INR > 1.5 with encephalopathy requires immediate hepatology referral [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Hepatic causes | - Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV, HAV, HEV) [^notfound] <br/> - NAFLD/NASH [^112TeHbB] <br/> - Alcoholic liver disease [^114mwBou] <br/> - Autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj] <br/> - Wilson's disease <br/> - Hemochromatosis <br/> - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency <br/> - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^113s1NHW] |
| Non-hepatic causes | - Muscle injury (rhabdomyolysis, myositis) [^113vW8Xu] <br/> - Macro-AST [^114bAZft] <br/> - Cardiac injury (myocardial infarction) <br/> - Hemolysis [^112eeqNX] |
| Cholestatic causes | - Biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, malignancy) [^113Fviv2] <br/> - PBC <br/> - PSC [^117MpALN] |

---

## Stepwise diagnostic approach

### Step 1: confirm persistent elevation and exclude common causes

Confirm persistent elevation with **repeat testing** [^117Gq1fp]. Concurrently review medications and supplements for **hepatotoxins** and discontinue as needed [^113s1NHW]. Obtain **hepatitis B/C serologies** and an abdominal ultrasound [^1127L5Xo].

---

### Step 2: pattern-based testing

For a **hepatocellular pattern**, evaluate for autoimmune hepatitis (ANA, ASMA) [^1127L5Xo], Wilson's disease (ceruloplasmin, copper), hemochromatosis (iron studies), alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, and thyroid function [^1155asMt]. For a **cholestatic pattern**, assess for PBC/PSC with AMA, ANCA, and MRCP if indicated [^116VCtcF]. For **isolated AST elevation**, check CK, LDH, and consider macro-AST with PEG precipitation [^113vW8Xu] [^114bAZft].

---

### Step 3: advanced testing if unresolved

If noninvasive tests are inconclusive, **consider liver biopsy** to clarify diagnosis or stage disease [^1156xFwp]. Use transient elastography (FibroScan) to assess fibrosis when chronic liver disease is suspected [^113BTdM5].

---

## Special considerations

- **Alcoholic liver disease**: AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 is suggestive; GGT may be elevated [^117RYf6K].

- **Macro-AST**: Persistent isolated AST elevation without other causes; confirm with PEG precipitation [^114bAZft].

- **Pediatric patients**: Consider metabolic liver disease, Wilson's disease, and muscle disorders [^1127L5Xo].

---

## Indications for urgent hepatology referral

Urgent hepatology referral is indicated for **AST/ALT > 5× ULN** with jaundice, encephalopathy, or coagulopathy [^114bdCmA]. Suspected acute liver failure warrants immediate referral, as does suspected drug-induced liver injury with severe biochemical injury [^114zraiE].

---

A structured approach to elevated AST — confirm the abnormality, characterize the pattern, and apply a targeted workup — enables efficient identification of the cause and guides management [^112o4UP2].

### Liver aminotransferases are elevated with rhabdomyolysis in the absence of significant liver injury [^111ZMft7]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is an uncommon finding in the emergency department. However, the clinical implications of rhabdomyolysis are important, with a significant minority of patients developing acute renal failure and multiorgan failure. When present, the cause of elevated aminotransferases in the setting of rhabdomyolysis is often unclear. We sought to determine the incidence of abnormal aminotransferases (defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L) in the setting of rhabdomyolysis and how the aminotransferases decrease relative to the creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration as rhabdomyolysis resolves. A retrospective chart review of 215 cases of rhabdomyolysis with CPK of ≥ 1,000 U/L was performed. The incidence of an abnormal AST in the setting of rhabdomyolysis was 93.1% (95% confidence interval, 88.7% to 95.8%). An abnormal ALT was much less common and found in 75.0% (95% confidence interval, 68.7% to 80.2%) of patients with a CPK of ≥ 1,000 U/L (p < 0.0001). In only one instance was the ALT > 40 U/L while the AST was < 40 U/L. Furthermore, AST concentrations (and not ALT) fall in parallel with CPK during the first 6 days of hospitalization for patients with rhabdomyolysis. Aminotransferase abnormalities, particularly AST, are common in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. AST concentrations decrease in parallel to CPK, suggesting skeletal muscle may be a significant source of AST elevation in these patients.

### Clinical significance of elevated liver transaminases in HIV-infected patients [^116CrpnV]. AIDS (2019). Medium credibility.

Elevation of liver transaminases is common in patients infected with the HIV. Although this is usually an incidental finding during regular work-up, HIV-infected patients with transaminase elevations require additional visits for laboratory studies and clinical assessments, and often undergo interruptions and changes in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Alanine aminotransferase is present primarily in the liver, thus being a surrogate marker of hepatocellular injury. Aspartate aminotransferase is present in the liver and other organs, namely cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidney and brain. Serum levels of both liver transaminases predict liver-related mortality. Moreover, serum fibrosis biomarkers based on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase predict all-cause mortality. In a busy clinical setting, a diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases could be complicated given the frequency and nonspecificity of this finding. Indeed, HIV-infected individuals present multiple risk factors for liver damage and chronic elevation of transaminases, including coinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol abuse, hepatotoxicity due to ART, HIV itself and frequent metabolic comorbidities leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This review provides an update on epidemiology of elevated liver transaminases, summarizes the main etiologic contributors and discusses the prognostic significance and a pragmatic approach to this frequent finding in the clinical practice of HIV medicine. With the aging of the HIV-infected population following the successful implementation of ART in Western countries, liver-related conditions are now a major comorbidity in this setting. As such, clinicians should be aware of the frequency, clinical significance and diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

AGA Institute COVID-19 gastrointestinal and liver manifestations — Cholankeril, 2020 (Stanford University Hospitals): In n = 116, survival was 0.9% died, 86.2% discharged, and 4.3% still hospitalized; age was M 50 y (IQR, 35–67), 46.6% females, and disease severity was 71.6% evaluated in ED/clinic only, 20.7% admitted to the medical floor, and 7.8% admitted to ICU. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms present on admission included diarrhea 10.3% (12), nausea and/or vomiting 10.3% (12), and abdominal pain 8.8% (10); 31.9% reported GI symptoms, median duration 1 day (IQR, 0–4), and none had isolated GI symptoms or GI as the initial symptoms. Liver tests showed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (n = 65) M 35 (IQR, 22–58) and, in those with any abnormal LFT, M 64 (IQR, 24–76); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (n = 65) M 32 (IQR, 22–48) and, with abnormal LFT, M 59 (IQR, 22–76); total bilirubin (n = 65) M 0.4 (IQR, 0.3–0.7) and, with abnormal LFT, M 0.5 (IQR, 0.3–0.7). Additionally, 26 patients developed liver enzyme elevation, 22 of whom had normal baseline liver enzymes.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^114mwBou]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — diagnosis and initial management are specified as: "Clinical diagnosis of AH is determined in a patient with rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications, with serum total bilirubin > 3 mg/dL; ALT and AST elevated > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but < 400 U/L with the AST/ALT ratio > 1.5; documentation of persistent heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks before onset of symptoms; and exclusion of other liver diseases"; furthermore, "In patients with suspected AH, a transjugular liver biopsy is recommended when the clinical diagnosis is confounded by another liver disease etiology or there is uncertainty on alcohol consumption history", and "Patients with severe AH should preferably be hospitalized for management".

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^115nShah]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–related liver toxicity management — grade-based initial actions are specified: Grade I (AST/ALT elevated ≤ 3x ULN; bilirubin elevated ≤ 1.5x ULN) continue ICI if asymptomatic and continue close lab monitoring. Grade II (AST/ALT elevated up to 3–5x ULN; bilirubin elevated up to 1.5–3x ULN) hold ICI and start 0.5–1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone, and consider liver biopsy. Grade III–IV (AST/ALT elevated > 5x ULN; bilirubin elevated > 3x ULN) discontinue ICI permanently and give 1–2 mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone; consider liver biopsy and consider admission.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111LWiQR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis — workup and evaluation outlines monitoring and diagnostic steps: "Monitor pattern of abnormal liver blood tests: AST, ALT, and bilirubin before each infusion and/or consider weekly if grade 1 LFT elevations. No treatment is recommended for grade 1 LFT abnormality". Medication review and metastasis assessment are advised, and "Liver biopsy should be considered if the patient is steroid-refractory or if concern for other differential diagnoses that would alter medical management". For higher grades, "Workup for other causes of elevated liver enzymes… by doing blood work and imaging (ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging). If suspicion for primary autoimmune hepatitis is high, can consider ANA/ASMA/ANCA. If patients with elevated ALKP alone, GGT should be tested. For isolated elevation of transaminases, consider checking CK for other etiologies".

### Pexidartinib long-term hepatic safety profile in patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumors [^1161jdpg]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pexidartinib is approved in the U.S. for tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs). Herein, we assessed the hepatic safety profile of pexidartinib across patients with TGCTs receiving pexidartinib.

Materials, and Methods

Hepatic adverse reactions (ARs) were assessed by type and magnitude of liver test abnormalities, classified as (a) isolated aminotransferase elevations (alanine [ALT] or aspartate [AST], without significant alkaline phosphatase [ALP] or bilirubin elevations), or (b) mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity (increase in ALP with or without ALT/AST and bilirubin elevations, based on adjudication). Median follow-up from initial pexidartinib treatment was 39 months (range, 32–82) in 140 patients with TGCTs across clinical studies NCT01004861, NCT02371369, NCT02734433, and NCT03291288.

Results

In total, 95% of patients with TGCTs (133/140) treated with pexidartinib (median duration of exposure, 19 months [range, 1–76]), experienced a hepatic AR. A total of 128 patients (91%) had reversible, low-grade dose-dependent isolated AST/ALT elevations without significant ALP elevations. Five patients (4%) experienced serious mixed or cholestatic injury. No case met Hy's law criteria. Onset of hepatic ARs was predominantly in the first 2 months. All five serious hepatic AR cases recovered 1–7 months following pexidartinib discontinuation. Five patients from the non-TGCT population (N = 658) experienced serious hepatic ARs, two irreversible cases.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis provides information to help form the basis for the treating physician's risk assessment for patients with TCGTs, a locally aggressive but typically nonmetastatic tumor. In particular, long-term treatment with pexidartinib has a predictable effect on hepatic aminotransferases and unpredictable risk of serious cholestatic or mixed liver injury.

Implications For Practice

This is the first long-term pooled analysis to report on the long-term hepatic safety of pexidartinib in patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumors associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery. These findings extend beyond what has been previously published, describing the observed instances of hepatic toxicity following pexidartinib treatment across the clinical development program. This information is highly relevant for medical oncologists and orthopedic oncologists and provides guidance for its proper use for appropriate patients within the Pexidartinib Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Safety program.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114bdCmA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — actions by aminotransferase severity specify etiologic evaluation thresholds and urgent referral criteria. For ALT and/or AST levels > 5X ULN, evaluate for viral hepatitis B and C, alcoholic and NAFLD, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha‑1‑antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and consider drugs/supplement‑related, ischemic, and DILI causes. For 5–15X ULN, also assess for acute hepatitis A, B, and C in addition to etiologies for AST/ALT elevation less than 5× ULN. For > 15X ULN, or massive ALT > 10,000 IU/L, also assess for acetaminophen toxicity and ischemic hepatopathy (shock liver). A patient with acute hepatitis plus elevated prothrombin time and/or encephalopathy requires immediate referral to a liver specialist. All are Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116kht1X]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated hepatic events — indirect hyperbilirubinemia with atazanavir (ATV) — present in children within the first months of therapy and can be asymptomatic or associated with jaundice, with levels of direct bilirubin normal or slightly elevated when indirect levels are very high and with normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). In long-term follow-up, 9% of children who were receiving ATV had at least one total bilirubin level > 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and 1.4% of children experienced jaundice. Risk factors are none established. For prevention/monitoring, no ongoing monitoring is needed, and after an initial rise over the first few months of therapy, unconjugated bilirubin levels generally stabilize; levels can improve over time. Management states that isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia is not an indication to stop ATV; the psychological impact of jaundice should be evaluated and alternative agents should be considered, and because jaundice can result in nonadherence, particularly in adolescents, this side effect should be discussed with patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1127L5Xo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) algorithm — mild elevation 2–5x ULN: Initial actions include history and physical exam, discontinue hepatotoxic meds, discontinue alcohol consumption, and assess for risk factors for fatty liver and viral hepatitis; testing includes CBC/platelet count, AST/ALT, Alk Phos, TB, albumin, PT/INR; HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb, HCV Ab with PCR confirmation if +, iron panel, abdominal ultrasound. If negative, consider observation for 3 months with repeat AST/ALT, Alk Phos, TB or continue investigation; if persistently elevated, continue investigation: ANA, ASMA, gamma-globulin, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype and may consider additional tests based on history (e.g., celiac sprue, tick-borne disease, thyroid disease and muscle disorders); if no diagnosis, consider diagnostic liver biopsy.

AST and ALT ratio interpretation — The ratio of AST to ALT may be useful in determining the etiology of abnormal liver tests; for most liver conditions including chronic viral hepatitis and NAFLD, ALT levels are > AST levels; however, ~90% of patients with alcoholic liver disease have AST > ALT, and > 70% have an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2; AST > ALT can also be seen in cirrhosis, although the AST:ALT ratio is typically not ≥ 2:1; in hepatitis C virus patients, non-cirrhotics had an AST/ALT ratio of 0.60, while the mean ratio in cirrhotics was 1.05; liver biopsy is most commonly done to assess the grade and stage of disease severity and may be useful to confirm suspected diagnoses including Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

Severe or massive aminotransferase elevation — initial evaluation and escalation: For aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), stratify into "Severe elevation > 15x ULN" or "Massive elevation ALT > 10,000 U/L". For both branches, perform "History and physical exam", "Discontinue hepatotoxic meds and alcohol", and "Evaluate for signs of acute liver failure", and for massive elevation also "Assess for toxic ingestions, ischemia, and rhabdomyolysis". If "signs of acute liver failure → urgent liver consultation with consideration of referral to a liver transplant center", and if "diagnostic evaluation negative → consideration for diagnostic liver biopsy if medically stable". The pathway advises to "Consider n-acetyl cysteine if any evidence of acetaminophen ingestion".

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

ALT and AST levels and mortality associations — population data: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 18 (AST > 18) was linked to a 3X increase in all cause mortality. Compared with men with AST or ALT ≥ 20 IU/l, those in the 30–39 IU/l group had an 8X (AST) or 9.5X (ALT) relative risk for liver-related death. In a cohort with standardized mortality ratios, values were 0.95 for normal ALT (defined as ULN 45 IU/l for men, 29 IU/l for females), 1.32 for 1–2× ULN, and 1.78 for > 2× ULN. Another study reported ALT 30–39 associated with relative risks of liver mortality 2.9 (2.4–3.5) and 9.5 (7.9–11.5) in men, and 3.8 (1.9–7.7) and 6.6 (1.5–25.6) in women. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) definitions of elevated ALT (30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women) was associated with liver-related mortality (11.2×) and diabetes-related mortality (3.3×), and another analysis found ALT > 43 IU/l for men and > 30 IU/l for women related to coronary heart disease.

5.1	Hepatotoxicity

Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking TAVNEOS. During controlled trials, the TAVNEOS treatment group had a higher incidence of transaminase elevations and hepatobiliary events, including serious and life-threatening events [see Adverse Reactions 6.1].

Obtain liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) before initiating TAVNEOS, every 4 weeks after start of therapy for the first 6 months of treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter.

If a patient receiving treatment with TAVNEOS presents with an elevation in ALT or AST to > 3 times the upper limit of normal, evaluate promptly and consider pausing treatment as clinically indicated.

If AST or ALT is > 5 times the upper limit of normal, or if a patient develops transaminases > 3 times the upper limit of normal with elevation of bilirubin to > 2 times the upper limit of normal, discontinue TAVNEOS until TAVNEOS-induced liver injury is ruled out [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

TAVNEOS is not recommended for patients with active, untreated and/or uncontrolled chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis B, untreated hepatitis C, uncontrolled autoimmune hepatitis) and cirrhosis. Consider the risk and benefit before administering TAVNEOS to a patient with liver disease. Monitor patients closely for hepatic adverse reactions [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

TAVNEOS may cause angioedema [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical trials, two cases of angioedema occurred, including one serious event requiring hospitalization. If angioedema occurs, discontinue TAVNEOS immediately, provide appropriate therapy, and monitor for airway compromise. TAVNEOS must not be re-administered unless another cause has been established. Educate patients on recognizing the signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction and to seek immediate medical care should they develop.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Comparison of prothrombin time and aspartate aminotransferase in predicting hepatotoxicity after acetaminophen overdose [^111icKmR]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite decades of experience with acetaminophen (APAP) overdoses, it remains unclear whether elevated hepatic transaminases or coagulopathy develop first. Furthermore, comparison of the predictive value of these two variables in determining hepatic toxicity following APAP overdoses has been poorly elucidated. The primary objective of this study is to determine the test characteristics of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the prothrombin time (PT) in patients with APAP toxicity. A retrospective chart review of APAP overdoses treated with IV N-acetylcysteine at a tertiary care referral center was performed. Of the 304 subjects included in the study, 246 with an initial AST less than 1000 were analyzed to determine predictors of hepatic injury, defined as an AST exceeding 1000 IU/L. The initial AST > 50 was 79.5% sensitive and 82.6% specific for predicting hepatic injury. The corresponding negative and positive predictive values were 95.5 and 46.3%, respectively. In contrast, an initial abnormal PT had a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 63.6%. The negative and positive predictive values for initial PT were 94.9 and 30.2%, respectively. Although the two tests performed similarly for predicting a composite endpoint of death or liver transplant, neither was a useful predictor. Initial AST performed better than the initial PT for predicting hepatic injury in this series of patients with APAP overdose.

### Consider muscle disease in children with elevated transaminase [^1129REvX]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are markers of hepatocellular injury but are highly concentrated in muscle cells. Consequently, muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, lead to hypertransaminasemia. Elevation in ALT and AST is most striking during the early stages of disease, before onset of or when only subtle signs of muscle disease are present. Thus, the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST may be the presenting sign of muscle disease in many children and provides an opportunity for early diagnosis. Many physicians, however, pursue extensive workup for liver disease in children who present with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. This results in delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment and increased expense and may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures. We report 12 patients with muscle disease who presented with a variety of symptoms and were found to have an incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST. We propose a rapid screening process for evaluating children with the incidental finding of elevated ALT/AST to shorten the time to diagnosis of muscle disease.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### Liver dysfunction in patients with severe anorexia nervosa [^116vhkgo]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Evaluation of liver dysfunction in patients with severe anorexia nervosa (AN) has typically been limited to small case series. We report an investigation into the admission characteristics and clinical outcomes associated with liver dysfunction in a large cohort of adults hospitalized for medical stabilization of severe AN.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated electronic medical records to quantify the cumulative incidence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). We compared mean (± SD), frequencies (%), and median (IQR) values of clinical covariates of interest by incidence of liver enzyme elevation. The study included 181 adults, admitted for medical stabilization of AN, from October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2013.

Results

AST and ALT were mildly elevated in 27.6% of patients and severely elevated (more than three times the upper limit of normal) in 35.4% of patients. On admission, patients with severely elevated liver enzymes had a lower body mass index (BMI) (11.9 ± 1.8 kg/m(2) vs.13.3 ± 1.7 kg/m(2)), lower percentage ideal body weight (56.5% ± 7.7% vs. 63.5% ± 8.3%), and lower prealbumin (64% vs. 37%) compared with the rest of the cohort (p < 0.001). While hospitalized, patients with severely elevated liver enzymes more often developed hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and experienced longer lengths of stay (p < 0.001).

Discussion

Elevated liver enzymes are common in our patient population with severe AN. Liver enzymes reached near normal values by the time of discharge. Severely elevated liver enzymes were associated with a lower BMI and the development of hypoglycemia.

### Development of macro-aspartate aminotransferase in a patient undergoing specific allergen injection immunotherapy [^111SuykC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Macro-aspartate aminotransferase (macro-AST), a complex between normal AST and an immunoglobulin, is recognized as a cause of isolated elevation of AST. Though its pathogenesis is unknown, previous reports have been suggestive of an autoimmune process. We describe a case of macro-AST formation in a patient with previously normal liver enzymes in whom an isolated AST elevation was discovered after initiation of specific allergen injection immunotherapy (SIT) for allergic rhinitis. We propose that SIT in this otherwise healthy patient led to the formation of macro-AST as a consequence of antibody cross-reaction (molecular mimicry). Awareness of this possible mechanism of macroenzyme development may be helpful to physicians evaluating patients with isolated elevations in AST.

### Persistent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase in a child after incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^111xAg4Z]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AST is an enzyme found predominantly in the liver and heart; however, it is also present in skeletal muscles, brain, pancreas, RBC, WBC, lungs and kidneys. There are two similar isoenzymes of AST localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria and are encoded by GOT1 and GOT2 on chromosomes 10q24 and 16q12, respectively. AST catalyses the transfer of an amino group to α-Ketoglutaric acid to make glutaric acid. AST rises 12 h after hepatic damage, with peak levels seen at 24 to 48 h. Isolated elevated AST, especially in asymptomatic children, poses a challenge to clinicians, resulting in often extensive, costly investigations. It is difficult to know the best investigative approach to these children. Some of the most important differential diagnoses and investigations that would aid in the differentiation of possible causes for increased AST are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Different causes of elevated level of AST and diagnostic work-up

Macro enzyme production phenomenon was suggested in 1964. There are a variety of macro enzymes such as amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, AST, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Macro enzymes are divided to two groups. High molecular weight complex is formed by self-polymerization or bonding with other molecules such as immunoglobulin. Circulating autoantibody and serum enzyme build enzyme-immunoglobulin complexes. These large molecules do not filter through the renal glomeruli. The definite mechanism of immunoglobulin-complex enzyme formation is not known, but the most probable mechanism is the antigen-driven theory.

Macro-AST was first recognized by Konttinen et al. in 1978. We used MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases to review the literature. The prevalence of macro-AST in either children or adults has not been established. Caropreso et al. performed a study to determine the reason for elevated isolated AST in a tertiary medical center and found that the prevalence of macro-AST was between 13.1 and 60% for adults and 38.6% for children. There are many different diseases in adults linked to macro-AST in the literature (Table 4).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### The development and implementation of a commissioned pathway for the identification and stratification of liver disease in the community [^1138xAXe]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the development of the Nottingham liver disease stratification pathway, present a 12-month evaluation of uptake and stratification results, and compare the pathway with current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines.

Design

A referral pathway between primary and secondary care for the detection and risk stratification of liver disease.

Setting

Four Nottinghamshire clinical commissioning groups (700 000 population).

Patients

Patients are referred to the pathway with (1) raised aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase (AST:ALT) ratio, (2) harmful alcohol use or (3) risk or presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Interventions

We report on clinic attendance within secondary care for transient elastography (TE) and brief lifestyle intervention. The TE result is reported back to the general practitioner with advice on interpretation and referral guidance.

Main outcome measures

Pathway uptake, patient characteristics, liver disease stratification results and stakeholder feedback.

Results

Over the first 12 months 968 patients attended a TE clinic appointment, with raised AST:ALT ratio being the most common single reason for referral (36.9%). Of the total, 222 (22.9%) patients had an elevated liver stiffness (≥ 8 kPa), in whom 57 (25.7%) had a liver stiffness which was indicative of advanced chronic liver disease. If a traditional approach based on raised liver enzymes (BSG guidance) had been followed, 38.7% of those with significant liver disease (≥ 8 kPa) would have gone undetected among those referred for either NAFLD or raised AST:ALT ratio.

Conclusions

Targeting patients with risk factors for chronic liver disease and stratifying them using TE can detect significant chronic liver disease above and beyond the approach based on liver enzyme elevation.

### Persistent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase in a child after incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^1157JgsG]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Isolated elevation of AST is an uncommon finding in children, the etiology of which remains conspicuous. As with any illness, a complete history and physical examination should be undertaken. Blood sampling should follow the guideline suggested in Table 3. If all the aforementioned investigations are performed without a suitable explanation of the etiology, then macro-AST should be suspected. With a simple method such as PEG precipitation, a definitive diagnosis can be made. This approach may prevent performing extensive, costly and invasive workups.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Macro-AST: misleading finding in an adolescent with MCAD-deficiency [^115QXPT4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In summary, we describe a girl with MCAD-deficiency developing isolated AST-elevation without any clinical or biochemical signs for organ dysfunction. We could detect macro-AST as the cause of AST-elevation.

Macro-AST has to be considered in any healthy individual or patient with a chronic disease displaying an isolated AST-elevation. This goes for patients with chronic metabolic diseases like MCAD-deficiency as well. Thus, unnecessary costly and invasive evaluation can be avoided. In our opinion, MCAD-patients should be regularly followed. Apart from dealing with acute health problems this will allow us to study the long-term biochemical and clinical outcome in patients with this rare disease diagnosed by neonatal mass screening.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115LHnCm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity — drug-induced liver injury (DILI) following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is more common in HCV/HIV coinfection than in HIV mono-infection, and individuals with HCV/HIV coinfection who have advanced liver disease are at greatest risk; eradicating HCV infection with treatment may decrease the likelihood of ARV-associated DILI. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of ART and at least every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and more often if clinically indicated. Mild to moderate fluctuations in ALT and/or AST levels (< 5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) are typical in individuals with chronic HCV infection and, in the absence of signs or symptoms of liver disease or increases in bilirubin, do not warrant interruption of ART but warrant monitoring to ensure a return to baseline. Patients with significant elevations in ALT or AST levels (> 5 times ULN), concomitant increase in total bilirubin, or concomitant symptoms (weakness, nausea, vomiting) should be evaluated for liver insufficiency and alternative causes of liver injury, and if these signs and symptoms do not resolve, ART should be discontinued.

Chronic hepatitis B initial evaluation of an HBsAg-positive patient — Table 3 outlines the baseline assessment. History and physical examination include symptoms/signs of cirrhosis, alcohol and metabolic risk factors, family history of HCC, and vaccination status. Routine laboratory tests include CBC with platelet count, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and INR; selected patients may have tests to rule out other causes of chronic liver disease if liver tests are elevated and AFP and GGT. Serology/virology assessments include HBeAg/anti-HBe, HBV DNA quantitation, anti-HAV to determine vaccination need, HBV genotype, anti-HDV, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV in those who have not undergone one-time screening (ages 13–64). Imaging/staging studies include abdominal ultrasound, vibration-controlled transient elastography or serum fibrosis panel (APRI, FIB-4, or FibroTest), and liver biopsy.

### Prevalence and long-term course of macro-aspartate aminotransferase in children [^114bAZft]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence, association with clinical conditions, and long-term course of macro-aspartate aminotransferase (macro-AST).

Study Design

Forty-four children with an isolated elevation of serum AST were screened for macro-AST with electrophoresis and % polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitable activity (PPA).

Results

All children were healthy, except they had elevated AST values. Seventeen children (38.6%) were macro-AST-positive. They had higher AST values than the 27 children who were macro-AST-negative (P = 0.001). Values < 67.1% PPA and > 82.2% PPA were associated with a very low probability of being macro-AST-positive and macro-AST-negative, respectively. Thirty-eight children underwent clinical and laboratory follow-up (mean, 4.7 ± 3.8; range, 1–16 years). All remained symptom-free. AST levels decreased significantly only in children who were macro-AST-negative (P = 0.006). Macroenzyme persisted in 6 of the 9 children who were macro-AST-positive after 6.0 ± 4.1 years.

Conclusions

Macro-AST was present in more than one-third of children with an isolated increase of AST levels. The lack of pathological correlates in a long period argues for the benign nature of this phenomenon in childhood. We suggest that our %PPA thresholds can be used as a screening test and that electrophoresis be reserved for confirming positive screen test results and cases in which %PPA levels are of intermediate discriminant accuracy.

### Serum transaminase levels in boys with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy [^113JbcSw]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels are commonly used as biochemical indicators of hepatocellular injury but can also detect occult muscle disease. High concomitant serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels can point to muscle as the source of high transaminase levels. Nevertheless, clinicians may be reluctant to attribute high transaminase levels to muscle.

Methods

Study patients were boys with a genetic or biopsy-confirmed dystrophinopathy whose concomitant serum CPK, ALT, and AST levels were measured.

Results

We report 82 enzyme data sets from 46 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 9 with Becker muscular dystrophy. Our results show a linear relationship between serum CPK and serum ALT and AST and a logarithmic relationship between serum enzyme levels and age for boys with DMD. We developed a mathematical model to predict serum ALT and AST levels when the serum CPK level and age are known. For 6 boys, initial failure to consider muscle as a cause of high transaminase levels led to delay of diagnosis and extensive testing for hepatic dysfunction. A second group of 4 boys with known DMD were investigated for liver disease after high transaminase levels were detected. Serum transaminase levels were highest in ambulant boys with DMD, whose levels reached 1220 U/L (ALT) (22.6 times higher than upper-limit normal levels) and 801 U/L (AST) (12.3 times higher than upper-limit normal levels).

Conclusions

By recognizing muscle as a potential source of serum transaminase levels, clinicians can avoid unnecessary and invasive procedures, expedite clinical diagnosis, and avoid unnecessary cessation of concomitant drug therapy.

Guidance statements — clinically significant drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is defined as any of: serum AST or ALT > 5x ULN or ALP > 2x ULN on two separate occasions, total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP, or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; most hepatotoxic drugs cause injury within the first 6 months, so evaluation should include a detailed medication and HDS history within the 180 days before presentation; classify injury using the ratio (ALT/ULN)/(ALP/ULN) into hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), and cholestatic (R ≤ 2) profiles; excluding alternative causes is required, and certain drugs have phenotype "signatures" useful for causality; We recommend accessing the LiverTox website for literature covering over 1000 prescription drugs.

### Fast-food-based hyper-alimentation can induce rapid and profound elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase in healthy subjects [^112HRQAf]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

Liver disease is often identified by asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferases, as these are commonly included in serum chemistry panels drawn on healthy individuals. However, incidentally discovered elevations of serum aminotransferases often lead to lengthy, expensive and potentially invasive diagnostic evaluations. Analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) in the United States showed a prevalence of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to be as high as 7.9%. This figure is considerably higher than the 1–4% prevalence rate reported in earlier studies, and indicates that the prevalence of abnormal liver tests in the general population has increased. Although many cases of elevated aminotransferase levels can be explained by the consumption of large quantities of alcohol or the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a great number of cases typically remain unexplained. In both men and women, elevations of aminotransferases are strongly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, such as abdominal adiposity, high plasma glucose levels and dyslipidaemia, – Indeed, high serum levels of AST and ALT are associated with future risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Most cases of aminotransferase elevations in seemingly healthy subjects have hitherto generally been attributed to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and liver biopsy studies of patients referred for aminotransferase elevations have demonstrated liver steatosis as the most common histological finding. – Interestingly, it was recently shown that subjects with NAFLD and elevated aminotransferases have a significant risk of developing end-stage liver disease and a lower chance of survival mainly because of cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the widespread misconception that NAFLD is a mild disease with good prognosis has been highlightedand it is likely that physicians will be more concerned when facing patients with elevated aminotransferases. However, in most asymptomatic individuals with high aminotransferase levels, the elevation is intermittent and normal levels are found when testing is repeated within months.

Diagnostic approach to DILI

DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, relying on a detailed medical history including medication exposure, the pattern and course of liver biochemistry tests before and after drug discontinuation, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. The initial laboratory testing for DILI includes serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and total and direct bilirubin levels, whereas serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) levels are a marker of severity (Figure 1). Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated serum AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI may present with lower levels of laboratory abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries because of NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^112n86gL]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

TAEAT DEFINITION

The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 grades AST and ALT levelsbased on reference to upper limits of normal (ULN) or baseline values (if baseline is abnormal). G1 elevations are > 1.0– ≤ 3.0×ULN (1.5–3.0×baseline), and G2 elevations are > 3.0–5.0×ULN/baseline, both of which are below the threshold defining acute DILI. Only G3 (> 5.0–20.0×ULN/ > 5.0–20.0×baseline) and G4 (> 20×ULN/(> 20×baseline) elevations meet currently accepted criteria for acute DILI. Although all AST and ALT elevations require close monitoring to establish whether they are isolated and transient events and to evaluate the risk of continuing drug therapy, the heightened significance of TAEAT requires further investigation.

Just as a third clinical phenotype has been proposed for DILI (ie, indirect hepatotoxicity), TAEAT might be best classified as a fourth DILI phenotype (ie, part of an extended spectrum of drug adaptation). This distinguishes TAEAT from clinically overt hepatotoxicity, given that after initial aminotransferase elevations develop in patients with TAEAT, levels gradually decline over days to weeks. Thus, TAEAT are akin to the adaptive response seen among several other drug classes; notably the statinsand tacrine, which has reached G4 ALT elevations.

TAEAT does not always preclude continuation of the causative oncotherapeutic agent and may resolve quickly without treatment interruption, as shown for blinatumomab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, interleukin (IL)–2, interferon-α, and fluorouracil. However, regulatory restrictions and treatment guidelines that recommend (or mandate) treatment interruption/discontinuation for asymptomatic ≥ G3 AST and ALT elevations can limit data generation for further identification and characterization of TAEAT. Additional research is needed to establish criteria for isolated ≥ G3 AST and ALT elevations, so clinicians can differentiate between those that spontaneously resolve without consequences (ie, TAEAT) and those that may progress further to liver-related symptoms such as jaundice or acute or subacute hepatic failure, that is, coagulopathy (international normalized ratio [INR] ≥ 1.5) and new onset encephalopathy.

### Brief communication: clinical implications of short-term variability in liver function test results [^117Gq1fp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians sometimes order liver tests as part of a screening examination or general work-up. Current guidelines do not recommend routine retesting of abnormal results in asymptomatic patients.

Objective

To characterize the magnitude of intraindividual variability of liver test results and determine the proportion of adults with persistently elevated levels after 1 positive test.

Design

Reliability study.

Setting

The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III First and Second Examinations (1988 to 1994).

Participants

1864 men and women age 18 years or older living in the United States.

Measurements

Repeated measurements (mean, 17.5 days apart) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and bilirubin.

Results

Using NHANES III cutoffs for normal levels, 38% of adults with initially elevated bilirubin levels had normal levels at the second examination. These proportions were 36%, 31%, 17%, and 12% for AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltranferase, respectively. More than 95% of initially normal results remained normal. The results did not differ by alcohol consumption; hepatitis A, B, or C serologic status; recent infection; body mass index; or sociodemographic characteristics. Intraindividual variability was significantly higher for bilirubin (coefficient of variation, 23.4%) and ALT (coefficient of variation, 20.4%) than for AST (coefficient of variation, 13.9%), gamma-glutamyltransferase (coefficient of variation, 13.8%), and alkaline phosphatase (coefficient of variation, 6.7%).

Limitations

Only 2 measurements were available. Complete liver disease history was lacking.

Conclusion

If retested, more than 30% of adults with elevated AST, ALT, or bilirubin levels would be reclassified as normal. Clinicians should be aware of the high intraindividual variability in common liver tests, and practice guidelines should explicitly recommend retesting of asymptomatic individuals with abnormal liver test results.

### Limiting the testing of AST: a diagnostically nonspecific enzyme [^112fbgcP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Annually, millions of pairs of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) tests are ordered. These enzymes are highly correlated, and ALT is far more specific diagnostically than AST. To reduce AST testing, we suggest measuring AST only when ALT exceeds a predetermined limit.

Methods

We derived the proportions of elevated ASTs that would not be measured based on 15 months of paired inpatient and outpatient ALT and AST data.

Results

For inpatients, a 35 U/L ALT limit for initiating AST testing would reduce AST testing by 51%, missing only 3% and 7.5% of ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively. In outpatients, AST testing can be reduced by more than 65%, with fewer missed elevated ASTs (0.5% and 2% of the ASTs exceeding 50 U/L and 35 U/L, respectively).

Conclusions

Conservatively, $100 million could be saved annually in the US health care budget by selectively limiting AST testing in just the US outpatient environment.

AASLD practice guidance — diagnostic entry criteria and initial steps for suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include biochemical evidence of liver injury meeting one of these criteria: 1) AST or ALT > 5x ULN, or ALP > 2x ULN (or pretreatment baseline if abnormal) on 2 separate occasions, 2) Total serum bilirubin > 2.5mg/dL with elevated AST, ALT or ALP level, or 3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT or ALP. DILI suspected based on clinical history, symptoms, and/or physical exam: 1) Assess exposure to all prescription and over the counter medications, HDS products, and toxins, including start and stop dates, especially within the preceding 6 months; 2) Discontinue any non-essential medications and supplements. Determine R ratio R = ALT/ULN ALP/ULN and classify as R ≥ 5: Hepatocellular, R value 2–5: Mixed, or R ≤ 2: Cholestatic.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^117G2zgw]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of drugs are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which has a wide spectrum of clinical and biochemical manifestations, ranging from transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases (TAEAT) to acute liver failure. Most cases (> 90%) of DILI resolve fully within several weeks after drug discontinuation, although some cases can persist as chronic low-level enzyme elevations for 6 to 12 months despite the drug cessation. Drug adaptation may also occur, defined as the phenomenon whereby an agent fails to cause progressive worsening of DILI beyond what are generally transient, low-level, asymptomatic reversible alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations despite the drug continuation.

Although international working groups have defined threshold levels of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to distinguish acute DILI from mild elevations, the clinical significance of higher level (ie, grade 3 [G3] and grade 4 [G4]) asymptomatic transient elevations has not been extensively studied, especially in oncology. In addition, there are gaps in the understanding of mechanisms leading to significantly elevated aminotransferase levels, specifically in cases of asymptomatic and transient presentations without clinical signs of hepatocyte damage.

Herein, TAEAT is used to indicate the occurrence of transient asymptomatic G3 and G4 elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) without associated elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase or corresponding histologic liver abnormalities. A review of TAEAT in oncology clinical trials and clinical practice is provided. In addition, the gaps in our current understanding of the phenomenon are identified, including those areas where consensus guidelines and practical suggestions for clinicians involved in managing oncology patients with elevated aminotransferases may offer value.

Immune-related myopathy (irMyopathy)

Subtypes, evaluation and definitions of irMyopathy syndromes are presented in table 7. The rationale for common, possible and uncommon disease-specific testing is outlined.

Table 7
irMyopathy

Common

Diagnostic evaluation for irMyopathy includes CK to assess for muscle breakdown. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are typically elevated along with CK. Gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) evaluates for liver-specific injury and is normal when AST/ALT elevations are due to muscle disease. EDX evaluate for muscle membrane irritability (indicated by fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves), which can be seen in inflammatory or necrotizing myopathy, and for myopathic motor unit potentials (characterized by short duration, with or without low amplitude and/or early recruitment). EMG should include needle examination of clinically weak muscles and thoracic paraspinals. Of note, abnormalities in motor unit potentials may be patchy or subtle, and recruitment is often normal, particularly in the acute setting. EDX are often performed with repetitive nerve stimulation of proximal nerve-muscle combinations to test for an overlapping neuromuscular junction disorder. Troponin-I, EKG, and echocardiogram may be used for initial screening for concurrent myocarditis. While troponin-T may beelevated with myositis, troponin-I is more specific for cardiac injury.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^1142Ngsv]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Standard of diagnosis: role of currently performed liver tests in assessing DILI

DILI most often presents as an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome, without symptoms that specifically point to the drug aetiology unless rash or other cutaneous manifestationsreinforce the suspicion of drug toxicity. The clinical spectrum of DILI can mimic almost every other liver disorder. Accompanying blood eosinophilia is uncommon in large series of patients with DILI, but is clearly suggestive of drug allergy. Histopathological findings in DILI can resemble many other liver disorders, thereby limiting the value of liver biopsy in DILI diagnosis. However, biopsy can be of use to establish an alternative diagnosis when the underlying liver disease worsens (ie, alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH))(table 1).

Table 1
Examples of host and environmental variables influencing the diagnostic workup in patients assessed for suspected DILI

A diagnostic workflow for assessing cases of suspected DILI is shown in figure 3. Serum aminotransferases, that is, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB) levels, although not specific for DILI, remain the hallmark for detecting and classifying liver damage. Minor increases in aminotransferases that can result from adaptive and reversible liver responses to the drug (eg, statins) or from pre-existing liver disease (eg, fatty liver) should not be classified as DILI. An international expert groupproposed the following thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI: (a) ALT value ≥ 5× ULN, (b) ALP value ≥ 2× ULN or (c) ALT value ≥ 3× ULN and TB ≥ 2× ULN. The latter constellation defines 'Hy's Law', which anticipates a 10% risk of mortality/liver transplantation, as confirmed in large databases of DILI cases. The FDA guidance for DILI extends the interpretation of Hy's Law by stating that 'there should not be a prominent cholestatic component' in the hepatocellular nature of the liver injury, suggesting that a cholestatic component as defined by elevated ALP levels is associated with less risk of progression. However, a recent analysis from the Spanish DILI Registry showed that raised ALP > 2 ULN did not decrease the risk of acute liver failure in cases fulfilling Hy's Law. A marked increase of AST and an AST/ALT ratio > 1.5 at DILI recognition also predict a worse prognosis.

### Can AST / ALT ratio indicate recovery after acute paracetamol poisoning? [^11432eW4]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Paracetamol (acetaminophen or APAP) is the most common pharmaceutical exposure in the US. Elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels indicate hepatic toxicity. AST and ALT levels rise in similar proportions but later decline at different rates, with AST falling more rapidly than ALT.

Objective

To determine whether the AST/ALT ratio can indicate that a patient has passed the time of peak AST concentration.

Methods

We retrospectively identified cases of patients hospitalized for acute APAP poisoning by querying the pharmacy database of all patients treated with acetylcysteine (NAC) from January 1, 2001 to March 19, 2013. We included all patients with severe APAP poisoning, defined as AST or ALT greater than 1000 IU/L. Patients who were given NAC for other indications, those without APAP poisoning, and those receiving liver transplantation were excluded. We then recorded paired AST and ALT concentrations from each patient's hospital course. We classified each pair as clearly post-peak or not, and calculated the AST/ALT ratio for each pair of values. We compared different thresholds of AST/ALT ratio in increments of 0.1 to find the optimal value that reliably indicated resolving transaminases.

Results

We identified 1820 patients who received NAC during the study period. Of these, 333 received NAC for suspected poisoning by APAP. After excluding patients without severe APAP poisoning, other diagnoses explaining transaminase elevations, and patients who underwent liver transplantation, we had 37 evaluable patients with 343 evaluable pairs of AST and ALT concentrations. An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 was 99% sensitive for identifying patients with resolving transaminases.

Conclusion

An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 following severe hepatoxicity from paracetamol poisoning appears to be highly predictive of recovery in patients treated with NAC. This has potential to be an indicator of safe discontinuation of NAC treatment.

### Insights into statin intolerance [^116S7YG6]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the Laboratory

Q: What laboratory tests help to confirm a diagnosis of statin intolerance?

Dr. Sperling: There is no test that typically confirms a diagnosis of statin intolerance, and this is one of the reasons that it is such a difficult clinical entity to address.

Dr. Wong: Obtaining adequate baseline information on current muscle and other symptoms before a patient begins a statin is important, as symptoms are often erroneously attributed to the statin when they were actually present beforehand.

Some papers in the literature suggest that measurement of creatine kinase (CK) is most appropriate for a patient workup, after symptoms of intolerance have emerged.

Some physicians prefer to obtain a baseline CK for comfort, whereas others claim that with a baseline CK, you may end up pursuing the enzyme forever.

Changes in CK levels can occur daily, and CK is not a diagnostic tool. Although there is a general tendency not to look at CK levels in the absence of a specific complaint, a CK measurement 1 to 2 days following intense exercise may be appropriate to see what the highest values might be.

Myositis (defined as muscle inflammation) seems to be associated with exercise, and almost without exception with CK elevations; myalgia (defined as muscle pain) can be relatively nondescript and is seldom associated with CK elevation.

Patients are interested in their liver enzymes. It is recommended that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements be done at baseline and then be repeated, but there is little need for ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes unless warranted.

The ALT and AST levels are measured to determine if a patient is developing liver damage, or even liver failure, which may occur idiosyncratically in 1 in a million patients. This is the same incidence that is seen in patients who are not on statins, so a physician might ask what is really being accomplished by obtaining these measurements. It should be noted that ALT and AST will often increase transiently and harmlessly during the first few weeks of statin therapy.

It should also be noted that some patients may be heavy drinkers, and this may confuse the issue with regard to liver function testing.

Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### A multicenter study into causes of severe acute liver injury [^111pLJvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of ≥ 1000 IU/L often is stated to include 3 main etiologies: ischemic hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis (typically hepatitis A and hepatitis B), and drug-induced (more specifically, acetaminophen/paracetamol) liver injury (DILI). 1 Unfortunately, there are a paucity of studies examining the most common causes of acute liver injury (ALI) and those that have been published have been small, 2 single-center, 2 or examined less severe increases in ALT or AST levels. 3,4 We conducted a multicenter study of all patients with an ALT and/or AST level ≥ 1000 IU/L. Our study had 3 main goals: (1) to determine the most common causes of an ALT and/or AST level ≥ 1000 IU/L, along with their relative frequencies; (2) to determine differences in etiology based on hospital type (liver transplant center, community hospital, Veterans Affairs hospital); and (3) to confirm or disprove the differential heuristic that ischemic hepatitis, acute viral hepatitis, and acetaminophen toxicity are the most common etiologies.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: the child with an incidental finding of elevated aminotransferases [^113gzBjz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

It is not unusual to encounter abnormal liver enzyme levels on routine blood tests. When the abnormal elevation in aminotransferases persist, they require prompt and appropriate investigations as liver diseases in children are often insidious in onset and clinically silent. This article aims to provide (1) an explanation to the aetiologies of elevated aminotransferases; (2) an investigational approach to these children and (3) an insight into further investigations performed at a liver centre.

The risk of an abnormal liver test in 813 patients with multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome enrolled in placebo arms of clinical trials was greater than expected for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (relative risk [RR] 3.7; 95% CI: 2.3 to 6.0) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (RR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3 to 3.6), although not alkaline phosphatase (AP) or total bilirubin, at first presentation. Abnormal test results were associated with higher body mass index (ALT only), male gender (ALT only), and a relapsing-remitting (vs secondary-progressive) course (ALT and AST only).

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

### Persistent elevation of aspartate aminotransferase in a child after incomplete Kawasaki disease: a case report and literature review [^116m1wNR]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Interpretation of abnormalities in liver function tests, especially in asymptomatic children, is a common problem faced by clinicians. Isolated elevation of aspartate aminotransferase may further puzzle physicians. Macro-aspartate aminotransferase (AST) results from complexes AST produces with other plasma components, such as immunoglobulin. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a case of macro-AST-associated incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD). It is to make physicians aware of this benign condition and help to prevent extensive, unnecessary investigations and invasive workups.

Case Presentation

A 16-month old boy with a 7-day history of fever was admitted to our pediatric ward for pyrexia workup. After complete investigations, KD was confirmed by a pediatric rheumatologist. During his admission and serial follow-up tests, an isolated AST elevation was noted. Comprehensive tests were performed and using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method, macro-AST was confirmed. The patient has been followed up for 3 years, and so far, the benign nature of this condition has been confirmed.

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider testing for macro-AST when elevated AST is the only abnormal lab finding. Although an uncommon finding, macro-AST may be seen in both children and adults. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, including resolved acute hepatitis or in some cases, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic malignancy, monoclonal gammapathy, celiac disease, or KD; however, it may be observed in asymptomatic healthy children as well. Using the PEG precipitation method, a definitive diagnosis can be made. In none of these conditions does macro-AST have any prognostic significance. An appreciation of macro-AST may prevent the need for more invasive investigations to which patients may be unnecessarily subjected. It is important to recognize this condition as benign and assure patients that no specific treatment is required.

Alcoholic liver disease — Significant alcohol consumption has been suggested as ≥ 210 g of alcohol per week in men and ≥ 140 g per week in women, and patterns suggestive of alcoholic liver injury include an AST:ALT ratio of at least 2:1, with a higher ratio of AST:ALT exceeding 3:1 further increasing the likelihood of alcoholic liver disease; measurement of GGT may represent a complementary test but by itself is not helpful diagnostically, and alcohol consumption should be queried in all patients with abnormal liver chemistries with complete cessation recommended.

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^1134VH4e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primaryand secondary care in an attempt to exclude liver disease, for the monitoring of potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and for the investigation of the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases though they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly presages a cycle of additional liver blood test testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual, and notably, most patients referred to hospital with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130 849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices and of these, 38 636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkably low, with only 3.9% of those with an abnormal value being diagnosed with significant liver disease within 5 years of the test. Thus, used in isolation, liver blood tests are neither specific diagnostic tools nor specific exclusion tools, whereas they can be more effectively used to assess the extent of liver fibrosis if incorporated into algorithmsor used in conjunction with other modalities.

### Assessment, differential diagnosis, and initial clinical evaluation of the pediatric patient with obesity: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^113EVUmW]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — initial evaluation elements include metabolic, hepatic, vitamin D, cardiovascular, sleep, and uric acid assessments. Children with obesity are at risk for glycemic dysregulation, and a fasting blood glucose or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test will determine whether glycemic dysregulation is present. Dyslipidemia is the most common laboratory abnormality found in children with obesity, and either a fasting lipid profile or a non-fasting lipid profile, if fasting is not feasible, can assess dyslipidemia. Liver function tests, specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), can screen for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many children are at risk for vitamin D deficiency, which is detected with a 25-hydroxy (25 OH) vitamin D test. Blood pressure is checked if the child is older than three years of age. Other studies are indicated based on history; a sleep study for any history of snoring, daytime sleepiness, disrupted sleep cycle or even hyperactivity may be indicated, and liver imaging can be done if the liver function tests (ALT and AST) are high. Uric acid can be obtained in those children with diabetes or prediabetes, and uric acid can be elevated with high intake of high fructose corn syrup and even table sugar.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, overinvestigation and considerably increased costs.

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

An important consideration when evaluating the risk of hepatic fibrosis is that both AST and ALT can be normal even in the setting of cirrhosis, and the utility of the AST:ALT ratio in adults persists even if both values are within the normal reference interval. While it is hard to justify the routine analysis of both AST and ALT together on every liver blood test request, a strategy not supported by the data from the BALLETS study, subsequent testing of AST (or ALT depending which one is undertaken first) to calculate the AST:ALT ratio is clearly desirable. From a patient and cost perspective this is likely to be more cost-effective if performed by 'reflex' on the same sera following the detection of an abnormal ALT or GGT. To date there is no firm evidence that this is a cost-effective approach, although the results of a pilot study of such 'reflex' testing and additional up-front aetiology screen testing from Wales and Scotland are awaited.

### Rhabdomyolysis: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^113vW8Xu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

What laboratory findings aid in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?

Recommendation

The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (> 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentration is identified (typically at 24–72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.

Discussion

Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reperfusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation. In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level > 5× the upper limit of normal or > 1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.CK values may become elevated within 12 hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy.

Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1–3 hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%. Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdomyolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115wEbB4]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1156xFwp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Fitusiran (Qfitlia) [^1133Fern]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

In the two randomized studies testing QFITLIA 80 mg once monthly, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 32% of patients with hemophilia with inhibitors and 18% of patients with hemophilia without inhibitors compared to no events of AST or ALT elevation greater than 3× ULN in the control groups. There was one case of moderate hepatic injury (ALT elevation > 300 U/L and total serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL) attributable to QFITLIA use. This patient had elevation of liver tests after a single 80 mg dose that continued to rise with repeated dosing of QFITLIA 80 mg once monthly. This patient's liver tests recovered with drug discontinuation. QFITLIA 80 mg once monthly is not approved or recommended for use.

On the AT-DR, 3.4% of patients treated with QFITLIA had at least one ALT value greater than 3× ULN with a median onset of 89 days after initial dosing (range 15 to 768 days).

Avoid use of QFITLIA in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C).

Obtain baseline liver tests including AST, ALT, and total bilirubin prior to initiating QFITLIA, monthly for at least the first 6 months of QFITLIA use, and monthly for at least 6 months after a dose increase, and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated.

If new or worsening liver test abnormalities occur, perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations, initiate medical management as appropriate and monitor laboratory parameters until they return to baseline. If ALT or AST elevations greater than 5× ULN occur, interrupt QFITLIA treatment. Consider the benefits and risks of resuming QFITLIA prophylaxis following resolution of transaminase elevations. If you decide to restart QFITLIA, wait until liver tests have returned to baseline. If QFITLIA is restarted and ALT or AST elevations greater than 5× ULN reoccur or the patient experiences jaundice (total bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL) thought to be from hepatotoxicity with other causes of liver test elevation ruled out, permanently discontinue QFITLIA.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^116AtZym]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

### Utility of hepatic transaminases to recognize abuse in children [^114GEyze]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Although experts recommend routine screening of hepatic transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in cases of potential child physical abuse, this practice is highly variable. Our objective was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of routine transaminase testing in young children who underwent consultation for physical abuse.

Patients and Methods

This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study of all children younger than 60 months referred for subspecialty evaluation of possible physical abuse. The child abuse team at each center recommended screening transaminases routinely as standard of care for all cases with a reasonable concern for physical abuse. Sensitivity and specificity for transaminases and clinical examination findings to detect identified abdominal injuries were determined, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was undertaken.

Results

Of 1676 consultations, 1272 (76%) patients underwent transaminase testing, and 54 (3.2% [95% confidence interval: 2.4–4.2]) had identified abdominal injuries. Area under the curve for the highest level of either transaminase was 0.85. Using a threshold level of 80 IU/L for either AST or ALT yielded a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 82% (positive likelihood ratio: 4.3; negative likelihood ratio: 0.3). Of injuries with elevated transaminase levels, 14 (26%) were clinically occult, lacking abdominal bruising, tenderness, and distention. Several clinical findings used to predict abdominal injury had high specificity but low sensitivity.

Conclusions

In the population of children with concern for physical abuse, abdominal injury is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, but it is not so common as to warrant universal imaging. Abdominal imaging should be considered for potentially abused children when either the AST or ALT level is > 80 IU/L or with abdominal bruising, distention, or tenderness.

### Loss of life expectancy by 10 years or more from elevated aspartate aminotransferase: finding aspartate aminotransferase a better mortality predictor for all-cause and liver-related than alanine aminotransferase [^116iCHjp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 2 commonly ordered liver function tests, and ALT has long been considered more liver-specific than AST. Between the 2, the one which is better in predicting liver or non-liver-related mortality remains unsettled.

Methods

The cohort, 416,122 adults, came from a self-paying comprehensive health surveillance program during 1994–2008 and was followed up till 2008. Mortality came from National Death Index, with 10,412 deaths identified. Hazard ratios (HRs), computed by Cox model, and life expectancy, by life table method, were presented for 5 levels of AST and ALT with elevated AST or ALT defined as ≥ 40 IU/L. Liver disease included liver cancer and other liver conditions.

Results

There were 3 times more elevated ALT (15.4%) than AST (5.7%). However, those with elevated AST had higher mortality for all-cause (HR = 2.44), for liver disease (HR = 27.2), and for liver cancer (HR = 47.6) than its ALT counterparts (HR = 1.69, 10.8, and 20.2, respectively). Elevated AST also lost more years of life expectancy (10.2) than those lost by ALT (5.2) and larger than most common risks. Elevated AST had increased mortality from all cancers (HR = 3.57), stroke (HR = 1.36), respiratory diseases (HR = 1.34), and injuries (HR = 1.82), other than just liver disease. All-cause mortality remained significantly increased, when high risk groups were excluded, such as frequent drinkers, hepatitis carriers, those died from nonmedical conditions, those died in the first 3 years, or advanced fibrosis index based on 4 factors or aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index. Results were consistent between those returned for second visits and those analyzed in initial visits.

Discussion

Those with elevated AST (≥ 40 IU/L) had life expectancy cut short by 10.2 years, doubled the number of years lost with elevated ALT. For all-cause and for liver-related mortality, AST was an important predictor, better than ALT.

### Macro-AST: misleading finding in an adolescent with MCAD-deficiency [^1112MWZX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

MCAD-deficiency is the most common inborn error of fatty acid oxidation now included in many newborn screening programms using MS/MS. During prolonged catabolic episodes, patients may suffer from metabolic decompensation with dysfunction of liver, skeletal- and heart muscle as well as brain. In anabolism, neither clinical symptoms nor biochemical signs of organ dysfunction occur.

Case Presentation

We report a female patient with MCAD-deficiency in whom at the age of 11 years isolated AST-elevation was found without any clinical or biochemical signs of organ dysfunction. We showed by polyethylene glycol precipitation that macro-AST formation was responsible for this biochemical finding. AST was probably complexed with immunoglobulins possibly related to an allergic disposition. Macro-AST formation is not a special feature of MCAD-deficiency but rather a non-specific, coincidental finding which also occurs in healthy individuals. The general practitioner consulted by the patient before coming to our outpatient clinic for inborn errors of metabolism was worried that isolated AST-elevation indicated cell damage in MCAD-deficiency. He ordered further diagnostic tests like ultrasound, ECG and echocardiography without any pathology.

Conclusion

In isolated AST-elevation, macro-AST has to be considered in order to avoid unnecessary, costly and invasive evaluation. This is not only true for healthy persons but for patients with chronic diseases like MCAD as well.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and diagnostic testing include population screening, test performance, and confirmatory steps. Approximately 4.1 million Americans are positive for anti-bodies against hepatitis C, and an estimated 3.0 million harbor chronic infection on the basis of positive hepatitis C RNA in the serum. The screening test for chronic hepatitis C is the hepatitis C antibody, which has a sensitivity of 92–97%, but the positive predictive value is highest with risk factors, and false positives may be observed in 5% of cases, and as high as 30% among individuals without reported risk factors. Confirmation of chronic infection is established by a highly sensitive HCV RNA PCR assay, and individuals confirmed to have positive RNA should be referred to a specialist for further characterization and assessment of liver fibrosis to guide therapy decisions. As recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individuals born within the 1945–1965 birth cohort should be considered for universal HCV antibody testing independent of abnormalities in AST/ALT levels, which may be normal in chronic infection. For suspected acute infection, testing includes anti-HCV, which is typically positive 6–8 weeks after exposure, with confirmation by measuring HCV RNA by PCR testing which must be done to confirm acute hepatitis or chronic hepatitis C.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^115EUJrR]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

REAL-WORLD EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TAEAT IN ONCOLOGY

Limited information is available on how practicing oncologists manage TAEAT or what criteria are used to predict whether the elevated aminotransferases will progress to more serious DILI. A recent real-world US evaluation of elevated aminotransferases associated with IO therapies found that isolated ALT and AST elevations of ≥ G3 were relatively transient (up to 128 d with median duration ~7 d), with only 5.3% subsequently progressing to elevated bilirubin levels. In this study, oncologists discontinued ICI therapy in 8% of cases, with 92% of patients proceeding with their anticancer treatment. In 37% of cases, ≥ G3 aminotransferase elevations were managed with corticosteroids without interruption of ICI therapy, illustrating decision-making based on risk:benefit assessment. Additional real-world studies are needed to assess current trends in TAEAT management in cancer patients treated with non-IO drugs including drug interruptions/discontinuations, use of corticosteroids, and frequency of liver function assessment. An analysis of 1670 patients in 85 phase 1 oncology studies found similar rates of DILI for patients in immune-based versus targeted therapy trials (5.0% vs. 4.9%); DILI resolved in 96% of patients, with no reports of drug-related liver failure, consistent with TAEAT representing drug adaptation. Nevertheless, additional real-world data and prospective clinical trials in specific oncology populations are needed to identify factors that predict which patients with elevated aminotransferases are likely to progress to more serious liver injury. Additional work is underway to develop best practice guidelines for the assessment of liver chemistries in oncology trials. In particular, consensus is needed regarding the continuation of an oncotherapeutic agent in patients experiencing TAEAT based on individual risk:benefit assessment.

### Macro-AST: misleading finding in an adolescent with MCAD-deficiency [^1135Mmjw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Medium chain acyl CoA-dehydrogenase (MCAD)-deficiency (OMIM #201450) is the most common inborn error of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. It is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait and leads to compromised breakdown of C4-C12 acyl-CoAs. The incidence in Northern Europe is 1:9,000 to 1:11,000 (and own data). Catabolism (immediately after birth or during common infections) may trigger acute metabolic decompensation. As fatty acids are the main energy fuel for skeletal and heart muscle as well as liver, dysfunction of these organs may occur during metabolic decompensation in MCAD-deficient patients though other mechanisms may play an additional role. Encephalopathy is presumably caused by the accumulation of toxic lipophilic compounds proximal to the enzyme defect as well as hypoketotic hypoglycaemia. Hypoketonaemia is based on compromised hepatic ketogenesis resulting from reduced fatty acid oxidation and leads to energy deprivation of the brain during prolonged catabolism/fasting.

MCAD-deficiency is a target disease of many newborn screening programs using the MS/MS technique which resulted in a significant reduction of metabolic decompensations and death by simply avoiding catabolism. The same goes for MCAD-patients diagnosed after an initial metabolic decompensation by selective screening.

There is no chronic toxicity known in MCAD-deficiency though prospective long-term studies are lacking. In childhood, decompensation typically occurs during febrile illness or emesis. However, there are different challenges during adolescence/adulthood which may hamper anabolism in the absence of parental care. Catabolism may be triggered by alcohol ingestion, fasting for weight reduction and competitive sports without adequate intake of food, in females, pregnancy and delivery may be an issue.

We report a female patient with MCAD-deficiency who developed isolated AST-elevation at the age of 11 years which was supposed to be a sign of chronic toxicity but later turned out to be due to macro-AST. Macro-AST is known for many years as a cause of isolated AST-elevation, however, it is often not considered during the work-up of patients with AST-elevation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^1177apKg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^1169AewF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic fatty liver disease — evaluation and diagnostic features include minimal aminotransferase elevations with AST typically greater than ALT, possible γ-glutamyl transpeptidase elevation, and typically normal serum bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio (INR); diagnosis of hepatic steatosis is based on imaging and liver biopsy is not routinely required. A proportion of patients with biopsy-proven steatohepatitis develop hepatic fibrosis (20–40%) and cirrhosis (8–20%), and one-third of patients with asymptomatic forms of ASH have significant liver fibrosis.
