## Question

Chronic sinusitis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic sinusitis treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying phenotype. Then, I should verify first-line medical therapy. Next, I will consider escalation strategies for CRS with and without polyps, including antibiotics, systemic steroids, and biologics. After that, I need to check surgical indications and preoperative planning. Finally, I will review special populations, postoperative care, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and phenotype, because treatment hinges on accurate classification. Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined by at least two cardinal symptoms for at least 12 weeks plus objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation on endoscopy or CT, and I should explicitly distinguish CRS with nasal polyps from CRS without nasal polyps since management diverges significantly [^765512ae] [^02911e91]. Hold on, I should verify that objective confirmation is a strong recommendation; yes, guidelines emphasize documenting inflammation rather than relying on symptoms alone, which helps avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy [^765512ae].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy, and I need to ensure I anchor this to high-quality evidence. Saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids are first-line for all adults with CRS, with multiple guidelines converging on this approach and systematic reviews showing symptom improvement and polyp reduction with INCS, particularly in CRSwNP, and modest but real benefits in CRSsNP as well [^b7a1e484] [^09e8a228] [^212e61d9]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit; the JAMA review shows topical steroids improve overall symptom scores with a standardized mean difference around −0.46 and reduce polyp scores by about −0.73, which is clinically meaningful in polyp disease [^09e8a228].

> For CRS without nasal polyps, I will now examine escalation beyond first-line therapy. Long-term macrolide therapy for about 3 months can be considered in select patients, particularly those with a neutrophilic phenotype and low IgE, given modest improvements in quality of life and symptom scores, but I should confirm the evidence quality and risks; Cochrane suggests a moderate effect at 3 months that fades by 3 months post-treatment, and guidelines advise selective use with attention to cardiovascular risk and QT prolongation, so I need to screen carefully before prescribing [^ab3ebe00] [^09e8a228] [^10ccf0c9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; macrolides are not for everyone, and I should avoid routine use in CRSwNP or in patients with arrhythmia risk [^09e8a228] [^dfef6b6f].

> For CRS with nasal polyps, I should confirm that short courses of oral corticosteroids can reduce polyp burden and improve symptoms, albeit with recurrence risk and adverse effects. Evidence shows large short-term improvements in symptom scores and quality of life that are not sustained at 3 to 6 months, so I need to limit frequency and monitor for insomnia, GI upset, and mood changes, aligning with EPOS guidance to restrict to 1–2 courses per year in partially controlled disease [^209a0047] [^a60ef477]. Let me reconsider the balance; yes, the benefit is real but transient, so I should pair steroids with optimized INCS and consider definitive strategies if control remains poor [^209a0047].

> Now, I should review biologics, and I need to be precise about indications. Dupilumab has robust phase 3 data showing large improvements in SNOT-22, symptom severity, and CT scores, and a marked reduction in surgery risk, with high-certainty evidence supporting its use in severe CRSwNP after failure of intranasal steroids and, in many cases, surgery; mepolizumab shows smaller, low-certainty benefits, and omalizumab evidence remains limited, so I should prioritize dupilumab when choosing a biologic [^ea0a100f] [^90259ed2]. Wait, I should double-check the scope; current guidelines recommend against routine biologics in CRS without polyps because trials excluded that population, so I must not overgeneralize beyond CRSwNP [^92e0f68c] [^d8072ea1].

> I will now examine surgical indications and preoperative planning, and I need to ensure I align with contemporary guidance. Surgery is appropriate when maximal medical therapy fails or when disease features predict poor response to medical therapy alone, such as extensive polyps, bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal disease; surgeons should verify the diagnosis, assess candidacy holistically, and use CT for planning while avoiding arbitrary thresholds for mucosal thickening to dictate extent of surgery [^1516e54d] [^0965184d] [^f26b67e3]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines discourage mandatory medical prerequisites; yes, they explicitly oppose one-size-fits-all preoperative regimens, emphasizing individualized care and shared decision-making [^06ca3fc1].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts, and I should confirm nuances. In cystic fibrosis, CRS is universal and often refractory, so aggressive medical and surgical strategies are common, though high-quality guideline direction is limited, necessitating multidisciplinary care and consideration of macrolides in select cases [^1ea69fe7]. In aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, I should integrate aspirin desensitization with standard CRSwNP care, as this can improve polyp control and reduce steroid dependence, while still applying INCS, limited oral steroids, and considering biologics for refractory disease [^37d2bea7] [^d35034b6]. For pediatrics, evidence for antibiotics is insufficient, so I should avoid routine antibiotics and focus on saline, INCS, and specialist referral for refractory disease [^c32df222].

> Next, I should review postoperative care and long-term management, and I need to ensure I capture follow-up and expectations. Continued intranasal steroids and saline irrigations are essential after surgery, with structured follow-up at 3 to 12 months to assess symptoms, endoscopic findings, adherence, and need for rescue therapy; patients should be counseled that surgery is not curative and that ongoing medical therapy is expected [^85241262] [^0965184d]. Wait, let me verify the strength of these statements; they are strong recommendations within the surgical guideline, underscoring their importance for durable outcomes [^85241262].

> I should now synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check that it aligns with evidence. Start with confirmed CRS and phenotype classification, initiate saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids for all, reassess at about 3 months, and if inadequate control, escalate based on phenotype: in CRSsNP, consider a 3-month macrolide in carefully selected patients; in CRSwNP, consider a short oral steroid burst and then, if severe and refractory, discuss biologics, with surgery reserved for failure of maximal medical therapy or high-risk disease features; throughout, avoid empiric antibiotics unless there is purulence suggesting an acute bacterial exacerbation or odontogenic source [^b7a1e484] [^09e8a228] [^4912c1a7]. Hold on, I should verify the antibiotic caveat; yes, guidelines explicitly advise against routine antibiotics in CRS without acute infection, reinforcing a conservative stance [^4912c1a7].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed uncertainties and evidence gaps, and I should be transparent about them. The role of macrolides remains debated, with modest and inconsistent benefits and potential cardiovascular risks, so shared decision-making and careful selection are crucial pending larger RCTs [^ab3ebe00] [^dfef6b6f]. Biologics are effective but costly and long-term safety data continue to mature, so cost-effectiveness and patient preferences must guide use [^ea0a100f]. And while surgery improves access for topical therapy and can reduce polyp burden, it does not obviate the need for ongoing medical management, which I should emphasize during counseling to set realistic expectations [^c60faff5].

Chronic sinusitis treatment centers on **saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids** as first-line therapy [^b7a1e484] [^09e8a228], with antibiotics reserved for acute bacterial exacerbations or specific phenotypes [^4912c1a7] [^ab3ebe00]. Short courses of oral corticosteroids are used for severe nasal polyps [^209a0047] [^a60ef477], and biologics (dupilumab, omalizumab, mepolizumab) are options for refractory CRS with nasal polyps [^ea0a100f] [^90259ed2]. Surgery is considered for patients who fail maximal medical therapy or have obstructive anatomy [^1516e54d] [^e91eb09e]. Management should be individualized based on phenotype, severity, and comorbidities, with regular follow-up to adjust therapy and monitor for complications [^039a55e72] [^85241262].

## Medical management

### First-line therapies

- **Saline nasal irrigation**: Improves symptoms, mucociliary clearance, and reduces inflammation; recommended for all patients [^b7a1e484] [^09e8a228].

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation, improve nasal obstruction, and decrease polyp size; first-line for CRS with or without polyps [^b7a1e484] [^212e61d9].

- **Topical steroid irrigations**: Useful for post-surgical patients or those with significant disease burden; consider budesonide or mometasone irrigations [^212e61d9].

---

### Second-line therapies

- **Short-course oral corticosteroids**: For severe nasal polyps or acute exacerbations; limit to 1–2 courses/year due to adverse effects [^209a0047] [^a60ef477].

- **Long-term macrolide antibiotics**: Consider in CRS without polyps with neutrophilic inflammation; evidence is modest and selective [^ab3ebe00] [^09e8a228].

- **Leukotriene antagonists**: May benefit CRS with nasal polyps, especially with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) [^09e8a228] [^37d2bea7].

---

### Biologic therapies

Biologics are indicated for **severe CRS with nasal polyps refractory to standard care**. Dupilumab (IL-4Rα antagonist) significantly improves symptoms, quality of life, and reduces polyp burden and surgery need [^ea0a100f] [^90259ed2]. Omalizumab (anti-IgE) and mepolizumab (anti-IL-5) are options for refractory CRSwNP, particularly with allergic or eosinophilic phenotypes [^ea0a100f] [^90259ed2].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for patients who fail maximal medical therapy or have **obstructive anatomy** (e.g. severe polyps, fungal disease, bony erosion) [^1516e54d] [^e91eb09e]. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) improves drainage, facilitates medical therapy, and reduces symptom burden, but patients still require ongoing medical management postoperatively [^e04df8c7] [^c60faff5].

---

## Adjunctive and supportive therapies

- **Allergy management**: Identify and treat allergic triggers; consider immunotherapy in allergic patients [^85b082f7].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, hydration, and environmental controls (humidification, allergen avoidance) [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, proper inhaler/irrigation technique, and recognition of exacerbations [^2ded205b].

---

## Special considerations

- **Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD)**: Consider aspirin desensitization alongside standard therapy [^d35034b6].

- **Cystic fibrosis**: Aggressive medical and surgical management; consider macrolides and frequent debridement [^1ea69fe7].

- **Immunodeficiency**: Evaluate and manage underlying immune disorders [^85b082f7].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should track symptoms, endoscopic findings, and quality of life, with therapy adjusted based on response and complications [^85241262]. Long-term management emphasizes **persistent inflammation control** and prevention of recurrence [^c60faff5].

---

Chronic sinusitis treatment is **multimodal**, with saline and intranasal steroids as foundation therapy, escalation to oral steroids, macrolides, or biologics for refractory disease, and surgery for anatomical or severe cases. Individualized, phenotype-guided care and ongoing follow-up are essential for optimal outcomes.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

Importance

Chronic sinusitis is a common inflammatory condition defined by persistent symptomatic inflammation of the sinonasal cavities lasting longer than 3 months. It accounts for 1% to 2% of total physician encounters and is associated with large health care expenditures. Appropriate use of medical therapies for chronic sinusitis is necessary to optimize patient quality of life (QOL) and daily functioning and minimize the risk of acute inflammatory exacerbations.

Objective

To summarize the highest-quality evidence on medical therapies for adult chronic sinusitis and provide an evidence-based approach to assist in optimizing patient care.

Evidence Review

A systematic review searched Ovid MEDLINE (1947-January 30, 2015), EMBASE, and Cochrane Databases. The search was limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Evidence was categorized into maintenance and intermittent or rescue therapies and reported based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps.

Findings

Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria: 12 meta-analyses (> 60 RCTs), 13 systematic reviews, and 4 RCTs that were not included in any of the meta-analyses. Saline irrigation improved symptom scores compared with no treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.84]; a positive SMD indicates improvement). Topical corticosteroid therapy improved overall symptom scores (SMD, -0.46 [95% CI, -0.65 to -0.27]; a negative SMD indicates improvement), improved polyp scores (SMD, -0.73 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.46]; a negative SMD indicates improvement), and reduced polyp recurrence after surgery (relative risk, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79]). Systemic corticosteroids and oral doxycycline (both for 3 weeks) reduced polyp size compared with placebo for 3 months after treatment (P < .001). Leukotriene antagonists improved nasal symptoms compared with placebo in patients with nasal polyps (P < .01). Macrolide antibiotic for 3 months was associated with improved QOL at a single time point (24 weeks after therapy) compared with placebo for patients without polyps (SMD, -0.43 [95% CI, -0.82 to -0.05]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence supports daily high-volume saline irrigation with topical corticosteroid therapy as a first-line therapy for chronic sinusitis. A short course of systemic corticosteroids (1–3 weeks), short course of doxycycline (3 weeks), or a leukotriene antagonist may be considered in patients with nasal polyps. A prolonged course (3 months) of macrolide antibiotic may be considered for patients without polyps.

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^2fcf9e2e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last 2 decades, the exact etiology is still unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments are aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and restoring mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease on the basis of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^05bcd911]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^4912c1a7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

### Current insight into treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: phenotypes, endotypes, and implications for targeted therapeutics [^39a55e72]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is characterized by persistent locoregional mucosal inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and upper airway that has substantial associated health care costs. Personalized approaches to care that incorporate use of molecular biomarkers, phenotypes, and inflammatory endotypes is a major focus of research at this time, and the concurrent rise of targeted therapeutics and biologic therapies has the potential to rapidly advance care and improve outcomes. Recent findings suggest that improved understanding of chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypic and endotypic heterogeneity, and incorporation of these characteristics into clinical care pathways, may facilitate more effective selection of surgical and/or therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, these personalized approaches have the potential to target specific inflammatory pathways, increase efficacy, reduce costs, and limit side effects. This review summarizes recent advances in the identification and characterization of chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypes, endotypes, and biomarkers and reviews potential implications for targeted therapeutics.

### Evolution in the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis: current indications and pitfalls [^c60faff5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) consists of a range of inflammatory conditions in the sinuses that can result in clinical symptoms. The underlying pathophysiology and its relationship to lower airway disease are complex. Current definitions of CRS can serve more as an indication for potential surgical intervention rather than a marker of disease state. CRS can be asymptomatic and may require medical management to avoid disease progression and minimize the risk of lower airway disease. Endoscopic surgery has undergone a significant evolution and refinement, but the most common surgical complication remains persistent inflammation and disease recurrence. It is important to recognize that surgery alone rarely cures CRS and patients require long-term medical therapy for continued asymptomatic inflammation. Careful postoperative care and endoscopic follow-up to ensure resolution of inflammation are key to ensuring optimal surgical outcomes and reduce the risk of revision surgery. Future work on CRS endotypes will allow discovery of new therapies to treat CRS, as well as refine indications for medical or surgical intervention and postoperative care.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^0965184d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery.

Methods

This guideline was developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations.

Action Statements

The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management… [^1af9f801]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Nasal/sinus bacterial cultures should be reserved for the circumstances previously outlined. The most common organisms isolated from patients with acute rhinosinusitis include. Treatment The general goals of therapy for patients with bacterial rhinosinusitis are to control infection, diminish tissue edema and reverse sinus ostial obstruction so the mucopus can drain. 1, 10, 17, 19–21 Maintaining patient hydration by adequate oral fluid intake, supplemented by the use of saline nasal sprays as desired, is recommended. Although study results are only suggestive, some studies 8, 17, 19, 20 used a mucolytic, and most favored the use of an oral decongestant, for patients with severe nasal/sinus obstruction. This can be supplemented with the addition of a topical decongestant for three to five days.

Oral antibiotics are recommended for seven to 14 days in patients with acute, recurrent acute or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis 1, 2, 10, 17, 22. The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently analyzed the world's literature and concluded that amoxicillin or folate inhibitors are appropriate choices as initial therapy in an otherwise healthy adult population with uncomplicated, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. 17, 22 Final recommendations may well mirror the antibiotic regimen for the treatment of patients with acute otitis media — amoxicillin, 80 to 90 mg per kg per day as initial therapy, reserving the broader spectrum and more expensive antibiotics for those patients who fail to improve after three days or whose symptoms worsen.
18.

Some experts favor a short course of oral steroid therapy in patients with acute rhinosinusitis to diminish tissue edema around the sinus ostia and to provide symptomatic relief. 1, 2, 10 This is controversial, given the potential for immunosuppression prolonging the underlying disease process. Topical steroids are commonly used in symptomatic patients with subacute or chronic rhinosinusitis and who have or are suspected of having inhalant sensitivities; however, these preparations are relatively ineffective in patients with acute rhinosinusitis because they poorly penetrate the associated rhinorrhea.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^85b082f7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### A decade of clinical advances in chronic rhinosinusitis: 2012–2022 [^c95d2c48]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The field of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is constantly evolving. In the past 10 years, key advancements in basic and translational research as well as clinical studies have improved our understanding and management of CRS. Notably, treatment options have expanded to include novel therapeutic drugs, devices, and surgical techniques. Assessments of patient symptoms and their impact on quality of life have become more standardized. Progress has also been made in both determining the true prevalence of CRS and recognizing comorbidities that can impact CRS severity. Practice guidelines have also shifted from expert opinion to more data-driven analyses. This review highlights major clinical advancements made in the field of CRS over the past 10 years as well as identifies current gaps in knowledge that can form the basis for new areas of study over the next decade.

### A practical approach to refractory chronic rhinosinusitis [^0f7b73cd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis, by definition, have persistent, poorly controlled symptoms and objective inflammatory findings despite prior medical and surgical therapy. These patients represent a diagnostic and treatment challenge given the complexity of the underlying disease factors and the limitations in available management options. This article presents a practical framework for clinical evaluation and treatment. Germane to discussion are emerging concepts in refractory chronic rhinosinusitis that will likely have important implications in the near future.

### Choosing the right patient for biologic therapy in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis: endotypes, patient characteristics, and defining failures of standard therapy [^390e8d93]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

There are many phenotypes of chronic sinusitis and clinical variables that differ between patients. The ability to accurately diagnose, predict prognosis, and select the appropriate treatment depends on the understanding of disease endotypes. Chronic sinusitis is in the early stages of disease endotyping. The ability to identify endotypes is at the forefront of clinical research. Endotyping of chronic sinusitis uses clinical information, radiographic studies, and pathophysiologic data. Understanding of the full spectrum of chronic sinusitis is in its infancy. A personalized approach to treatment will consider standard medical therapies, sinus surgeries, and targeted use of biologic agents.

### Current controversies: sinus disease and the lower airways [^ba8b7de3]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

This review explores the literature dealing with the relation between the upper and lower airways, including the possible link between chronic sinus disease and asthma, and between chronic sinus disease and cough. Imaging studies, microbiology, epidemiology, animal studies, and effects of treatment are discussed. Available studies do not prove that upper airway disease directly causes lower airway pathology. Allergic rhinitis causing nasal blockage needs treatment, as does symptomatic sinus disease. Where there is concurrent disease of the upper and lower airways, both conditions need to be treated adequately. Further research is required to establish the relation between upper and lower airways, and animal models may help to unravel the mechanisms and impact of treatment. Randomized, blinded, controlled trials are needed in both children and adults to assess therapies of chronic sinusitis and the response of asthma.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^15221a10]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this specialty-specific clinical practice guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities and provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. The target audience includes otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons who manage adults with chronic rhinosinusitis, including candidacy and performance of endoscopic sinus surgery.

Methods

This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements (KASs), application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline group represented otolaryngologists, rhinologists, advanced practice nursing and physician assistants, and consumers who represented participating national professional organizations.

Action Statements

The Guideline Development Group made strong recommendations for the following KASs: Before considering surgery, the surgeon should verify an existing diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis to ensure established diagnostic criteria (signs and symptoms) from clinical practice guidelines are met, and the surgeon should assess candidacy for sinus surgery based on symptoms, disease characteristics, quality of life, and prior medical or surgical therapy (KASs 1A and 1B). The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination (KAS 3). The Guideline Development Group made recommendations for the following KASs: The surgeon should not endorse or require a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy (eg, antibiotics, steroids, antihistamines) as a prerequisite to sinus surgery for an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis (KAS 2). The surgeon should identify patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that would benefit most from surgery and are least likely to benefit from continued medical therapy alone, such as those with chronic rhinosinusitis subtypes that include, but are not limited to, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, polyps with bony erosion, eosinophilic mucin, or fungal balls (KAS 4). The surgeon or their designee should counsel patients before sinus surgery to establish realistic expectations, including the potential for chronicity or relapse, and the likelihood of long-term medical management, taking into account their chronic rhinosinusitis subtype (KAS 5). The surgeon should offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery (eg, which specific sinuses to operate on) solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11). There were no recommendations that were considered options from the Guideline Development Group.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^1bffc83c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS OF GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION

Table I provides a synopsis of recommendations regarding systemic oral antibiotics from several recently published guidelines: the International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR) 2021, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020, the Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Guideline (CSACSO) from 2020, the Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Adult Sinusitis (CPGAS) from 2015, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) update from 2014. Oral and topical corticosteroids are often recommended in combination with antibiotics.

Whereas earlier guidelines usually included antibiotics as a recommended treatment of CRS, more recent guidelines suggest antibiotics be regarded as an optional treatment for CRS, in association with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, saline rinses and surgery.(,–) Whereas in 2007, long term macrolide therapy received a class A recommendation from the EPOS for the treatment of CRSsNP, 307 after subsequent publications by Wallwork et al. and Videler et al. the EPOS recommendation was downgraded from A to C (not including exacerbations) in 2012. The EPOS 2020 steering group made recommendations using the GRADE system, and their overall recommendation was "uncertain" due to the relatively low quality of the available evidence. EPOS 2020 called for studies with larger population sizes, and placebo-controlled randomized trials of long-term macrolides are currently underway.

ICAR 2021 recommended against non-macrolide antibiotics for CRSwNP, except in acute exacerbations. Macrolides were considered as an option for treatment of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP, but the optimal drug, dosage and treatment duration were not defined due to the limited published data.

The Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP patients with neutrophilic inflammatory patterns and low IgE levels, but no antibiotics for CRSwNP patients. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy post-surgery was discussed to improve the subjective and objective symptom scores, reduce polyp size and delay polyp recurrence. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy was recommended for corticosteroid-resistant CRSwNP patients, neutrophil-dominant nasal polyps, persistent edema of nasal mucosa, and purulent nasal discharge.

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^ab3ebe00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^8c98907a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^be389891]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses that occurs in 1% to 5% of the U.S.

Population

It may significantly decrease quality of life. Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined by the presence of at least two out of four cardinal symptoms (i.e., facial pain/pressure, hyposmia/anosmia, nasal drainage, and nasal obstruction) for at least 12 consecutive weeks, in addition to objective evidence. Objective evidence of chronic rhinosinusitis may be obtained on physical examination (anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy) or radiography, preferably from sinus computed tomography. Treatment is directed at enhancing mucociliary clearance, improving sinus drainage/outflow, eradicating local infection and inflammation, and improving access for topical medications. First-line treatment is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid sprays. There may be a role for antibiotics in patients with evidence of an active, superimposed acute sinus infection. If medical management fails, endoscopic sinus surgery may be effective. Patients not responding to first-line medical therapy should be referred to an otolaryngologist, and selected patients with a history suggestive of other comorbidities (e.g., vasculitides, granulomatous diseases, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency) may also benefit from referral to an allergist or pulmonologist.

### Biologics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^ea0a100f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This living systematic review is one of several Cochrane Reviews evaluating the medical management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common. It is characterised by inflammation of the nasal and sinus linings, nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. It occurs with or without nasal polyps. 'Biologics' are medicinal products produced by a biological process. Monoclonal antibodies are one type, already evaluated in related inflammatory conditions (e.g. asthma and atopic dermatitis).

Objectives

To assess the effects of biologics for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL (2019, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 September 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least three months follow-up comparing biologics (currently, monoclonal antibodies) against placebo/no treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease severity and serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary outcomes were avoidance of surgery, extent of disease (measured by endoscopic or computerised tomography (CT) score), generic HRQL and adverse events (nasopharyngitis, including sore throat). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs. Of 986 adult participants, 984 had severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; 43% to 100% of participants also had asthma. Three biologics, with different targets, were evaluated: dupilumab, mepolizumab and omalizumab. All the studies were sponsored or supported by industry. Anti-IL-4Rα mAb (dupilumab) versusplacebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids) Three studies (784 participants) evaluated dupilumab. Disease-specific HRQL was measured with the SNOT-22 (score 0 to 110; minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 8.9 points). At 24 weeks, the SNOT-22 score was 19.61 points lower (better) in participants receiving dupilumab (mean difference (MD) -19.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) -22.54 to -16.69; 3 studies; 784 participants; high certainty). Symptom severity measured on a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) was 3.00 lower in those receiving dupilumab (95% CI -3.47 to -2.53; 3 studies; 784 participants; moderate certainty). The risk of serious adverse events may be lower in the dupilumab group (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75; 3 studies; 782 participants; low certainty). The number of participants requiring nasal polyp surgery (actual or planned) during the treatment period is probably lower in those receiving dupilumab (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.52; 2 studies; 725 participants; moderate certainty). Change in the extent of disease using the Lund Mackay computerised tomography (CT) score (0 to 24, higher = worse) was -7.00 (95% CI -9.61 to -4.39; 3 studies; 784 participants; high certainty), a large effect favouring the dupilumab group. The EQ-5D visual analogue scale (0 to 100, higher = better; MCID 8 points) was used to measure change in generic quality of life. The mean difference favouring dupilumab was 8.59 (95% CI 5.31 to 11.86; 2 studies; 706 participants; moderate certainty). There may be little or no difference in the risk of nasopharyngitis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.25; 3 studies; 783 participants; low certainty). Anti-IL-5 mAb (mepolizumab) versusplacebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids) Two studies (137 participants) evaluated mepolizumab. Disease-specific HRQL measured with the SNOT-22 at 25 weeks was 13.26 points lower (better) in participants receiving mepolizumab (95% CI -22.08 to -4.44; 1 study; 105 participants; low certainty; MCID 8.9). It is very uncertain whether there is a difference in s ymptom severity: on a 0- to 10-point VAS symptom severity was -2.03 lower in those receiving mepolizumab (95% CI -3.65 to -0.41; 1 study; 72 participants; very low certainty). It is very uncertain if there is difference in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.46; 2 studies; 135 participants, very low certainty). It is very uncertain whether or not the overall risk that patients still need surgery at trial end is lower in the mepolizumab group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 participants; very low certainty). It is very uncertain whether mepolizumab reduces the extent of disease as measured by endoscopic nasal polyps score (scale range 0 to 8). The mean difference was 1.23 points lower in the mepolizumab group (MD -1.23, 95% -1.79 to -0.68; 2 studies; 137 participants; very low certainty). The difference in generic quality of life (EQ-5D) was 5.68 (95% CI -1.18 to 12.54; 1 study; 105 participants; low certainty), favouring the mepolizumab group. This difference is smaller than the MCID of 8 points. There may be little or no difference in the risk of nasopharyngitis (RR 0.73, 95% 0.36 to 1.47; 2 studies; 135 participants; low certainty). Anti-IgE mAb (omalizumab) versus placebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids) Three very small studies (65 participants) evaluated omalizumab. We are very uncertain about the effect of omalizumab on disease-specific HRQL, severe adverse events, extent of disease (CT scan scores), generic HRQL and adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

In adults with severe chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps, using regular topical nasal steroids, dupilumab improves disease-specific HRQL compared to placebo, and reduces the extent of the disease as measured on a CT scan. It probably also improves symptoms and generic HRQL and there is no evidence of an increased risk of serious adverse events. It may reduce the need for further surgery. There may be little or no difference in the risk of nasopharyngitis. In similar patients, mepolizumab may improve both disease-specific and generic HRQL. It is uncertain whether it reduces the need for surgery or improves nasal polyp scores. There may be little or no difference in the risk of nasopharyngitis. It is uncertain if there is a difference in symptom severity and the risk of serious adverse events. We are uncertain about the effects of omalizumab.

### Diagnosis and first-line treatment of chronic sinusitis… [^5f2c88b3]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Chronic sinusitis is a commonly diagnosed disease of the nose and sinuses, and is a distinct disease entity from acute sinusitis. Unlike acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis it not primarily an infectious condition, but rather a chronic inflammatory process. Clinical practice guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery outline diagnostic and treatment recommendations, but above all else, emphasize the need for accurate diagnosis. 1 Treatment for chronic sinusitis involves saline irrigation, nasal steroid spray, or both. 1, 2 Surgery is reserved for patients with severe or refractory disease. Although this and other CPGs for chronic sinusitis recommend long-term use of nasal steroid spray, 3, 4 few studies have examined the uptake of this recommendation. Bergmark RW, Pynnonen M.

### Yardstick for the medical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^a73e686c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses defined by classic symptoms, imaging findings, or endoscopic findings. There are a growing number of emerging pharmacologic therapies being evaluated to treat patients with CRS, some of which have gained indication status in the United States. There have not been updated treatment guidelines published in the United States however since 2014. This document is meant to serve as an updated expert consensus document for the pharmacologic management of patients with CRS. We review available data focusing on prospective clinical trials on oral and intranasal corticosteroids, nasal irrigation, biologics, antibiotics, and allergy immunotherapy for CRS both with and without nasal polyposis, including specific therapies for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease-associated CRS and allergic fungal CRS. There are multiple options to treat CRS, and clinicians should be knowledgeable on the efficacy and risks of these available therapies. Allergists-immunologists now have various therapies available to treat patients with CRS.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps — key action statement and management: The clinician should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS. Recommendation based on observational studies with preponderance of benefit over harm, and policy level: Recommendation. The exact prevalence of nasal polyps in rhinosinusitis is unknown, but about 4% of patients with CRS have concurrent polyps. Smaller nasal polyps in the middle meatus or in the posterior nasal cavity, however, may only be detected by nasal endoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the sinuses is often useful in evaluating CRS with nasal polyps, especially for unilateral polyps, concern for polyps extending outside of the nasal cavity, or other atypical presentations. For unilateral processes, tissue biopsy and imaging are often required to differentiate unilateral polyps from other pathologies; scraping of nasal polyps is not recommended. Topical nasal steroid sprays are indicated for long-term treatment of nasal polyps in the setting of CRS. If no response is seen within 3 months, a short course of oral corticosteroids can be considered. Off-label topical corticosteroids in the nasal cavity such as budesonide, may also be beneficial.

### Surgical management of rhinosinusitis for the allergist-immunologist [^379029c6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation of the sinus, with or without nasal passage inflammation, occurring for more than 12 weeks at a time. CRS has historically been classified in 2 categories: CRS without nasal polyps or CRS with nasal polyps (25%-30% of cases). The mainstay of treatment for CRS with or without nasal polyps is medical management, and options may include a combination of saline irrigation, nasal steroids, allergy medications, antibiotics, oral steroids, and treatment with targeted monoclonal antibodies. Unfortunately, up to 60% of patents report symptoms refractory to maximal medical therapy. As such, a combined approach of surgery and medical therapy may be offered. Endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS is approached in a stepwise fashion, ranging from the simplest technique, such as polyp removal, to more expanded approaches that open the paranasal sinuses and allow gravity-dependent drainage. This review article provides a review and in-depth explanation of various surgical approaches for CRS, including the indications, techniques, and respective outcomes for each one.

### Functional endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^e04df8c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinosinusitis is a well-recognised clinical syndrome affecting patients of all ages and gender. FESS has now become a well-established strategy, comprising several techniques, for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to medical treatment.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of functional endoscopic sinus surgery as a treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2006) and EMBASE (1974 to January 2006) were searched. Reference lists were handsearched and experts in the field contacted to identify further studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were any of the following criteria singly or in combination: patients with chronic rhinosinusitis diagnosed by a health professional; patients with sinusitis symptoms for more than 12 weeks; endoscopic evidence of sinusitis or radiological evidence of sinusitis. Exclusion criteria were immune suppression; cystic fibrosis; Wegener's disease; previous sinus surgery or sinonasal malignancy.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies meeting the inclusion criteria underwent validity assessment and the data were extracted independently by the two authors. Comparisons were:FESS versus medical treatmentFESS versus conventional sinus surgeryFESS + medical treatment versus medical treatmentFESS + medical treatment versus conventional sinus surgery + medical treatment

Main Results

The three included studies were randomised controlled trials. The evidence available does not demonstrate that FESS, as practiced in the included trials, is superior to medical treatment with or without sinus irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. A middle meatal antrostomy fashioned by FESS was also not shown to be superior to an inferior meatal antrostomy formed by traditional sinus surgery techniques, although the small sample size in the study does not exclude a type II error. In one study there was a relapse rate of 2.4% in the FESS and sinus irrigation group compared to 5.6% in the sinus irrigation only group. The relapse rates were not mentioned in the other studies. There were no major complications such as orbital injury or cerebrospinal fluid leak reported in any of the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

FESS as currently practiced is a safe surgical procedure. The limited evidence available suggests that FESS as practiced in the included trials does not confer additional benefit to that obtained by medical treatment (± sinus irrigation) in chronic rhinosinusitis. More randomised controlled trials comparing FESS with medical and other treatments, with long-term follow up, are required.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^efe0c84a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Guideline scope and purpose — adult endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis — state that the clinical practice guideline focuses on the surgical management of CRS for adults and addresses primary surgery and adjuvant therapies in detail with discussion of revision surgery when related to specific topics. The target audience is otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons managing adults (18 years of age or older) with CRS who are potential candidates for ESS in office-based, ambulatory-based, or hospital-based settings. The guideline does not apply to primary diagnoses of acute rhinosinusitis, recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, rhinosinusitis complicated by intracranial or orbital spread, acute invasive fungal sinusitis, or odontogenic sinusitis; it is not designed to provide directives for patients with genetic disorders or comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia, or for those with lesions such as inverting papilloma or sinonasal malignancy. It is not intended for pediatric patients (< 18 years of age), and it also does not focus on balloon dilation of the sinuses.

### Advances in chronic rhinosinusitis in 2020 and 2021 [^13e2ec99]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Major progress has been achieved in the understanding and clinical practice of chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal polyps. These advances resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology, the distribution into subgroups, and consequently in a better management perspective using classical approaches and biologics. Pathomechanisms, endotypes and biomarkers, and finally innovative therapeutic approaches are themes especially for the more severe forms of chronic rhinosinusitis, those with uncontrolled severe nasal polyps. Biologicals against key type 2 cytokines are gaining ground in the long-term treatment approaches of often recurrent nasal polyps, and should be integrated in care pathways making use of classical and innovative treatment pathways. These areas of interest show a fast development and will profoundly change our disease management within a decade.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^d8072ea1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Action statement 13a — chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe biologics (including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies such as dupilumab, mepolizumab, or omalizumab) for the treatment of adults with CRS without polyps. Recommendation (against therapy) is based on lack of randomized controlled trials in this population with a preponderance of benefit over harm for not treating. Quality improvement opportunity: Avoid biologic use in patients with CRS without polyps for whom benefits would be uncertain as this patients population was not evaluated in the published randomized trials to date. Aggregate Evidence Quality: A, with exclusion of patients without polyps from clinical trials; Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate; Benefit-Harm Assessment: Preponderance of Benefit; Policy level: Recommendation. Intentional Vagueness is specified: the word "routinely" is included to avoid a legal standard; Exceptions are a distinct indication for biologics other than CRS; Role Of Patient Preferences: Limited role in shared decision making. Supporting text specifies the evidence base: In the 10 studies on biologics in CRS synthesized in a 2021 Cochrane Review, 1260 of 1262 patients (99.8%) had polyps, and all were using topical nasal steroids for their CRS symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^cb504dc4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Other considerations in CRS — comorbid disease states and surgical timing are outlined as follows: CRS can exacerbate other disease states and could be an impetus to recommend earlier surgical treatment if medical therapy is insufficient or takes too long. Patients with either chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) can have asthma aggravated by poorly controlled CRS, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a subtype of CRSwNP strongly linked to respiratory illness. In rare cases, CRS patients with immunodeficiencies or other immune dysfunction can develop life-threatening infections related to their sinus disease that may be best treated with expedited surgical care. Knowledge of CRS inflammation patterns and biomarkers and newer treatments, such as biological therapy, are evolving, and clinicians will continue to balance medical and surgical therapy in overall care plans.

### Management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis during the COVID-19 pandemic-an EAACI position paper [^86372033]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic rhinosinusitis is regarded as a chronic airway disease. According to WHO recommendations, it may be a risk factor for COVID-19 patients. In most CRSwNP cases, the inflammatory changes affecting the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes are type-2 (T2) inflammation endotypes.

Methods

The current knowledge on COVID-19 and on treatment options for CRS was analyzed by a literature search in Medline, Pubmed, international guidelines, the Cochrane Library and the Internet.

Results

Based on international literature, on current recommendations by WHO and other international organizations as well as on previous experience, a panel of experts from EAACI and ARIA provided recommendations for the treatment of CRS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusion

Intranasal corticosteroids remain the standard treatment for CRS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surgical treatments should be reduced to a minimum and surgery preserved for patients with local complications and for those with no other treatment options. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Treatment with biologics can be continued with careful monitoring in noninfected patients and should be temporarily interrupted during the course of the COVID-19 infection.

### Surgical versus medical interventions for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^4270983f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal polyps cause nasal obstruction, discharge and reduction in or loss of sense of smell, but their aetiology is unknown. The management of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, aimed at improving these symptoms, includes both surgical and medical treatments, but there is no universally accepted management protocol.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of endonasal/endoscopic surgery versus medical treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 February 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of any surgical intervention (e.g. polypectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery) versus any medical treatment (e.g. intranasal and/or systemic steroids), including placebo, in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the selective (incomplete) outcome reporting by the studies.

Main Results

Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. No studies were at low risk of bias. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy versus systemic steroids (two studies, n = 87); (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (one study, n = 35). All participants also received topical steroids but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics. In that study, the medical treatment arm had higher doses than the surgical arm. In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest. Although there were important differences in the types of treatments and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar.

Primary Outcomes

symptom scores and quality of life scores There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) failed to find a difference in generic health-related quality of life scores. The quality of this evidence is low or very low. Endoscopic scores and other secondary outcomes Two studies reported endoscopic scores. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a large, significant effect size in the surgical group, with a mean difference (MD) in score of -1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to -1.22, n = 95) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no polyposis, 3 = severe polyposis). In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups (MD 2.3%, 95% CI -17.4% to 12.8%, n = 34). None of the included studies reported recurrence rates. No differences were found for any objective measurements or olfactory tests in those studies in which they were measured. Complications Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but rates of up to 21% for medical treatment and 14.3% for surgical treatment are described. Epistaxis was the most commonly reported complication with both medical and surgical treatments, with severe complications reported rarely.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence relating to the effectiveness of different types of surgery versus medical treatment for adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is of very low quality. The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. The one positive finding from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. As the overall evidence is of very low quality (serious methodological limitations, reporting bias, indirectness and imprecision) and insufficient to draw firm conclusions, further research to investigate this problem, which has significant implications for quality of life and healthcare service usage, is justified.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^f26b67e3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Key action statements for adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — Offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11).

### Management of sinusitis in the cystic fibrosis patient [^1ea69fe7]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is present in up to 100% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF-associated CRS is particularly recalcitrant, and sinus disease can have important implications in the health of the lower airways and overall quality of life in these patients. Both medical and surgical management play important roles in treating CF-associated CRS, but guidelines are lacking. This review summarizes the current literature on both medical and surgical management of this disease to provide an up-to-date analysis and recommendations on the treatment of CF-associated CRS.

### Endoscopic sinus surgery for the treatment of chronic sinusitis in geriatric patients [^f1a72dd6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Although endoscopic sinus surgery is a well-documented procedure for the treatment of chronic sinusitis in children and adults, no study has been conducted to specifically investigate its application in a geriatric population. We undertook to fill this void by analyzing the records of 1,112 patients who had undergone endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis in our department between April 1988 and March 1998. We categorized these patients by age. There were 171 patients (15.4%) in the geriatric group (age: ≥ 65 yr), 837 patients (75.3%) in the adult group (age: 17 to 64), and 104 patients (9.4%) in the pediatric group (age: ≤ 16 yr). We found that the geriatric group experienced a disproportionately larger share of operative complications, but most of them were minor. Outcomes were similar in all three groups. We conclude that endoscopic sinus surgery is a safe and effective treatment for older patients with chronic sinusitis.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis in children [^3e6af2c1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects nearly 37 million people in the United States each year and accounts for approximately $6 billion in direct and indirect health care costs. Despite its prevalence and significant impact, little is known about its exact cause and pathophysiology, and significant controversy remains regarding appropriate treatment options. Basic science research, however, has shown recent promise toward improving understanding of the innate and environmental factors underlying the pathophysiology of CRS. The hope is that this will also lead to advances in treatment for children adversely affected by this common yet complicated disease.

### The role of biologics in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^bcf56848]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a symptomatic chronic inflammatory syndrome of the nose and paranasal sinuses that affects 6% to 12% of patients in the Western world. - Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) accounts for approximately 20% of all CRS in the United States. It is associated with increased morbidity and an annual health care cost burden of US$5.7 billion. - An estimated 85% of patients with CRSwNP exhibit type 2 (T2) cytokine profiles with increased local eosinophils and total IgE. - As such, the advent of biologics, which target and reduce T2 inflammation, are novel treatment options for patients with recalcitrant CRSwNP. The role of biologics in the treatment paradigm requires thoughtful consideration of multiple factors, including disease severity, risk of polyp recurrence with medical or surgical treatment, patient preferences and goals, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

This article defines chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and shares contemporary principles for its diagnosis and management, focusing on practical considerations for rhinoplasty surgeons. Nasal obstruction, the most common symptom of CRS, is frequently the chief complaint of patients seeking functional rhinoplasty surgery. Because correcting sites of anatomic obstruction to nasal airflow alone is unlikely to adequately treat CRS, rhinoplasty surgeons must have a firm understanding of the origin, diagnosis, and management of this disease process. With no single cause identified, CRS is likely an umbrella diagnosis or syndrome encompassing numerous causative factors, with the common end point of chronic sinonasal inflammation.

### Medical management strategies in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^df1303c7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, historically, has been considered to be caused by upper airway anatomical abnormalities. However, today that concept has changed, for it is now recognized as an inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Acute rhinosinusitis is usually caused by a viral infection, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder with increased expression of type 1, 2, or 17 cytokines in the nasal and sinus mucosa, similar to that which occurs in asthma. Exacerbations are caused by aeroallergens in the allergic individual and irritants, pollutants, and viral/bacterial infections in all subjects. It may be categorized by phenotypes, examples of which include chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps. Defined endotypes are based on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Knowledge of chronic rhinosinusitis endotypes will optimize management by employing targeted medical therapies. Understanding that rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease has led to the identification of a variety of different predisposing conditions, new medical treatment options, and the concept that rhinosinusitis is primarily a medical problem.

### Biologics for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [^90259ed2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

With the increasing recognition of the role of type 2 immune responses in chronic rhinosinusitis, its severity, recurrence, and comorbidities, several biologics targeting IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as IgE have been administered in small proof-of-concept studies. Recently, the first phase 3 trials have been reported with dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, demonstrating a significant and clinically relevant reduction of the disease burden from polyp size and sinus involvement to symptoms and smell; these changes consecutively led to an important increase in quality of life. Finally, the biologic versus placebo treatment reduced the need for systemic glucocorticosteroids and sinus surgery significantly and clinically meaningfully. Dupilumab today is registered for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in Europe and the United States. Within a year, 2 further phase 3 trials with omalizumab and mepolizumab will be reported. With this development, without any doubt, a new era for the treatment of severe uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has begun. Questions on the indication of the biologics, the selection of patients, and finally criteria for monitoring the efficacy in individual patients need to be urgently answered, and care pathways need to be established integrating the current standard of care including surgery.

### Diverse endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis and clinical implications [^6bc73cb5]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by inflammation in the nasal and sinus mucosa. The CRS phenotypes, based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps, are known as CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). However, this classification has limitations in fully capturing the mechanisms and clinical manifestations of CRS. To address the heterogeneity of CRS, there has been a growing focus on classifying the condition into distinct endotypes. Endotype classification involves grouping patients based on specific molecular, immunological, and clinical characteristics, allowing for more personalized and targeted treatment approaches. This review delves into the current state of endotype classifications for CRS. It explores the role of geographic factors, microbiome, and subphenotype in shaping different endotypes. Additionally, the review examines how various clinical features are associated with specific endotypes, providing valuable insights into tailoring treatment options for better outcomes and transitions between different endotypes. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on the intricate realm of CRS endotype classifications. By unraveling the molecular and clinical intricacies, this review lays the foundation for more precise, effective, and individualized treatment strategies in the management of CRS.

### EUFOREA / EPOS2020 statement on the clinical considerations for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps care [^d35034b6]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) treatment algorithm for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), patients suffering from severe uncontrolled CRSwNP are recommended to receive oral corticosteroids, (revision) sinus surgery, systemic biologicals and/or aspirin treatment after desensitization (ATAD). Given the major differences in indications, outcomes, practical considerations, risks and costs of these key pillars of treatment, there is a growing need to define criteria for each treatment option and list the clinically relevant and major considerations for them. This EUFOREA document therefore provides an expert panel overview of the expected outcomes, specific considerations and (contra)indications of the five major treatment arms of severe uncontrolled CRSwNP: oral corticosteroids, primary and revision sinus surgery, biological treatment and ATAD. This overview of treatment considerations is needed to allow physicians and patients to consider the different options in the context of providing optimal and personalized care for severe uncontrolled CRSwNP. In conclusion, the five major treatment options for severe uncontrolled CRSwNP have intrinsic advantages, specific indications and considerations that are of importance to the patient, the physician and the society. This EUFOREA statement supports the unmet need to define criteria for the indication of every treatment pillar of CRSwNP.

### Consultation for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma: clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and treatment options [^2d0e1fd5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa, affects over 12% of the US population, and costs over $20 billion annually. CRS can be divided into 2 major phenotypes based on whether nasal polyps are present (chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]) or absent (chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps). This grand rounds review will discuss the clinical approach to patients with CRSwNP, including typical presentations, workup, and currently available treatment options. Tools that physicians can use to assess subjective sinonasal symptoms, as well as objective measures of disease, will be reviewed. Additional focus will be on recognizing clinical comorbidities commonly associated with CRSwNP, including asthma, bronchiectasis, allergic rhinitis, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease. Clinical outcomes can be improved by providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating (and managing) patients with CRSwNP.

### Treatment of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis in the United States, 1999–2002… [^891ba9c7]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The most frequently recommended medications for treatment of both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis are antibiotic agents, followed by antihistamines; nasal decongestants; corticosteroids; and antitussive, expectorant, and mucolytic agents, respectively. In addition, corticosteroids are used for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. The effects of antibiotic therapy on chronic rhinosinusitis are questionable, but if an acute infection occurs in the inflamed nasal or sinus cavities, use of a short-term regimen can provide relief. 4 Decongestants are often used in treatment plans to increase sinus drainage and ventilation and to thin mucosa and mucous secretions, and result in decreasing mucous stasis.
13. Penicillins, mainly amoxicillin and amoxicillin–clavulanate potassium, were the most commonly used medication class for both chronic and acute rhinosinusitis. A penicillin drug was mentioned in 30. 35% of all visits with a primary diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis and in
27.

18% visits with a primary diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis. This is intuitive, inasmuch as recent studies have shown penicillins to be highly effective against the bacteria in nasal and sinus areas. Amoxicillin–clavulanate potassium has a 95% clinical response rate in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis.
15. One focused on symptomatic improvement only, while a more recent study coupled symptomatic and radiographic changes due to medical treatment. In the earlier study, McNally et al18 showed that treatment with antibiotics, decongestants, and intranasal steroids can decrease symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. In that study, however, patients were not followed up for occurrence of relapse.

16 In a 2002 retrospective study, chronic rhinosinusitis was treated with an antibiotic, oral prednisone for 10 days, intranasal steroids, and nasal irrigation with saline solution. 19 Statistically significant improvement in both symptoms and findings at computed tomography from baseline to the end of the study were demonstrated. 19 However, neither of these studies included a concurrent control group.

### Corticosteroid treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis: the possibilities and the limits [^fc01862f]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, including nasal polyps, is an inflammatory disease of the nose and sinuses. The medical treatment, mainly topical intranasal and oral corticosteroids, constitutes its first line of therapy. Long-term treatment with corticosteroid nasal spray reduces inflammation and nasal polyp size, and improves nasal symptoms such as nasal blockage, rhinorrea, and the loss of smell. Corticosteroid intranasal drops may be used when intranasal spray fails to demonstrate efficacy. Short courses of oral steroids are recommended in severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or when a rapid symptomatic improvement is needed. Endoscopic sinus surgery is only recommended when the medical treatment fails. Intranasal corticosteroids should be continued postoperatively. When using intranasal corticosteroids, care should be taken in selected populations such as children, pregnant women, and elderly patients; especially in those patients with comorbid conditions such as asthma, in which the overall steroid intake can be high due to the administration of both intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids.

### Topical steroid for chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps [^479346ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroid is used as part of a comprehensive medical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to show a clear overall benefit. Trials studying the efficacy of topical corticosteroid use various delivery methods in patients who have or have not had sinus surgery, which directly impacts on topical delivery and distribution.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical steroid in patients with CRS without nasal polyps and perform a meta-analysis of symptom improvement data, including subgroup analysis by sinus surgery status and topical delivery methods.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 9 July 2010.

Selection Criteria

All randomised trials in which a topically administered corticosteroid was compared with either a placebo, no treatment or alternative topically administered corticosteroid for the treatment of CRS without polyps in patients of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors reviewed the search results and selected trials meeting the eligibility criteria, obtaining full texts and contacting authors where necessary. We documented our justification for the exclusion of studies. Two authors extracted data using a pre-determined standardised data form.

Main Results

Ten studies (590 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The trials were of low (six trials) and medium (four trials) risk of bias. The primary outcome was sino-nasal symptoms. When compared to placebo, topical steroid improved symptom scores (standardised mean difference -0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.13, P = 0.002; five trials, n = 286) and had a greater proportion of responders (risk ratio 1.69; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.37, P = 0.002; four trials, n = 263). With a limited number of studies, the subgroup analyses of patients who had received sinus surgery versus those who had not was not significant (P = 0.35). Subgroup analyses by topical delivery method revealed more benefit when steroid was administered directly to the sinuses than with simple nasal delivery (P = 0.04). There were no differences between groups for quality of life and adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for CRS without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. It may be included in a comprehensive treatment of CRS without polyps. Direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. Further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.

### Short-course oral steroids alone for chronic rhinosinusitis [^209a0047]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of a suite of six Cochrane reviews looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common condition involving inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. It is characterised by nasal blockage and nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Oral corticosteroids are used to control the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids compared with placebo/no intervention or other pharmacological interventions (intranasal corticosteroids, antibiotics, antifungals) for chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a short course (up to 21 days) of oral corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment or compared with other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the adverse event of mood or behavioural disturbances. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and osteoporosis. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs (474 randomised participants), which compared oral corticosteroids with placebo or no intervention. All trials only recruited adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. All trials reported outcomes at two to three weeks, at the end of the short-course oral steroid treatment period. Three trials additionally reported outcomes at three to six months. Two of these studies prescribed intranasal steroids to patients in both arms of the trial at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. Oral steroids versus placebo or no intervention Disease-specific health-related quality of life was reported by one study. This study reported improved quality of life after treatment (two to three weeks) in the group receiving oral steroids compared with the group who received placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.92 to -0.56, 40 participants, modified RSOM-31), which corresponds to a large effect size. We assessed the evidence to be low quality (we are uncertain about the effect estimate; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect). Disease severity as measured by patient-reported symptom scores was reported by two studies, which allowed the four key symptoms used to define chronic rhinosinusitis (nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure, hyposmia) to be combined into one score. The results at the end of treatment (two to three weeks) showed an improvement in patients receiving oral steroids compared to placebo, both when presented as a mean final value (SMD -2.84, 95% CI -4.09 to -1.59, 22 participants) and as a change from baseline (SMD -2.28, 95% CI -2.76 to -1.80, 114 participants). These correspond to large effect sizes but we assessed the evidence to be low quality. One study (114 participants) followed patients for 10 weeks after the two-week treatment period. All patients in both arms received intranasal steroids at the end of the oral steroid treatment period. The results showed that the initial results after treatment were not sustained (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.15, 114 participants, percentage improvement from baseline). This corresponds to a small effect size and we assessed the evidence to be low quality. There was an increase in adverse events in people receiving orals steroids compared with placebo for gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.78; 187 participants; three studies) and insomnia (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.10 to 11.95; 187 participants; three studies). There was no significant impact of oral steroids on mood disturbances at the dosage used in the included study (risk ratio (RR) 2.50, 95% CI 0.55 to 11.41; 40 participants; one study). We assessed the evidence to be low quality due to the lack of definitions of the adverse events and the small number of events or sample size, or both). Other comparisons No studies that compared short-course oral steroids with other treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

At the end of the treatment course (two to three weeks) there is an improvement in health-related quality of life and symptom severity in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps taking oral corticosteroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The quality of the evidence supporting this finding is low. At three to six months after the end of the oral steroid treatment period, there is little or no improvement in health-related quality of life or symptom severity for patients taking an initial course of oral steroids compared with placebo or no treatment. The data on the adverse effects associated with short courses of oral corticosteroids indicate that there may be an increase in insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances but it is not clear whether there is an increase in mood disturbances. All of the adverse events results are based on low quality evidence. More research in this area, particularly research evaluating patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required. There is no evidence for oral steroids compared with other treatments.

Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults — begin with "Adult patient with suspected CRS", then "Verify that signs/symptoms meet CPG diagnostic criteria", "Assess candidacy for ESS", "Assess additional disease characteristics of CRS", and "Assign appropriate individualized medical therapy". For infection assessment, ask "Does patient have evidence of purulence?"; if yes, "May prescribe antibiotics", and if no, "Do not prescribe antibiotics". Education and imaging planning include "Educate patient about realistic long-term expectations", determine "Has patient had a recent adequate sinus CT scan?" — if yes, "Avoid arbitrary guidelines for mucosal thickening", and provide "Educate patient about postoperative care expectations". Surgical approach should "Tailor extent of surgery to patient's disease, not solely mucosal thickening measurements", and disease-directed steps use "Does the patient have polyps, fungus, osteitis, erosion?" — if yes, "Perform wide exposure ± tissue removal", and if no, "Perform surgery as required of disease state". Postoperative evaluation states "Assess outcomes at 3–12 months postop", followed by "Continue follow up and care as needed".

### Rhinitis and sinusitis [^41b20d87]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Rhinitis and sinusitis are among the most common medical conditions and are frequently associated. In Western societies an estimated 10% to 25% of the population have allergic rhinitis, with 30 to 60 million persons being affected annually in the United States. It is estimated that sinusitis affects 31 million patients annually in the United States. Both rhinitis and sinusitis can significantly decrease quality of life, aggravate comorbid conditions, and require significant direct medical expenditures. Both conditions also create even greater indirect costs to society by causing lost work and school days and reduced workplace productivity and school learning. Management of allergic rhinitis involves avoidance, many pharmacologic options, and, in appropriately selected patients, allergen immunotherapy. Various types of nonallergic rhinitis are treated with avoidance measures and a more limited repertoire of medications. For purposes of this review, sinusitis and rhinosinusitis are synonymous terms. An acute upper respiratory illness of less than approximately 7 days' duration is most commonly caused by viral illness (viral rhinosinusitis), whereas acute bacterial sinusitis becomes more likely beyond 7 to 10 days. Although the mainstay of management of acute bacterial sinusitis is antibiotics, treatment of chronic sinusitis is less straightforward because only some chronic sinusitis cases have an infectious basis. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been subdivided into 3 types, namely CRS without nasal polyps, CRS with nasal polyps, and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Depending on the type of CRS present, a variety of medical and surgical approaches might be required.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^212e61d9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are supported as effective management, with systematic reviews in CRS with polyps showing improved outcomes in reducing symptoms with excellent safety and minimal adverse effects, while data are limited for CRS without polyps. There are no recommendations suggesting a superior topical corticosteroid or recommendations on INCS dosing; however, epistaxis was seen in higher doses of INCS. In patients post sinus surgery with moderate to severe disease not controlled with INCS, intranasal steroid irrigations using budesonide were beneficial in controlling symptoms, though lack of FDA approval and limited evidence are noted, and the GUG felt this approach was beneficial in select patients postendoscopic surgery. EDS fluticasone has also shown benefits in CRSsNP based on 2 RCTs. Adverse events of topical nasal steroids are generally minor, and long-term use has not been shown to impact systemic cortisol levels or increase ocular risks; the GUG felt that a specific treatment length cannot be stated and that decisions should be individualized to achieve symptom control with the lowest effective dose.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis [^02911e91]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses, with a prevalence of approximately 1% to 7%. It is defined by the presence of at least two cardinal symptoms (nasal blockage, obstruction, or congestion; anterior or posterior nasal drainage; facial pain or pressure; and hyposmia) for at least three consecutive months, with objective findings on imaging or nasal endoscopy. CRS can result in significant patient costs and lower quality of life due to severe fatigue, depression, and sometimes reduced cognitive function. The condition is categorized as primary or secondary and with or without nasal polyps. Treatment is directed at reducing symptoms, improving mucus clearance, reducing inflammation, enhancing ciliary function, and removing bacteria and biofilms from the nasal mucosa. First-line treatment comprises nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids. Acute exacerbation of CRS is common and is defined as a transient worsening of symptoms. The role of oral antibiotics and oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations is unclear. Optimal maintenance therapy can help alleviate exacerbations. Patients with refractory CRS that is not responsive to first-line treatment and patients with alarm symptoms should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation and consideration of surgical management. Identifying patients who have CRS with nasal polyps or comorbid conditions such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, or eosinophilic esophagitis is especially important to ensure they are referred to a specialist for consideration of biologic therapy.

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^2ded205b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, the appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management (including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function), and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia. An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. METHODS: This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3 rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of current data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgements, and related procedures. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, family medicine, allergy and immunology, advanced practice nursing, and a consumer advocate. DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR GUIDELINE: This clinical practice guideline is as an update, and replacement, for an earlier guideline published in 2015 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF). 1 An update was planned for 5 years after the initial publication date and was further necessitated by new primary studies and systematic reviews that might suggest a need for modifying clinically important recommendations. 2 Changes in content and methodology from the prior guideline include the following: New evidence from 14 guidelines, 194 systematic reviews, and 133 RCTs. Emphasis on patient education and counseling with new explanatory tables. Expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion. Enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review. New algorithm to clarify decision making, watchful waiting, action statement relationships. Extension of watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as an initial management strategy to all patients with uncomplicated acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) regardless of severity, not just patients with "mild" illness (prior guideline). Clarified the recommended timeline for the diagnosis, conservative management and antibiotic treatment of ABRS. Change in recommendation to first-line antibiotic therapy for ABRS amoxicillin, with or without clavulanate, from amoxicillin alone (prior guideline). Addition of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) as a chronic condition that modifies management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Three new key action statements on managing CRS that focus on the use of biologics (recommend against when patients do not have polyps and educate patients about them when they do) and a recommendation against the empiric use of antibiotics for CRS solely as a third-party requirement for surgery or imaging.

### Clinical implications of the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides on sinusitis [^ccc336a3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This article reviews the treatment of chronic sinusitis with macrolides. Chronic sinusitis is often the result of bacterial infections that lead to chronic inflammation with thickening of the sinus mucosa and hypersecretion of mucus. In addition to their anti-infective properties, some macrolides possess immunomodulatory effects. These macrolides have been used successfully to treat diffuse panbronchiolitis, a progressive inflammatory lung disease, and may be useful for treatment of asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. The clinical benefits of macrolides in patients with chronic sinusitis include decreased nasal secretions and postnasal drip, with improvement in nasal obstruction. In vivo and in vitro studies show that some macrolides affect neutrophil chemotaxis and infiltration, inflammatory cytokine production, mucus production, and the transportability of airway secretions. These findings indicate that macrolides are promising agents for treating chronic inflammation of the airways.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis: epidemiology and medical management [^d84a91d8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects 12.5% of the US population. On epidemiologic grounds, some association has been found between CRS prevalence and air pollution, active cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, perennial allergic rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux. The majority of pediatric and adult patients with CRS are immune competent. Data on genetic associations with CRS are still sparse. Current consensus definitions subclassify CRS into CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP), CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS). Evaluation and medical management of CRS has been the subject of several recent consensus reports. The highest level of evidence for treatment for CRSsNP exists for saline lavage, intranasal steroids, and long-term macrolide antibiotics. The highest level of evidence for treatment of CRSwNP exists for intranasal steroids, systemic glucocorticoids, and topical steroid irrigations. Aspirin desensitization is beneficial for patients with aspirin-intolerant CRSwNP. Sinus surgery followed by use of systemic steroids is recommended for AFRS. Other modalities of treatment, such as antibiotics for patients with purulent infection and antifungal drugs for patients with AFRS, are potentially useful despite a lack of evidence from controlled treatment trials. The various modalities of medical treatment are reviewed in the context of recent consensus documents and the author's personal experience.
