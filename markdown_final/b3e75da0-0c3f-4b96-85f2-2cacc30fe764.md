## Question

The patient performs heavy lifting daily in his job as a glasser and reports a popping sound on the inner side of his elbows.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a worker with medial elbow popping during heavy lifting and wants guidance on differential diagnosis, work-relatedness, diagnostics, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical localization and biomechanics driving a medial elbow popping phenomenon. Then, I should construct and prioritize the differential diagnosis consistent with repetitive forceful work. Next, I will evaluate the strength of occupational causation. After that, I will outline an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm, including when and how to image. Then, I will propose a staged management plan, including activity modification, pharmacologic and injection options, and surgical considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a coherent clinical impression and immediate actions that align with guidelines and prognosis data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and anatomic localization. Medial-sided elbow symptoms with an audible or palpable pop during forceful lifting suggest dynamic stress at the medial compartment, implicating the ulnar collateral ligament complex and the flexor-pronator mass, and may also reflect ulnar nerve subluxation or intra-articular mechanical pathology, especially under repetitive valgus loading typical of heavy manual work [^1151C1xU] [^115Pp1rg] [^111fWAmP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should build a prioritized differential and check each item against the presentation. Medial collateral ligament insufficiency or valgus instability remains high on the list given chronic microtrauma and popping with load, followed by medial epicondylitis from flexor-pronator tendinopathy, ulnar neuropathy at the cubital tunnel with possible snapping, and less commonly intra-articular loose body or osteochondral injury producing mechanical symptoms such as catching or popping, particularly if locking or ROM loss is reported [^1151C1xU] [^114aqhb6] [^117LGch2] [^111fWAmP].

> Wait, let me verify the occupational causation signal before attributing this entirely to work. There is consistent evidence that forceful manual work, repetitive elbow and wrist motion, and heavy load handling increase the risk of epicondylitis and related elbow disorders, with meta-odds ratios around 2 to 3 for combined wrist–elbow biomechanical exposure; heavy loads exceeding 20 kg, repetitive elbow flexion–extension beyond two hours per day, and forceful gripping are particularly relevant to a glass worker whose job requires lifting, gripping, and stabilization of panels [^112A4rwf] [^1141TfuD] [^113ynTRp] [^111j8tHm]. I should also consider that while attribution on a "balance of probabilities" is often discussed, systematic reviews note that doubling of risk can be hard to demonstrate consistently across tasks and diagnoses, so careful exposure documentation is essential to support work-relatedness [^114whzvB].

> I will now examine the bedside diagnostic approach, but first I should confirm which provocative tests map to medial versus lateral pathology. I initially thought of using Maudsley's and Cozen's tests; hmm, wait a minute, those are classic for lateral epicondylalgia, not medial, so I should correct that and use resisted wrist flexion and forearm pronation with palpation over the medial epicondyle for medial epicondylitis, valgus stress testing at 20–30 degrees of flexion for MCL integrity, and ulnar nerve assessment including Tinel's at the cubital tunnel and dynamic evaluation for subluxation; neurovascular exam and assessment of range of motion and crepitus help screen intra-articular pathology if mechanical symptoms are present [^115Pp1rg] [^114aqhb6] [^1151C1xU] [^111fWAmP]. I should double-check my reference to repetitive strain injury as well; I should verify the correct ID, which is the Lancet review on repetitive strain injury that includes cubital tunnel and epicondylitis within its spectrum [^117LGch2].

> Next, I should review the imaging algorithm and ensure it aligns with appropriateness criteria. Let me first confirm the starting point: for chronic elbow pain, obtain plain radiographs to screen for avulsion, osteophytes, arthrosis, and loose bodies; if radiographs are normal yet ligamentous injury is suspected, MRI or ultrasound can evaluate epicondylalgia and collateral ligament pathology, with MR arthrography or CT/MR arthrography reserved for suspected intra-articular mechanical lesions when mechanical symptoms persist despite normal radiographs; targeted ultrasound or MRI is also appropriate when nerve abnormalities are suspected, and MRI remains preferred for chronic ligament and complex soft-tissue assessment [^112ZR2zY] [^115rsyDi] [^1125vYxf] [^111fWAmP] [^115C6Nag] [^1175HUrf]. I should confirm dynamic ultrasound utility for snapping structures and ulnar nerve instability as it provides real-time correlation with the popping event during provocative maneuvers [^115Pp1rg].

> Let me consider management conservatively first and verify evidence-informed steps. Activity modification with temporary elimination of heavy lifting and forceful gripping, ergonomic review, NSAIDs as tolerated, and structured physical therapy emphasizing flexor-pronator strengthening and medial elbow stabilization are reasonable first-line measures for both tendinopathy and low-grade MCL strain in workers, with return-to-work guided by symptom-limited progressive loading and task modification [^114aqhb6] [^112k5TYj] [^117LGch2]. If symptoms persist, I should consider a carefully placed corticosteroid injection for tendinopathy at the area of maximal tenderness while avoiding intratendinous injection; dosing ranges such as methylprednisolone acetate 4–30 mg are acceptable, but ultrasound guidance can improve accuracy and reduce risk, and repeated injections should be used judiciously [^111omiVS] [^114aqhb6]. For suspected ulnar neuropathy, splinting to avoid prolonged elbow flexion and nerve gliding may help, with escalation to procedural options if deficits progress [^1175Hko8].

> Hold on, I should verify surgical indications and options and be cautious not to overstate benefits. In persistent valgus instability due to MCL insufficiency refractory to rehabilitation, MCL reconstruction may be indicated; when symptoms localize to refractory medial epicondylitis after comprehensive nonoperative care, surgical debridement of the flexor-pronator origin may be considered; if a snapping ulnar nerve drives symptoms or deficits, anterior transposition may be appropriate; intra-articular mechanical lesions identified on advanced imaging with mechanical symptoms can be addressed arthroscopically or open as indicated, acknowledging that much of the high-level evidence derives from lateral-sided pathology and athletic populations rather than heavy-industry workers [^1151C1xU] [^114aqhb6] [^111fWAmP] [^114hjzKL]. I need to ensure patients understand that surgery is typically reserved after a substantial trial of conservative care and shared decision-making about goals and work demands [^117LGch2].

> I should now confirm occupational medicine considerations and work restrictions, being careful to tie them to exposure risks and prognosis. Temporary restrictions should limit lifting to light loads, reduce repetitive elbow flexion–extension and forceful gripping, and avoid sustained valgus stress until strength and symptoms improve; durable controls include ergonomic aids, job rotation, and technique training to reduce high-strain exposures; ACOEM guidance supports modified duties that preclude high-force exertions during recovery and emphasizes documentation of exposure and functional capacity for return-to-work planning [^116K2Lkb] [^117LGch2]. Prognosis is generally favorable with conservative care, but high physical strain and manual work predict slower recovery and worse outcomes, underscoring the value of workplace intervention and graded rehabilitation in return-to-work success [^114ZiJ67] [^111j8tHm].

> Let me synthesize a final impression and immediate next steps, ensuring internal consistency with the evidence above. The most likely diagnosis is work-related medial compartment pathology, led by MCL microtrauma with dynamic valgus laxity and concurrent flexor-pronator tendinopathy, with consideration of ulnar nerve instability and less likely intra-articular loose body; immediate actions include detailed exposure history characterizing load weights, frequency, and elbow-wrist postures; targeted physical examination with valgus stress testing, resisted wrist flexion and pronation, and ulnar nerve assessment; screening radiographs; initiation of activity modification and a medial elbow–focused rehabilitation program; early occupational health involvement for restrictions and ergonomic review; and reserving MRI or ultrasound for persistent symptoms or suspected ligament, tendon, nerve, or mechanical pathology that would change management, aligning with ACR and ACOEM recommendations [^115Pp1rg] [^112ZR2zY] [^1125vYxf] [^117LGch2]. I should double-check progress within four to six weeks and escalate to injection or advanced imaging if pain, popping, or functional limitation persists despite compliant conservative care, with surgical referral considered if objective instability, nerve subluxation with deficits, or mechanical symptoms are corroborated on imaging and fail nonoperative treatment [^111omiVS] [^111fWAmP] [^1151C1xU].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **medial epicondylitis** (golfer's elbow) [^114aqhb6] due to repetitive heavy lifting and gripping, with the pop suggesting a partial tear or **degeneration at the flexor-pronator origin** or the medial collateral ligament [^1151C1xU]. Initial evaluation should include a **focused exam** and **plain radiographs** [^112ZR2zY]; if instability or a tear is suspected, obtain MRI or ultrasound [^1175HUrf] [^1125vYxf]. Management is **conservative**, with activity modification, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and bracing [^117LGch2]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases or confirmed tears [^113M1nLK]. Prognosis is **generally good** with adherence to treatment and ergonomic changes [^111j8tHm] [^117LGch2].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **primary differential diagnoses** for medial elbow pain with a popping sensation include:

- **Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow)**: Degeneration or partial tearing of the flexor-pronator origin from repetitive wrist flexion/pronation and gripping [^114aqhb6].

- **Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury**: Valgus instability from repetitive valgus stress or acute overload [^1151C1xU].

- **Ulnar nerve subluxation**: Snapping or popping from ulnar nerve instability at the cubital tunnel [^115hiM5o].

- **Medial elbow instability**: Chronic valgus instability from repetitive microtrauma [^1151C1xU].

- **Medial epicondyle avulsion fracture**: Acute avulsion from sudden forceful contraction [^115Pp1rg].

Given the occupational history and symptoms, **medial epicondylitis** with possible partial tear or degeneration is the most likely diagnosis [^112y9CkY].

---

## Pathophysiology

Medial epicondylitis involves **degeneration of the flexor-pronator origin** (primarily flexor carpi radialis and pronator teres) [^113M1nLK] from repetitive wrist flexion, forearm pronation, and gripping, leading to microtears, tendinosis, and potential partial tearing [^114aqhb6]. The pop likely reflects a partial tear [^1151C1xU] or a sudden progression of degeneration.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical examination

- **Inspection**: Swelling, ecchymosis, deformity.

- **Palpation**: Tenderness at the medial epicondyle/flexor-pronator origin [^115hiM5o].

- **Range of motion**: Pain with resisted wrist flexion/pronation [^117LGch2].

- **Valgus stress test**: Assess MCL stability [^1175HUrf].

- **Tinel's sign**: Evaluate ulnar nerve involvement [^115hiM5o].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging should begin with plain radiographs [^112ZR2zY] to exclude fracture or calcification [^111nnukF]. Ultrasound provides dynamic assessment of tendon and ligament integrity and can identify ulnar nerve subluxation [^115C6Nag]. MRI is the **gold standard** [^1125vYxf] for detecting partial- or full-thickness tears, ligament injury [^1175HUrf], and intra-articular pathology.

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Activity modification**: Limit heavy lifting, repetitive wrist flexion/pronation, and gripping [^116K2Lkb].

- **NSAIDs**: Reduce pain and inflammation [^117LGch2].

- **Physical therapy**: Eccentric strengthening, stretching, and ergonomic training [^112k5TYj].

- **Bracing**: Counterforce brace or wrist splint to reduce tendon load [^117LGch2].

- **Corticosteroid injections**: Consider for persistent symptoms after conservative care [^111omiVS].

---

### Surgical management

Indications include persistent symptoms despite conservative care or a confirmed partial/full-thickness tear [^117LGch2]; **procedures** include debridement of degenerated tendon, repair of partial tears, or MCL reconstruction when instability is present [^113M1nLK].

---

## Prognosis and occupational implications

The **prognosis is generally favorable** with conservative care and ergonomic changes; most recover within 6–12 months [^111j8tHm]. Persistent symptoms can impair function and productivity, potentially requiring job modifications or temporary reassignment [^112k5TYj].

---

## Preventive measures and ergonomic interventions

Preventive measures focus on **ergonomic assessment** to optimize workplace setup and lifting techniques, and use of protective equipment, such as gloves and braces [^116K2Lkb]. Regular breaks and a strengthening program targeting the forearm and grip muscles help reduce repetitive strain [^1141TfuD], while education on proper lifting and body mechanics reinforces safer movement patterns.

---

The patient's medial elbow pop is most consistent with **medial epicondylitis** with a possible partial tear; confirm with an exam and imaging [^1125vYxf], treat conservatively, and address workplace ergonomics to support recovery and prevent recurrence.

### Overuse-related instability of the elbow: The role of CT-arthrography [^1151C1xU]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Ligamentous injuries of the elbow can be caused either by repetitive microtraumatic activities or by a single acute traumatic event, such as an elbow dislocation. We focused on injuries caused by repetitive activities that produce overuse damage: chronic overuse implies repetitive microtrauma of the elbow and can occur in both athletes and nonathletes.

Even though diagnosis is often made at clinical examination, imaging is helpful to confirm clinical interpretation, grade the injury, and guide treatment. The radiologist should be able to identify commonly seen patterns of injury since different structures are variably involved, including tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage.

- **Medial compartment instability**: Instability may affect the medial compartment, involving the medial collateral ligament (MCL), or the lateral compartment, involving the lateral collateral ligament (LCL).

	- **Major elbow instability and posteromedial elbow impingement**: Medial major elbow instability typically affects patients involved in athletic performances and results from acute or chronic injuries to the MCL. The most frequent presentation is chronic elbow pain localized to the medial side and valgus instability, worsened by overhead activities. Overhead throwing athletes, such as baseball pitchers, are particularly subjected to repetitive microtrauma to the MCL. The acceleration phase of throwing is characterized by great valgus and extension forces, leading to major tensile stress on medial structures.

### Medial epicondylitis: Evaluation and management [^114aqhb6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Medial epicondylitis, often referred to as "golfer's elbow", is a common pathology characterized by flexor-pronator tendon degeneration. This occurs with repetitive forced wrist extension and forearm supination during activities involving wrist flexion and forearm pronation. A staged process of pathologic change in the tendon can result in structural breakdown and irreparable fibrosis or calcification.

Patients typically report persistent medial-sided elbow pain, which is exacerbated by daily activities. Athletes may be particularly symptomatic during the late cocking or early acceleration phases of the throwing motion. Nonsurgical supportive care includes activity modification, NSAIDs, and corticosteroid injections. Once the acute symptomology is alleviated, focus is turned to flexor-pronator mass rehabilitation and injury prevention. Surgical treatment via open techniques is typically reserved for patients with persistent symptoms.

### Mapping origins of tendons on the medial epicondyle to improve treatment of medial epicondylitis: Anatomical study [^113M1nLK]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Medial epicondylitis is a tendinosis commonly found in throwing and golfing athletes. Although there are choices for nonsurgical treatments, surgical intervention can be considered when these fail. When surgical treatment is performed, the objective is to debride the diseased tissue from the epicondyle. The purpose of this study was to clarify the locations and size of the common flexor tendons and medial collateral ligament (MCL) relative to each other and to the posterior ridge of the medial epicondyle.

- **Methods**: The common flexor tendons and MCL were dissected and reflected from their origin on the medial epicondyle in six cadaver elbows. Measurements were taken from the posterior and distal ridges of the medial epicondyle with respect to the humerus. Each origin was also measured for its height and width.

- **Results**: The flexor carpi ulnaris origin starts at a mean of 4.2 mm from the posterior ridge of the medial epicondyle and extends anteriorly an average of 4.8 mm. The flexor carpi radialis starts at a mean of 4.2 mm from the posterior ridge and extends anteriorly an average of 7.4 mm. The pronator teres begins at a mean of 4.6 mm from the posterior ridge and extends an average of 5.7 mm anteriorly. The MCL starts at an average of 10.4 mm from the posterior ridge and extends 5.2 mm anteriorly.

- **Conclusions**: The measurements found have allowed the creation of a map of the specific common flexor tendon origins and their sizes on the medial epicondyle, as well as their position relative to the MCL.

- **Clinical Relevance**: A surgeon may debride 1 cm anteriorly from the posterior ridge of the medial epicondyle based on this mapping information to improve surgical outcomes.

### Medial epicondylitis in occupational settings: Prevalence, incidence and associated risk factors [^111j8tHm]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Medial epicondylitis, often not studied alone, was investigated to explore its links with personal and occupational factors in repetitive work and its course. A total of 1,757 workers were examined by an occupational health physician in 1993–1994. Five hundred ninety-eight of them were reexamined three years later. Prevalence was between 4% and 5%, with an annual incidence estimate of 1.5%. Forceful work emerged as a risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 1.95; confidence interval [CI] = 1.15–3.32), whereas exposure to repetitive work was not significantly linked (OR, 1.11; CI = 0.59–2.10). Workers with medial epicondylitis had a significantly higher prevalence of other work-related upper-limb musculoskeletal disorders (WRMD). Risk factors differed between medial and lateral epicondylitis. The prognosis for medial epicondylitis in this population appeared favorable, with a 3-year recovery rate of 81%. Medial epicondylitis was clearly associated with forceful work and other upper-limb WRMD, and its prognosis was good.

### Lateral epicondylitis: Review and current concepts [^115rbi49]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis is a painful and functionally limiting condition affecting the upper extremity, frequently treated by hand surgeons. The anatomical basis of injury to the extensor carpi radialis brevis origin is multifaceted, involving hypovascular zones, eccentric tendon stresses, and a microscopic degenerative response. Although many treatments have been advocated, there is little clear consensus on which modality works best, both for conservative and operative options. In this article, we present an overview of this challenging issue and an evidence-based review of treatment choices.

### Repetitive strain injury [^1175Hko8]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Repetitive strain injury remains a controversial topic. The term "repetitive strain injury" includes specific disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography, are few. Consequently, the role of such imaging in the diagnosis of upper limb disorders remains unclear. In many cases, no specific diagnosis can be established, and complaints are labeled as non-specific.

Little is known about the effectiveness of treatment options for upper limb disorders. Strong evidence for any intervention is scarce, and the effect, if any, is mainly short-term pain relief. Exercise is beneficial for non-specific upper limb disorders. Immobilizing hand braces and open carpal tunnel surgery release are beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, and topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid injections are helpful for lateral epicondylitis. Exercise is probably beneficial for neck pain, as are corticosteroid injections and exercise for shoulder pain.

Although upper limb disorders occur frequently in the working population, most trials have not exclusively included a working population or assessed effects on work-related outcomes. Further high-quality trials should aim to include sufficient sample sizes, working populations, and work-related outcomes.

### Phenobarbital sodium [^112HA2ou]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Untoward reactions may occur in the presence of fever, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and severe anemia. In cases of great debility, severely impaired liver function, pulmonary or cardiac disease, status asthmaticus, shock, or uremia, phenobarbital sodium should be used with extreme caution. Intramuscular injection should be confined to a total volume of 5 mL and made in a large muscle to avoid possible tissue irritation.

Barbiturates may be habit-forming. Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continued use (see drug abuse and dependence). Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or a history of drug abuse.

Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked excitement, depression, and confusion. In some persons, barbiturates repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression.

In patients with hepatic damage, barbiturates should be administered with caution and initially in reduced doses. Barbiturates should not be administered to patients showing the premonitory signs of hepatic coma.

Parenteral solutions of barbiturates are highly alkaline. Therefore, extreme care should be taken to avoid perivascular extravasation or intraarterial injection. Extravascular injection may cause local tissue damage with subsequent necrosis; consequences of intraarterial injection may vary from transient pain to gangrene of the limb. Any complaint of pain in the limb warrants stopping the injection.

### Common occupational upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders [^112k5TYj]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Family physicians play a valuable role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders that result from occupational exposures, including overexertion, repetitive motion, and vibration. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome often identified in workers whose jobs require repetitive hand motion. Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome includes splinting, rehabilitation exercises, and oral or injected corticosteroids; surgical release is considered in patients for whom conservative treatment has failed or who have severe symptoms.

Lateral epicondylitis is an elbow disorder resulting from overuse; it is diagnosed clinically and managed with bracing, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a degenerative disorder of the rotator cuff musculature and tendons and is often identified in people who perform repetitive work overhead. Rotator cuff tendinopathy is diagnosed clinically and generally managed nonoperatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and corticosteroid injections; imaging may be considered to confirm the diagnosis after initial conservative treatment.

Trigger finger is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons of the hand and occurs among people whose jobs require repetitive gripping. Corticosteroid injection is a first-line treatment for trigger finger. A careful history can assist the clinician in determining whether an injury is work-related. Providing appropriate work restrictions for injured workers is essential.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^115V5MZz]. Gut (2017). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for choledocholithiasis, particularly with respect to endoscopic papillary balloon dilation, the BSG 2017 guidelines recommend considering endoscopic papillary balloon dilation as an alternative to biliary sphincterotomy in selected patients. This includes patients with an uncorrected coagulopathy or difficult biliary access due to altered anatomy. It should be noted that performing endoscopic papillary balloon dilation without prior biliary sphincterotomy is associated with an increased risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. An 8-mm diameter balloon should be used when performing endoscopic papillary balloon dilation without prior biliary sphincterotomy.

### Azithromycin [^112FxvLN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: For the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the recommended dose of azithromycin by injection is 500 mg as a single daily dose administered intravenously for at least two days. This should be followed by switching to azithromycin administered orally at a single daily dose of 500 mg, given as two 250 mg tablets, to complete a 7- to 10-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch to oral therapy should be at the physician's discretion and based on the patient's clinical response.

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease**: For adult patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, the recommended dose of azithromycin by injection is 500 mg as a single daily dose administered intravenously for one or two days. This should be followed by oral administration of azithromycin at a single daily dose of 250 mg to complete a 7-day course of therapy. The timing of the switch from intravenous to oral therapy should be determined by the physician, according to clinical response.

### Compensating occupationally related tenosynovitis and epicondylitis: A literature review [^114whzvB]. Occupational Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To assess occupational associations with tenosynovitis and epicondylitis, we conducted a systematic literature review. We focused particularly on evidence that might support compensation of these disorders 'on the balance of probabilities'.

- **Methods**: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic biomedical databases up to 1 January 2005 using combinations of keywords and medical subject headings, and also the references cited in two state-of-the-art reviews from the 1990s. Primary research reports were retrieved and checked for further relevant citations. From each paper, we abstracted a standardized set of information on study populations, exposure contrasts, and estimates of effect.

- **Results**: We found and summarized 18 papers. In the main, these analyses were based on job titles rather than on directly assessed physical activities. Few occupations were studied more than once, and there was little consistent evidence of jobs or work activities that carried more than a doubling of risk for either disorder.

- **Conclusion**: Compensation of occupational illness can be problematic for disorders that are not specific to work and for which there are no distinctive clinical features in occupationally related cases. Attribution can, however, be made on the balance of probabilities if there is convincing evidence that risk is at least doubled in an occupational group. Our review highlights the relative lack of data to support such attribution for tenosynovitis and epicondylitis and discusses the difficulty of compensating upper limb disorders.

### Patanase [^115kgPv5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Patient counseling information is essential when prescribing Patanase. Patients should be informed that treatment with Patanase Nasal Spray may lead to adverse reactions, which include epistaxis and nasal ulcerations [see warnings and precautions (5.1)]. Other common adverse reactions reported with use of Patanase Nasal Spray include bitter taste, headache, and pharyngolaryngeal pain [see adverse reactions (6)].

- **Activities requiring mental alertness**: Somnolence has been reported in some patients taking Patanase Nasal Spray. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of Patanase Nasal Spray [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

- **Concomitant use of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants**: Use of Patanase Nasal Spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see warnings and precautions (5.2)].

Patients should be informed to avoid spraying Patanase Nasal Spray in their eyes.

### Surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^115xSJXu]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). High credibility.

A number of surgical techniques for managing tennis elbow have been described, with one of the most frequently performed involving excision of the affected portion of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). The results of this technique, as well as most other described surgical techniques for this condition, have been reported as excellent, yet none have been compared with placebo surgery.

- **Hypothesis**: The surgical excision of the degenerative portion of the ECRB offers no additional benefit over placebo surgery for the management of chronic tennis elbow.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: This study investigated surgical excision of the macroscopically degenerated portion of the ECRB (surgery; n = 13) as compared with skin incision and exposure of the ECRB alone (sham; n = 13) to treat patients who had tennis elbow for more than six months and had failed at least two nonsurgical modalities. The primary outcome measure was defined as patient-rated frequency of elbow pain with activity at six months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures included patient-rated pain and functional outcomes, range of motion, epicondyle tenderness, and strength at six months and 2.5 years. All outcome measures up to and including the six-month follow-up were measured in person; the longer-term questionnaire was conducted in person or over the phone.

- **Results**: The two groups, surgery and sham, were similar in terms of age, sex, hand dominance, and duration of symptoms. Both procedures improved patient-rated pain frequency and severity, elbow stiffness, and difficulty with activity.

### Optiray300 [^112wFsTW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Risks associated with inadvertent intrathecal administration**: Optiray is indicated for intravascular use only [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Inadvertent intrathecal administration can cause death, convulsions, cerebral hemorrhage, coma, paralysis, arachnoiditis, acute renal failure, cardiac arrest, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, and brain edema.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Optiray can cause life-threatening or fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. Manifestations include respiratory arrest, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, angioedema, and shock. Most severe reactions develop shortly after the start of the injection (e.g. within 1 to 3 minutes), but delayed reactions may occur. There is an increased risk in patients with a history of a previous reaction to contrast agents, known allergies (i.e. bronchial asthma, drug, or food allergies), and other hypersensitivities. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids to avoid or minimize possible allergic reactions does not prevent serious life-threatening reactions but may reduce both their incidence and severity. Obtain a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or prior hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast agents. Always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.

- **Contrast induced acute kidney injury**: Acute kidney injury, including renal failure, may occur after Optiray administration. Risk factors include pre-existing renal impairment and dehydration.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: elbow disorders [^117LGch2]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine has updated the treatment guidelines in its Elbow Disorders chapter through revision processes begun in 2006. This abbreviated version of that chapter highlights some of the evidence and recommendations developed.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive systematic literature reviews were conducted involving article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Extensive peer-review was used to develop evidence-based guidance. Consensus recommendations were formulated when evidence was lacking, often relying on analogy to other disorders for which evidence exists. A total of 108 high- or moderate-quality trials were identified for elbow disorders.

- **Results**: Guidance has been developed for 13 major diagnoses and includes 270 specific recommendations.

- **Conclusion**: Quality evidence is now available to guide treatment for elbow disorders, particularly for lateral epicondylalgia.

### Guideline no. 413: Surgical management of apical pelvic organ prolapse in women [^1123kA4m]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for pelvic organ prolapse, specifically concerning general counseling, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend that patients seeking surgical correction of apical POP should be counseled about the higher risk of objective failure but similar rates of subjective failure, reoperation for POP recurrence, and complications after vaginal suture suspensions compared with abdominal sacrocolpopexy (any approach), balanced against the ongoing risk of mesh exposure after sacrocolpopexy, which may require reintervention.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: Systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^113SEQCy]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This systematic review focuses on the work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis, including a meta-analysis and an evaluation using the GRADE approach. The research aimed to identify key occupational factors contributing to the condition.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search and analysis using various databases were conducted. Relevant studies were included, and a meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the data.

- **Results**: The analysis identified several occupational risk factors associated with lateral epicondylitis. Certain repetitive tasks and manual labor increases the likelihood of developing the condition.

- **Discussion**: The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions in workplaces to reduce the risk of lateral epicondylitis. Occupational safety measures should be implemented to mitigate these risks and protect workers.

By establishing the connection between work-related activities and lateral epicondylitis, this research aims to inform industry practices and reduce the prevalence of this musculoskeletal disorder in occupational settings.

### Physical and psychosocial work exposures as risk factors for disability retirement due to a shoulder lesion [^115FCQDB]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Physical workload factors**: Heavy physical work, such as lifting, carrying heavy loads, excavating, shoveling, or hammering, is considered. Manual handling of heavy loads involves lifting, carrying, or pushing items heavier than 20 kg at least 10 times every day. Working with hands above shoulder level for at least 1 hour per day and working in a forward bent posture for the same duration are significant factors. Forceful hand movements, including squeezing, twisting, holding burdens, or tools for at least 1 hour per day, are also assessed. These were estimated with a gender-specific job exposure matrix (JEM). The JEM provided estimates for the likelihood of exposure. For analysis, continuous JEM values were dichotomized as 0–0.39 (non-exposed) and 0.40–1.00 (exposed).

- **Psychosocial work-related factors**: High job demands, low job control, and monotonousness of work were estimated using a gender-specific JEM. Job strain was operationalized using the quadrant approach proposed by Karasek and Theorell. It defines workers who are above the median on job demands and below the median on job control as having a high strain job. Other categories are low strain (low demands and high control), passive (low demands and low control), and active (high demands and high control). Low strain jobs were used as the reference category in the analyses.

- **Potential confounders**: Information on individuals' education achieved by 31 December 2004, employment sector, and industrial sector was obtained from FLEED. Education was categorized as (1) primary (no education after 9 years of compulsory school and sometimes a vocational qualification).

### Overuse-related instability of the elbow: The role of CT-arthrography [^116273kN]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

This condition may result from repetitive low-energy stress or shear forces, occurring in simple, repetitive, or prolonged daily or working activities performed with the shoulder in moderate abduction, pronation of the hand, and 50°–70° of elbow flexion. In this position, the hand and the forearm create a varus/pronation load on the lateral elbow, with progressive stretching and elongation of the RCL and the annular ligament, both associated with a relative hypermobility of the radial head.

### Work-related risk factors for lateral epicondylitis and other causes of elbow pain in the working population [^113ynTRp]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the relationship between work-related combined physical and psychosocial factors and elbow disorders, specifically lateral epicondylitis and non-specific disorders without lateral epicondylitis, in the working population.

- **Methods**: A total of 3,710 workers (58% men) from a French region participated in physical examinations conducted by occupational health physicians between 2002 and 2005. They assessed their personal factors and work exposure using a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical associations between elbow disorders and risk factors were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 389 (10.5%) workers experienced elbow pain without lateral epicondylitis, while 90 (2.4%) workers had lateral epicondylitis. Age, body mass index (> 25), and low social support (only for men) were significant risk factors. Hard perceived physical exertion combined with elbow flexion/extension (> 2 hr/day) and wrist bending (> 2 hr/day) was a strong significant risk factor for elbow pain and epicondylitis. Among men, the adjusted Odds Ratios (ORa) were 2.6 (1.9–3.7) and 5.6 (2.8–11.3), respectively; among women, ORa values were 1.4 (0.9–2.2) and 2.9 (1.3–6.5).

- **Conclusions**: This study emphasizes the strength of the associations between combined physical exertion and elbow movements and lateral epicondylitis. Certain observed differences in associations with lateral epicondylitis and elbow pain highlight the need for additional longitudinal studies on different stages of elbow disorders and known risk factors.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: Systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^117MQwW6]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Of the included prospective cohort studies on work-related physical risk factors and the incidence of lateral epicondylitis (LE), four studies were conducted in the United States, and one study was conducted in France. Included workers were manufacturing workers, construction, biotechnology, and healthcare workers, those in the service industry, and workers in poultry processing. The study by Herquelot et al. included skilled and unskilled blue-collar workers, cleaning operatives, and healthcare assistants. The total population of workers included in all studies in this review consisted of 5,036 workers, two of which used the same population. In total, 318 cases of LE were observed.

LE was assessed by physical examination in all five studies. In the studies of Fan and Bao et al. and Fan and Silverstein et al, LE was diagnosed as pain in the lateral humeral epicondylar region on resisted wrist extension or tenderness on palpation of the lateral epicondyle as determined during physical examination. The physical examination was conducted by an occupational physician, a registered nurse, or a physical therapist, all blinded to self-reported health status. In the study by Garg et al, the physical examination investigated pain at or near the lateral epicondyle, pain upon palpation in one or more of six points when applying approximately 4 kg of force, and lateral epicondylar region pain upon either resisted wrist extension or third digit extension — all of which were used to diagnose LE. The physical examination was performed by a trained registered occupational therapist.

### The prevalence, variety and impact of wrist problems in elite professional golfers on the European Tour [^112qpHro]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The study group, based on players at one tournament, may be subject to selection bias. Our golfers, in progressing to the pinnacle of European golf, may self-select as a more robust group, capable of ignoring or dismissing symptoms in order to compete.

The European Tour Medical Advisory Board was established in 2008 to provide a specialist assessment, imaging, and treatment service for professional golfers at the larger tournaments. The itinerant lifestyle of elite golfers makes it difficult for them to seek appropriate and consistent medical assistance throughout the year. The medical support service now provided on the European Tour, on the facility shown in Figure 4, significantly addresses this deficiency. This system also enables the collection of reliable injury data on a prospective basis, which should lead to improved medical management of common injuries seen in professional golf.

Figure 4: The roaming 'Physio' unit used on the European Tour to provide physical therapy and medical assessments at each event.

- **New findings**: Wrist injuries in professional golf can be performance-limiting, and some can lead to a prolonged absence. The leading wrist is most vulnerable to injury. Ulnar-sided wrist symptoms are more common than radial-sided symptoms. The optimal management of extensor carpi ulnaris subluxation may not always be surgical.

- **Impact on clinical practice in the near future**: Complete functional assessment will be required to diagnose wrist problems in golfers. Many conditions can be managed by a change in the amount of practice or technique adjustments.

### Repetitive strain injuries of the upper extremity: Imaging of tendon pathology and compressive neuropathies [^115aHMHy]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Repetitive strain injuries (RSIs) encompass a broad clinicopathologic spectrum, which includes discrete patterns of tissue injury involving tendons, bursae, and nerves, although an element of subjective symptomatology may be contributory. Upper extremity RSIs include De Quervain's tenosynovitis, intersection syndromes, epicondylitis, ulnar and median neuritis, as well as other compressive neuropathies. It is estimated that RSIs cost the US economy over $60 billion annually. While detailed clinical examination remains the diagnostic mainstay, imaging can aid in diagnosis, guide management, and reduce costs.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^113cV1Wv]. Lancet (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse is the downward descent of female pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus or post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff, and the small or large bowel, resulting in the protrusion of the vagina, uterus, or both. The development of prolapse is multifactorial, with vaginal childbirth, advancing age, and increasing body-mass index as the most consistent risk factors. Vaginal delivery, hysterectomy, chronic straining, normal aging, and abnormalities of connective tissue or connective-tissue repair predispose some women to disruption, stretching, or dysfunction of the levator ani complex, connective-tissue attachments of the vagina, or both, resulting in prolapse.

Patients generally present with several complaints, including bladder, bowel, and pelvic symptoms; however, with the exception of vaginal bulging, none is specific to prolapse. Women with symptoms suggestive of prolapse should undergo a pelvic examination and medical history check. Radiographic assessment is usually unnecessary.

Many women with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. When prolapse is symptomatic, options include observation, pessary use, and surgery. Surgical strategies for prolapse can be categorized broadly by reconstructive and obliterative techniques. Reconstructive procedures can be done by either an abdominal or vaginal approach. Although no effective prevention strategy for prolapse has been identified, considerations include weight loss, reduction of heavy lifting, treatment of constipation, modification or reduction of obstetric risk factors, and pelvic-floor physical therapy.

### Lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^115Rfet1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis, or "tennis elbow", is a common musculotendinous degenerative disorder of the extensor origin at the lateral humeral epicondyle. Repetitive occupational or athletic activities involving wrist extension and supination are thought to be causative. The typical symptoms include lateral elbow pain, pain with wrist extension, and weakened grip strength. The diagnosis is made clinically through history and physical examination; however, a thorough understanding of the differential diagnosis is imperative to prevent unnecessary testing and therapies. Most patients improve with nonoperative measures, such as activity modification, physical therapy, and injections. A small percentage of patients will require surgical release of the extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon. Common methods of release may be performed via percutaneous, arthroscopic, or open approaches.

### Lateral epicondylitis and physical exposure at work? A review of prospective studies and meta-analysis [^112A4rwf]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). High credibility.

In view of recent studies, a meta-analysis was undertaken on prospective studies to assess the association between lateral epicondylitis and physical exposure at work.

- **Methods**: Using the keywords "lateral epicondylitis" AND "occupational" AND ("cohort" OR "longitudinal" OR "incidence") without limitations on language or year of publication, original prospective studies were selected from four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Base de Données de Santé Publique. This selection followed two rounds ensuring valid design, valid association reported, and valid work exposure. Relevant associations between physical exposure at work and incident lateral epicondylitis were extracted from the articles, and a meta-risk was calculated using the generic variance approach (meta-odds ratios [meta-ORs]).

- **Results**: From 2001 to 2014, five prospective studies were included. Among 6,922 subjects, with 3,449 who were followed, 256 cases of incident lateral epicondylitis were diagnosed 2.5–6 years after baseline. All studies found a significant estimation of relative risk for a positive association between combined biomechanic exposure involving the wrist and/or elbow and incidence of lateral epicondylitis. The overall meta-OR was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.9–3.5), with low heterogeneity (Q = 1.4, P > 0.05). Funnel plots and Egger's test did not suggest major publication bias.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this meta-analysis strongly support the hypothesis of an association between biomechanic exposure involving the wrist and/or elbow at work and the incidence of lateral epicondylitis.

### The elbow: Review of anatomy and common collateral ligament complex pathology using MRI [^1175HUrf]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint whose stability is imparted by osseous and soft-tissue constraints. Anatomical and biomechanical knowledge of the supporting structures that provide stability to the medial and lateral elbow is essential to correctly interpret the pathological findings. Conventional MRI and MR arthrography are the imaging modalities of choice in the evaluation of elbow ligament injuries.

Elbow instability can be classified according to timing (acute, chronic, or recurrent), the direction of displacement, the degree of displacement, and the articulations involved. This article reviews the MR imaging protocols recommended for each diagnosis and the normal anatomy and biomechanical aspects of the medial and lateral collateral ligament complex. Multiple cases of typical and atypical patterns of injury are presented.

### Evaluation of elbow pain in adults [^115Pp1rg]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

The elbow is a complex joint designed to withstand a wide range of dynamic exertional forces. The location and quality of elbow pain can generally localize the injury to one of the four anatomic regions: anterior, medial, lateral, or posterior. The history should include questions about the onset of pain, what the patient was doing when the pain started, and the type and frequency of athletic and occupational activities.

Lateral and medial epicondylitis are two of the more common diagnoses and often occur as a result of occupational activities. Patients experience pain and tenderness over the affected tendinous insertion, which are accentuated with specific movements. If treatments for lateral and medial epicondylitis are unsuccessful, ulnar neuropathy and radial tunnel syndrome should be considered.

Ulnar collateral ligament injuries occur in athletes participating in sports that involve overhead throwing. Biceps tendinopathy is a relatively common source of pain in the anterior elbow; history often includes repeated elbow flexion with forearm supination and pronation. Olecranon bursitis is a common cause of posterior elbow pain and swelling. It can be septic or aseptic and is diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and bursal fluid analysis if necessary.

Plain radiography is the initial choice for the evaluation of acute injuries and is best for showing bony injuries, soft tissue swelling, and joint effusions. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality for chronic elbow pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography allows for an inexpensive dynamic evaluation of the elbow.

### Associations between work-related factors and specific disorders at the elbow: A systematic literature review [^1141TfuD]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the exposure-response relationships between work-related physical and psychosocial factors and disorders like lateral epicondylitis, medial epicondylitis, cubital tunnel syndrome, and radial tunnel syndrome, a systematic review was conducted. This review examined associations between the type of work, physical load, and psychosocial aspects at work with the occurrence of specific elbow disorders, using odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) as quantitative measures.

Handling tools weighing more than 1 kg (ORs of 2.1–3.0), handling loads over 20 kg at least ten times per day (OR 2.6), and repetitive movements exceeding two hours daily (ORs of 2.8–4.7) were associated with lateral epicondylitis. Additionally, psychosocial factors like low job control (OR 2.2) and low social support (OR 1.8) were linked to lateral epicondylitis. Factors such as handling loads greater than 5 kg (twice per minute for a minimum of two hours daily), handling loads over 20 kg at least ten times daily, high hand grip forces for more than one hour per day, repetitive movements for over two hours daily (ORs of 2.2–3.6), and working with vibrating tools for more than two hours daily (OR 2.2) were associated with medial epicondylitis.

The occurrence of cubital tunnel syndrome was linked to holding a tool in position (OR 3.53). For radial tunnel syndrome, handling loads exceeding 1 kg (OR 9.0; 95% CI 1.4, 56.9), static hand work during the majority of the cycle time (OR 5.9), and full elbow extension (0–45 degrees) (OR 4.9) were identified as associated factors.

In conclusion, various physical and psychosocial factors present in occupational settings may contribute to specific elbow disorders.

### How to improve the assessment of the impact of occupational diseases at a national level? The Netherlands as an example [^114yfE9g]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Risk factors were categorized and exposure dichotomized as follows: physical risk factors in terms of force (combined physical exposure wrist and elbow: lateral epicondylitis; hand force: specific soft tissue shoulder disorder; lifting: knee osteoarthritis; manual material handling: non-specific low back pain) and posture (combined physical exposure wrist and elbow: lateral epicondylitis; arm elevation: specific soft tissue shoulder disorder; kneeling or squatting: knee osteoarthritis; bending and twisting: non-specific low back pain) and noise ('yes, regularly').

- **Psychosocial risk factors**: In terms of job demands, decision authority, emotional demands ('often' or 'always'); social support from manager and social support from colleagues (mean ≤ 2.5 on a two-item scale with four answer categories).
- **Chemical risk factors**: Such as inhaling substances ('often' or 'always'); and dermal exposure to wet work ('often' or 'always').

The prevalence of work-related risk factors varied between 4% and 46%.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^111vgt9R]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Using previously described methods, a systematic query of the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science database (v5.22.3; Thomson Reuters) was performed using the Advanced Search tool on October 13, 2016. The authors expanded the search to include all journals, not only those listed under the Web of Science category of "Orthopedics". They searched for all published articles with topics listed as "lateral epicondylitis" or "tennis elbow". The retrieved articles were sorted according to the total number of citations, and the 50 most-cited articles were selected for analysis. The full text of each article was individually evaluated by two authors to ensure that the reviewed material was related to lateral epicondylitis.

For each of the 50 most-cited articles, the following characteristics were recorded: citation number, citation density, journal, publication year, country of origin, and language. Citation density was defined as the number of citations per year since the date of publication. Two independent evaluators characterized each article by type, including basic science, clinical, or diagnostic. Clinical articles were further subtyped as systematic review or meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial, prospective or retrospective cohort study, case-control study, case series, cross-sectional study, review article, or expert opinion. The classification system developed by The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (JBJS) was used to determine the level of evidence for each clinical article.

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^111omiVS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Miscellaneous: Ganglion, tendinitis, epicondylitis**: In the treatment of conditions such as tendinitis or tenosynovitis, care should be taken following application of a suitable antiseptic to the overlying skin to inject the suspension into the tendon sheath rather than into the substance of the tendon. The tendon may be readily palpated when placed on a stretch. When treating conditions such as epicondylitis, the area of greatest tenderness should be outlined carefully and the suspension infiltrated into the area. For ganglia of the tendon sheaths, the suspension is injected directly into the cyst. In many cases, a single injection causes a marked decrease in the size of the cystic tumor and may effect disappearance. The usual sterile precautions should be observed, of course, with each injection. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures listed above varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 mg to 30 mg. In chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.

- **Injections for local effect in dermatologic conditions**: Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 mg to 60 mg is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 mg to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. Care should be taken to avoid injection of sufficient material to cause blanching, as this may be followed by a small slough. One to four injections are usually employed, with the intervals between injections varying with the type of lesion.

### Prognostic factors in lateral epicondylitis: A randomized trial with one-year follow-up in 266 new cases treated with minimal occupational intervention or the usual approach in general practice [^114ZiJ67]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether minimal intervention by occupational specialists involving information about the disorder, encouragement to stay active, and instruction in graded self-performed exercises could enhance the prognosis of lateral epicondylitis compared with the treatment usually given in general practice, this study also aimed to quantify workplace factors associated with the prognosis and consider treatments given in general practice.

A randomized controlled trial was performed in a cohort of 266 consecutive new cases of lateral epicondylitis diagnosed in general practice. Workplace factors were assessed with questionnaires at the time of inclusion, and patients completed follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months. Status at one year was assessed as overall improvement and pain reduction compared with the time of diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) registered the treatments given for both cases and controls during follow-up. Numbers of contacts with GPs and physiotherapists were obtained from the National Health Insurance registry. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis.

After one year, 83% of cases showed improvement in the condition, but the intervention was found to have had no advantage. Poor overall improvement was associated with employment in manual jobs [odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–8.7], a high level of physical strain at work (OR 8.5, CI 1.0–74.7), and a high level of pain at baseline (OR 2.3, CI 1.0–5.3). Pain reduction of less than 50% was associated with manual jobs (OR 2.3, CI 1.1–5.1) and high physical strain at work.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic elbow pain [^111fWAmP]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lateral elbow tendinopathy, and more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining CT/MRI arthrography or non-contrast-enhanced elbow CT/MRI. These imaging techniques are advised to evaluate suspected intra-articular pathologies, such as osteocartilaginous body, osteochondral lesion, or synovial abnormality, in patients with chronic elbow pain accompanied by mechanical symptoms, such as locking, clicking, or limited range of motion (ROM), along with normal or nonspecific radiographs.

### Surgical treatment of lateral epicondylitis: A systematic review [^114sp6BQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

For the minority of people with lateral epicondylitis who do not respond to nonoperative treatment, surgical intervention is an option, but confusion exists because of the plethora of options. The surgical techniques for treating lateral epicondylitis can be grouped into three main categories: open, percutaneous, and arthroscopic. Our primary question was whether there was clear evidence suggesting one of these three approaches was superior in relieving pain, restoring strength, or reducing time to return to work. A 2002 Cochrane Collaboration Database review found no conclusions could be drawn regarding the efficacy of operative treatment given the lack of controlled trials.

Although there is not enough literature to conduct a meta-analysis, we systematically reviewed the available literature to address our questions. Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each procedure, no technique appears superior by any measure. Therefore, until more randomized, controlled trials are done, it is reasonable to defer to individual surgeons regarding experience and ease of procedure.

### Management of lateral epicondylosis [^113GMVy9]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylosis is a common cause of lateral elbow pain and can lead to disability and an overall diminished quality of life. Repetitive gripping and wrist extension is thought to lead to microtearing and degeneration of the extensor tendons. In general, patients with symptoms of lateral epicondylosis experience relief with non-operative management alone. However, controversy remains concerning the role of non-surgical management and which modality facilitates the quickest recovery. Moreover, debate persists throughout the literature regarding surgical intervention and other treatment options for refractory cases. This article serves to provide an updated review of the various treatment options and management for lateral epicondylosis.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: Systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^1146qHUq]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The methodological quality of the study and additional physical exposure assessment was independently rated by two authors (SB and FL). For the quality assessment of the study, the checklist from the systematic review of van der Molen et al. was used. The checklist covers five topics and 16 items in total:

- **Study population**: For example, whether the study population was defined.
- **Assessment of exposure**: Whether the exposure was clearly defined.
- **Assessment of outcome**: Whether the outcome was defined.
- **Study design and analysis**: Whether inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly defined.
- **Data analysis**: Whether a risk estimate was provided.

An overview of the complete checklist is shown in Appendix 1. Possible decisions on the items were (1) positive, (2) negative, or (3) unclear. Methodological quality was considered high when at least 11 of the 16 items were judged as positive.

To assess the quality of the physical exposure assessment and the clinical outcome assessment of lateral epicondylitis (LE), we used the scoring system of Sulsky et al. For the assessment of the physical exposure, a maximum of five points could be obtained if the exposure had a direct measurement of the elbow strain described in specific quantitative data (e.g. applied force measurements, load weight handled, time of holding a specific elbow posture, number of repetitions per time unit). Four points were awarded if the measurement of the elbow strain was indirect, using qualitative specifications (e.g. high repetition, awkward posture, heavy load weight) that were additionally checked.

### Neupogen [^116JbyHZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage in patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy**: The recommended dosage of Neupogen for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer Neupogen for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of Neupogen administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established, administration of Neupogen for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5, 6, and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of Neupogen, and discontinue Neupogen if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100,000/mm³.

- **Dosage in patients with severe chronic neutropenia**: Prior to starting Neupogen in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts, and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of Neupogen prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition, other than SCN, causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with congenital neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection, and the recommended starting dosage in patients with idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection.

### Pelvic organ prolapse [^111Jd7wV]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse, or genital prolapse, is the descent of one or more of the pelvic structures (bladder, uterus, vagina) from the normal anatomic location toward or through the vaginal opening. Women of all ages may be affected, although pelvic organ prolapse is more common in older women. The cause is a loss of pelvic support from multiple factors, including direct injury to the levator ani, as well as neurologic injury from stretching of the pudendal nerves that may occur with vaginal childbirth. Previous hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse, ethnicity, and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from chronic coughing, straining with constipation, or repeated heavy lifting may contribute. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. A sense of bulging or protrusion in the vagina is the most specific symptom. Evaluation includes a systematic pelvic examination.

Management options for women with symptomatic prolapse include observation, pelvic floor muscle training, mechanical support (pessaries), and surgery. Pessary use should be considered before surgery in women who have symptomatic prolapse. Most women can be fitted with a pessary regardless of the stage or site of predominant prolapse. Surgical procedures are either obliterative or reconstructive.

### Ultravist [^114qtVyZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Life-threatening or fatal hypersensitivity reactions may occur during or after Ultravist injection administration. Manifestations include respiratory arrest, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, angioedema, and shock. An increased risk is associated with a history of a previous reaction to a contrast agent (3-fold), a known sensitivity to iodine, and known allergic disorders such as bronchial asthma, hay fever, and food allergies, or other hypersensitivities (2-fold). It is crucial to monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency facilities and personnel trained in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions should be available for at least 30 to 60 minutes after Ultravist injection administration.

- **Contrast-induced acute kidney injury**: Acute kidney injury, including renal failure, may occur after intravascular administration of Ultravist injection. Risk factors include pre-existing renal insufficiency, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, advanced vascular disease, elderly age, concomitant use of nephrotoxic or diuretic medications, multiple myeloma/paraproteinemia, and repetitive and/or large doses of Ultravist injection. It is advised to use the lowest necessary dose of Ultravist injection in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be hydrated appropriately prior to and following Ultravist injection administration.

- **Cardiovascular reactions**: Ultravist injection increases the circulatory osmotic load and may induce acute or delayed hemodynamic disturbances in patients with congestive heart failure and severely impaired renal function.

### Work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis: Systematic review including meta-analysis and GRADE work-relatedness of lateral epicondylitis [^115FBweM]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Quality of studies (methodological quality)**: The quality score of the studies ranged from 11 to 14 points in total, indicating that all studies had a high methodological quality. The initial agreement between the two raters was 81%. Specifically, the study by Garg et al. had the highest quality score of 14 out of 16 points. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and information about possible withdrawals were not reported by all studies, except for the study by Descatha et al.

- **Quality assessment of physical exposure and assessment of outcome**: The quality of the physical exposure assessment in all five studies was high, scoring between six to eight points in total. Two studies used questionnaires to measure work-related physical risk factors. Three studies scored the maximum of five points by using videotape analyses to measure the exposure of work-related physical risk factors. All studies scored the maximum number of points for the clinical assessment of lateral epicondylitis (LE), as this was an inclusion criterion in our review.

- **Meta-analysis and GRADE**: For the following five work-related physical risk factors, a meta-analysis and assessment of the GRADE criteria were performed: flexion and extension movements of the wrist, forearm rotation, (pinch) gripping, repetitive movements, and SI. Details of the assessment of the GRADE framework are presented in the referenced material.

### Is it time to reconsider the indications for surgery in patients with tennis elbow [^112bsjWR]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis or lateral elbow tendinopathy, is a common condition causing lateral elbow pain and disability in middle-aged adults. Its prevalence is strongly associated with age, rising sharply after the age of 30 years, peaking between the ages of 45 and 65 years, and being rare after the age of 65 years.

Indirect evidence suggests that tennis elbow has a benign clinical course. A screening study found that between 1% and 2% of people between the ages of 35 and 55 years have typical clinical findings of tennis elbow, but the reported incidence in the same age group is less than half of that. This suggests that many patients with tennis elbow never see a doctor. Furthermore, about half of those who are diagnosed with tennis elbow only visit a doctor once or twice, and three-quarters are no longer seeking care three months after their initial visit. Another indicator of its excellent long-term prognosis is that despite the lack of a specific cure, the condition is rare in people aged over 65 years.

### Rehabilitation of the painful elbow [^114hjzKL]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Although lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury are common musculoskeletal pathologies in overhead athletes, the evidence supporting specific interventions for managing these conditions is scarce. Management of these conditions has been guided mostly by expert opinion rather than empirical evidence. Yet, the lack of comparative data in the literature has not negatively affected return-to-play rates following surgery. However, an understanding of what is known regarding unimodal and multimodal treatments for lateral elbow pain and medial ulnar collateral ligament injury is needed for clinicians to select evidence-based treatment pathways. Additionally, highlighting what is not known is crucial to develop future high-quality investigations.

### Validation and translation of the Hungarian version of the Australian pelvic floor questionnaire (APFQ-H) [^116aQo97]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Validation and translation of the Hungarian version of the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire involved two key questionnaires: the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ) and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PICQ–IR). Additionally, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) was utilized for data collection. We also gathered data on socio-demographic characteristics, including the highest level of education, occupation, and place of residence, as well as anthropometric data such as weight and height, and information concerning obstetrical and gynecological anamnesis.

- **Discriminant validity**: To determine whether the Hungarian version of the APFQ can effectively distinguish between a general, healthy population and a clinical population, we analyzed data from a group of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP), a condition known to correlate with decreased sexual quality of life due to altered genital anatomy and involuntary coital urine incontinence. All participating women had ≥ stage 1 POP of the anterior, middle, or posterior compartment, or a combination of these. They reported experiencing a sensation of a bulge in the vagina, with or without symptoms of urinary, bowel, or sexual dysfunction. All methods, definitions, and units conform to the standards set by the International Urogynecology Association and the International Continence Society.

### Occupation and epicondylitis: A population-based study [^112y9CkY]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

To explore the relationship between occupational exposures and lateral and medial epicondylitis, and the effect of epicondylitis on sickness absence in a population sample of working-aged adults, a study was conducted. This cross-sectional study involved 9,696 randomly selected adults aged 25–64 years, using a screening questionnaire and standardized physical examination. Age- and sex-specific prevalence rates of epicondylitis were estimated, and associations with occupational risk factors were explored.

Among the 6,038 respondents, 636 (11%) reported elbow pain in the last week. Of those surveyed, 0.7% were diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis and 0.6% with medial epicondylitis. Lateral epicondylitis was associated with manual work, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.0 (95% CI 1.9, 8.4). In multivariate analyses, repetitive bending or straightening of the elbow for more than 1 hour per day was independently associated with lateral (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2, 5.5) and medial epicondylitis (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8, 14.3). Five percent of adults with epicondylitis took sickness absence because of their elbow symptoms in the past 12 months, with a median of 29 days.

Repetitive exposure to bending and straightening the elbow was identified as a significant risk factor for both medial and lateral epicondylitis. Epicondylitis is associated with prolonged sickness absence in 5% of affected working-aged adults.

### Fifty most-cited articles on lateral epicondylitis of the elbow [^111C6Sb9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Lateral epicondylitis affects 1% to 3% of the population and is the most commonly diagnosed musculoskeletal condition of the elbow. A number of treatment options have been developed for tennis elbow, yet the optimal management remains controversial. As such, it is important to identify and characterize the most widely cited investigations on lateral epicondylitis to provide practitioners with the studies that have helped our understanding of this pathology and provided evidence for various treatment options.

Our study identified the 50 most-cited articles pertaining to lateral epicondylitis. It should be noted that this list cannot be comprehensive because only two measures of impact (i.e. citation number and density) were used as a proxy for academic influence. Citation frequency has been used as a marker of an article's impact on a specific specialty because it is an indicator of readership and influence on further research. We are aware that several articles may have been excluded despite having a significant impact on the understanding of lateral epicondylitis. However, we feel that this list includes a number of articles that have greatly contributed to the understanding of the pathoanatomy and surgical and nonsurgical treatments of lateral epicondylitis, which is evidenced by the fact that five of the articles in this top 50 cited list were also included in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons elbow curriculum guide on lateral epicondylitis.
