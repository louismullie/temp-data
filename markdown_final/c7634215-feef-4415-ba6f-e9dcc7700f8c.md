## Question

What is the pathophysiology behind microspherocytes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of microspherocytes, including their definition, mechanisms of formation, clearance, and diagnostic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what microspherocytes are and how they differ from classic spherocytes. Then, I should verify the two principal mechanisms that generate them: membrane loss with reduced surface area and mechanical fragmentation. Next, I will examine the biomechanics of splenic clearance and the role of deformability. After that, I should review the clinical contexts where microspherocytes appear and how to interpret them on smear. Finally, I will synthesize a concise pathophysiologic model and ensure the reasoning aligns with current hematology and morphology literature.

> Let me first confirm the definition and morphology. Microspherocytes are small, round, hyperchromic red cells that lack central pallor and are typically smaller than classic spherocytes; they are a secondary manifestation of fragmentation and should be counted among schistocytes when the characteristic shape abnormalities are present, rather than as separate spherocytes, which I need to keep in mind to avoid misclassification on smear review [^114MAsBv].

> Now, I will examine the first major mechanism: membrane loss with reduced surface area. In hereditary spherocytosis, defects in membrane-cytoskeletal proteins such as ankyrin, band 3, or spectrin weaken the linkage between the lipid bilayer and the underlying skeleton, leading to membrane instability, vesiculation, and progressive loss of membrane surface area; this produces spherocytes that are less deformable and prone to splenic sequestration, and the same principle applies to smaller spherocytes when membrane loss is more focal or severe [^113XHFp8] [^113Cy7LQ]. Wait, let me verify the link to vesiculation and stiffness: recent biophysical work shows that increased RBC vesiculation in HS accompanies membrane-cytoskeleton uncoupling and contributes to cell rounding and stiffening, reinforcing the concept that membrane loss drives spherocyte formation and clearance [^113Cy7LQ].

> Hold on, I should also consider the second major mechanism: mechanical fragmentation with secondary spherocyte formation. In microangiopathic hemolytic processes such as TTP, HUS, DIC, and device-related hemolysis, RBCs are physically sheared by fibrin strands or turbulent flow, producing schistocytes; microspherocytes can arise as small, rounded remnants after partial membrane loss or resealing of fragments, which is why they are considered part of the schistocyte spectrum and should be enumerated with schistocytes rather than as isolated spherocytes [^114MAsBv] [^114Q3WUR]. I should double-check that this aligns with smear teaching: yes, the atlas explicitly instructs that microspherocytes are secondary to fragmentation and counted within the schistocyte total when the defining shape abnormalities are present [^114MAsBv].

> Next, I should review the biomechanics of clearance. The spleen is exquisitely sensitive to reduced deformability and increased sphericity; RBCs with diminished surface area-to-volume ratios cannot traverse the narrow splenic cords and are retained and phagocytosed, explaining the extravascular hemolysis in membrane disorders and the shortened RBC lifespan even when fragmentation is not prominent [^114iSbT4]. Let me verify that this applies beyond classic spherocytes: ex vivo human spleen perfusion and microsphere filtration models demonstrate rapid retention of rigid or spherical RBCs, supporting the concept that microspherocytes, being small and rigid, are efficiently cleared by the same mechanical sensing mechanisms [^114iSbT4].

> I will now examine the clinical contexts where microspherocytes appear. They are well described in thrombotic microangiopathies, including TTP and HUS, and in other MAHA settings such as DIC, malignant hypertension, and mechanical hemolysis from prosthetic valves or devices; they can also be seen in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type I as part of a broader poikilocytosis, which I should remember to distinguish from primary membrane disorders by the clinical picture and additional smear findings [^114MAsBv] [^111Cfjqo] [^114Q3WUR]. But wait, what if I see microspherocytes in a patient with suspected hereditary spherocytosis? I need to ensure I am not overcalling HS when fragmentation is present; in HS, spherocytes are typically larger and more uniform, whereas microspherocytes in MAHA are smaller and accompany other schistocyte forms, which helps in morphologic differentiation [^notfound].

> Let me consider diagnostic implications and pitfalls. On peripheral smear, microspherocytes must be interpreted in the context of accompanying morphologies and the clinical scenario; their presence alongside helmet cells, keratocytes, and other fragments supports a microangiopathic process, whereas uniform spherocytes without fragmentation favor hereditary spherocytosis or warm autoimmune hemolysis, and I should confirm with appropriate hemolysis labs and, when indicated, ADAMTS13 activity or direct antiglobulin testing [^114MAsBv] [^111kLtJd]. Hold on, I should verify that counting guidance is explicit: the atlas advises including microspherocytes within the schistocyte count only when the characteristic fragmentation shapes are present, which prevents overcalling isolated small spherocytes as schistocytes in non-MAHA settings [^114MAsBv].

> Synthesis: I need to ensure the model integrates both mechanisms and the clearance biology. Microspherocytes arise via two converging pathways: primary membrane loss from cytoskeletal defects producing spherocytes of varying sizes, and secondary rounding of small membrane-deficient fragments after mechanical trauma, with both leading to rigid, poorly deformable cells that are rapidly cleared by splenic mechanical retention; clinically, they signal either a membrane disorder or a microangiopathic process, and their enumeration alongside other schistocytes strengthens the diagnosis of MAHA when fragmentation features are present [^113Cy7LQ] [^114MAsBv] [^114iSbT4].

Microspherocytes are small, round, hyperchromic RBCs with reduced surface area and increased sphericity, most often due to **membrane loss from cytoskeletal defects** (ankyrin, band 3, spectrin) in hereditary spherocytosis [^114Qx2xX] or from **mechanical fragmentation** in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (TTP, HUS, DIC, prosthetic valves) [^114MAsBv]. They are less deformable and are trapped in splenic sinusoids, leading to extravascular hemolysis and anemia [^114iSbT4]. Key triggers include genetic mutations, immune-mediated injury, oxidative stress, and mechanical shear; **splenic sequestration** is the final common pathway of clearance [^111CcM9G].

## Structural and morphological characteristics

Microspherocytes are **small, round RBCs** with a reduced diameter and increased thickness, which produces a hyperchromic appearance on peripheral smear. They lack central pallor due to their spherical shape and have a reduced surface-area-to-volume ratio, which limits deformability and predisposes to splenic sequestration [^114iSbT4].

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying microspherocyte formation

### Genetic mutations and membrane protein defects

- **Hereditary spherocytosis (HS)**: Mutations in genes encoding membrane-cytoskeletal proteins (ankyrin, band 3, spectrin) cause membrane instability, loss of surface area, and spherocyte formation [^1175Yvtj].

- **Hereditary stomatocytosis**: Mutations in PIEZO1 or other ion channels cause cation leaks, dehydration, and spherocyte-like cells [^114Rr7nc].

---

### Immune-mediated mechanisms

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (**AIHA**) involves immunoglobulin coating of RBCs, leading to partial phagocytosis and spherocyte formation [^1175Yvtj].

---

### Oxidative stress and membrane damage

Oxidative stress can damage the **RBC membrane**, causing loss of membrane asymmetry, phosphatidylserine exposure, and membrane loss with spherocyte formation [^113nKvgZ].

---

### Mechanical fragmentation

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (**MAHA**) causes mechanical shear from fibrin strands, producing fragmented RBCs and microspherocytes [^114MAsBv].

---

## Role of the spleen in microspherocyte clearance

The spleen is central to microspherocyte clearance: its narrow sinusoids trap **less deformable spherocytes**, which are then phagocytosed by macrophages, causing extravascular hemolysis and anemia [^114iSbT4].

## Diagnostic methods and laboratory findings

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Identifies microspherocytes and other abnormal RBC morphologies [^111kLtJd].

- **Coombs test**: Differentiates immune from non-immune hemolysis [^111kLtJd].

- **Osmotic fragility test**: Assesses membrane stability in hereditary spherocytosis [^notfound].

- **ADAMTS13 activity**: Low in TTP [^113NtX8B].

---

## Therapeutic implications and management strategies

- **Splenectomy**: Reduces hemolysis and anemia in hereditary spherocytosis and refractory AIHA [^notfound].

- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Corticosteroids and IVIG for AIHA [^notfound].

- **Plasma exchange**: For TTP and HUS [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Folic acid, transfusion, and infection prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

Microspherocytes result from **membrane loss or mechanical fragmentation**, leading to reduced deformability and splenic clearance. Management targets the underlying cause — genetic, immune, or mechanical — to reduce hemolysis and improve anemia.

### Cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of circulating microparticles [^111A1HBt]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Microparticles (MPs) derived from platelets, monocytes, endothelial cells, red blood cells, and granulocytes may be detected in low concentrations in normal plasma and at increased levels in atherothrombotic cardiovascular diseases. The elucidation of the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of circulating MPs is crucial for improving our understanding of their pathophysiological role in health and disease. The flopping of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is the key event that will ultimately lead to the shedding of procoagulant MPs from activated or apoptotic cells. Research over the last few years has revealed important roles for calcium-, mitochondrial-, and caspase-dependent mechanisms leading to PS exposure. The study of Scott cells has unraveled different molecular mechanisms that may contribute to fine-tuning of PS exposure and MP release in response to a variety of specific stimuli. The pharmacological modulation of MP release may have a substantial therapeutic impact in the management of atherothrombotic vascular disorders. Because PS exposure is a key feature in pathological processes different from hemostasis and thrombosis, the most important obstacle in the field of MP-modulating drugs seems to be carefully targeting MP release to relevant cell types at an optimal level, so as to achieve a beneficial action and limit possible adverse effects.

### Plasma microparticles and vascular disorders [^113J8nKB]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Microparticles are circulating, phospholipid rich, submicron particles released from the membranes of endothelial cells, platelets, leucocytes and erythrocytes. Investigation into their biological activity has revealed diverse actions in coagulation, cell signalling and cellular interactions. These actions are mediated through their phospholipid rich surfaces and the expression of cell surface molecules which reflect their cell of origin and its state of activation. Microparticle numbers are reported to be elevated in a number of conditions where vascular dysfunction and inflammation are important pathophysiological mechanisms, for example coronary artery disease or thrombotic microangiopathies. Currently, there are a variety of different methods used for the quantitation of circulating microparticles; however with standardisation their assessment may prove to be of clinical value, reflecting the state of the vasculature. Knowledge of the functional properties of microparticles will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction and prothrombotic states.

Figure 2
Immunological response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Upon viral cell entry, SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens are processed by the innate immune system through antigen‐presenting cells (APCs), e.g. epithelial cells, macrophages, and/or dendritic cells. Subsequently, the adaptive immune system is activated by migration of APCs to the lymphoid system. Upon antigen recognition, T‐lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate into CD4 + and CD8 + T‐lymphocytes that are responsible for sequential events including cytokine production, activation of naïve B‐lymphocytes, and clearance of infected cells (CD8 + cytotoxic T‐lymphocytes). B‐lymphocytes proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells that produce large numbers of neutralising antibodies, representing humoral immunity. A bulk of cytokines is induced upon SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, most of which contribute to hyperinflammation as constituents of the 'cytokine storm' in severe disease (e.g. IL‐6, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IP‐10, MCP‐1, CSFs, and IL‐17A), whereas others are particularly important for viral clearance (e.g. IL‐15, IFN‐α, IL‐12, IL‐21, and IFN‐γ) in mild‐to‐moderate disease. Severe COVID‐19 is marked by dysfunction of certain immune cells, with relatively increased abundances of neutrophils and monocytes and decreased levels of effector T‐lymphocytes. In addition, multiple downstream pathophysiological processes are activated, including an increased thrombogenic state [microangiopathy, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)], haemophagocytosis, reduced haematopoiesis, and increased apoptosis/pyroptosis. CD147, cluster of differentiation 147; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Loss of germinal centre formation in both spleen and lymph nodes provides a potential explanation for suboptimal humoral immunity, with the possibility of reinfection in certain individuals. Nevertheless, the vast majority of COVID‐19 patients with mild‐to‐moderate disease experience a robust adaptive immune response consisting of T‐cells (against S‐protein‐ and nucleoprotein/membrane protein‐derived antigens) and neutralising antibodies (against S‐protein‐derived antigens), which persists for months after primary infection. Overall, coordinated SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific adaptive immune responses are associated with milder disease and are therefore essential for optimally controlling viral infection.

### Role of microparticles in atherothrombosis [^113R7PYk]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Cell activation or apoptosis leads to plasma membrane blebbing and microparticle (MP) release in the extracellular space. MPs are submicron membrane vesicles which express a panel of phospholipids and proteins specific of the cells they are derived from. Exposure of negatively charged phospholipids and tissue factor confers a procoagulant potential to MPs. MPs accumulate in the lipid core of the atherosclertotic plaque and is a major determinant of its thrombogenecity. Elevation of plasma MPs levels, particularly those of endothelial origin, reflects cellular injury and is considered now as a surrogate marker of vascular dysfunction. Thus, MPs can be seen as triggers of a vicious circle for they promote prothrombogenic and pro-inflammatory responses as well as cellular dysfunction within the vascular compartment. A better knowledge of MP composition and biological effects as well as the mechanisms leading to their clearance will probably open new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of atherothrombosis.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Megakaryocytes and beyond: the birth of platelets [^1115StwC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Megakaryocytes are highly specialized precursor cells that differentiate to produce blood platelets via intermediate cytoplasmic extensions known as proplatelets. Recent advances in the understanding of megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet formation rely on a combination of genetic and cell biological studies with detailed structural analysis of cultured cells. Visualization of sequential steps in endomitosis has expanded our views on how megakaryocytes acquire polyploid DNA content, whereas studies in mouse models of platelet disorders provide clues into transcriptional pathways and those leading to the assembly of platelet-specific secretory granules. The experimental findings forge stronger links between cellular processes and molecular mechanisms, while observation of the underlying morphologic events in beginning to yield insights into the cytoskeletal mechanics of proplatelet formation. Here we review salient aspects of the emerging appreciation of the cellular and molecular basis of thrombopoiesis.

### Why are tumour blood vessels abnormal and why is it important to know? [^111qP64y]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Capillaries

One mechanism by which MVs evolve into capillaries involves intraluminal bridging, a process that was originally discovered in tumour vessels, but which has since been found to occur in the angiogenesis induced by Ad-VEGF-A 164 and healing wounds, and after chronic vascular dilatation. Endothelial cells extend cytoplasmic processes into and across MV lumens, forming transluminal bridges that divide blood flow into multiple smaller-sized channels. Subsequently, these smaller channels separate from each other to form individual, capillary-sized vessels that are, as far as is known, normal in structure and are not hyperpermeable.

### Images from the haematologica atlas of hematologic cytology: schistocytes in thrombotic microangiopathies [^114MAsBv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

The presence of schistocytes is a constant feature of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies. The highest concentrations of schistocytes are observed in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in which they represent 1–18% of red blood cells. Lower concentrations can be observed in other thrombotic microangiopathies as well as in subjects with mechanical heart valves or other intravascular devices and in chronic renal diseases. Helmet cells (A-C, arrow) are erythrocytes with an amputated zone highlighted by a straight border as a result of a crash on a fibrin strand. The missing cell portion corresponds to the fragments of erythrocytes shown in (H) and (I). Keratocytes (cells with horns) (D-F, arrows) are characterized by two or three spicules separated by concave segments of membrane and have been formed by rupture of peripheral pseudovacuoles and subsequent fusion of the cell membrane. Fragments of erythrocytes with bizarre shapes escape a precise classification (G-I). In (F) and (G) you can also recognize microspherocytes, which are a secondary manifestation of fragmentation and should be included within the schistocyte count only in the presence of the shape abnormalities described in (A-F).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^1166LCuA]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — group 1 updates and associated conditions are outlined as follows: The term familial PAH has been replaced by heritable PAH because specific gene mutations have been identified in sporadic cases with no family history, and heritable PAH includes clinically sporadic idiopathic PAH with germline mutations (mainly of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 gene as well as the activin receptor-like kinase type-1 gene or the endoglin gene) and clinical familial cases with or without identified germline mutations; this category does not mandate genetic testing in any patient with IPAH or in familial cases of PAH because this would not change clinical management. The classification of congenital heart disease causing PAH has been updated to include a clinical and an anatomical–pathophysiological version to better define and individualize prognosis, and associated PAH includes conditions with a similar clinical presentation to idiopathic PAH with identical histological findings including plexiform lesions. Schistosomiasis has been included among associated PAH forms, with a mechanism probably multifactorial including portal hypertension and local vascular inflammation caused by schistosome eggs, and chronic haemolytic anaemias such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, stomatocytosis, and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia may result in PAH; in chronic haemolysis the mechanism relates to a high rate of nitric oxide consumption leading to resistance to NO bioactivity and smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate is not activated in chronic haemolytic anaemia.

### Circulating microparticles carry a functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase that is decreased in patients with endothelial dysfunction [^115hfPSu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Microparticles (MPs) are shed membrane particles of less than a micrometer in diameter thought to be budded into the circulation from endothelial cells and various blood cells, including platelets, leukocytes, and erythrocytes. – Thus, circulating MPs constitute a heterogeneous population of different cellular origins, numbers, size, and antigenic composition. Proposed mechanisms of MP generation include apoptosis and cellular activation by cytokines. – MPs circulate in blood from healthy individuals, and their numbers are increased in several cardiovascular diseases and conditions that predispose to cardiovascular disease. – MPs have long been considered functionally inert cell debris, and the number of circulating MPs in blood was proposed to be a marker of endothelial damage and platelet activation. More recently, it was appreciated that MPs harbor a number of membrane and cytoplasmatic proteins from the cells they originate from – and, therefore, may play a role as a disseminated storage pool of bioactive effectors in intercellular communication mediating effects in cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology.

The enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and its product nitric oxide (NO) play a central role in the control of vascular homeostasis. – A significant proportion of circulating MPs originate from platelets and endothelial cells, which both express eNOS. We hypothesized that MPs may harbor a functional eNOS. Therefore, we analyzed eNOS expression and activity in MPs isolated from healthy individuals, as well as from patients with cardiovascular disease, a condition characterized by impaired eNOS activity and/or expression.

### Platelet-derived microparticles-an updated perspective [^115A3Kbu]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Platelet-derived microparticles (PMP) are a heterogeneous population of vesicles (< 1 mm) generated from the plasma membrane upon platelet activation by various stimuli. They are a discrete population differing from the exosomes which originate from the intracellular multivesicular bodies. PMP also differ from the microparticles derived from megakaryocytes despite the presence of several identical surface markers on the latter. The molecular properties and the functional roles of the PMP are beginning to be elucidated by the rapidly evolving research interest, but novel questions are simultaneously raised. This updated perspective discusses the most recent highlights in the PMP research in context with the methodological problems and the paradoxical role of the PMP in health and disease.

### Capillary leukocytes, microaggregates, and the response to hypoxemia in the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients [^114wP4wz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has brought a wide range of challenges in intensive care medicine related to the understanding of its pathophysiology, pathogenesis, immunology, and therapeutic resolution. Unresolved COVID-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-induced hypoxemia associated with a state of hyperinflammation and procoagulation requiring intensive care admission for invasive mechanical ventilation as well as virus induced organ damage. COVID-19-induced ARDS, however, differs markedly in its phenotype in comparison with the better understood bacterial sepsis-induced ARDS although there may be important similarities.

Endothelial cell dysfunction has been suggested to be a central unifying event in the pathogenesis of sepsis in general and in COVID-19 in particular. Such endothelial cell injury may cause microcirculatory dysfunction, which could underlie the deterioration of oxygen transport seen in COVID-19. The importance to investigate the nature of microcirculatory alterations induced by COVID-19 has been suggested (,–), although as yet not adequately investigated.

Handheld vital microscopes used to investigate the sublingual microcirculation of patients has identified microcirculatory alterations as a key event in the states of critical illness. These have shown a high sensitivity and specificity for identifying the underlying pathophysiology and for predicting outcome in septic shock patients independent of changes in systemic hemodynamic variables. Recently, we developed and clinically validated an automatic image analysis platform for quantitative analysis of microcirculatory hemodynamic parameters and developed methodologies to measure microcirculatory leukocyte-endothelial interactions from sublingual microcirculatory images.

With these tools, we undertook a multicenter microcirculation study in COVID-19 ICU patients. We formulated three hypotheses: 1) there are microcirculatory alterations in response to COVID-19-induced ARDS, 2) there is an increased presence of leukocytes in the microcirculation in response to inflammation, and 3) there are RBC microthrombi due to coagulopathy present in the microcirculation.

### Evidence for a protective role of the gardos channel against hemolysis in murine spherocytosis [^113XHFp8]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

It has been shown that mice with complete deficiency of all 4.1R protein isoforms (4.1-/-) exhibit moderate hemolytic anemia, with abnormal erythrocyte morphology (spherocytosis) and decreased membrane stability. Here, we characterized the Gardos channel function in vitro and in vivo in erythrocytes of 4.1-/- mice. Compared with wild-type, the Gardos channel of 4.1-/- erythrocytes showed an increase in Vmax (9.75 ± 1.06 vs 6.08 ± 0.09 mM cell x minute; P < .04) and a decrease in Km (1.01 ± 0.06 vs 1.47 ± 1.02 microM; P < .03), indicating an increased sensitivity to activation by intracellular calcium. In vivo function of the Gardos channel was assessed by the oral administration of clotrimazole, a well-characterized Gardos channel blocker. Clotrimazole treatment resulted in worsening of anemia and hemolysis, with decreased red cell survival and increased numbers of circulating hyperchromic spherocytes and microspherocytes. Clotrimazole induced similar changes in 4.2-/- and band 3 ± mice, indicating that these effects of the Gardos channel are shared in different models of murine spherocytosis. Thus, potassium and water loss through the Gardos channel may play an important protective role in compensating for the reduced surface-membrane area of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) erythrocytes and reducing hemolysis in erythrocytes with cytoskeletal impairments.

### Microparticles, vascular function, and atherothrombosis [^116UgHAA]. Circulation Research (2011). Low credibility.

Membrane-shed submicron microparticles (MPs) are released after cell activation or apoptosis. High levels of MPs circulate in the blood of patients with atherothrombotic diseases, where they could serve as a useful biomarker of vascular injury and a potential predictor of cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. Atherosclerotic lesions also accumulate large numbers of MPs of leukocyte, smooth muscle cell, endothelial, and erythrocyte origin. A large body of evidence supports the role of MPs at different steps of atherosclerosis development, progression, and complications. Circulating MPs impair the atheroprotective function of the vascular endothelium, at least partly, by decreased nitric oxide synthesis. Plaque MPs favor local inflammation by augmenting the expression of adhesion molecule, such as intercellular adhesion molecule -1 at the surface of endothelial cell, and monocyte recruitment within the lesion. In addition, plaque MPs stimulate angiogenesis, a key event in the transition from stable to unstable lesions. MPs also may promote local cell apoptosis, leading to the release and accumulation of new MPs, and thus creating a vicious circle. Furthermore, highly thrombogenic plaque MPs could increase thrombus formation at the time of rupture, together with circulating MPs released in this context by activated platelets and leukocytes. Finally, MPs also could participate in repairing the consequences of arterial occlusion and tissue ischemia by promoting postischemic neovascularization.

### Pathophysiology of venous ulceration [^114rxHKM]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the pathophysiologic process of venous ulceration has dramatically increased during the past two decades because of dedicated, venous-specific basic science research. Currently, the mechanisms regulating venous ulceration are a combination of macroscopic and microscopic pathologic processes. Macroscopic alterations refer to pathologic processes related to varicose vein formation, vein wall architecture, and cellular abnormalities that impair venous function. These processes are primarily caused by genetic factors that lead to the destruction of normal vein wall architecture and venous hypertension. Venous hypertension causes a chronic inflammatory response that over time can cause venous ulceration. The inciting inflammatory injury is chronic extravasation of macromolecules and red blood cell degradation products and iron overload. Chronic inflammation causes white blood cell extravasation into the dermis with secretion of numerous proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines transform the phenotype of fibroblasts to a contractile phenotype that increases tension in the dermis. In addition, iron overload keeps macrophages in an M1 phenotype, which leads to tissue destruction instead of dermal repair. Current surgical and medical therapies are primarily directed at eliminating venous hypertension and promoting venous ulcer wound healing. Despite advances in our understanding of venous ulcer formation and healing, ulcers still take an average of 6 months to heal, and ulcer recurrence rates at 5 years are > 58%. To improve the care of patients with venous ulcers, we need to further our understanding of the underlying pathologic events that lead to ulcer formation, prevent healing, and decrease ulcer-free recurrence intervals.

### Breaking the barrier: unraveling the no-reflow phenomenon in cardiovascular medicine [^114bFwRL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of no‐reflow is multifaceted, with microvascular obstruction (MVO) identified as the primary mechanism. Four key factors contribute to MVO: myocardial ischemia, distal embolization, reperfusion‐related injury, and individual susceptibility (Figure 2). The coronary microcirculation, comprised of arterioles, capillaries, and venules plays a pivotal role in the development of CNR. Arterioles, as resistance vessels, exhibit impaired vasomotor tone and increased thrombus formation during ischemia‐reperfusion cycles. Capillaries, the primary site of MVO, undergo structural changes such as endothelial swelling and obstruction, which reduce the number of open vessels and impair oxygen delivery. Venules, characterized by weak smooth muscle walls, facilitate leukocyte and platelet adhesion, exacerbating inflammation and obstruction. These microvascular changes collectively contribute to the impaired perfusion observed in no‐reflow.

Figure 2
Progression of the coronary no‐reflow phenomenon from initial microvascular obstruction (MVO) to reperfusion injury. [Color figure can be viewed at]

Mechanistically, endothelial dysfunction is central to the development of no‐reflow. During ischemia, endothelial cells experience metabolic stress, leading to ionic imbalances, cytoskeletal contraction, and increased vascular permeability. The degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines further disrupts the capillary barrier, promoting leukocyte and platelet aggregation. Pericytes, contractile cells surrounding capillaries, also play a significant role by constricting capillaries and reducing perfusion despite the reopening of upstream arteries. These processes are exacerbated by platelet activation and neutrophil infiltration, which create microthrombi and release inflammatory mediators that amplify endothelial damage.

### Monocyte and haematopoietic progenitor reprogramming as common mechanism underlying chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases [^115EaaPM]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to excessive amounts of lipids, atherosclerotic lesions thus harbour all classes of immune cells and moreover, serum levels of inflammatory mediators are linked to coronary heart disease. Recent advances in preclinical research have established a fundamental role for cellular inflammation throughout all stages of this disease from initiation through progression and, ultimately, the thrombotic complications following plaque rupture or erosion. A key role for innate immunity is illustrated by studies showing that monocytes and macrophages are abundantly present in atherosclerotic plaques, and moreover, inhibiting monocyte-entry into the plaque drastically attenuates atherogenesisas well as CVD-risk, whereas immune cell stimulation accelerates atherosclerosis.

In parallel, systemic monocyte production and circulating monocyte number increase progressively with advancing disease. These innate immune cells help drive the formation of an extensive microvascular network penetrating the more advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These leaky, immature vessels provide an easy communication and access network for both cellular as well as humoral elements. The extravasated immune cells also have an intricate impact on plaque phenotype by contributing substantially to endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix degradation. From a therapeutic perspective, several randomized clinical trials are currently underway that will determine whether non-specific anti-inflammatory therapies with for instance interleukin-1-neutralizing antibodies or methotrexate can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis.

To date, little is known on the mechanism(s) maintaining the chronic inflammatory state in CV patients. Recent data have moved our focus from immune cells within the atherosclerotic plaque towards a systemic pro-inflammatory state, characterized by increased production and mobilization of innate immune cells by haematopoietic organs, lipoprotein-driven activation of innate immune cells already within the plasma compartment, and rapid, increased influx of immune cells into atherosclerotic plaques in patients, collectively driving the inflammatory state in the atherosclerotic plaque.

Whereas the contribution of immune cells to atherogenesis has been well established, it remains elusive why the strong inflammatory response in the arterial wall persists over time. In the adaptive arm of the immune system, dendritic cells in the plaque promote adaptive immune responses by presenting antigens, leading to enhanced T-cell function both in experimental and clinical atherosclerosis. The interplay between activated T-cells and resident macrophages perpetuates a local inflammatory cascade within the subendothelial compartment. In addition, increasing body of evidence directs towards a role for impaired resolution of inflammation.

### Dusky pink annular plaques with a vesicular border [^112rfDBc]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the pathophysiologic mechanism of bullae formation in this patient?
A. Th2 shift in cell-mediated immunity causing exacerbation of underlying atopy
B. Th2 response to placental tissues causing degradation of the dermoepidermal junction
C. Th1 induced complement-fixing antibodies to type VII collagen
D. Th2 response to skin flora with elevated interleukin 9 and interleukin 33
E. Photoactivation of accumulated porphyrins at the dermoepidermal junction triggering the complement cascade

Answers:

A. Th2 shift in cell-mediated immunity causing exacerbation of underlying atopy – Incorrect. In the acute presentation of atopic dermatitis, the Th2-type response predominates and leads to erythematous and edematous papules and plaques. A Th1-type response can also occur in chronic atopic dermatitis, presenting with lichenification.
B. Th2 response to placental tissues causing degradation of the dermoepidermal junction – Correct. Gestational hormonal changes cause a Th2 immune response to placental tissue leading to the formation of bullous pemphigoid-180 autoantibodies that activate complement and chemotaxis of eosinophils. Eosinophilic degradation of the dermoepidermal junction leads to the formation of bullae.
C. Th1 induced complement-fixing antibodies to type VII collagen – Incorrect. This mechanism has been suggested in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.
D. Th2 response to skin flora with elevated interleukin 9 and interleukin 33 – Incorrect. While the mechanism of PUPPP has not been fully elucidated, it is hypothesized that hyperextension of the abdominal skin leads to allowing for possible antigen exposure to skin flora. A case study in a patient with PUPPP found elevated serum cytokines interleukin 9 and interleukin 33.
E. Photoactivation of accumulated porphyrins at the dermoepidermal junction triggering the complement cascade – Incorrect. PCT is caused by the impaired activity of uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase leads to the accumulation of porphyrins, which, when photoactivated by UV irradiation, activates the complement cascade. Localized accumulation of porphyrins in the dermal-epidermal junction results in its separation and the formation of vesicles and bullae.

### Circulating microclots are structurally associated with neutrophil extracellular traps and their amounts are elevated in long COVID patients [^111KncVP]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Impact of NETs and Microclots Association on LC Complications

Abnormal blood clotting and microclots formation thus appear as important factors that may explain the development and persistence of symptoms in LC. Indeed, several researchers have signalled the exacerbation by a dysregulated thromboinflammatory response of the interplay between coagulation and innate immunity. Platelet hyperactivation and endothelial dysfunction would therefore appear to be a unifying pathway underlying the wide range of symptoms seen in LC.

Mechanistically, cell viral infection and the resulting inflammation leads to the stimulation of neutrophils, which leads in turn to the release of tissue factors and the degradation of anticoagulants by monocytes, promoting coagulation. As a result, the interplay between the innate immune response and blood coagulation (immunothrombosis) leads to the formation of microthromboses.

### Placenta-derived microparticles [^1151WTNb]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Microparticles (MPs), sub-micron membrane vesicles, participate in the placental and maternal crosstalk in normal pregnancies as well as in gestational vascular complications (GVC). The article will review the effects of MPs on placental physiological processes, including hemostasis, trophoblast migration, invasion, placental vasculature and their involvement in pathologic states such as thrombosis, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, resulting in GVC.

### Circulating microparticles carry a functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase that is decreased in patients with endothelial dysfunction [^113bZNsB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

The consequences of decreased eNOS protein expression and NO release are not limited to the vessel wall, but may also involve blood cells known to express this enzyme, including platelets, endothelial progenitor cells, or even circulating MPs, as shown in the present study. Considering the central role played by endothelial and blood cell eNOS in vascular homeostasis, it is also tempting to speculate that the eNOS activity of MPs may directly participate in this equilibrium, providing a further circulating source of NO. Future studies will aid further understanding of the (patho)physiological role of circulating eNOS in MPs.

Taken together, our data support the concept that MPs may not only retain phenotypic markers but also preserve the expression and functionality of enzymes of the cells they originate from, including eNOS, and may mediate and transport their physiological functions. In cardiovascular disease, an increase in endothelium‐derived MP subpopulations accompanied by a decrease in MPs' eNOS activity may not merely be an index of a dysfunctional endothelium, but may also contribute to disturbed NO bioavailability and hence play a role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.

### Diabetic platelets: pathophysiology, clinical significance, and therapeutic perspectives [^114UgbqD]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Platelets in people with diabetes play an active role in the development of vascular complications rather than being mere participants in haemostasis. The diabetic milieu leads to significant changes in the structure and function of the platelets, making them hyperactive and less responsive to standard treatments. These modifications contribute to both micro- and macro-vascular complications, highlighting the importance of careful monitoring and customized treatment strategies for individuals with diabetes. Although conventional antiplatelet medications are fundamental to treatment, their varied effectiveness in patients with diabetes emphasizes the pressing need for more tailored and mechanism-based therapies.

### The human microcirculation: regulation of flow and beyond [^111iAZL3]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

The microcirculation is responsible for orchestrating adjustments in vascular tone to match local tissue perfusion with oxygen demand. Beyond this metabolic dilation, the microvasculature plays a critical role in modulating vascular tone by endothelial release of an unusually diverse family of compounds including nitric oxide, other reactive oxygen species, and arachidonic acid metabolites. Animal models have provided excellent insight into mechanisms of vasoregulation in health and disease. However, there are unique aspects of the human microcirculation that serve as the focus of this review. The concept is put forth that vasculoparenchymal communication is multimodal, with vascular release of nitric oxide eliciting dilation and preserving normal parenchymal function by inhibiting inflammation and proliferation. Likewise, in disease or stress, endothelial release of reactive oxygen species mediates both dilation and parenchymal inflammation leading to cellular dysfunction, thrombosis, and fibrosis. Some pathways responsible for this stress-induced shift in mediator of vasodilation are proposed. This paradigm may help explain why microvascular dysfunction is such a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events and help identify new approaches to treatment and prevention.

### Function and role of microparticles in various clinical settings [^116qUgGH]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Microparticles released from cells (MPs) may play a role in the normal hemostatic response to vascular injury and a role in clinical diseases because they express phospholipids, which function as procoagulants. Although flow cytometry is the most widely used method for studying MPs, some novel assays such as tissue factor-dependent procoagulant assay or the ELISA method have been reported. However, the use of MP quantification as a clinical tool is still a matter of debate. Elevated platelet-derived MP, endothelial cell-derived MP, and monocyte-derived MP concentrations are documented in almost all thrombotic diseases occurring in both venous and arterial beds. However, the clear significance of MPs in various clinical conditions remains controversial. For example, it is not known if MPs found in peripheral blood vessels cause thrombosis, or whether they are the result of thrombosis. On the other hand, numerous studies have shown that not only the quantity but also the cellular origin and composition of circulating MPs are dependent on the type of disease, the disease state and medical treatment. In addition, many different functions have also been attributed to MPs. Thus, the number and type of clinical disorders associated with elevated MPs is currently increasing.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS: a narrative review from molecular to organ-level perspectives [^1174PMfp]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Tissue-Level Transformation: barrier disruption and tissue remodeling

Collapse of the alveolar-capillary barrier: from Protection to Destruction

The alveolar-capillary barrier, comprising the alveolar and capillary endothelium, primarily functions to facilitate gas exchange and maintain a critical separation between blood and alveolar fluid. Under normal conditions, this barrier remains intact due to tight junctions and surfactant secretion, which serve protective functions. In ARDS, however, various pathological factors compromise the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier, shifting its role from maintaining homeostasis and protection to exacerbating tissue damage and driving disease progression. Mechanical injuries, such as those induced by mechanical ventilation and elevated airway pressures, directly damage epithelial cells and ECs. Inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α and IL-1β, trigger inflammatory responses that culminate in cellular apoptosis and necrosis. Oxidative stress, mediated by ROS, inflicts oxidative damage on cell membranes and intracellular structures, further compromising barrier function. Simultaneously, immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages release enzymes and ROS, exacerbating tissue damage.

These factors collectively contribute to the breakdown of the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in increased permeability and the subsequent formation of pulmonary edema. The loss of alveolar-capillary barrier function exacerbates pulmonary edema and hypoxemia and profoundly influences ARDS course and prognosis. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying alveolar-capillary barrier injury and repair, as well as on developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with ARDS.

### Computer vision quantitation of erythrocyte shape abnormalities provides diagnostic, prognostic, and mechanistic insight [^113NtX8B]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Expert estimates

To provide a reference for RBC-diff performance, 5 experts (board-certified hematopathologists or hematologists) were asked to estimate the prevalence (%) of specified cell types in 5 sets of 10 smears (10 smears for elliptocytes, schistocytes, sickle cells, spiculated cells, and teardrop cells), with each set containing 5 smears with a 1+ flag for the given cell type, and 5 with no flag. The experts were blinded to the clinical details and morphology grading flags. To simulate standard high-power microscopic fields, each smear was presented as a series of 16 smaller images, each containing ∼100 to 200 RBCs. To best reflect clinical practice, the experts were not given specific instructions on how to perform the task.

Clinical cohort studies

For further validation, we tested the discriminatory capacity of RBC-diff counts across 5 clinical cohorts with clear pathophysiologic signals: elliptocytosis vs spherocytosis, before and after liver transplantation, before and after RBC exchange in patents with sickle cell disease, before and after iron supplementation in patients with iron-deficiency, and before and after splenectomy. The cohort inclusion criteria are given in the supplemental Methods.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) cohort

Patients with TMA were drawn from the Harvard TMA Research Collaborative data set. Two TMA cohorts were collated: a derivation and a validation cohort. The derivation cohort consisted of patients presenting at the MGH between 31 March 2017 and 30 November 2020, and the validation cohort consisted of patients presenting at the MGH and BWH between 1 January 2021 and 19 December 2021. Patient details were gathered through a detailed chart review by members of the study team. Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) was defined as an ADAMTS13 enzyme activity level ≤ 10% (normal reference range, activity > 66% for assay at Blood Center of Wisconsin) or ADAMTS13 enzyme activity ≤ 25% with an inhibitor of > 1.0 inhibitor units (normal reference range, < 0.5 inhibitor units). Outpatient cases of Upshaw-Schulman syndrome were not defined as iTTP cases. See the supplemental Methods for additional details.

### Circulating microparticles in severe pulmonary arterial hypertension increase intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression selectively in pulmonary artery endothelium [^111hw3vY]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Endothelial heterogeneity within the pulmonary circulation is defined by location of the cells and their physiologic and pathologic responses. By testing endothelial cells derived from both the pulmonary arterial and microcirculations we could identify whether the circulating MPs affected a specific location. Importantly, in PAH the pulmonary vascular lesions, containing inflammatory cell infiltrates, develop in the pulmonary artery but not in the pulmonary microcirculation. The 8-week circulating MPs did not induce ICAM-1 expression in or on PMVECs, from the microcirculation. We cannot state explicitly that the MPs had no effect on the PMVECS, since we only examined ICAM-1 expression, and further studies would be necessary to determine whether there were influences on proliferation or other inflammatory molecules, however the implications are intriguing. The concept that MPs interact with cellular targets has been proposed, but rarely directly tested. These data leave open speculation on the mechanism of this "targeting". Whether the MP possesses proteins or lipids necessary for interaction specifically with PAECs rather than PMVECs, or if the cell processes the interaction in a unique manner remains unknown. However, these are some of the first data to address MP effects using phenotypically distinct endothelium and to show differential responses. The implications of this work for PAH are that there are mechanisms inherent to circulating microparticles that influence the pulmonary artery, which do not stimulate the pulmonary microcirculation. A multitude of inflammatory factors have been reported to be increased in the circulation of PAH patients, but it has never been understood why the effects are only observed in specific vascular locations. MPs may contain the key to targeted vascular damage or even repair, however many studies will be necessary to answer these questions.

### Mechanisms underlying atheroma induction: the roles of mechanotransduction, vascular wall cells, and blood cells [^114fXdoh]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this article is to review cellular mechanism of atherosclerosis (AS) development. The pathogenesis of AS comprises a sequence of biological events leading to build up of a dense or loose atheromatous plaque (AP).

Methods

In this review, we tried to attempt to analyze the cellular mechanisms underlying AS development, including the roles of monocytes/macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the formation of stable/unstable APs.

Results

As a rule, APs are formed in the regions with irregular blood flow; both mechanical perturbations of the vascular wall and several biological events contribute to plaque formation. Blood lipid/lipoprotein deposition, recruitment of monocytes/macrophages, foam cell formation, migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, secretion of extracellular matrix, and formation of the connective tissue in plaques are among the latter events.

Conclusions

The review briefs the contributions of different processes to atheroma formation and describes the molecular mechanisms involved in AS development. AP transcriptome studies will be helpful in the identification of the key genes involved in atheroma transformation and development as well as discovery of the new targets for diagnosis and therapy.

### Meningeal lymphatics clear erythrocytes that arise from subarachnoid hemorrhage [^111MKBWC]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

As estimated by Global Burden of Diseases (GBD 2016), stroke is the second leading cause of death. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) contributes to only 5% of the cases of stroke, but it occurs at a fairly young age and is associated with a high degree of mortality (in the range of 50%). Thus SAH is a large burden on society. The progression of SAH includes early brain injury that appears the first 3 days after injury, followed by delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) 3–4 days after injury, which reaches the highest incidence and severity 6–8 days after SAH. As vasospasm, microthrombosis, and neuroinflammation contribute greatly to the DCI and clinical prognosis, pharmacological approaches to treat this pathology have been focused on preventing vasospasm, microclot formation, and anti-inflammation for decades; however, to date, few agents have been found to exert beneficial effects on patient outcomes. The pathologies of SAH are caused by the extravasated blood presenting in the subarachnoid space (SAS). Thus a better understanding of extravasated blood clearance may help in the development of effective therapeutic approaches. When a SAH attack occurs, blood releases into the SAS, leading immediately to clot formation, which disappear within 2–3 days. To date, clot lysis and phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils were considered as ways to clear the extravasated blood and the subsequent clots in the SAS. However, the mechanism(s) by which extravasated blood is cleared is still unclear.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS: a narrative review from molecular to organ-level perspectives [^111ogxxg]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Cellular War: endothelial and epithelial cells under siege

Endothelial cell disruption: Breakdown of the permeability barrier

Endothelial cells (ECs) form the fundamental architecture of the vascular lining, playing a vital role in maintaining blood vessel integrity and permeability. The extensive network of ECs in the lungs forms an essential interface that supports the complex process of gas exchange and ensures the efficient delivery of oxygen throughout the body. In ARDS, EC injury and dysfunction are crucial in compromising the alveolar-capillary barrier, resulting in severe pathological consequences.

ECs may undergo an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process during which they lose their endothelial identity and acquire mesenchymal traits, leading to increased vascular reactivity, decreased permeability, and promoted fibrosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress, combined with immune cell attacks, can induce apoptosis and necrosis in ECs, further increasing vascular permeability. This cascade results in the leakage of plasma proteins and fluids, ultimately manifesting as pulmonary edema, a condition that exacerbates lung inflammation and tissue damage by facilitating the migration of inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators. Clinical observational study has identified elevated circulating EC counts in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, correlating strongly with disease severity and poor clinical prognosis ​. Restoring mitochondrial function and reinforcing barrier integrity in ECs are emerging as promising therapeutic strategies to combat ARDS.

Struggle of epithelial cells: the fall of the alveolar barrier

Epithelial cells are indispensable components of the alveolar walls, forming a delicate air-blood barrier essential for maintaining alveolar integrity, regulating gas exchange, and defending against external pathogens. Type I alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-I) cover approximately 95% of the alveolar surface, serving a primary role in gas exchange. These cells are connected to adjacent cells via tight and adherens junctions, forming a continuous and effective barrier. Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC-II) secrete surfactant to reduce alveolar surface tension and possess stem cell properties, enabling them to differentiate into AEC-I, thus contributing to alveolar repair and lung regeneration.

Oxidative stress and cytokine storms induce apoptosis and necrosis in epithelial cells, compromising barrier function and resulting in fluid accumulation within the alveoli and the subsequent development of pulmonary edema. Experimental evidence suggests that mitigating epithelial cell apoptosis may improve the clinical course of ARDS. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their ability to promote epithelial cell regeneration, show potential as a therapeutic intervention for ARDS.

### Hereditary stomatocytosis: an underdiagnosed condition [^115tm7ps]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary stomatocytoses are a wide class of hemolytic anemias characterized by alterations of ionic flux with increased cation permeability that results in inappropriate shrinkage or swelling of the erythrocytes, and water lost or gained osmotically. The last few years have been crucial for new acquisitions in this field in terms of identifying new causative genes and of studying their pathogenetic mechanisms. This review summarizes the main features of erythrocyte membrane transport diseases, dividing them into forms with either isolated erythroid phenotype (nonsyndromic) or extra-hematological manifestations (syndromic), and focusing particularly on the most recent advances regarding dehydrated forms of hereditary stomatocytosis and familial pseudohyperkalemia.

### Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization: mechanisms, models, and therapeutic strategies [^1115Ft1U]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Understanding the pathophysiology of atherogenesis and the progression of atherosclerosis have been major goals of cardiovascular research during the previous decades. However, the complex molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying plaque destabilization remain largely obscure. Here, we review how lesional cells undergo cell death and how failed clearance exacerbates necrotic core formation. Advanced atherosclerotic lesions are further weakened by the pronounced local activity of matrix-degrading proteases as well as immature neovessels sprouting into the lesion. To stimulate translation of the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms of plaque destabilization into clinical studies, we further summarize available animal models of plaque destabilization. Based on the molecular mechanisms leading to plaque instability, we outline the current status of clinical and preclinical trials to induce plaque stability with a focus on induction of dead cell clearance, inhibition of protease activity, and dampening of inflammatory cell recruitment.

### Microparticles, malignancy and thrombosis [^116B2tbE]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Microparticles (MPs) are considered to be important biological effectors of several different physiological and pathological processes. There is increasing evidence of their role in haemostasis and thrombosis, and also of their importance in cancer cell survival, invasiveness and metastasis. The level of circulating MPs has been assessed in many different disease states, and there are reports that patients with malignancy and patients with thrombosis have increased levels of circulating MPs and MP-dependent thrombogenic potential. Research into the function and effect of MPs is currently hampered by a lack of standardization in the methods used to identify and quantify them. As these methods improve it is likely that MP assays will be of use both diagnostically and therapeutically in the future.

### Disc hemorrhages are associated with localized three-dimensional neuroretinal rim thickness progression in open-angle glaucoma [^116nmXXk]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Taken all together, our data support the hypothesis that DHs represent indicators of ongoing glaucoma progression rather than being discrete events that cause subsequent progression. Current theories on the underlying pathophysiology of DHs fall into 2 camps: the vascular theory and the mechanical theory. According to the vascular theory, the primary cause of a DH is a microinfarction within the optic nerve head, whereby primary vascular dysregulation leads an increase in circulating levels of endothelin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and loss of the barrier function of the endothelial cells, resulting in extravasation of red blood cells and a DH. According to this theory, the primary cause of a DH is the underlying vascular insufficiency. The mechanical theory states that DHs result from mechanical disruption of the blood vessels in the optic nerve head from posterior bowing and glaucomatous remodeling of the lamina cribrosa. In addition, capillaries may also be mechanically disrupted through the process of proliferative reactive gliosis in response to glaucoma damage, in which the formation of a fibrous glial scar disrupts the capillary wall and leads to a DH. Our finding that significant optic nerve damage precedes DH occurrence is in agreement with the latter, mechanical theory of DH etiology, whereby ongoing glaucoma damage causes the DH and not the other way around.

### Pathogenic mechanisms in thalassemia I: ineffective erythropoiesis and hypercoagulability [^114cgezr]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Erythropoiesis is the physiological process that results in the production of red blood cells (RBCs). In conditions of pathologically altered erythropoiesis or ineffective erythropoiesis, as in the case of β-thalassemia, the reduced ability of erythrocytes to differentiate, survive and deliver oxygen stimulates a state of stress that leads to the ineffective production of RBCs. We herein describe the main features of erythropoiesis and its regulation in addition to the mechanisms behind ineffective erythropoiesis development in β-thalassemia. Finally, we review the pathophysiology of hypercoagulability and vascular disease development in β-thalassemia and the currently available prevention and treatment modalities.

### Cytoskeletal-based mechanisms differently regulateandproplatelet formation [^113HWtwQ]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood platelets are key elements of hemostasis for the prevention of bleeding and are produced by a unique mechanism. They arise from megakaryocytes (MK), specialized cells in the bone marrow. Upon differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors, MKs undergo endomitosis, leading to a giant cell, whose cytoplasm is filled by a highly developed intracellular membrane network called the demarcation membrane system (DMS). At a mature stage, MK lie adjacent to the bone marrow sinusoid vessels and initiate cytoplasmic protrusion through the vessel wall. These protrusions further elongate inside the blood circulation, attached to their mother cells. These extensions are named proplatelets (PPT) and are fueled by the DMS that acts as a membrane reservoir to allow PPT growth. Once inside the blood stream, PPT are released into the circulation as large fragments that have been proposed to further remodel in downstream organs to release bona fide platelets, small anucleated MK fragments having a discoid shape.

The first PPT term was proposed following in situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of "long intrasinusoidal "proplatelet" processes which originate from the cell body of extravascularly located megakaryocytes". Later on, in vivo observations by time lapse imaging in living animal confirmed the morphology of PPT as elongated protrusions in wild-type (WT) mice under physiological conditions. The same denomination was also given to the cytoplasmic MK extensions in culture or in bone marrow explants. Yet, the morphology of PPT observed in vitro strongly differs from that observed in situ/in vivo. Early in vitro observations of marrow explants, and later of progenitor-differentiated MK in culture, similarly recorded PPT presenting branched thin shafts (1–4 mm in diameter) leading to an entanglement of PPT surrounding the MK body. These morphological differences between these two types of MK extensions raise the possibility that the mechanisms at stake could as well differ between in vitro cultured PPT (hereafter referred as cPPT) and in vivo generated native PPTs (referred as nPPT).

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^116fY6Un]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

The contributions of cells, plasma proteins, vascular wall, and flow dynamics are familiar building blocks for hemostasis. The numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) may be low due to deficiency in hematopoiesis (bone marrow failure), major bleeds, or cellular destruction because of membrane abnormalities (sickle cell trait or hemoglobinopathies, antibodies or malaria, or other pathogens and hemolysis associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with a thrombotic tendency). However, the most common reason for anemia is iron deficiency, either due to poor absorption of iron or loss of RBCs due to subtle bleeding, impairing oxygen delivery. All these disorders lead to coagulation abnormalities, which need special and proactive attention. Here, we will focus mostly on disorders with decreased RBC numbers from the point of view of hemorheology, bleeding tendency, and complications. After discussing the critical mechanisms of hemorheology, we will identify the most important disorders where anemia should be under active evaluation to be managed if possible (Figure 1). Finally, we will return to the bench for other valuable RBC-associated functional properties, including clot contraction and RBC microvesicles, to be further considered in clinics as well.

### Microparticles in sickle cell anaemia: promise and pitfalls [^113rmSmG]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Blood from patients with sickle cell disease contains microparticles (MP) derived from multiple cell sources, including red cells, platelets, monocytes and endothelial cells. MPs are of great interest because of their disease associations, their status as promising biomarkers, and the intercellular communications they mediate. To illustrate the likelihood of their relevance in sickle cell disease, we discuss the nature of MP, their profiling in sickle disease, some caveats relevant to their detection, their roles in supporting coagulation and the disparate influences they may exert upon the pathobiology of sickle cell disease.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115yg8ZB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular function mechanisms — key knowledge gaps include whether angiogenesis and/or capillary maintenance is necessary to preserve right ventricle (RV) function during remodeling and whether capillary rarefaction causes maladaptive remodeling; whether metabolic alterations are necessary for transition from adaptive to maladaptive RV remodeling and which changes should be targeted; whether apoptosis and other forms of cellular death are necessary for this transition; whether myocardial inflammation and oxidative stress are causes or consequences of right ventricular failure (RVF); the roles of circulating and resident progenitor cells in modulating hypertrophy, angiogenesis, fibrosis, metabolism, cell death, inflammation, oxidative stress, and contractile signaling; how established and novel pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapies modulate these pathways; and whether short-term detrimental effects on RV contractile function with neurohormonal modulators are offset by long-term beneficial effects.

### Understanding the mechanisms of senile osteoporosis: new facts for a major geriatric syndrome [^114FuEU1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis in older adults has significantly advanced in recent years. There is an acute loss of bone mineral density in the peri-menopausal period, followed by a more gradual and progressive decline, which is also seen in men. Markedly increased bone resorption leads to the initial fall in bone mineral density. With increasing age, there is also a significant reduction in bone formation. This is mostly due to a shift from osteoblastogenesis to predominant adipogenesis in the bone marrow. This study reviews new evidence on the pathophysiology of senile osteoporosis, with emphasis upon the mechanism of action of current osteoporosis treatments. New potential treatments are also considered, including therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis in elderly people that focus on the pathophysiology and potential reversal of the adipogenic shift in bone.

### Spatial microstimuli in endothelial mechanosignaling [^115A1NAN]. Circulation Research (2003). Low credibility.

Descriptive and quantitative analyses of microstimuli in living endothelial cells strongly support an integrated mechanism of mechanotransduction regulated by the spatial organization of multiple structural and signaling networks. Endothelial responses to blood flow are regulated at multiple levels of organization extending over scales from vascular beds to single cells, subcellular structures, and individual molecules. Microstimuli at the cellular and subcellular levels exhibit temporal and spatial complexities that are increasingly accessible to measurement. We address the cell and subcellular physical interface between flow-related forces and biomechanical responses of the endothelial cell. Live cell imaging and computational analyses of structural dynamics, two important approaches to microstimulation at this scale, are briefly reviewed.

### Subcellular analysis of blood-brain barrier function by micro-impalement of vessels in acute brain slices [^115TTbnK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is now understood that the BBB is not just a constant filter for specific molecules entering and leaving the brain parenchyma but that transport is regulated in a very dynamic manner, depending on the biological states of the body: it is bidirectionally linked to neuronal activity, stress, sleep, changes of nutrition and it is coupled to the immune system. Therefore, it is not surprising that disease-associated changes of the BBB are receiving increasingly more attention and causal roles of BBB alterations have, for example, been suggested for Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Coupling of transport and BBB permeability to body states and systems-level functions is likely based on blood-borne signaling.

While significant progress on this topic has been made in recent years –, a number of major questions regarding this dynamic regulation of the BBB and the specific facilitation of the passage of some molecules versus others are still mainly unresolved: a) What are the key molecules and pathways essential for the dynamic and pathological alterations of the BBB?, b) how and when are immune cells recruited across the BBB, c) do ECs and BBB properties differ between brain regions and across the smaller vessels between arterioles, venules and capillaries, d) which pattern of neuronal activity influences the transport and permeability of the BBB, e) conversely, how does the regulated transport of metabolites and neuroactive molecules at the BBB influence the activity of neurons in health and disease?

### Vascular stem cells in diabetic complications: evidence for a role in the pathogenesis and the therapeutic promise [^111TyiLf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Long standing diabetes leads to structural and functional alterations in both the micro- and the macro-vasculature. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are the primary target of the hyperglycemia-induced adverse effects. Vascular stem cells that give rise to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) represent an attractive target for cell therapy for diabetic patients. A number of studies have reported EPC dysfunction as a novel participant in the culmination of the diabetic complications. The controversy behind the identity of EPCs and the similarity between these progenitor cells to hematopoietic cells has led to conflicting results. MPCs, on the other hand, have not been examined for a potential role in the pathogenesis of the complications. These multipotent cells, however, do show a therapeutic role. In this article, we summarize the vascular changes that occur in diabetic complications highlighting some of the common features, the key findings that illustrate an important role of vascular stem cells (VSCs) in the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications, and provide mechanisms by which these cells can be used for therapy.

### Spatial and temporal dynamics of the endothelium [^112oAMRX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

The endothelium is a highly metabolically active organ that is involved in many physiological processes, including the control of vasomotor tone, barrier function, leukocyte adhesion and trafficking, inflammation, and hemostasis. Endothelial cell phenotypes are differentially regulated in space and time. Endothelial cell heterogeneity has important implications for developing strategies in basic research, diagnostics and therapeutics. The goals of this review are to: (i) consider mechanisms of endothelial cell heterogeneity; (ii) discuss the bench-to-bedside gap in endothelial biomedicine; (iii) revisit definitions for endothelial cell activation and dysfunction; and (iv) propose new goals in diagnosis and therapy. Finally, these themes will be applied to an understanding of vascular bed-specific hemostasis.

### Strategies targeting cAMP signaling in the treatment of polycystic kidney disease [^111D8deG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a leading cause of ESRD worldwide. In PKD, excessive cell proliferation and fluid secretion, pathogenic interactions of mutated epithelial cells with an abnormal extracellular matrix and alternatively activated interstitial macrophages, and the disruption of mechanisms controlling tubular diameter contribute to cyst formation. Studies with animal models suggest that several diverse pathophysiologic mechanisms, including dysregulation of intracellular calcium levels and cAMP signaling, mediate these cystogenic mechanisms. This article reviews the evidence implicating calcium and cAMP as central players in a network of signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of PKD and considers the therapeutic relevance of treatment strategies targeting cAMP signaling.

### Microvascular function measurement in mice: from large to small [^116EUvC4]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a growing body of interest in cardiac microvascular function because it plays an important role in various cardiac disease conditions. Therefore, efforts have been made to develop non-invasive techniques to measure microvascular function. In this issue of the journal, Guerraty et al developed a micro-SPECT-based approach to assess microvascular function in in vivo mice. They applied two independent approaches to measure microvascular function: (1) myocardial blood flow measurement using 99m Tc-sestamibi as a flow tracer and (2) intramyocardial blood volume measurement using 99m Tc-red blood cells. Although there are issues to be addressed, they provided an important framework for non-invasive assessment of microvascular function in mice, where a number of disease models are readily available. Thus, their approaches are encouraging for facilitating better understanding of pathophysiology underlying microvascular disease models, and thereby the development of therapeutic options in future.

### Pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension [^1135uPSZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is estimated to affect 7% to 10% of all pregnancies in the United States. Despite being the leading cause of maternal death and a major contributor of maternal and perinatal morbidity, the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of PIH have not yet been fully elucidated. Studies during the past decade, however, have provided a better understanding of the potential mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of PIH. The initiating event in PIH appears to be reduced uteroplacental perfusion as a result of abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of spiral arterioles. Placental ischemia is thought to lead to widespread activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium that results in enhanced formation of endothelin and thromboxane, increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II, and decreased formation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The quantitative importance of the various endothelial and humoral factors in mediating the reduction in renal hemodynamic and excretory function and elevation in arterial pressure during PIH is still unclear. Investigators are also attempting to elucidate the placental factors that are responsible for mediating activation/dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium. Microarray analysis of genes within the ischemic placenta should provide new insights into the link between placental ischemia and hypertension. More effective strategies for the prevention of preeclampsia should be forthcoming once the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that are involved in PIH are completely understood.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes [^113A8YNs]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by hemopoietic insufficiency associated with cytopenias leading to serious morbidity plus the additional risk of leukemic transformation. Therapeutic dilemmas exist in MDS because of the disease's multifactorial pathogenetic features, heterogeneous stages, and the patients' generally elderly ages. Underlying the cytopenias and evolutionary potential in MDS are innate stem cell lesions, cellular/cytokine-mediated stromal defects, and immunologic derangements. This article reviews the developing understanding of biologic and molecular lesions in MDS and recently available biospecific drugs that are potentially capable of abrogating these abnormalities. Dr. Peter Greenberg's discussion centers on decision-making approaches for these therapeutic options, considering the patient's clinical factors and risk-based prognostic category. One mechanism underlying the marrow failure present in a portion of MDS patients is immunologic attack on the hemopoietic stem cells. Considerable overlap exists between aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and subsets of MDS. Common or intersecting pathophysiologic mechanisms appear to underlie hemopoietic cell destruction and genetic instability, which are characteristic of these diseases. Treatment results and new therapeutic strategies using immune modulation, as well as the role of the immune system in possible mechanisms responsible for genetic instability in MDS, will be the subject of discussion by Dr. Neal Young. A common morphological change found within MDS marrow cells, most sensitively demonstrated by electron microscopy, is the presence of ringed sideroblasts. Such assessment shows that this abnormal mitochondrial iron accumulation is not confined to the refractory anemia with ring sideroblast (RARS) subtype of MDS and may also contribute to numerous underlying MDS pathophysiological processes. Generation of abnormal sideroblast formation appears to be due to malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, attributable to mutations of mitochondrial DNA, to which aged individuals are most vulnerable. Such dysfunction leads to accumulation of toxic ferric iron in the mitochondrial matrix. Understanding the broad biologic consequences of these derangements is the focus of the discussion by Dr. Norbert Gattermann.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^111HSTLj]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our results also provide new insights into the pathophysiology and vesiculation process in HS. Suggested mechanisms for membrane shedding by RBCs are related to clustering of membrane proteins driving curvature generation, and to the balance between membrane bending and stretching of the spectrin cytoskeleton –. The weaker linkage of the membrane with the underlying cytoskeleton in HS likely causes loss of organization in the membrane. This is supported by the observation that diffusion of membrane proteins is faster in RBCs from patients with HS. We speculate that loss of organization of the membrane gives room to accumulation of specific membrane proteins that lower the bending modulus locally and hence the energy barrier for vesicle formation. This would be consistent with the observation that the bending modulus of spherocytic red blood cells is not decreased, and in this way, the loss of membrane linkage could lead to the reported increase in vesiculation in HS patients. Ultimately, such increased vesiculation is the primary reason of the rounding and stiffening of HS RBCs, resulting in RBC clearance from the circulation and hemolytic anemia.

To conclude, we have presented an innovative approach to characterize the structural and material properties of extracellular vesicles. Surprisingly, the material properties of RBC EVs from healthy donors are similar to that of fluid liposomes. In contrast, the EVs from hereditary spherocytosis patients are significantly softer. This suggests a neutral effect for (membrane) proteins in donor EVs, whereas the different protein composition of patient EVs results in a lower bending modulus. The low rigidity of patient EVs fits with the augmented stiffness of HS patient RBCs and their increased vesiculation. Our approach has shed novel light on EV structure from healthy individuals as well as from HS patients, and is expected to be applied for the characterization and development of a variety of natural EVs and EV-based approaches in nanotechnology and nanomedicine.

### Review of research on pulmonary cysts in Sjögren's syndrome [^116torbM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms underlying the formation of pulmonary cysts in sjögren's syndrome

The precise mechanisms underlying the formation of pulmonary cysts have not been fully understood. The following conjectures have been proposed based on the pathophysiological processes observed in different diseases:

First, one of the most well-known mechanisms that cause pulmonary cysts is "check-valve obstruction". This involves obstructive bronchiectasis due to vascular occlusion or secondary bronchiole dilation caused by bronchiole compression from lymphoid tissue. Another potential mechanism involved in causing pulmonary cysts is local ischemia, where obstruction of the small capillaries supplying the terminal bronchioles leads to airway necrosis and ischemic dilation.

Current molecular mechanisms for cystic lesions include the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases, matrix-degrading enzymes, and flat foot proteins like D2–40, which induce lung tissue remodeling. In addition, genetic mutations, such as those involved in BHD, may contribute to cyst formation. However, these mechanisms do not fully explain the occurrence of thymic or parotid cysts associated with SS or HIV infection.

The formation of pulmonary cysts in SS may be associated with recurrent lung infections and weakening of bronchiole walls due to retroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or human herpesvirus. In addition, there is evidence indicating a potential association between the presence of anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen B (anti-SSB) antibody or anti-Sjögren's syndrome-related antigen A (anti-SSA) antibody in serum and the development of pulmonary cysts in patients with SS.

### Highly efficient platelet generation in lung vasculature reproduced by microfluidics [^1157YpUT]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Platelets, small hemostatic blood cells, are derived from megakaryocytes. Both bone marrow and lung are principal sites of thrombopoiesis although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Outside the body, however, our ability to generate large number of functional platelets is poor. Here we show that perfusion of megakaryocytes ex vivo through the mouse lung vasculature generates substantial platelet numbers, up to 3000 per megakaryocyte. Despite their large size, megakaryocytes are able repeatedly to passage through the lung vasculature, leading to enucleation and subsequent platelet generation intravascularly. Using ex vivo lung and an in vitro microfluidic chamber we determine how oxygenation, ventilation, healthy pulmonary endothelium and the microvascular structure support thrombopoiesis. We also show a critical role for the actin regulator Tropomyosin 4 in the final steps of platelet formation in lung vasculature. This work reveals the mechanisms of thrombopoiesis in lung vasculature and informs approaches to large-scale generation of platelets.

### Dietary fatty acids fine-tune piezo1 mechanical response [^114Rr7nc]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Mechanosensitive ion channels are membrane proteins that translate mechanical stimuli into electrical signals that lead to physiological responses. The Piezo1 mechanosensitive cation channel has been shown to mediate crucial physiological processes that include, but are not limited to, blood pressure regulation –, vascular architecture and remodeling, erythrocyte volume regulation, chondrocyte mechanotransduction, lineage choice in neural stem cells, and association of neurons with astrocytes. Piezo1 is important in mammals, as global knockouts are embryonic lethal in mice, and cell-specific knockouts result in animals with severe defects. Cells continuously facing mechanical cues such as shear and osmotic stress, stretch, and changes in substrate stiffness rely on the fast response (milliseconds) of Piezo1 to regulate cellular processes that occur on larger timescales (seconds to days). Consequently, Piezo1 gain- and loss-of-function mutants have been associated with several hereditary human pathophysiologies. For example, some mutations in Piezo1 are linked to inherited blood disorders (e.g. dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis –), in which the mutant channel displays slow inactivation, leading to an increase in cation permeability and subsequent dehydrated erythrocytes. To better understand Piezo1 role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, it is essential to determine the proteins and molecules that regulate its function.

6 Altered Autophagy as a Common Trait in Cell Trafficking Disorders

As aforementioned, a growing number of studies describe alterations in autophagy underlying the pathophysiology of different cell trafficking diseases, which we will briefly review through specific examples through this section. Due to our knowledge on autophagy modulation, studying the place it takes within cell trafficking disorders pathophysiology can potentially lead to the description of new therapeutic strategies.

6.1 Autophagy in Disorders of Membrane Trafficking

Autophagy is closely related with the processes of exo‐ and endocytosis, not only functionally but also at a structural level, with the orchestrated participation of several shared proteins and organelles. Therefore, it comes with no surprise the description of autophagy as part of the pathophysiology of membrane‐trafficking defects.

EXOCYTOSIS: The process of transport of a newly synthesized protein starts with the trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi System (GS). One of the coordinators of this transport is TANGO2, involved in ER‐GS transport and lipids metabolism. Pathogenic variants in TANGO2 (MIM #616878) lead to pathology with poor prognosis, characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and fasting‐precipitated rhabdomyolysis due to acute breakdown of skeletal myofibers. Besides the alterations in endomembrane trafficking, TANGO2‐patient myoblasts show reduced LC3II levels in starving conditions, suggesting an impairment in autophagy along with the trafficking defects.

Another example of the involvement of autophagy in the pathophysiology of exocytosis defects is TRAPPC11 deficiency (MIM #615356). TRAPPC11 is a protein involved in the earliest steps of ER‐GS transport, and mutations affecting its function are founders of a congenital defect of glycosylation characterized by muscular dystrophy. Even though its main function is related to membrane trafficking, it has been described that TRAPPC11 has a role upstream of autophagosome formation. Upon TRAPPC11 depletion, LC3‐positive membranes accumulate before and during starvation but fail to be cleared. Moreover, it has been described that TRAPPC11 recruits ATG2 and WIPI4, both of which are proteins directly related to the isolation of membranes necessary for autophagy. The involvement of autophagy in the pathophysiology of this disease outlines a potential therapeutic strategy.

### Pathophysiology of internal hemorrhoids [^114PFx4W]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a fairly common and debilitating clinical entity. Despite centuries' of attempts to shed light on its pathophysiology, to cure those affected and to improve sufferers' quality of life, many aspects of the disease remain elusive. Individual beliefs and historical legends, accompanied by undocumented theories, have established and perpetuated the confusion regarding the mechanisms leading to the development of the disease and the rules governing its treatment. Hemorrhoids are classified as internal or external and are viewed as a disease when they become symptomatic. Returning to basic medical sciences, this mini-review focuses on internal hemorrhoids and aims to define the histology and anatomy of the normal and abnormal internal hemorrhoidal plexus and to encourage clinicians to comprehend the pathophysiology of the disease. If doctors can understand the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease, they will be able to clarify the nature of the associated symptoms and complications and to make the correct therapeutic decision.

### Pathophysiological analyses of leptomeningeal heterotopia using gyrencephalic mammals [^115aADEW]. Human Molecular Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia (LGH) is a focal malformation of the cerebral cortex and frequently found in patients with thanatophoric dysplasia (TD). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying LGH formation are still largely unclear because of difficulties in obtaining brain samples from human TD patients. Recently, we established a new animal model for analysing cortical malformations of human TD by utilizing our genetic manipulation technique for gyrencephalic carnivore ferrets. Here we investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the formation of LGH using our TD ferrets. We found that LGH was formed during corticogenesis in TD ferrets. Interestingly, we rarely found Ki-67-positive and phospho-histone H3-positive cells in LGH, suggesting that LGH formation does not involve cell proliferation. We uncovered that vimentin-positive radial glial fibers and doublecortin-positive migrating neurons were accumulated in LGH. This result may indicate that preferential cell migration into LGH underlies LGH formation. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of LGH in TD.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

### Genetic mechanisms and modifying factors in hereditary hemochromatosis [^11511LB4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary iron overload is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. Several genetic mutations underlie the various forms of the disease, which have similar pathophysiological profiles but distinct clinical presentations. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb too much iron from the diet, which accumulates over time within parenchymal cells. This accumulation leads to eventual organ failure as a consequence of iron-mediated formation of free radicals. The mechanism underlying this excessive absorption of iron is a sensing defect caused by the reduced formation of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, as a consequence of mutations in the genes encoding several membrane-bound signaling molecules present on hepatocytes. A considerable number of carriers of these specific genetic mutations, however, do not develop iron overload, indicating that additional genetic and environmental factors modify the severity and clinical penetrance of disease. In affected patients, early initiation of treatment by phlebotomy can prevent organ damage. Genetic screening of first-degree relatives can be also used to identify individuals at risk. Our expanding knowledge of the regulation of iron metabolism and the role of factors that modify the severity of the disease may lead to the design of new and improved treatments.

### Red cell membrane disorders: structure meets function [^114Qx2xX]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

The mature red blood cell (RBC) lacks a nucleus and organelles characteristic of most cells, but it is elegantly structured to perform the essential function of delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from all other cells while enduring the shear stress imposed by navigating small vessels and sinusoids. Over the past several decades, the efforts of biochemists, cell and molecular biologists, and hematologists have provided an appreciation of the complexity of RBC membrane structure, while studies of the RBC membrane disorders have offered valuable insights into structure-function relationships. Within the last decade, advances in genetic testing and its increased availability have made it possible to substantially build upon this foundational knowledge. Although disorders of the RBC membrane due to altered structural organization or altered transport function are heterogeneous, they often present with common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia. However, they may require substantially different management depending on the underlying pathophysiology. Accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid emergence of complications or inappropriate interventions. We propose an algorithm for laboratory evaluation of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia with a focus on RBC membrane disorders. Here, we review the genotypic and phenotypic variability of the RBC membrane disorders in order to raise the index of suspicion and highlight the need for correct and timely diagnosis.

### Two further British families with the 'cryohydrocytosis' form of hereditary stomatocytosis [^112vZoKm]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

We describe two families with the 'cryohydrocytosis' form of stomatocytosis. Both show a mild stomatocytic anaemia with Hb levels of 12–16 g/dl and reticulocyte counts of 4.3–24%, with very marked autohaemolysis at refrigerator temperatures and pseudohyperkalaemia as a result of loss of K from red cells on storage at room temperature. The ouabain + bumetanide-insensitive 'passive leak' K influx showed a 'U'-shaped temperature dependence, with a minimum at 23 degrees C. In one family, there was consistent variation in haematological severity within the pedigree. In the other, the parents of the proposita were normal, but all three of her children were affected, consistent with a new mutation of a dominant condition. Cold storage of the red cells led to a very marked increase in osmotic fragility and macrospherocytosis, explaining why a diagnosis of 'hereditary spherocytosis' can easily be reached in these pedigrees.

### Vigilance or subversion? Constitutive and inducible M cells in mucosal tissues [^116dssHi]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Microfold (M) cells are epithelial cells present in mucosal tissues and specialized for the capture of luminal microparticles and their delivery to underlying immune cells; thus, they are crucial participants in mucosal immune surveillance. Multiple phenotypic subsets of M cells have now been described, all sharing a unique apical morphology that provides clues to their ability to capture microbial particles. The existence of diverse M cell phenotypes, especially inflammation-inducible M cells, provides an intriguing puzzle: some variants may augment luminal surveillance to boost mucosal immunity, while others may promote microbial access to tissues. Here, I consider the unique induction requirements of each M cell subset and functional differences, highlighting the potentially distinct consequences in mucosal immunity.

### Relation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with microvascular injury and clinical outcome in revascularized ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1157FGno]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology Between LDL Cholesterol and MVI

The pathophysiological processes leading to MVI in STEMI are sophisticated and not completely elucidated so far. 9 Hypercholesterolemia has been previously discussed as 1 acquired factor potentially increasing individual susceptibility for MVI. 9 Indeed, in this CMR study, we could demonstrate, for the first time, an association between serum hypercholesterolemia and MVI in the clinical setting of acute STEMI. Earlier data of optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound studies may provide a morphological explanation for the relation of LDL with MVI. 24 Soeda et al showed that lipid‐rich plaques, defined by greater lipid index and maximal lipid arc, were associated with higher rates of no‐reflow. 24 The underlying pathophysiological pathways of LDL‐induced plaque formation have been elucidated to a high degree 25; however, the subsequent mechanisms linking lipid‐rich plaques with MVI are largely unclear. One mechanism potentially explaining this relation might be the increased local thrombogenicity. 24 There is good evidence that the lipid core of atherosclerotic plaques provide highest thrombogenicity 3, 24, 26; therefore, a higher lipid‐load could lead to a higher thrombus burden, which, in turn, would increase the risk of MVI‐inducing distal embolization. 27 Besides this aspect regarding thromogenicity, lipoproteins, especially LDL, were shown to cause inflammation as well as endothelial dysfunction, 28 2 major mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ischemia‐reperfusion injury, highlighting another potential link between LDL and MVI. 9 This hypothesis is supported by data from animal studies, in which hypercholesterolemia was shown to aggravate reperfusion injury by enhancing endothelial oxidative stress. 6 Because we could not detect a correlation between LDL and systemic inflammatory response evaluated by hs‐CRP concentration, it may be hypothesized that such inflammatory processes of reperfusion injury primarily remain local phenomena in STEMI patients. Taken together, evidence exists that LDL could augment MVI through both mechanisms distal embolization and reperfusion injury; however, the exact underlying processes as well as their pro rata contributions remain to be further elucidated.

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) — pathophysiology: NIHF can arise from increased right heart pressure with increased central venous pressure, obstruction of venous or arterial blood flow, inadequate diastolic ventricular filling, hepatic venous congestion leading to decreased hepatic function and hypoalbuminemia, increased capillary permeability, anemia leading to high output cardiac failure and extramedullary hematopoiesis with resultant hepatic dysfunction, lymphatic vessel dysplasia and obstruction, and reduced osmotic pressure; the precise pathogenesis depends on the underlying disorder and in many cases remains unclear.

### Thalassaemia [^114JCwib]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Inherited haemoglobin disorders, including thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide. Several clinical forms of α-thalassaemia and β-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of β-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.

### Clinical characteristics and outcome of critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury: a single centre cohort study [^115aKKms]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanism of AKI in COVID-19 remains elusive, it appears to be multifactorial. Direct viral infection, overt immune response leading to tubuloepithelial injury and microvascular endothelial injury due to microthrombi formation are some of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms postulated. The contribution of microthrombi formation in AKI has been found in postmortem findings, where there is erythrocyte stagnation with clot formation in the glomerular and peri-tubular capillaries in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, one study demonstrated that elevated D-Dimer level and complete failure of lysis at 30 min on a thromboelastogram are predictive of significant increase in the incidence of thromboembolism and a need for haemodialysis in critically ill COVID-19 patients. In our report, the development of AKI was associated with raised admission D-dimer levels and these abnormalities persisted in patients with AKI even after a week of ICU admission. This supports the fore-mentioned studies and highlights this maybe a potential contributor to the underlying pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 cases.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Neutrophils in the initiation and resolution of acute pulmonary inflammation: understanding biological function and therapeutic potential [^115Gnc4X]. The Journal of Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Neutrophil recruitment and function

The recruitment of neutrophils to the lung makes them a key factor in the pathogenesis of ARDS. In response to inflammatory mediators, either originating from the lung or distant organ injury, circulating neutrophils become primed and alter their cytoskeletal architecture with retention in the pulmonary capillary bed. They then migrate out of postcapillary venules across the endothelium, through the interstitium and epithelium and into alveoli, with associated local tissue dysfunction and destruction due to release of histotoxic mediators, such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases (Figure 1). This induction of epithelial and endothelial injury contributes to the development of alveolar oedema and hypoxaemia, as well as exacerbating the pro‐inflammatory state. It should be recognised that neutrophil migration into the lung without concomitant activation does not induce tissue injury 13. However, there are conflicting models with regards to the mechanisms by which initial neutrophil activation occurs. It has been proposed that activation of the intravascular immune system, through an increase in circulating pro‐inflammatory mediators, results in neutrophil priming, adhesion and/or trapping in lung capillaries. Subsequent migration along a variety of chemotactic gradients into the lung parenchyma therefore results in secondary lung injury 20. The alternative hypothesis is that the release of pro‐inflammatory mediators by alveolar macrophages plays a vital role in the initiation of inflammation 21, triggering an inflammatory cascade by activating surrounding tissues and resulting in chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, to the airways 21. It is likely that the exact mode of initial neutrophil recruitment and activation varies depending on the inciting stimulus and whether this is intrapulmonary or systemic. However, the end result in both cases is the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung, resulting in tissue injury.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2024 update [^112qurA6]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society frostbite pathophysiology — Frostbite is a freezing injury with 4 overlapping phases: prefreeze, freeze-thaw, vascular stasis, and late ischemic; the prefreeze phase has tissue cooling with vasoconstriction and ischemia without ice crystal formation and permanent damage does not occur if cooling stops at this stage; the freeze-thaw phase forms intracellular or extracellular ice crystals causing protein and lipid derangement, cellular electrolyte shifts, cellular dehydration, cell membrane lysis, and cell death; the vascular stasis phase features fluctuating constriction and dilation with blood leaking or coagulating; the late ischemic phase reflects progressive ischemia and infarction with inflammatory mediators and emboli, where destruction of the microcirculation is the main factor leading to cell death and refreezing after thawing makes injury worse.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of mast cells in atherosclerotic plaque progression and destabilization [^115qNZjf]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neutrophils, Monocytes, Macrophages, and Foam Cells

Plaque-residing MCs have been reported to have a role in recruitment of other inflammatory cells to the cite. MCs degranulate after being activated by ROS released by the extravasated neutrophils. MCs then induce the recruitment of neutrophils and T cells by releasing TNF. Moreover, MC-released MCP-1 induces the recruitment of monocytes which later may develop in macrophage or foam cells and aggravate atherosclerosis.

Studies of the cellular architecture of atherosclerotic plaques showed a correlation between (a) the number of MCs with the percentage of the plaque area populated with macrophages (r = 0.156, P = 0.011) and (b) the number of degranulating MCs and the percentage of plaque residing macrophages (r = 0.310, P = 0.002). MC activation may contribute to the formation of foam cells. In line with this the term "granule-mediated uptake of LDL" was already introduced to picture how IgE-dependent MC activation results in the release of mediators that boost the macrophage LDL uptake. Granule-mediated uptake of LDL is defined as a process in which MC granules placing a variety of MC mediators promote after being released bind to LDL and phagocytosed by macrophages. The uptake of mediator LDL by macrophages results in enhancing the extent of cholesteryl ester synthesis in these cells and thus accumulation of cholesteryl esters.

### Reverse migration of neutrophils: where, when, how, and why? [^1128VNgu]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Neutrophil migration to injured and pathogen-infected tissues is a fundamental component of innate immunity. An array of cellular and molecular events mediate this response to collectively guide neutrophils out of the vasculature and towards the core of the ensuing inflammatory reaction where they exert effector functions. Advances in imaging modalities have revealed that neutrophils can also exhibit motility away from sites of inflammation and injury, although it is unclear under what circumstances this reverse migration is a physiological protective response, and when it has pathophysiological relevance. Here we review different types of neutrophil reverse migration and discuss the current understanding of the associated mechanisms. In this context we propose clarifications to the existing terminology used to describe the many facets of neutrophil reverse migration.

### Peripheral spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis: are we dealing with semantics or clinically meaningful differences? [^112Sarwe]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

A disease can be defined by its phenotype or by its underlying pathophysiology; when considering the latter definition, different phenotypes may be the result of the same intrinsic cellular and molecular mechanisms. Therefore, bringing up the resemblance in the pathophysiology of pSpA and PsA sine psoriase adds to the cohesion of the SpA group.

Histopathology studies of synovial biopsies found that PsA, either oligoarticular or polyarticular, resembles that of other SpA subtypes (ankylosing spondylitis and undifferentiated SpA), whereas both groups can be differentiated from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) based on these same synovial features, confirming that peripheral synovitis in PsA belongs to the SpA concept. In all SpA subtypes, vascularity and neutrophil and CD163+ macrophage counts were greater. Whereas in RA, lining layer thickness and the number of CD83+ dendritic cells were greater. No significant differences were observed between PsA and other forms of SpA. PsA synovitis is characterised by a sublining infiltrate with T and B cells, vascular proliferation and a relative thin lining layer of proliferating intimal synoviocytes. PsA also associates with genetic polymorphisms involved in the interleukin (IL)-23–IL-17 signalling pathway. In fact, synovial fluid of PsA patients includes increased levels of CD4+, especially Th17 and CD8+. Frequencies of polyfunctional T-cells correlated with disease activity. Trauma or biochemical stress at tendon insertion leads to the production of IL-23, which activates Th17 cells and releases IL-22 and TNF, which leads to inflammation erosion and bone formation. IL-22 activates osteoblasts as well, leading to the formation of enthesophytes in peripheral entheses and joints. Inflammation in the synoviocytes, along with higher levels of TNF and IL-17, leads to activation of osteoclasts via RANKL expression which leads to bone resorption.

I. Pathophysiology of uterine fibroid (leiomyoma) formation and growth

Uterine fibroids are extremely common. More than half of women will develop uterine fibroids by the age of 50 years. Patients present with AUB or pressure symptoms such as pelvic discomfort and pain, constipation, or changes in urinary habits. Submucosal fibroids are also associated with infertility and early pregnancy loss.

Fibroids are benign uterine tumors characterized by disordered monoclonal proliferation of uterine smooth muscle cells embedded in an abundant extracellular matrix. One proposed mechanism of fibroid formation involves genetic and epigenetic changes in multipotent stem cells in the myometrium that lead to abnormal proliferation and differentiation. Physiological fluctuations in sex steroid levels with subsequent growth and involution of myometrial cells during the menstrual cycle make these stem cells vulnerable to mutations or epigenetic changes and fibroid formation. The genetic, epigenetic, molecular, and paracrine mechanisms underlying fibroid pathophysiology are highly diverse, which explains the observed variations in individual tumors' clinical behavior (growing, stable, or regressing) and response to medications.

Fibroid growth is hormone dependent, and the sex steroids estrogen and progesterone are important regulators of fibroid growth. Most fibroids decrease in size after menopause, whereas pregnancy can lead to an increase in the size of fibroids. Both systemic and local estrogen can stimulate fibroid growth, but local estrogen production through aromatase activity in fibroid tissue seems to play an important role in fibroid pathophysiology. Estrogen induces progesterone receptor expression and progesterone responsiveness of the tumor. Progesterone has been shown to be essential for fibroid growth in animal studies. Progesterone may regulate fibroid growth indirectly through its action on differentiated smooth muscle cells, which in turn secrete paracrine molecules that stimulate proliferation of multipotent stem cells.

### Postoperative adhesions in gynecologic surgery: a committee opinion [^115ycvSh]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Gynecologic postoperative adhesions — pathophysiology and healing timeline describe that peritoneal trauma produces blood, histamines, cytokines, growth factors, inflammation and increased vascular permeability leading to a fibrin exudate; with normal fibrinolytic activity there is breakdown of fibrinous exudate within 72 hours and normal healing, whereas decreased fibrinolytic activity results in fibrin deposition and capillary ingrowth with adhesion formation. Fibrinous exudates form within 3 hours after injury, and trauma-induced local suppression of peritoneal fibrinolysis leads to early fibrous adhesions followed by invasion of fibroblasts and blood vessels resulting in permanent adhesions.

### Deciphering the mechanism underlying late-onset Alzheimer disease [^112EGSAe]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite tremendous investments in understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer disease (AD), recent clinical trials have failed to show efficacy. A potential problem underlying these failures is the assumption that the molecular mechanism mediating the genetically determined form of the disease is identical to the one resulting in late-onset AD. Here, we integrate experimental evidence outside the 'spotlight' of the genetic drivers of amyloid-β (Aβ) generation published during the past two decades, and present a mechanistic explanation for the pathophysiological changes that characterize late-onset AD. We propose that chronic inflammatory conditions cause dysregulation of mechanisms to clear misfolded or damaged neuronal proteins that accumulate with age, and concomitantly lead to tau-associated impairments of axonal integrity and transport. Such changes have several neuropathological consequences: focal accumulation of mitochondria, resulting in metabolic impairments; induction of axonal swelling and leakage, followed by destabilization of synaptic contacts; deposition of amyloid precursor protein in swollen neurites, and generation of aggregation-prone peptides; further tau hyperphosphorylation, ultimately resulting in neurofibrillary tangle formation and neuronal death. The proposed sequence of events provides a link between Aβ and tau-related neuropathology, and underscores the concept that degenerating neurites represent a cause rather than a consequence of Aβ accumulation in late-onset AD.

### A narrative review of diabetic macroangiopathy: from molecular mechanism to therapeutic approaches [^11389PQA]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia

Persistent hyperglycemia is now acknowledged as a major contributor to T2DM vasculopathy development. When combined with other variables, hyperglycemia may hasten the onset of atherosclerosis (AS) in people with diabetes. In addition, hyperglycemia stimulates apoptosis, lowers endothelial cell (EC) replication, and hastens the progression of AS. The glycation of proteins and lipids in the arterial wall is the most important of these processes. Glucose-induced damage is caused by advanced glycation, PKC activation, and sorbitol accumulation. Early glycated proteins on collagen, intestinal tissues, and blood vessels undergo a series of chemical reactions that result in permanent AGEs (Fig. 1). AGEs possess a plethora of potentially hazardous chemical and biological features. They gradually build up with age and steadily accumulate. The phrase "AGE formation" refers to the biochemical attachment of glucose to the amino group of a protein that occurs without the intervention of an enzyme. This process produces a reversible material called a Schiff base, which can subsequently be rearranged to produce an Amadori product, the most well-known of which is hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Permanent AGE formation alters molecule structure, modifies enzyme activity, reduces the ability of proteins and lipids to degrade and recognize receptors, and interferes with normal protein and lipid function. Plasma glucose levels and the degree of non-enzymatic glycation are significantly associated, highlighting the importance of monitoring HbA1c as a useful adjunct in diabetes treatment. AGEs generate oxidative stress, impair the function of the vascular barrier, enhance vascular permeability, and improve the adhesion of VCAM-1, a vascular cell adhesion molecule, by binding to AGE receptors (RAGE) on ECs. The expression of VCAM-1 on monocytes, which may enhance monocyte migration, may constitute one of the early steps of vascular remodeling. Previous studies have revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a specific type of stem cell, are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Studies have shown that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with a decrease in the number and function of circulating and tissue-resident stem/progenitor cells including MSCs. This suggests that the macrovascular complications of diabetes may be partly attributed to a stem cell vasculopathy, where the impaired stem cell compartment fails to regenerate dying endothelial or vascular smooth muscles. In T2DM, the reduction of vascular stem cells is directly related to the glycemic level, and this reduction is also observed in individuals with impaired glucose regulation. However, it is unclear whether the decrease or dysfunction of stem cells is a direct consequence of glucose level disturbances, and to what extent the hyperglycemia contributes to this mechanism.

### Endothelial cells, fibroblasts and vasculitis [^1156NGSK]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

One of the most important questions in vasculitis research is not why inflammation of blood vessels occurs but why it persists, often in a site-specific manner. In this review we illustrate how stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and pericytes, might play an important role in regulating the site at which vasculitis occurs. Smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts directly influence the behaviour of overlying vascular cells, amplifying the response of the endothelium to proinflammatory agents such as TNF-alpha and allowing enhanced and inappropriate leucocyte recruitment. An abnormal local vascular stromal environment can therefore influence local endothelial function and drive the persistence of local vascular inflammation. However, such local vascular inflammation can have distant effects on the systemic vascular system, leading to widespread endothelial cell dysfunction. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is common in a range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, is seen in multiple vascular beds, and is reversible following the induction of disease remission. The mechanisms that drive such systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction are unclear but factors such as TNF-alpha and CRP may play a role. Persistence of such widespread endothelial dysfunction in systemic vasculitis appears to have long-term consequences, leading to the acceleration of atherosclerosis and premature ischaemic heart disease. It may also underlie the accelerated atherosclerosis seen in other immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### Mechanisms underlying neutrophil-mediated monocyte recruitment [^113YVYVo]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Extravasation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the site of inflammation precedes a second wave of emigrating monocytes. That these events are causally connected has been established a long time ago. However, we are now just beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this cellular switch, which has become even more complex considering the emergence of monocyte subsets, which are affected differently by signals generated from PMNs. PMN granule proteins induce adhesion as well as emigration of inflammatory monocytes to the site of inflammation involving beta(2)-integrins and formyl-peptide receptors. Furthermore, modification of the chemokine network by PMNs and their granule proteins creates a milieu favoring extravasation of inflammatory monocytes. Finally, emigrated PMNs rapidly undergo apoptosis, leading to the discharge of lysophosphatidylcholine, which attracts monocytes via G2A receptors. The net effect of these mechanisms is the accumulation of inflammatory monocytes, thus promoting proinflammatory events, such as release of inflammation-sustaining cytokines and reactive oxygen species. As targeting PMNs without causing serious side effects seems futile, it may be more promising to aim at interfering with subsequent PMN-driven proinflammatory events.

### Sensing of red blood cells with decreased membrane deformability by the human spleen [^114iSbT4]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

The current paradigm in the pathogenesis of several hemolytic red blood cell disorders is that reduced cellular deformability is a key determinant of splenic sequestration of affected red cells. Three distinct features regulate cellular deformability: membrane deformability, surface area-to-volume ratio (cell sphericity), and cytoplasmic viscosity. By perfusing normal human spleens ex vivo, we had previously showed that red cells with increased sphericity are rapidly sequestered by the spleen. Here, we assessed the retention kinetics of red cells with decreased membrane deformability but without marked shape changes. A controlled decrease in membrane deformability (increased membrane rigidity) was induced by treating normal red cells with increasing concentrations of diamide. Following perfusion, diamide-treated red blood cells (RBCs) were rapidly retained in the spleen with a mean clearance half-time of 5.9 minutes (range, 4.0–13.0). Splenic clearance correlated positively with increased membrane rigidity (r = 0.93; P < .0001). To determine to what extent this increased retention was related to mechanical blockade in the spleen, diamide-treated red cells were filtered through microsphere layers that mimic the mechanical sensing of red cells by the spleen. Diamide-treated red cells were retained in the microsphilters (median, 7.5%; range, 0%-38.6%), although to a lesser extent compared with the spleen (median, 44.1%; range, 7.3%-64.0%; P < .0001). Taken together, these results have implications for understanding the sensitivity of the human spleen to sequester red cells with altered cellular deformability due to various cellular alterations and for explaining clinical heterogeneity of RBC membrane disorders.

### Mechanisms and consequences of endothelial cell senescence [^1132H54c]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Endothelial cells are located at the crucial interface between circulating blood and semi-solid tissues and have many important roles in maintaining systemic physiological function. The vascular endothelium is particularly susceptible to pathogenic stimuli that activate tumour suppressor pathways leading to cellular senescence. We now understand that senescent endothelial cells are highly active, secretory and pro-inflammatory, and have an aberrant morphological phenotype. Moreover, endothelial senescence has been identified as an important contributor to various cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In this Review, we discuss the consequences of endothelial cell exposure to damaging stimuli (haemodynamic forces and circulating and endothelial-derived factors) and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce endothelial cell senescence. We also discuss how endothelial cell senescence causes arterial dysfunction and contributes to clinical cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Finally, we summarize the latest evidence on the effect of eliminating senescent endothelial cells (senolysis) and identify important remaining questions to be addressed in future studies.

Diabetes-specific microvascular disease is a leading cause of blindness, renal failure and nerve damage, and diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis leads to increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and limb amputation. Four main molecular mechanisms have been implicated in glucose-mediated vascular damage. All seem to reflect a single hyperglycaemia-induced process of overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. This integrating paradigm provides a new conceptual framework for future research and drug discovery.

### Conjugated bilirubin triggers anemia by inducing erythrocyte death [^113nKvgZ]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Erythrocytes exhibit a simplified programmed cell death termed eryptosis. Eryptosis shares several key features with apoptosis of nucleated cells, such as cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer cell membrane. However, erythrocytes lack cell organelles participating in the machinery of apoptosis. Eryptosis contributes to anemia in several clinical disorders. In anemia caused by genetic mutations such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, erythrocytes may undergo accelerated suicidal death.–Furthermore, other diseases including intoxications or nutritional imbalance result in increased eryptosis and consequently anemia.

Eryptosis leads to rapid clearance of affected erythrocytes from circulating blood. PS receptors on macrophages may recognize PS on the outer cell membrane of apoptotic and eryptotic cells. The asymmetric organization of PS in the cell membrane is executed by flippases, which translocate PS to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. During cell stress, activation of scramblases and flippases can exteriorize PS, thus making apoptotic cells visible to macrophages. In erythrocytes, PS can be translocated during cell stress such as oxidative stress, hyperosmotic stress, and energy deprivation. Opening of a nonselective cation channel triggers rapid influx of Ca 2+, which leads to Ca 2+ -activated potassium efflux and subsequent cell shrinkage. Furthermore, Ca 2+ influx can induce a scramblase activity, which translocates PS from the inner to the outer cell membrane leaflet. During cell stress, erythrocytes may further activate sphingomyelinase, resulting in ceramide formation and scramblase activation. Various inhibitors can be used to prevent scramblase activation during eryptosis. Inhibition of the nonselective cation channel, the Ca 2+ -sensitive potassium channel or sphingomyelinase, counteracts death of erythrocytes. Furthermore, erythropoietin (EPO) can limit Ca 2+ entry through the nonselective cation channel and prevent the programmed cell death of erythrocytes. Thus, EPO not only stimulates the production of erythrocytes, but also enhances the life span of circulating erythrocytes. Taken together, several molecular mechanisms which can modulate eryptosis have been described.

In this investigation we report that high bilirubin levels present during liver disease were identified as critical triggers of suicidal erythrocyte death and anemia in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, this was linked to both Ca 2+ influx as well as sphingomyelinase activation.

### The fluid membrane determines mechanics of erythrocyte extracellular vesicles and is softened in hereditary spherocytosis [^113Cy7LQ]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

RBC vesiculation is also relevant in blood disorders, for example in hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS is one of the most common hereditary RBC disorders in the western world and is accompanied by increased release of EVs. This vesiculation is caused by a reduced linkage between the membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal spectrin network leading to loss of RBC membrane. Reduced membrane surface area results in the formation of spherocytes. Spherocytes are less deformable, which causes these cells to be retained and cleared by the spleen. However, the relation between this blood disorder and EV release is still poorly understood as we are lacking structural and mechanical insights into EVs properties of both donors and patients.

These structural and mechanical properties of EVs influence their behavior, such as their interactions with cells –. Therefore, there has been a strong interest in quantifying EV mechanical properties. At present, however, characterization of EVs is challenging due to their small size and a proper mechanical characterization of (RBC) EVs under physiological conditions has not yet been performed. Recently, we showed that the mechanics of small (< 200 nm) synthetic vesicles, i.e. liposomes, are accurately described by a quantitative model based on Canham-Helfrich theory –. However, the mechanical properties of natural vesicles will result from a combination of lipidic contributions as well as that of membrane proteins and intraluminal proteins. The presence of such proteins could lead to a nonzero shear modulus of the natural vesicles, which might therefore be better described as thin elastic shells, and hence potentially show typical behavior thereof, such as buckling. Moreover, thin shell behavior could be caused by spectrin structures, which is known to provide shear resistance to the RBC membrane –. A high percentage of the RBC membrane is occupied by membrane proteins (~20% at the hydrophobic core). The effect of these proteins on membrane mechanics is not entirely clear; nano-indentation studies with vesicles reconstructed from yeast membranes and influenza viruses both suggested that membrane proteins result in a large increase of the bending modulus of vesicles. On the other hand, studies with model membranes have mostly reported membrane softening due to the presence of short peptides in the membrane. Similar experimental studies with various larger membrane proteins showed either a neutral effect on membrane stiffness, or a decrease in the membrane stiffness. Recent simulations reconcile some of these results by reporting how integral membrane proteins can have diverse effects on membrane mechanics, either softening, neutral or stiffening.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^111wtzm3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio < 13 suggesting thalassemia. In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia. In this case, the patient's other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells. For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia. The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Red cell survival: relevance and mechanism involved [^111G8EQv]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Red blood cells (RBCs) often have a short circulating half-life in hemodialysis patients, which increases the difficulty of achieving a stable hemoglobin level. Fluctuations in erythropoietin (EPO) levels contribute to this increased RBC turnover because a decline in the level of EPO triggers the preferential destruction of newly-formed RBC, a process termed neocytolysis. The RBCs that are released during the treatment of renal anemia are often hypochromic, with a low content of iron; these RBCs are vulnerable to rapid turnover because iron-deficiency affects RBCs in several ways, such as, increased exposure of the phagocytic signaling molecule phosphatidylserine, loss of deformability, and increased oxidative stress. Both EPO fluctuation and the release of iron-deficient RBCs are characteristic events occurring during the management of renal anemia, and the shorter RBC lifetime is a component of the large fluctuations in hemoglobin level seen in patients on hemodialysis.

### Molecular changes in normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis are characteristic of neuroprotective mechanisms against hypoxic insult [^116zaxZE]. Brain Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS leading to focal destruction of myelin, still the earliest changes that lead to lesion formation are not known. We have studied the gene-expression pattern of 12 samples of normal appearing white matter from 10 post-mortem MS brains. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and in neural protective mechanisms known to be induced upon ischemic preconditioning. This is best illustrated by the upregulation of the transcription factors such as HIF-1alpha and associated PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, as well as the upregulation of their target genes such as VEGF receptor 1. In addition, a general neuroprotective reaction against oxidative stress is suggested. These molecular changes might reflect an adaptation of cells to the chronic progressive pathophysiology of MS. Alternatively, they might also indicate the activation of neural protective mechanisms allowing preservation of cellular and functional properties of the CNS. Our data introduce novel concepts of the molecular pathogenesis of MS with ischemic preconditioning as a major mechanism for neuroprotection. An increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new more specific treatment to protect resident cells and thus minimize progressive oligondendrocyte and axonal loss.

### Babesiosis surveillance-Wisconsin, 2001–2015 [^1132ptSM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on babesiosis:

- **Definition**: Babesiosis is a tick-borne multisystem disease caused by the intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites of the Babesia species, primarily Babesia microti.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of babesiosis involves the transmission of Babesia microti by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Once in the host, the parasite invades and multiplies within RBCs, leading to hemolytic anemia and potential organ damage due to the destruction of these cells.
- **Epidemiology**: More than 2000 cases of babesiosis are reported annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for babesiosis include residence in or travel to endemic regions, participation in outdoor activities that increase exposure to ticks, and immunocompromised status.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of babesiosis can range from being asymptomatic to severe. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, chills, and diaphoresis. In severe cases, particularly in older or immunocompromised individuals, babesiosis can develop into a serious malaria-like illness that can be fatal without prompt treatment. Severe cases can lead to complications such as organ damage or failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of babesiosis is generally favorable in normal individuals, with most patients recovering with appropriate treatment. However, the disease can be severe and potentially fatal in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, or those with other underlying health conditions.

### Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are increased in rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease [^115Cu6DU]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a prevalent but frequently underrecognized complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and significantly impairs patient outcomes. The survival rate of patients with RA-ILD has been reported to be comparable to that of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), primarily due to its progressive nature and the limited availability of effective therapeutic options. Despite the substantial impact on patient prognosis, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the molecular pathways that drive RA-ILD is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets.

ILD represents a diverse group of pulmonary fibrotic and inflammatory conditions. Although the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of inflammatory cascades and tissue remodeling in various forms of RA-ILD remain obscure, accumulating evidence suggests that neutrophils play a pivotal role in the complex interplay between inflammation and fibrosis in this context. For example, neutrophils produce tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases and neutrophil elastase (NE), which together activate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and recruit other inflammatory cells to the lungs, promoting pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which contain chromatin bound to granule enzymes and are implicated in both inflammation and fibrosis. NETs are large, web-like structures that consist of of cytosolic and granule proteins assembled on a scaffold of decondensed chromatin that can accumulate in the lungs and exacerbate fibrosis. The formation of NETs is a complex process that involves multiple molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways. Suicidal NET formation, induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), immune complexes, or bacteria, activates NADPH oxidase (NOX) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently activate myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE), leading to chromatin decondensation and eventual neutrophil death. In contrast, vital NET formation is triggered by factors such as platelets or Staphylococcus aureus, which involve the release of nuclear DNA to form NETs while maintaining the antibacterial and secretory functions of neutrophils. Mitochondrial NET formation, driven by granulocyte‒macrophage colony‒stimulating factor (GM-CSF) combined with lipopolysaccharide/complement C5a (LPS/C5a), leads to the release of mitochondrial DNA to form NETs, with neutrophils maintaining their physiological activity. Additionally, peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) is activated by calcium ion channels and then translocates to the nucleus to mediate histone citrullination and chromatin decondensation.

### Flow goes forward and cells step backward: endothelial migration [^112D6vc1]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Future perspective and conclusion

Despite three decades of development, the success of pro- and anti-angiogenic therapies has been rather modest. The best results achieved in retinal diseases were from the use of anti-VEGF therapies that resulted in the significant preservation and improvement of vision. Clearly, alternative strategies are needed to overcome the current limitations. To date, most efforts to control the process of angiogenic vascular growth have mainly focused on VEGF-A and its receptors, while other factors regulating this process have been largely ignored. Recently, a growing body of evidence has started indicating the importance of venous endothelial cells in developmental and pathological angiogenesis in a number of pathological settings. Venous endothelial cells are distinct from other endothelial subtypes in that they possess high mitotic activity, are able to migrate against blood flow, and can assume the molecular and functional identity of other endothelial subtypes. Despite much progress in understanding the role of the venous endothelium in various developmental and pathological settings, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that confer these features on the venous endothelium has only just begun. One important feature of this endothelial subtype is that quiescent venous endothelium, unlike other endothelial subtypes, can be reprogrammed to activate their ability to migrate in response to angiogenic and mechanical stimuli. This implies the presence of specific molecular control mechanisms that regulate the reactivation process and migratory activity in the venous endothelium. A better understanding of these mechanisms and why they are unique to the venous endothelium may enable us to develop better therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases.

### Hemolytic anemia… [^1175Yvtj]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1 A normal 8-micron red blood cell can deform itself and pass through the 3-micron openings in the splenic cords. Red blood cells with structural alterations of the membrane surface are unable to traverse this network and are phagocytosed and destroyed by macrophages. When warm autoantibodies attach to red blood cell surface antigens, these IgG-coated red blood cells are partially ingested by the macrophages of the spleen, leaving microspherocytes, the characteristic cells of AIHA. 7 These spherocytes, which have decreased deformability compared with normal red blood cells, are trapped in the splenic sinusoids and removed from circulation. MICROANGIOPATHIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA When red blood cells traverse an injured vascular endothelium — with associated fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation — they are damaged and shredded.

This fragmentation occurs in a diverse group of disorders, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, preeclampsia, eclampsia, malignant hypertension, and scleroderma renal crisis. In addition, intravascular devices, such as prosthetic cardiac valves and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, can induce MAHA. Malaria is the classic example of direct red blood cell parasitization. Plasmodium species, introduced by the Anopheles mosquito, invade red blood cells and initiate a cycle of cell lysis and further parasitization. Both the cellular invasion and the metabolic activity of the parasite alter the cell membrane, leading to splenic sequestration. Septicemia caused by Clostridium perfringens, which occurs in intra-abdominal infections and septic abortions, causes hemolysis when the bacterium releases alpha toxin, a phospholipase that degrades the red blood cell membrane.

MEMBRANOPATHIES Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the red blood cell membrane skeleton protein genes. With a weakened protein backbone anchoring its lipid bilayer, the membrane undergoes a progressive deterioration in structure, resulting in a spherocyte, the characteristic abnormality seen on peripheral smear. As with AIHA, the spherocytes are unable to pass through the splenic cords and are degraded and ingested by the monocyte-macrophage system.

### Sickle cell disease in childhood: part I. laboratory diagnosis, pathophysiology and health maintenance… [^111DiNge]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Variants of Sickle Cell Disease The common variants of sickle cell disease are homozygous sickle cell disease, doubly heterozygous sickle hemoglobin C disease and the sickle β-thalassemias. In homozygous sickle cell disease, the child inherits a sickle gene from each parent. In sickle hemoglobin C disease, the child inherits an S gene from one parent and a C gene from the other parent. In neither variant can normal hemoglobin be produced. If the child inherits an S gene from one parent and another abnormal hemoglobin, such as D, G or O, from the other parent, other rarer variants result. The normal hemoglobin present in the child with sickle β. +-thalassemia ameliorates the clinical picture. In general, this is the mildest variant of sickle cell disease, followed in severity by sickle hemoglobin C disease.

Homozygous sickle cell disease and sickle β 0-thalassemia have a comparable spectrum of severity, and specific laboratory studies are needed to distinguish between the two conditions. Pathophysiology of Sickle Cell Disease The symptoms of sickle cell disease stem from the peculiar properties of sickle hemoglobin and from hemolytic anemia. 8–10 When deoxygenated, sickle hemoglobin forms rigid polymers that deform red cells, causing vaso-occlusion in the small vessels. Adherence of sickle cells to vascular endothelium results in intimal hyperplasia in larger vessels and causes slowed blood flow. 11 The high white blood cell count found in most patients with sickle cell anemia results in the production of injurious cytokines.
12. Exacerbation of anemia by temporary bone marrow aplasia or splenic sequestration puts children with sickle cell disease at risk for life-threatening circulatory failure.

In all infants, the spleen provides important protection against invading bacteria; it is also a source of opsonins and fixed-tissue macrophages, as well as antibody production. From the age of a few months on, children with sickle disease have increasing splenic dysfunction as the organ is at first intermittently and then chronically occluded with sickled cells.
