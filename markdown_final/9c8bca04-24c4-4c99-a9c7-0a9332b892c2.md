## Question

mdd first-line drugs and doses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for first-line pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder, including which agents to choose, what doses to use, how to monitor and titrate, and how to handle special populations and nonresponse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching first-line treatment framework and whether pharmacotherapy is indicated. Then, I should verify which medications are truly first-line and which are not. Next, I will examine dose-response and tolerability to define optimal starting and target doses. After that, I need to outline monitoring, timing of response assessment, and what to do if there is inadequate response. Finally, I should consider special populations such as older adults, pregnancy and postpartum, and adolescents, and close with practical prescribing pearls and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and pivotal studies [^1161dcHY] [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd].

> Let me first confirm the first-line framework so I don't jump to conclusions: for adults with MDD, both psychotherapy and second-generation antidepressants are acceptable initial monotherapies, with the choice individualized to patient preference, severity, comorbidities, access, and prior response; combination therapy with CBT plus an SGA can be considered in moderate-to-severe presentations, though the evidence is weaker and decisions should be shared. I should double-check that this aligns with ACP, VA/DoD, and APA guidance, which it does, including the caution that benefits of SGAs versus CBT are similar overall but SGAs have higher discontinuation for adverse effects, reinforcing the need to match treatment to patient values and context [^1161dcHY] [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd] [^117AgbRV].

> Now, which medications are truly first-line; wait, let me verify the specific agents endorsed across guidelines. High-credibility sources converge on SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine as acceptable first-line options, with no consistent superiority among them for average efficacy; selection should be driven by side-effect profiles, comorbidities, and patient preference. I need to ensure I exclude fluvoxamine from routine first-line SSRI choices because APA singles it out as not preferred for initial treatment, and I should remember that tricyclics and MAOIs are generally reserved for later lines due to tolerability and safety concerns despite historical efficacy data [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd] [^113PVR2R].

> Next, I should review dose-response so I don't over-titrate. Hold on, I should verify the best evidence: a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis shows SSRIs have a gradual efficacy increase up to about 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, then a flat to slightly declining curve, with adverse effects rising monotonically; optimal acceptability sits in the lower licensed range. For venlafaxine, efficacy rises to roughly 75–150 mg with diminishing returns thereafter, and for mirtazapine, efficacy peaks around 30 mg before declining; again, acceptability is better at lower doses. Pragmatically, this supports starting at the low end of the therapeutic range and titrating cautiously to a moderate target rather than reflexively pushing to the maximum dose, which often adds side effects without benefit [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH] [^113t99r6].

> I will now examine concrete starting doses and titration cadence, but wait, I should confirm representative ranges. For sertraline, 50 mg daily is a common starting and early target within the 50–200 mg range; for escitalopram, 10 mg daily is a typical starting point within 10–20 mg; for venlafaxine XR, 75 mg daily is a reasonable initial target within 75–225 mg; for bupropion XL, 150 mg daily is a standard start with consideration of 300 mg if tolerated; for mirtazapine, 15–30 mg at bedtime balances efficacy and sedation. I should confirm that guidelines endorse starting low and going slow to improve adherence and tolerability, which ACP explicitly recommends, and I should remember that SUN☺D found no advantage to pushing sertraline to 100 mg by week 3 versus staying at 50 mg, reinforcing a moderate, tolerability-focused target rather than aggressive early escalation [^115EPMFN] [^116b3KLf] [^113xZnMZ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response thresholds so I don't miss early nonresponse. Let me first confirm timing: reassess at 1–2 weeks for tolerability and early improvement, and by 4–6 weeks for a more definitive response assessment; without at least 20% improvement by about 4 weeks, the likelihood of response or remission at 8–12 weeks is low, prompting consideration of dose optimization or switching. I need to ensure I use measurement-based care with validated scales such as PHQ-9 at each visit to quantify change and guide decisions, as recommended by ACP and embedded in enhanced care models that improve outcomes [^117S8eb5] [^112yF7CJ] [^113HkV48].

> Hold on, I should verify what constitutes an adequate pharmacotherapy trial before changing course. An adequate trial is generally 6–12 weeks at a maximally tolerated therapeutic dose, with at least 4–6 weeks at the final dose; if there is partial response, optimization or augmentation is reasonable; if there is minimal response, switching is favored. I should double-check that guidelines align here: VA/DoD and ACP support switching or augmenting after an adequate trial, and SUN☺D suggests that early reassessment at 3 weeks can identify nonresponders for whom switching or adding mirtazapine yields modest benefits, though this timing is earlier than some guidelines and should be contextualized [^111ZQkSR] [^116ekByx] [^116b3KLf].

> For inadequate response, let me consider next steps carefully and avoid overpromising. Switching to a different SGA or adding CBT are both reasonable, with similar overall effectiveness across strategies; augmentation with mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone is supported, and atypical antipsychotic augmentation (e.g., aripiprazole, quetiapine, brexpiprazole) can be effective but carries more adverse effects and should be reserved for appropriate cases. I should confirm that dose escalation of SSRIs after nonresponse offers little to no benefit in most cases, which meta-analytic data support, so I should not rely on simply increasing the SSRI dose as a primary strategy after an adequate trial [^116ekByx] [^117S8eb5] [^117MscZZ].

> But wait, what about special populations; I need to ensure safety-first adjustments. In older adults with mild-to-moderate MDD, first-line psychotherapy is preferred due to pharmacotherapy risks; if medication is used, start low, go slow, and consider citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, or venlafaxine with close monitoring. In pregnancy and postpartum, evidence-based psychotherapy is first-line; if medication is needed, sertraline is often preferred for lower infant exposure, and paroxetine is generally avoided when possible. In adolescents, fluoxetine is the first-line medication when pharmacotherapy is indicated, ideally combined with CBT or IPT, and close monitoring for adverse effects is essential [^116VQAW9] [^111ws1LF] [^113EDv9X] [^115yHFb4] [^1123Sz39].

> I should double-check practical prescribing pearls so I don't overlook basics. Start with a generic SGA when feasible, screen for drug–drug interactions and contraindications such as recent MAOI use, counsel on common adverse effects and time course, and plan continuation for 4–9 months after remission with a gradual taper to mitigate withdrawal. Let me verify that ACP emphasizes these points, which it does, and I should also remember that while combination therapy can be considered up front in moderate-to-severe cases, the evidence is less certain and should be framed as a conditional option aligned with patient preferences and clinical judgment [^115EPMFN] [^117S8eb5] [^113iJfju].

> In summary, I need to ensure the algorithm is coherent and evidence-aligned: for adults with MDD, offer either CBT or an SGA as initial monotherapy, individualizing by severity, comorbidity, access, and preference; among SGAs, SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine are all reasonable, with no clear efficacy winner; start at the low end of the therapeutic range and titrate cautiously to a moderate target, avoiding reflexive max dosing; reassess at 1–2 weeks and 4–6 weeks using measurement-based care; if inadequate response after an adequate trial, switch to another SGA or add CBT, or consider augmentation strategies; in older adults and perinatal patients, prioritize psychotherapy and use medications judiciously; and always plan for continuation and a gradual taper after remission. This approach balances efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability while honoring patient values and the best available evidence [^1161dcHY] [^112rNpvs] [^112vEbnF] [^117S8eb5].

First-line pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder includes **SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine** [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd], with no clear superiority among classes [^115QcBMD]; selection should be individualized based on patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profiles [^112rNpvs]. Typical starting doses are: **sertraline 50 mg/day**, **escitalopram 10 mg/day**, **venlafaxine XR 75 mg/day**, **bupropion XL 150 mg/day**, and **mirtazapine 15 mg/day** [^notfound]; titrate to a therapeutic dose over 2–4 weeks, aiming for the lower end of the licensed range (e.g. 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) to balance efficacy and tolerability [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH]. Assess response at 4–6 weeks [^113VEmQd]; if inadequate, consider dose increase, switching, or augmentation strategies [^116ekByx] [^115hqgCy].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

Current guidelines consistently recommend the following medication classes as **first-line treatments** for MDD:

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine (excluding fluvoxamine) [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd].
- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)**: venlafaxine, duloxetine [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd].
- **Atypical antidepressants**: bupropion, mirtazapine [^112rNpvs] [^113VEmQd].

These medications have comparable efficacy [^115QcBMD]; therefore, **selection should be individualized** based on patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profiles [^111odPUf].

---

## Recommended starting doses and titration strategies

Starting doses and titration should balance efficacy with tolerability; **start low and go slow** to minimize adverse effects and improve adherence [^115EPMFN]:

| **Medication** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Titration strategy** |
|-|-|-|
| Sertraline | 50 mg/day | Increase by 25 mg every 1–2 weeks to a maximum of 200 mg/day |
| Escitalopram | 10 mg/day | Increase to 20 mg/day after 2–4 weeks if needed |
| Fluoxetine | 20 mg/day | Increase to 40 mg/day after 2–4 weeks if needed |
| Venlafaxine XR | 75 mg/day | Increase by 75 mg every 1–2 weeks to a maximum of 225 mg/day |
| Duloxetine | 60 mg/day | Increase to 90 mg/day if needed |
| Bupropion XL | 150 mg/day | Increase to 300 mg/day after 1–2 weeks if tolerated |
| Mirtazapine | 15 mg/day | Increase to 30 mg/day after 1–2 weeks if needed |

---

Titration should be guided by clinical response and tolerability, with **therapeutic doses typically achieved within 2–4 weeks** [^notfound].

---

## Optimal therapeutic dose range

Recent dose–response meta-analyses indicate that for most SSRIs, the **optimal therapeutic range corresponds to 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents** (approximately sertraline 50–100 mg, escitalopram 10–20 mg, fluoxetine 20–40 mg) [^112vEbnF] [^113h76DH]. Higher doses generally do not improve efficacy and may increase adverse effects and discontinuation rates [^112vEbnF] [^117MscZZ].

---

## Clinical considerations and patient-specific factors

When selecting and dosing antidepressants, consider the following:

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiac conditions, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and seizure disorders may influence medication choice and dosing [^112rNpvs].
- **Drug interactions**: SSRIs and SNRIs have significant interactions with other medications, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are contraindicated [^115EPMFN].
- **Patient preferences**: Side-effect profiles, prior treatment response, and patient preferences should guide medication selection and dosing [^112rNpvs].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of treatment

Regular monitoring of treatment response and adverse effects is essential. Use standardized rating scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess response [^117S8eb5]. Assess response at **4–6 weeks** [^113VEmQd]; if inadequate, consider dose escalation, switching to another antidepressant class, or augmentation strategies (e.g. adding bupropion, mirtazapine, or atypical antipsychotics) [^116ekByx] [^115hqgCy].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate slowly due to increased sensitivity to side effects [^1154GbFB].
- **Pregnant or breastfeeding patients**: SSRIs such as sertraline are preferred due to favorable safety profiles [^notfound].
- **Patients with treatment-resistant depression**: Consider augmentation strategies, including atypical antipsychotics or lithium [^113PVR2R].

---

First-line pharmacotherapy for MDD includes SSRIs, SNRIs, bupropion, and mirtazapine, with **no clear superiority among classes** [^112rNpvs]. Starting doses should be conservative, with gradual titration to a therapeutic range of 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents for SSRIs [^112vEbnF]. Treatment should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, with regular monitoring and adjustment to optimize outcomes [^117S8eb5].

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the United States, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the United States and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^112J7rwi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^111mcX5y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

Clinicians face another challenge because, after several weeks of the first-line treatment, only 50% of patients respond (i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at pre-treatment), and only 30% remit (i.e. return to a euthymic state). Patients' failure to respond or remit requires consideration of alternative treatments. Guideline recommendations for second-line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant or adding a different drug. The last strategy may be divided into 'augmentation' when a non-antidepressant drug is added to an antidepressant and 'combination' when two antidepressants are used together. Systematic reviews of RCTs agree that dose escalation confers no benefit beyond continuing the initial drug dose; consistent with these results, the German National Guideline clearly states that dose escalation for SSRI does not work. Two previous systematic reviews have found some support for the switching strategy, especially to an antidepressant from a different class. However, a recent more rigorous meta-analysis found no high-level evidence that switching the antidepressant is effective when compared to simply continuing the initial antidepressant. There are also reviews that support various augmentation strategies and combination strategies. However, most of the RCTs addressing patients who fail to respond to initial pharmacotherapy for depression compared new strategies against continuing preceding treatment; far less evidence exists comparing alternative second-line strategies against one another. For example, only two reports have directly compared switching vs combination strategies among patients who failed first-line treatment: one study compared combination vs switching vs continuing the prior treatment, while another compared dose escalation vs combination vs continuing the prior treatment. Unfortunately, neither study was sufficiently powered (only 32–38 patients in each arm in the first study and 98–99 patients in the second study) to reach meaningful conclusions. The STAR*D trial randomised 1439 patients with major depression who had not remitted on citalopram to various switching strategies or augmentation/combination strategies. However, they used an equipoise-stratified design which gave patients choices in their treatment regimen: only 105 patients consented to randomisation to any of the drug switching or augmentation strategies, and consequently the analyses had to be conducted separately among the switching strategies or among the augmentation/combination strategies. A recently published study compared switching to bupropion against combining with bupropion or augmenting with an antipsychotic aripiprazole among 1522 patients with antidepressant-refractory major depression and found that aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased response over bupropion combination or switching. Most patients in this trial were, however, chronically depressed and highly refractory (the mean duration of index episode was more than 85 months and the mean number of previous medication courses was 2.4). The trial does not, therefore, address the initial treatment of a new depressive episode.

Even less is known about when to institute second-line treatment. The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline recommends 4–8 weeks, the American College of Physicians 6–8 weeks and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline 3–4 weeks at one place but 6–8 weeks at another.

Thus, in trying to optimise antidepressant pharmacotherapy for patients with major depression, clinicians face conflicting guidelines informed by low quality evidence. We therefore conducted a pragmatic RCT — an RCT that mimics the practice environment and thus maximises applicability — to examine the following two questions concerning the first- and second-line treatments for a hitherto untreated episode of major depression:
What is the relative effectiveness and safety of initially titrating to the lowest vs the highest value of the therapeutic dose range of an antidepressant? On the basis of the results of prior evidence and existing practices, we chose sertraline as the drug to be tested. Since the available evidence suggests that there may be differences between different classes of antidepressants with respect to dose-response relationship, the first hypothesis pertains to the choice of the initial target dose of an SSRI, and of sertraline in particular, within its therapeutic range.
When patients do not remit on first-line treatment, what is the relative effectiveness and safety of continuing initial treatment, combining with mirtazapine or switching to mirtazapine? We set 3 weeks as this decision point as the earliest time point in guideline recommendations. Our choice of mirtazapine is consistent with a systematic review reporting that combination of a reuptake inhibitor antidepressant such as an SSRI and a blocker of presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptor (mirtazapine, mianserin, trazodone) was superior to other combinations. In addition, mirtazapine poses a very low risk of drug interaction. Finally, in the recently updated network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants, mirtazapine was the second most potent antidepressant after amitriptyline; its less favourable acceptability profile renders it less suitable as first-line treatment, but when first-line treatment fails, mirtazapine represents a potentially appropriate second choice.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113VEmQd]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline — adult major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment sequencing is as follows: For mild to moderate MDD, first line pharmacotherapy treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, mirtazapine, and bupropion; if a patient has not demonstrated sufficient response after 4 to 6 weeks of trying a pharmacotherapy, the patient should switch to another medication or to psychotherapy or augment with another medication or psychotherapy. Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy. In treating severe or chronic or recurrent complex MDD the guideline recommends a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^112PXfBN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^116b3KLf]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For patients starting treatment for depression, current guidelines recommend titrating the antidepressant dosage to the maximum of the licenced range if tolerated. When patients do not achieve remission within several weeks, recommendations include adding or switching to another antidepressant. However, the relative merits of these guideline strategies remain unestablished.

Methods

This multi-centre, open-label, assessor-blinded, pragmatic trial involved two steps. Step 1 used open-cluster randomisation, allocating clinics into those titrating sertraline up to 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day by week 3. Step 2 used central randomisation to allocate patients who did not remit after 3 weeks of treatment to continue sertraline, to add mirtazapine or to switch to mirtazapine. The primary outcome was depression severity measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (scores between 0 and 27; higher scores, greater depression) at week 9. We applied mixed-model repeated-measures analysis adjusted for key baseline covariates.

Results

Between December 2010 and March 2015, we recruited 2011 participants with hitherto untreated major depression at 48 clinics in Japan. In step 1, 970 participants were allocated to the 50 mg/day and 1041 to the 100 mg/day arms; 1927 (95.8%) provided primary outcomes. There was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted PHQ-9 score at week 9 between the 50 mg/day arm and the 100 mg/day arm (0.25 point, 95% confidence interval (CI), − 0.58 to 1.07, P = 0.55). Other outcomes proved similar in the two groups.

In step 2, 1646 participants not remitted by week 3 were randomised to continue sertraline (n = 551), to add mirtazapine (n = 537) or to switch to mirtazapine (n = 558): 1613 (98.0%) provided primary outcomes. At week 9, adding mirtazapine achieved a reduction in PHQ-9 scores of 0.99 point (0.43 to 1.55, P = 0.0012); switching achieved a reduction of 1.01 points (0.46 to 1.56, P = 0.0012), both relative to continuing sertraline. Combination increased the percentage of remission by 12.4% (6.1 to 19.0%) and switching by 8.4% (2.5 to 14.8%). There were no differences in adverse effects.

Conclusions

In patients with new onset depression, we found no advantage of titrating sertraline to 100 mg vs 50 mg. Patients unremitted by week 3 gained a small benefit in reduction of depressive symptoms at week 9 by switching sertraline to mirtazapine or by adding mirtazapine.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis for a clinical guideline by the American College of Physicians [^117AgbRV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care patients and clinicians may prefer alternative options to second-generation antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD).

Purpose

To compare the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments with second-generation antidepressants as first-step interventions for acute MDD, and to compare second-step treatment strategies for patients who did not achieve remission after an initial attempt with antidepressants.

Data Sources

English-language studies from several electronic databases from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2022, trial registries, gray literature databases, and reference lists to identify unpublished research.

Study Selection

2 investigators independently selected randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration.

Data Extraction

Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, interventions, and outcomes. They dually rated the risk of bias of studies and the certainty of evidence for outcomes of interest.

Data Synthesis

65 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria; eligible data from nonrandomized studies were not found. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses indicated similar benefits of most nonpharmacologic treatments and antidepressants as first-step treatments. Antidepressants had higher risks for discontinuation because of adverse events than most other treatments. For second-step therapies, different switching and augmentation strategies provided similar symptomatic relief. The certainty of evidence for most comparisons is low; findings should be interpreted cautiously.

Limitations

Many studies had methodological limitations or dosing inequalities; publication bias might have affected some comparisons. In some cases, conclusions could not be drawn because of insufficient evidence.

Conclusion

Although benefits seem to be similar among first- and second-step MDD treatments, the certainty of evidence is low for most comparisons. Clinicians and patients should focus on options with the most reliable evidence and take adverse event profiles and patient preferences into consideration.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. III. pharmacotherapy [^113PVR2R]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008–2009 to reflect advances in the field.

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included Levels of Evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Pharmacotherapy" is one of 5 guideline articles.

Results

Despite emerging data on efficacy and tolerability differences amongst newer antidepressants, variability in patient response precludes identification of specific first choice medications for all patients. All second-generation antidepressants have Level 1 evidence to support efficacy and tolerability and most are considered first-line treatments for MDD. First-generation tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are not the focus of these guidelines but generally are considered second- or third-line treatments. For inadequate or incomplete response, there is Level 1 evidence for switching strategies and for add-on strategies including lithium and atypical antipsychotics.

Limitations

Most of the evidence is based on trials for registration and may not reflect real-world effectiveness.

Conclusions

Second-generation antidepressants are safe, effective and well tolerated treatments for MDD in adults. Evidence-based switching and add-on strategies can be used to optimize response in MDD that is inadequately responsive to monotherapy.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116dE1Ni]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — economic burden and early-treatment patterns are summarized as follows: The estimated economic burden attributable to MDD in the United States was $120 billion in 2020, including direct medical and pharmaceutical costs ($36 billion) of treating MDD, suicide-related costs ($13 billion), and effects on workplace productivity ($70 billion). Primary care clinicians most frequently prescribe second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) for initial (first-line) treatment, yet approximately up to 70% of patients with MDD do not achieve remission and remain in the acute phase after the initial pharmacologic treatment attempt.

### Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for treating major depressive disorder: an updated meta-analysis [^115QcBMD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antidepressants dominate the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), but evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of these agents is contradictory.

Purpose

To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for treating MDD in adults.

Data Sources

English-language studies from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to August 2011 and reference lists of pertinent review articles and gray literature.

Study Selection

2 independent reviewers identified randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration to evaluate efficacy and observational studies with at least 1000 participants to assess harm.

Data Extraction

Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, and interventions and outcomes and rated study quality. A senior reviewer checked and confirmed extracted data and quality ratings.

Data Synthesis

Meta-analyses and mixed-treatment comparisons of response to treatment and weighted mean differences were conducted on specific scales to rate depression. On the basis of 234 studies, no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or effectiveness were detected for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of MDD. No differences in efficacy were seen in patients with accompanying symptoms or in subgroups based on age, sex, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life.

Limitations

Most trials were conducted in highly selected populations. Publication bias might affect the estimates of some comparisons. Mixed-treatment comparisons cannot conclusively exclude differences in efficacy. Evidence within subgroups was limited.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not warrant recommending a particular second-generation antidepressant on the basis of differences in efficacy. Differences in onset of action and adverse events may be considered when choosing a medication.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in Japan [^111j4s3w]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Japanese treatment guidelines, consensus guidelines, and treatment algorithms for managing patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been developed and/or updated in the past decade. The treatment guidelines, which are evidence-based, are the most detailed of the 3 types of guidance; they describe how to establish a treatment plan, treatment methods, and special problems such as intractable depression and suicide. The Japanese consensus guidelines were compiled from the results of a survey about treatment choices in MDD that was sent to members of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were the most common first-line treatments, followed by tricyclic antidepressants and tetracyclic antidepressants. The consensus guidelines are not evidence-based but are practical and easy to use. The Japanese treatment algorithm for MDD is a flowchart created in conjunction with the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project. The flowchart shows steps in treatment both for patients who respond to initial treatment and for those who need several trials of treatment. These 3 forms of guidance for managing patients with MDD in Japan are reviewed.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^113t99r6]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The number of people living with depression increased by around 18% between 2005 and 2015, and depression affects 322 million people, or about 4% of the world's population. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are the two mainstays of depression treatment. In particular, second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the first-line options in the pharmacological management of major depression.

However, there is still uncertainty about the dose dependency and optimal target dose of second-generation agents. Current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations: the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose: "Initial doses should be incrementally raised as tolerated until a therapeutic dose is reached… doses of antidepressant medications should be maximized, side effects permitting". Systematic and comprehensive reviews of the literature examining dose dependency of antidepressants should clarify the issue and inform the guideline recommendations. Unfortunately, the available reviews are few and their conclusions disagree. Moreover, they addressed mainly dose-efficacy relationships and gave little attention to the balance between efficacy, tolerability, and overall acceptability of treatment.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Second-generation antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay in the pharmacological management of major depression; however, current practice guidelines provide conflicting recommendations as to their optimum target dose. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline in the UK states that no dose dependency has been established within the therapeutic range of SSRIs, whereas the American Psychiatric Association guideline recommends titration up to the maximum tolerated dose. We searched for reviews that analysed dose-response relationships for second-generation antidepressants in PubMed using the search terms "depressive disorder", "antidepressive agents, second-generation", and "dose-response relationship, drug", and in the references of the identified studies, up to March 21, 2019. We identified three systematic reviews: one concluded 21–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents provided maximum efficacy, another found 40–50 mg fluoxetine-equivalent dose category offered the greatest efficacy, and the third confirmed a linearly increasing dose-efficacy relationship from placebo, to low doses, to high doses of SSRIs. Only two studies examined dose dependency for adverse effects, and only one examined dose dependency for acceptability of treatment.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^11581uwx]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The SUN☺D trial suggests that, for the initial antidepressant therapy for a new major depressive episode, titrating sertraline to the maximum over the minimum within the licenced dosage confers no additional benefit but increases cost. The confidence in this conclusion is limited by the failure of the cluster randomisation to achieve prognostic balance, and the possible residual confounding after our adjusted analysis. When patients fail to remit on this initial treatment, early combination or switching using mirtazapine resulted in a small benefit in reducing depression without an increase in adverse effects. Inferences apply to the strategies as implemented, which reflect clinical practice, including gradual tapering of sertraline in the switching arm. Factors bearing on the decision to combine or switch are likely to include costs (combination will be more costly), the current burden of side effects of the first-line treatment, the expected burden of combination or switching and the patient's readiness to change antidepressants.

The many drugs available allow clinicians considerable options in the selection of an initial antidepressant and of second-line antidepressants to switch to or combine with. Clinicians and patients may consider starting the treatment with a low dose of agents for which evidence suggests satisfactory efficacy and acceptability in the current trial and in the comprehensive network meta-analysis. Should they choose to combine antidepressants as the second-line strategy, the relative merits of potential combinations remain largely untested in RCTs, and it is implausible that RCTs will ultimately evaluate all such alternatives. A previous review suggested that a combination of a reuptake inhibitor antidepressant and an antagonist of presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptor is more effective than other combinations, and the current findings were consistent with this suggestion. Those who place a high value in treatments that have been tested in large trials that both minimise risk of bias and mimic real-world conditions may prefer the specific strategies used in this trial.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^111ZQkSR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management after inadequate response — patients with MDD who have received an adequate trial (six to 12 weeks) of initial maximized pharmacotherapy but have achieved partial (< 50% improvement in symptoms) or no response should be reassessed and, once diagnosis and treatment adherence are confirmed, treatment should be adjusted to achieve remission; maximized pharmacotherapy is defined as an antidepressant dose advanced to either the FDA maximum recommended dose and/or maximum dose tolerated by the patient for a minimum of four to six weeks, and in STAR*D patients commonly required eight weeks or more to achieve response or remission; an SR by Braun et al. (2020) found no clinically relevant dose-effects gradients for SSRIs and that dropout rates increased with dose, primarily due to side effects, suggesting that maximizing the dose of an SSRI may not be clinically useful; further, STAR*D demonstrated that at least one-third of patients did not achieve remission after four consecutive, highly optimized treatment steps.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions on comparative effectiveness and harms in major depressive disorder (MDD) specify: for adults attempting initial treatment, the effectiveness of SGA monotherapy compared with nonpharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy (Key Question 1a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (1b); for adults who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with 1 SGA, the comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies (2a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (2b); the comparative risks for harms for those attempting initial treatment or those who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with an SGA (3a) and whether comparative risks vary by MDD severity (3b); and whether benefits and risks differ by subgroups defined by psychiatric symptoms or demographics (4). The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment according to MDD severity because screening is becoming more widespread and may increase diagnosis of milder MDD.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^112s7unP]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A further limitation is that, although it provides evidence that changing therapy after failure to remit at an early point (in our study 3 weeks) may be preferable to waiting a longer period (e.g. the oft-recommended 6 to 8 weeks), the design did not specifically address the optimal timing of the decision to switch or combine. One RCT compared switching to duloxetine immediately after non-response to 4weeks of escitalopram against continuing 4 more weeks on escitalopram and then switching if non-responsive: the two arms did not differ in their primary outcome of time to response, while there was significant increase in a secondary outcome of remission in the early switch arm than in the later switch arm. Another recent RCT examined the value of switching escitalopram to venlafaxine if patients have shown minimal improvement after 2 weeks; remission rates were 8% higher in the switched than in the continuation arm, but this difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to a small sample size (n = 192, p = 0.21). Thus, the optimal time to combine or switch remains uncertain.

Strengths of this pragmatic trial primarily relate to design features that enhance the real-world application of the results. We employed a large number of study sites using broad eligibility criteria, and thus enrolled sufficient patients to achieve high power to establish or refute differences between groups. Because Japan does not have a primary care system, patients with new onset depressive episodes usually consult office practice psychiatrists directly. Thus, in many other countries, primary care doctors would see and begin treatment of most participants entered in SUN☺D. In comparison to many multi-centre trials, we were able to enrol a large proportion (2011 of 7895) of potentially eligible patients. Enrolment of patients not yet treated for their current episode is another strength, eliminating a potential source of variability. For step 1 randomisation, we excluded patients who did not tolerate a low dose of sertraline, faithfully addressing the clinical question in which patients and clinicians are interested: In patients who tolerate an initial low dose of sertraline, should clinicians titrate to the maximum dose? For step 2 randomisation, we selected alternative interventions that are recommended in practice guidelines and are widely used.

### International consensus statement on major depressive disorder [^113T3BEW]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Because considerable variability exists between countries in the management of major depressive disorder, experts in psychiatry gathered for the International Consensus Group on Depression to outline a universal treatment algorithm for this illness. The experts decided to adapt the existing treatment algorithm developed in Japan and discuss strategies for clinical issues that have been problematic in some countries. Specific recommendations were made by the consensus group for screening for, diagnosing, and treating depression, which include periodically screening all patients for depression, completing a differential diagnosis of depression, referring to a psychiatric specialist if needed, establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients and their families, choosing and optimizing the dose of appropriate antidepressants based on individual patient's needs, and incorporating nonpharmacologic treatment strategies as necessary.

### Pharmacotherapy for late-life depression [^114DS7GC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The 2001 expert consensus guidelines for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) in geriatric patients recommended antidepressant treatment in combination with psychotherapy. Recent evidence continues to support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as first-line agents in the elderly, and although the transdermal monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegilene has shown promise in adult patients, it has not been studied in geriatric depression. Augmentation therapy with atypical antipsychotics or other agents may provide benefits for agitated, psychotic, or resistant MDD in the elderly. The few treatment studies that have been conducted in the geriatric population since the publication of the guidelines have had mixed results and high placebo response rates. More large controlled trials are needed.

These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing. Suggestions for future research priorities are also made.

This study constitutes a revision of the guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) issued by the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Depressive Disorder (KMAP-DD) 2006. In incorporates changes in the experts׳ consensus that occurred between 2006 and 2012 as well as information regarding newly developed and recently published clinical trials.

Methods

Using a 44-item questionnaire, an expert consensus was obtained on pharmacological treatment strategies for (1) non-psychotic MDD, (2) psychotic MDD, (3) dysthymia and depression subtypes, (4) continuous and maintenance treatment, and (5) special populations; consensus was also obtained regarding (6) the choice of an antidepressant (AD) in the context of safety and adverse effects, and (7) non-pharmacological biological therapies.

Results

AD monotherapy was recommended as the first-line strategy for nonpsychotic depression in adults, children and adolescents, elderly adults, and patients with postpartum depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The combination of AD and atypical antipsychotics (AAP) was recommended for psychotic depression. The duration of the initial AD treatment for psychotic depression depends on the number of depressive episodes. Most experts recommended stopping the initial AD and AAP therapy after a certain period in patients with one or two depressive episodes. However, for those with three or more episodes, maintenance of the initial treatment was recommended for as long as possible. Monotherapy with various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was recommended for dysthymic disorder and melancholic type MDD.

Conclusion

The pharmacological treatment strategy of KMAP-DD 2012 is similar to that of KMAP-DD 2006; however, the preference for the first-line use of AAPs was stronger in 2012 than in 2006.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^114FUfP9]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Procedures

In step 1, participants in the minimum dosage arm received 50 mg/day of sertraline at week 1 to be continued through week 3, and those in the maximum dosage arm received 50–75 mg/day at week 1 and 100 mg/day at week 2 to be continued through week 3. When these target dosages were not tolerated, lower dosages were accepted.

In step 2, in the continuing sertraline arm, sertraline was administered as 50 or 100 mg/day according to the initial randomisation. In the combination arm, sertraline was continued and mirtazapine was added between 7.5 and 45 mg/day at the discretion of the study psychiatrist. In the mirtazapine switch arm, mirtazapine between 7.5 mg and 45 mg/day was administered; sertraline was tapered and discontinued by week 7.

Co-administration of benzodiazepines, but not of another antidepressant, antipsychotic or mood stabiliser was allowed up to week 9. Neither was any depression-specific psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) allowed. Those who withdrew consent to the study treatments by week 9 but still participated in follow-up evaluations received treatment as negotiated with their physician. Between weeks 9 and 25, there were no restrictions on treatments, and the continuation therapy was at the physician's discretion.

### Real-world characteristics of European patients receiving SNRIs as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder [^113Eogvv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are among the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (ADs) for major depressive disorder (MDD), with an increasing trend in the last decade. Given the relative dearth of information regarding rationales for their preferred use as first-line ADs in the broad clinical routine, the present study systematically investigated real-world characteristics of MDD patients prescribed either SNRIs or other AD substances across different countries and treatment settings.

Methods

In the present secondary analyses based on a large European, multi-site, naturalistic and cross-sectional investigation with a retrospective assessment of treatment outcome, we firstly defined the proportion of MDD patients receiving SNRIs as first-line AD psychopharmacotherapy and secondly compared their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to those patients prescribed alternative first-line ADs during their current major depressive episode (MDE).

Results

Within the total sample of 1410 MDD patients, 336 (23.8%) received first-line SNRIs. Compared to other ADs, SNRIs were significantly associated with inpatient care, suicidality and treatment resistance during the current MDE, and a longer lifetime duration of psychiatric hospitalizations. Moreover, greater severity of depressive symptoms at study entry, higher daily doses of the administered ADs, as well as more frequent prescriptions of psychopharmacotherapeutic add-on strategies in general and antipsychotic augmentation in particular, were significantly related to first-line SNRIs.

Conclusions

Considering the limitations of a cross-sectional and retrospective study design, our data point towards a preferred use of first-line SNRIs in a generally more severely ill MDD patients, although they did not lead to superior treatment outcomes compared to alternative ADs.

### Dose increase versus unchanged continuation of antidepressants after initial antidepressant treatment failure in patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind trials [^117MscZZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of dose increase compared to dose continuation of the initially prescribed antidepressant in antidepressant treatment failure (ATF).

Data Sources

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO using generic terms for depression, dose increase, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), without date or language restrictions.

Study Selection

Of 1,780 studies screened, 9 studies reporting on 1,273 patients were included for meta-analysis (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42017058389). Studies met the following predetermined inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trial, patients diagnosed with unipolar depression according to a standardized diagnostic instrument, ATF after a standard antidepressant trial (duration of ≥ 3 weeks at a standard dose), dose increase regimen, and control group of dose continuation.

Data Extraction

Two authors extracted data independently according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Analyses are based on random effects models.

Results

All studies reported on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); 1 study also reported on maprotiline. Meta-analyses resulted in a statistically nonsignificant summary effect size of 0.053 standardized mean difference (95% CI, -0.143 to 0.248) in favor of antidepressant dose increase. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses and secondary outcome analyses resulted in similar effect estimates and supported the robustness of the results.

Conclusions

With clinically and statistically nonsignificant effect estimates, there is evidence from RCTs against increasing the dose of SSRIs (with the possible exception of citalopram) in adult patients with major depression and ATF. Dose increase with other antidepressants (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and in other patient groups (minor depression, children and adolescents) or after long periods of first-line antidepressant therapy (ie, 8 weeks) have not been or not been sufficiently studied and, at this time, cannot be recommended in clinical practice.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1168irY6]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Adult depression — Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute guideline recommends either antidepressant medication or psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or problem-solving therapy) as first line treatments for patients whose major depressive disorder is mild to moderate, and recommends a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy for patients with chronic or severe major depressive disorder. According to that guideline, first line medication classes can include tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI), or dopamine agonist, and it does not recommend for or against St. John's Wort (hypericum) for mild to moderate major depressive disorder but recommends against St. John's Wort for severe major depressive disorder. The guideline recommends consulting with specialized behavioral health providers for patients with suicidal ideation, plans, intent, or previous suicide attempts. For persistent and impairing symptoms after first line treatment, it discusses second line options including augmenting treatment, increasing antidepressant dosage, and switching treatments; it recommends against augmenting with pindolol and does not recommend for or against providing atypical antipsychotics or inositol or folate as second line treatments.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116h2m7R]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence.

Audience and Patient Population

The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD.

Recommendation 1a

ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 1b

ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant:

- Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)
- Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Optimal dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine in major depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^112vEbnF]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is the single largest contributor to non-fatal health loss worldwide. Second-generation antidepressants are the first-line option for pharmacological management of depression. Optimising their use is crucial in reducing the burden of depression; however, debate about their dose dependency and their optimal target dose is ongoing. We have aimed to summarise the currently available best evidence to inform this clinical question.

Methods

We did a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of double-blind, randomised controlled trials that examined fixed doses of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline), venlafaxine, or mirtazapine in the acute treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with major depression, identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, PSYNDEX, websites of drug licensing agencies and pharmaceutical companies, and trial registries. We imposed no language restrictions, and the search was updated until Jan 8, 2016. Doses of SSRIs were converted to fluoxetine equivalents. Trials of antidepressants for patients with depression and a serious concomitant physical illness were excluded. The main outcomes were efficacy (treatment response defined as 50% or greater reduction in depression severity), tolerability (dropouts due to adverse effects), and acceptability (dropouts for any reasons), all after a median of 8 weeks of treatment (range 4–12 weeks). We used a random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis model with flexible splines for SSRIs, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine.

Findings

28 554 records were identified through our search (24 524 published and 4030 unpublished records). 561 published and 121 unpublished full-text records were assessed for eligibility, and 77 studies were included (19 364 participants; mean age 42.5 years, SD 11.0; 7156 [60.9%] of 11 749 reported were women). For SSRIs (99 treatment groups), the dose-efficacy curve showed a gradual increase up to doses between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents, and a flat to decreasing trend through the higher licensed doses up to 80 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Dropouts due to adverse effects increased steeply through the examined range. The relationship between the dose and dropouts for any reason indicated optimal acceptability for the SSRIs in the lower licensed range between 20 mg and 40 mg fluoxetine equivalents. Venlafaxine (16 treatment groups) had an initially increasing dose-efficacy relationship up to around 75–150 mg, followed by a more modest increase, whereas for mirtazapine (11 treatment groups) efficacy increased up to a dose of about 30 mg and then decreased. Both venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed optimal acceptability in the lower range of their licensed dose. These results were robust to several sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation

For the most commonly used second-generation antidepressants, the lower range of the licensed dose achieves the optimal balance between efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability in the acute treatment of major depression.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^113xZnMZ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The SUN☺D trial involved two randomisations to examine the first- and second-line antidepressant pharmacotherapies for the acute phase treatment of hitherto untreated major depressive disorder.

The step 1 randomisation examined the impact of titrating to the minimum or maximum of the licenced dose of sertraline by week 3. In patients starting treatment for major depressive disorder, there were no important differences in effectiveness or adverse effects between these two starting sertraline doses. The results of the primary outcome at week 9 (0.25 point difference in adjusted PHQ-9 score, 95% CI − 0.58 to 1.07, P = 0.55) excluded an important difference in favour of the higher dose. Neither were there any important differences between the minimum vs the maximum target doses in side effects, burden or treatment acceptability up to either week 9 or week 25.

When patients do not remit after 3 weeks of sertraline treatment, however, adding mirtazapine or switching sertraline to mirtazapine resulted in approximately a one-point benefit in PHQ-9 at week 9, a standardised mean difference of around 0.16. This difference corresponded to RDs in response of 9.1% (95% CI 2.8–15.4%) for the combination and 8.2% (1.7–14.3%) for the switching strategy and, in remission, of 12.4% (6.1–19.0%) for the combination and 8.4% (2.5–14.8%) for the switching strategy. These values are slightly below or above the usually accepted clinically significant threshold of 10% RD, but they may be important to patients when one considers that they are differences between alternative active treatments and that RDs for antidepressants over placebo are approximately 20% only. In addition, these results were consistent with patients' self-reports by BDI-II. The benefits of combination and switching did not, however, persist after continuation treatment at the treating physician's discretion at week 25.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112o36JE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — scope and evidence base are stated as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of an MDD episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and costs. This update adds new key questions on patient values and preferences and costs of interventions and incorporates network meta-analyses on initial treatment strategies, and it evaluates the comparative effectiveness between treatment options but does not evaluate the effectiveness of the included treatments compared with no treatment. For initial treatment, the systematic review limited pharmacologic treatment to SGAs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; and others such as bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone, and vortioxetine.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^116w6VKr]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Combination or switching strategies resulted in 6–8% fewer patients continuing the allocated treatments up to week 9 than continuing on sertraline. However, given the greater improvement in depressive symptoms with the strategies that included mirtazapine; similar global ratings of side effects among the treatment arms at weeks 9 and 25; and similar time to discontinuation of allocated treatment or any treatment when considered up to 25 weeks; this finding does not raise concern regarding the use of combination and switching strategies.

The most recent comprehensive network meta-analysis of antidepressants found that mirtazapine may have a greater response rate than sertraline (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.93–1.43) when used as first-line monotherapy. The current study findings are compatible with this network meta-analysis, and this superior efficacy of mirtazapine may be responsible for some of the benefits of switching or combination strategies over sertraline continuation found in the current study.

Some guidelines recommend dose increase within the approved range after non-response to a lower dose (, p. 356, p.53). Two previous studies have tested this strategy for sertraline and found that there was no additional benefit: one study compared 50 mg vs 150 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 3 weeks on 50 mg and reported no difference. Another study compared 100 mg vs 200 mg of sertraline for 5 weeks after an initial 6 weeks in which patients received up to 100 mg and reported that the increase to 200 mg resulted in a lower response rate. Although the current study did not specifically address this strategy, our results with regard to the initial target dose are consistent with these previous studies.

There are limitations of our study. First, the step 1 cluster randomisation by clinic was performed at the start of the study. As a result, there was no concealment at the level of randomisation of individual patients, which explains the differences in characteristics of patients enrolled in the two arms. Clinicians at study sites allocated to the lower dose were less inclined to enrol severe patients or male patients than were clinicians at sites allocated to the higher dose. We dealt with this prognostic imbalance by adjusting for key variables in the mixed-model repeated-measures analyses and confirmed robustness of the primary findings against model assumptions through sensitivity analyses. Unknown confounders may still, however, have biased our findings, limiting strength of inference in the step 1 findings.

### Should this patient receive an antidepressant? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^117No1Zo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is a major public health problem and a common cause of disability. To help physicians choose among available treatment options, the American College of Physicians recently issued a guideline titled "Nonpharmacologic Versus Pharmacologic Treatment of Adult Patients with Major Depressive Disorder". The evidence review done for the guideline found no statistically significant difference in the efficacy of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) versus most other treatments for this disorder. However, rates of adverse events and discontinuation were generally higher in patients treated with SGAs. This Beyond the Guidelines reviews the guideline and includes a discussion between 2 experts on how they would apply it to a 64-year-old man with depression who is reluctant to begin medication. They review the data on which the guideline is based, discuss the limitations of applying the data to real-world settings, review how they would incorporate patient preferences when making treatment decisions, and outline options for patients in whom first-line therapy has failed.

With regard to step 1 treatments, in the 50 mg/day arm, 91.7% (889/970) had been prescribed 50 mg/day, 0.1% (1/970) 37.5 mg/day, 1.3% (13/970) 25 mg/day and 0.1% (1/970) 75 mg/day by week 3; in the 100 mg/day arm, 82.0% (854/1041) had reached 100 mg/day, 5.3% (55/1041) 75 mg/day, 6.7% (70/1041) 50 mg/day and 0.9% (9/1041) 25 mg/day. In the 50 mg/day arm 6.8% (66/970) had stopped treatment as had 5.1% (53/1041) in the 100 mg/day arm. For step 2 randomised allocations at week 3, 99.5% (548/551), 96.1% (516/537) and 96.8% (540/558) of the randomised participants started their allocated treatment for the continuation, combination and switch arms, respectively; of the last group, 72.9% (407/558), 83.9% (468/558) and 87.8% (490/558) were successfully tapered off sertraline by weeks 5, 6 and 7, respectively.

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of depression in adults [^1154GbFB]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

One in 11 U.S. adults currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and a similar number report that they have taken an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days. In the primary care population, medications are modestly superior to placebo in achieving remission, with a number needed to treat of seven or eight for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants. The benefit of antidepressants over placebo is more pronounced in patients with severe depression. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line therapy. Specific therapy choice should be based on cost, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. About two-thirds of patients receiving second-generation antidepressants experience at least one adverse effect during treatment. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy. The optimal treatment duration is unclear, but clinical guidelines suggest four to 12 months for an initial episode of major depression. Patients with recurrent depression may benefit from prolonged treatment. High-quality evidence is lacking on the benefits and harms of antidepressant use in pregnancy. It is unclear whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in breastfeeding mothers causes adverse effects in their infants, but sertraline and paroxetine transfer to breast milk in lower concentrations than other antidepressants. Consensus guidelines recommend a "start low, go slow" approach to antidepressant therapy in older persons; preferred medications include citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

APA adolescent depression — initial treatment recommendations state that for initial treatment of adolescent patients with depressive disorders, the panel recommends that clinicians offer cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for adolescents (IPT-A), with the strength listed as "Recommendation for use" and justification that, based on the literature reviewed that met the AMSTAR requirements, these were the only psychotherapy interventions with evidence of efficacy. The panel recommends fluoxetine as a first-line medication compared to other medications for adolescent patients with major depressive disorder, specifically when considering medication options, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend either treatment (psychotherapy or fluoxetine) over the other for major depressive disorder.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113nxh5m]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many medications have proven efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD), but frequently and even with multiple medication exposures, they fail to improve MDD symptoms; one third of individuals do not achieve full symptomatic remission, and even fewer meet criteria for both symptomatic and functional remission. In individuals with ineffective initial treatments, even if subsequent treatments are effective, there is a very high relapse rate while continuing the treatment; for example, in the STAR*D trial, individuals who required more treatment steps had higher relapse rates (up to 71% after the fourth step).

'Incomplete response' is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but rather a continuum that ranges from partially responsive depression (PRD), to treatment-resistant depression (TRD), to 'multi-therapy-resistant MDD (MTR-MDD)', to 'refractory depression', which implies an absence of response to all currently available treatments. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus definitions around concepts such as PRD, TRD, and 'adequate' treatments. Moreover, guidelines on how to treat TRD/PRD, such as pharmacological augmentation, are not consistent, and evidence on effectiveness is sparse. This complicates the generalizability of results from research settings to the real-world, and hinders progress in this field, as there is no uniform population for clinical and biological investigations in TRD/PRD, including clinical trials for new or repurposed medications. Importantly, regulators acknowledge that response, partial response, and non-response exist on a continuum without universally accepted definitions, but nevertheless distinguish between these conditions; indeed, treatments for TRD and PRD already have accepted regulatory paths for drug approval.

VA/DoD guideline — pregnant or breastfeeding individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD): For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment; in patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions (Strong for | Not reviewed, Amended). The evidence does not support recommending any specific evidence-based psychotherapy over another, and a meta-analysis found fair evidence that CBT and IPT are efficacious for treating postpartum depression; an additional RCT (n = 192) found group treatments were not significantly different from each other although they were not as effective as individual counseling, and an SR of 40 RCTs found fair evidence supporting CBT to treat and prevent depression for women during pregnancy and one year postpartum; there are no studies comparing psychotherapy to medication. Before the initiation of medication in women of childbearing age, providers should discuss whether the individual is sexually active and may be pregnant and the potential risks to the fetus, newborn, and mother of treated and untreated depression, and medication safety should be reviewed again with pregnant or breastfeeding patients who have been prescribed antidepressant medication.

### Florida best practice psychotherapeutic medication guidelines for adults with major depressive disorder [^114yMZAC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein we provide the 2015 update for the Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Guidelines (FPG) for major depressive disorder (MDD). The FPG represent evidence-based decision support for practitioners providing care to adults with MDD.

Participants

The consensus meeting included representatives from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA), advocacy members, academic experts in MDD, and multidisciplinary mental health clinicians, as well as health policy experts. The FAHCA provided funding support for the FPG.

Evidence

Evidence was limited to results from adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; in addition, pooled-, meta-, and network-analyses were included. Recommendations were based on consensus arrived at by the multistakeholder Florida Expert Panel. Articles selected were identified on the electronic search engine PubMed with the dates 2010 to present. The search terms were major depressive disorder, psychopharmacology, antidepressants, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, complementary alternative medicines, pooled-analysis, meta-analysis, and network-analysis. Bibliographies of the identified articles were manually searched for additional citations not identified in the original search.

Consensus Process

A consensus meeting comprising all representatives took place on September 25–26, 2015, in Tampa, Florida. Guiding principles (eg, emphasis on the most rigorous evidence for efficacy, safety, and tolerability) were discussed, defined, and operationalized prior to review of extant data. As MDD often pursues a recurrent and chronic course, principles of practice, measurement-based care, and comprehensive assessment and management of overall physical and mental health were emphasized. Evidence supporting pretreatment major depressive episode specifiers (eg, mixed features, anxious distress) and the role of pharmacogenomics (and other biological-behavioral markers) in informing treatment selection were comprehensively discussed. Algorithmic priority was assigned to agents with relatively greater therapeutic index (ie, efficacy) and minimal propensity for safety and tolerability disadvantages.

Conclusions

The updated 2015 FPG provide concise, pragmatic, evidence-based decision support for treatment selection and sequencing for adults with MDD. Principles of practice include measurement-based care, priority to both psychiatric and medical comorbidity, identification of DSM-5-defined specifiers (eg, mixed features), suicide risk assessment, and evaluation of cognitive symptoms. The FPG have purposefully aimed to minimize emphasis on "expert opinion" and instead differentially emphasized extant evidence for pharmacologic treatments.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^115hBZL1]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Thirdly, the tapering speed of sertraline in the switching arm was relatively slow and allowed some patients to take the combination of sertraline and mirtazapine for several weeks. The efficacy of the switching strategy might therefore be contaminated by that of the combination treatment. However, gradual tapering was appropriate for this pragmatic trial and allowed us to address the impact of interventions as clinicians would implement them in the real world.

Fourthly, one might question the generalisability of the current study findings beyond the specific drugs and dosages employed. As the initial target dose of the antidepressant, we compared the minimum and the maximum of the licenced dosage in Japan, 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day of sertraline. The maximum dosage for sertraline in the United States and in some other countries is 200 mg/day. The study specified dosing for mirtazapine between 7.5 and 45 mg, which is also lower than the dosing sometimes used in other countries. These differences may reflect differences in body weights and other ethnically specific variations in the genetic as well as non-genetic mechanisms affecting the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of psychotropic drugs. Up to now, however, inquiry has failed to identify ethnicity as a convincing modifier of antidepressant effect. Had we compared 50 mg/day vs 200 mg/day, or had we required higher dose ranges for mirtazapine, the results might have differed. However, consistent with our step 1 findings, RCTs using other drugs have in most cases also suggested no additional benefit with higher doses. It is also uncertain whether results would be similar had we chosen to begin with an antidepressant other than sertraline or chosen to combine or switch with a drug other than mirtazapine. Our step 2 findings for adding mirtazapine to sertraline are consistent with the previous systematic review examining various combination strategies. One might consider our step 2 findings for switching to mirtazapine at odds with the recent meta-analysis on this topic that found no additional benefit in switching to various antidepressants. However, the only study in this review specific to mirtazapine reported that using mirtazapine was more effective than continuing the prior medication.

American College of Physicians guideline — Recommendation 3 for patients not responding to a second-generation antidepressant states: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence); Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant (conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence); Switching to a second-generation antidepressant from a different pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117S8eb5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — acute-phase major depressive disorder monitoring and management directives are as follows: Monitor for new or increased suicidal or self-harming thoughts and behaviors during the first 1 to 2 months of treatment (25, 54, 55). Periodically assess adherence to treatment (with both SGAs and CBT). For patients in the acute phase of mild MDD for whom CBT is not available or feasible, monotherapy with an SGA is a reasonable alternative approach. Reevaluate symptoms to monitor treatment efficacy (response and remission) and potential adverse events using validated scales, such as the PHQ-9, and clinical history. Once remission is achieved with an SGA, clinicians should continue the treatment strategy for at least an additional 4 to 9 months (25). When SGA treatment is discontinued, the dose should be gradually decreased (tapered) to minimize withdrawal symptoms. When using augmentation as a second-line treatment in patients who do not respond to initial treatment, consider augmentation of an SGA with mirtazapine, bupropion, or buspirone. Refer patients who have severe symptoms, marked functional impairment, or risk for self-harm to mental health services. Encourage exercise as a healthy lifestyle practice for adults with MDD. Consider team-based collaborative care involving appropriate psychiatric care and mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, in adults with MDD.

### Prescription patterns following first-line new generation antidepressants for depression in Japan: a naturalistic cohort study based on a large claims database [^111aSLi3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have described real-world prescription patterns of first-line antidepressants for depression but little is known about their fate in terms of duration, intensity and changes.

Methods

An inception cohort of new onset non-psychotic depression initiating antidepressant treatment with a new generation antidpressive agent was identified in a large health insurance claims database in Japan between 2009 and 2010. The duration and intensity of first-line antidepressants, the timing and kind of second-line antidepressants and the total duration of antidepressant treatment were examined.

Results

We identified 1592 patients. The starting dose and the maximum dose attained with the first-line agent appeared to be largely in line with the guideline recommendations although the latter tended toward the minimum of the recommended range. The continuity of the first-line antidepressant was far below the guideline recommendations, with 28% never returning after the initial prescription and 55% dropping out within 3 months. Of all the first-line antidepressants, 14% were subsequently augmented by another psychotropic agent while 17% were switched to another antidepressant after a median of 3 or 2 months, respectively. The choice of the second-line agents varied extremely widely. The total duration of antidepressant therapy was as short as a median of 4 months, with 68% stopping treatment by 6 months.

Limitations

The diagnosis of non-psychotic unipolar depression in the claims database analyses remains approximate.

Conclusions

The current guidelines are grossly out of touch with the clinical realities. On the one hand, guidelines need to reflect the real-world practices; on the other hand clinicians should limit their treatment options and allow evidence-based comparative effectiveness research among them so that patients shall no longer be given less effective and more effective treatments without being able to distinguish among them.

### Agomelatine as adjunctive therapy with SSRIs or SNRIs for major depressive disorder: a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^111ghjq9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in daily activities. While it significantly impacts an individual's emotional well-being, cognitions, and behaviours, leading to a range of functional impairments, it also comes along with increased mortality, morbidity and medical cost, imposing a significant burden to not only MDD patients themselves, but also their families and the society. In general, pharmacotherapy with antidepressant drugs is often considered the first-line treatment for MDD patients, which also remains to be one of the mainstays of treatments throughout the course of MDD. Among these, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most well-known and commonly used antidepressants. However, more than half of MDD patients do not adequately respond to antidepressants at adequate doses after 8 weeks of treatment.

To date, there is limited evidence to guide the management of MDD patients who have taken adequate doses of SSRIs or SNRIs but do not demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements in their depressive symptoms. Yet, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) has recommended that psychiatric practitioners and clinicians reconsider treatment if patients do not show a response to the prescribed antidepressant after 2–4 weeks, such as switching antidepressants or adding adjunctive drugs to augment the efficacy of the existing antidepressant. Cleare and colleagues have pointed out that an augmentation regimen, which is to add adjunctive medication, was better than switching the existing antidepressants. Aligned with such findings, a previous systematic review focusing on adjunctive treatments for MDD has ascertained that several drugs, such as cariprazine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone, are effective in terms of reducing depressive symptoms among MDD patients who have an inadequate response to antidepressants in the previous treatment. Of note, cariprazine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and brexpiprazole are the only four antipsychotic drugs endorsed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjunctive treatment of MDD patients. Yet, an augmentation regimen with antipsychotic medications is often accompanied by more adverse events, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, as well as less tolerability, which necessitates further research into alternative treatment options.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^116T5JV9]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Limitations of current evidence for antidepressants

The primary limitation of all the available evidence on the effects of antidepressants is that the majority of previous trials assessing the effects of antidepressants have been at high or unclear risk of bias. Even if the trials used matching placebo, due to easily recognised adverse events in the experimental group and lack of adverse effect in the control groups, some patients might be able to figure out if they received an antidepressant or a placebo, which might compromise blinding and hence valid assessment of subjective symptoms. Trials at high or unclear risk of bias tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate harms. Despite biases inflating beneficial effects of review results, they still show only negligible differences between antidepressants and placebo on depressive symptoms, and the 'true' effect of antidepressants might not even be statistically significant.

The evidence base for antidepressants is also limited by low generalisability due to inclusion of highly selected patients. Results from a large trial conducted in a clinical setting (the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial) showed that 77.8% of the patients in the STAR*D trial would have been excluded in conventional clinical trials. The patients in this trial showed a low improvement on the HDRS of 6.6 points after 3 months of treatment with an SSRI, compared with a mean improvement of 14.8 points on the HDRS in conventional comparator trials that, like the STAR*D trial, do not include placebo controls. These data indicate that, in a clinical setting, the benefit of antidepressants is low and that the exclusion criteria typically used in randomised clinical trials lead to inflated effect estimates.

### Low dosage tricyclic antidepressants for depression [^115FAjKD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Tricyclic antidepressants are still extensively prescribed worldwide. Evidence for the recommended dosage of tricyclics, however, is poor.

Objectives

To compare the effects and side effects of low dosage tricyclic antidepressants with placebo and with standard dosage tricyclics in acute phase treatment of depression.

Search Strategy

Electronic search of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), incorporating results of group searches of MEDLINE (1966-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1982-), PsycLIT (1974-), PSYNDEX (1977-) and LILACS (1982–1999) and hand searches of major psychiatric and medical journals. Reference search and SciSearch of the identified studies. Personal contact with authors of significant papers.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials 1) comparing low dosage TCA (= < 100 mg/d on average at the end of trial) with placebo or 2) comparing low and standard dosages of the same TCA, in acute phase treatment of depressive disorder

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers examined eligibility of the identified studies, and extracted data for outcomes at 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6–8 weeks and later. Main outcome measures were relative risk of response in depression (random effects model), according to the original authors' definition but usually defined as 50% or greater reduction in severity of depression according to the last-observation-carried-forward intention-to-treat method, and relative risks of overall dropouts and dropouts due to side effects. Other outcome measures included worst-case-scenario intention-to-treat analysis of response as defined above (in which dropouts were considered non-responders in the active treatment group and as responders in the comparison group), and standardised weighted mean scores of continuous depression severity scales (usually calculated by last-observation-carried-forward method).

Main Results

35 studies (2013 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with placebo, and six studies (551 participants) compared low dosage tricyclics with standard dosage tricyclics. Low dosage tricyclics, mostly between 75 and 100 mg/day, were 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 2.0) and 1.47 (1.12 to 1.94) times more likely than placebo to bring about response at 4 weeks and 6–8 weeks, respectively. Standard dosage tricyclics failed, however, to bring about more response but produced more dropouts due to side effects than low dosage tricyclics.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment of depression in adults with low dose tricyclics is justified. However, more rigorous studies are needed to definitively establish the relative benefits and harms of varying dosages.

### The effectiveness of enhanced evidence-based care for depressive disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HkV48]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based care is the use of the best available evidence together with clinical judgement, as well as patient preferences, to make healthcare decisions. Over the past 50 years, several psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of depressive disorders. Yet remission rates remain low, with only about one-in-three individuals achieving remission in acute treatment trials. In fact, Pence and colleagues estimate that only about 6% of individuals with depression in primary care achieve remission. Clearly, efforts are needed to improve outcomes for depression treatment.

Several care models have been developed to improve treatment for depression, all of which provide "enhanced" evidence-based care (EEC). The essential component of all of these approaches is Measurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC in psychiatry is defined as the use of validated clinical measurement instruments to objectify the assessment, treatment, and clinical outcomes, including efficacy, safety, tolerability, functioning, and quality of life, in patients with psychiatric disorders. The concept of MBC was derived from the stepwise treatment algorithm by Trivedi et al.

Rigorous assessment and treatment algorithms of MBC are regarded as key instruments to optimize treatment delivery and outcomes for MDD. These explicit treatment protocols aim at a predefined treatment goal (e.g. remission or response). Treatment algorithms provide strategies (which treatments to use), tactics (how to implement the treatments), treatment steps (in what order to implement the different treatments), standardized evaluation instruments, critical decision points and standardized medical decisions based on preset "if-then-rules". Simply put, MBC is "the routine measurement of symptoms and side effects at each treatment visit and the use of a treatment manual describing when and how to modify medication doses based on these measures". MBC uses patient-reported rating scales in conjunction with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to provide an objective assessment of patient progress over time to guide a more effective plan of care.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- Supervised low- to moderate-intensity exercise for 30 to 40 minutes three to four times per week for a minimum of 9 weeks is a first-line monotherapy for mild depression.
- For most patients, psychotherapy should include 12 to 16 sessions twice weekly for best results.
- Bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, and extended-release venlafaxine are the most effective medications for treatment of major depressive disorder.
- Without an early improvement of 20% symptom reduction or more by 4 weeks of pharmacotherapy, there is a low likelihood of treatment response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. The antidepressant medication should be switched or the dose increased in these patients. From the AFP Editors Although major depressive disorder is common and has significant effects on quality of life, only an estimated 20% of patients with the disorder receive adequate treatment.
