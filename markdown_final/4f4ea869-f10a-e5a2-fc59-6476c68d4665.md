## Question

Should the donor kidney be biopsied before transplantation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether donor kidneys should be biopsied before transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts, namely deceased versus living donation and standard versus expanded criteria donors. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines recommend. Next, I will appraise the evidence on prognostic value, reproducibility, and impact on organ utilization. After that, I need to weigh benefits against risks, including cold ischemia time and discard rates. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions and alternatives like machine perfusion or virtual biopsy tools.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the answer is not binary. For deceased donors, practices vary by donor profile and center policy, whereas for living donors, routine pre-transplant biopsy is generally not indicated unless there is a specific diagnostic question such as unexplained hematuria or suspected glomerular disease, so I need to keep those buckets separate as I proceed [^175ee77e] [^a991627d].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The 2025 EAU guidelines explicitly advise not to base acceptance decisions on histology alone and recommend integrating histology with clinical and perfusion parameters, while also emphasizing that procurement biopsies should be read by renal pathologists or trained general pathologists and that paraffin histology is preferred over frozen when feasible, balancing diagnostic yield against delays in transplantation [^144464f8] [^86d582d5] [^27bd0aa4]. Hold on, I should verify the KDIGO stance; KDIGO does not endorse routine pre-transplant donor biopsy and instead supports biopsy when there is persistent unexplained allograft dysfunction after transplant, which is a different question than procurement decisions, reinforcing that routine pre-transplant biopsy is not a blanket recommendation [^31c79b96] [^6aa34ab1].

> I will now examine the evidence on prognostic value, and I need to be careful not to overstate. A systematic review of 47 studies found poor study quality, heterogeneity, and frequent failure of histologic parameters such as percent glomerulosclerosis to predict graft failure, concluding that routine use of procurement biopsies to decide transplantability should be reconsidered [^c75b4710]. Wait, let me verify reproducibility; multiple studies show poor inter-biopsy agreement for glomerulosclerosis and weak correlation between procurement frozen sections and paraffin reperfusion biopsies, undermining reliability for decision-making [^fd7ceed7] [^3f4f498c]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some analyses suggest that in intermediate-quality kidneys, suboptimal histology may associate with worse outcomes after accounting for donor factors, indicating a nuanced, context-dependent signal rather than a universal rule [^30b00be0].

> I should double-check the impact on organ utilization because that is a key harm signal. Procurement biopsies are a leading cause of kidney discard in the U.S., and many discarded kidneys would have been expected to perform well if transplanted, with modeling suggesting approximately 45% of biopsy-discarded U.S. kidneys matched to transplanted European kidneys would have had 93.1% one-year survival, 80.7% five-year survival, and 68.9% ten-year survival, which is substantial lost opportunity [^d2c0dd8a]. Let me verify contemporary discard data; the 2023 SRTR report shows nonuse at 27.9% overall, with even higher nonuse among biopsied kidneys and those with KDPI ≥ 85%, reinforcing the concern that indiscriminate biopsy drives unnecessary discards [^cdf0aec3].

> Now, I need to weigh benefits against risks. Potential benefits include identifying chronicity that might guide single versus dual transplantation or anticipate delayed graft function, but these must be balanced against prolonged cold ischemia time while awaiting frozen or paraffin results, interobserver variability, and false positives that lead to discard of usable organs, all of which can worsen outcomes and reduce access to transplantation [^1ba68f98] [^1c4d9f64]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought procurement biopsies might uniformly help triage marginal organs, but the balance of evidence shows that routine biopsy often adds harm by increasing discards without clear outcome benefit, so I should correct that assumption and align with a more selective approach [^c75b4710] [^d2c0dd8a].

> Let me consider exceptions where pre-transplant biopsy can be reasonable. In expanded criteria donors or when clinical assessment raises concern for chronic parenchymal disease, a targeted biopsy interpreted by an experienced renal pathologist can refine decisions, and some centers use histology to allocate single versus dual transplantation with reported success, though this remains controversial and should be integrated with clinical and perfusion data rather than used in isolation [^144464f8] [^6fbb2521] [^d870f3de]. I should confirm that even when biopsy is pursued, paraffin processing is preferred over frozen when time allows to improve diagnostic accuracy, acknowledging the trade-off with ischemia time [^27bd0aa4].

> For living donors, I need to ensure I do not conflate recipient protocol biopsies with donor evaluation. Routine pre-donation kidney biopsy is not indicated; biopsy is reserved for unresolved abnormalities such as persistent microscopic hematuria after appropriate noninvasive evaluation, suspected hereditary nephropathy, or other diagnostic dilemmas, and even then, decisions should follow guideline-based algorithms and expert review [^175ee77e] [^a991627d] [^52e0cb8c].

> Next, I should review alternatives and evolving tools that might mitigate the limitations of static histology. Machine perfusion platforms, including normothermic perfusion, offer dynamic assessment and may enable safer utilization of marginal kidneys, and emerging virtual biopsy models using donor variables show promise for predicting chronic lesions without tissue, though prospective validation and integration into practice are ongoing [^a1ecb192] [^bb658cb6] [^1c4d9f64]. Hold on, I should verify that these tools complement rather than replace clinical judgment; current guidance still requires integration of donor clinical factors, perfusion parameters, and, when used, expert histopathology rather than reliance on any single modality [^144464f8].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that routine pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy should not be performed for all deceased donors, and decisions should never be based on histology alone. Instead, biopsy should be reserved for select scenarios where clinical and perfusion data suggest uncertainty about organ quality, and when performed, it should be interpreted by trained renal pathologists with attention to sampling adequacy and processing method, ideally using paraffin histology when feasible to balance diagnostic yield against ischemia time [^144464f8] [^86d582d5] [^27bd0aa4]. For living donors, routine biopsy is not indicated and should be limited to specific diagnostic questions after noninvasive evaluation, consistent with donor evaluation guidelines [^175ee77e] [^a991627d].

> Finally, I should confirm the practical steps that reduce harm while preserving benefit. Centers should standardize biopsy indications to intermediate-risk donors, ensure rapid processing and expert interpretation, document glomerular counts and chronicity scores clearly, and track discard rates and outcomes to audit the net clinical impact of their biopsy strategy, aligning with EAU guidance and contemporary data on utilization and outcomes [^144464f8] [^cdf0aec3] [^eb97be0f].

Routine pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy is **not universally recommended** [^144464f8] and should be reserved for selected cases where histology is likely to change management, such as expanded criteria donors, donors with AKI, or when malignancy is suspected [^0a87e7d6] [^71ddaa7a]. Biopsy can help identify chronic changes (glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis, vascular disease) that inform acceptance or dual transplantation, but it carries risks of sampling error, delays, and unnecessary discards [^c75b4710] [^d2c0dd8a]. Most guidelines advise against decisions based on histology alone and emphasize integrating clinical and perfusion data [^144464f8] [^fe5dfca0]. For living donors, biopsy is only indicated for unexplained abnormalities (e.g. hematuria, proteinuria) [^175ee77e] [^a991627d].

---

## Indications for pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy

Pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy is **not routinely performed**; indications include:

- **Expanded criteria donors (ECD)**: Age ≥ 60 years or 50–59 years with hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, or creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL [^c6f4a623].

- **Donors with acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Especially stage 2–3 AKI, to assess severity and reversibility [^71ddaa7a].

- **Suspected malignancy**: To exclude renal cell carcinoma or other malignancies [^01979a4f].

- **Unexplained donor kidney abnormalities**: Such as persistent hematuria or proteinuria, to assess for glomerular disease [^175ee77e].

---

## Histological parameters assessed in donor kidney biopsy

Key histological parameters evaluated include:

| **Histological parameter** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Glomerulosclerosis | Indicates chronic kidney damage; > 20% associated with increased risk of delayed graft function (DGF) and graft failure [^3f4f498c] |
| Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) | Reflects chronic injury; correlates with worse graft outcomes [^30b00be0] |
| Vascular disease (arteriosclerosis, hyalinosis) | Indicates chronic hypertension or diabetes; associated with increased graft failure risk [^30b00be0] |
| Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | Indicates acute injury; may predict DGF but not necessarily graft failure [^907c7c30] |

## Clinical utility and limitations of pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy

### Clinical utility

Pre-transplant biopsy can **identify chronic changes** (glomerulosclerosis, fibrosis, vascular disease) that inform acceptance or dual transplantation [^c5917442]. It also provides a baseline for comparison with post-transplant biopsies, aiding diagnosis of rejection or recurrent disease [^6fab53f8].

---

### Limitations

- **Sampling error**: Small samples may not reflect global kidney pathology [^1a4a7817].

- **Reproducibility**: Poor inter-observer agreement, especially with frozen sections [^fd7ceed7].

- **Delays**: Processing can prolong cold ischemia time, worsening outcomes [^1c4d9f64].

- **Unnecessary discards**: Histology alone can lead to discarding usable organs [^d2c0dd8a].

---

## Impact on transplant outcomes

Pre-transplant biopsy findings correlate with DGF and early graft function, but **predicting long-term graft survival remains uncertain** [^c75b4710]. Some studies show worse outcomes with significant chronic changes, while others find no independent association after adjusting for clinical factors [^30b00be0] [^d2c0dd8a].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **EAU 2025**: Do not base acceptance solely on histology; integrate clinical and perfusion data [^144464f8].

- **Banff working group**: Biopsy only when clinical assessment suggests unsuitability; interpret with clinical findings [^c5917442].

- **KDIGO**: No routine pre-transplant biopsy; reserve for specific indications (e.g. unexplained donor abnormalities) [^notfound].

---

## Alternative non-invasive methods

Non-invasive tools are being explored to reduce biopsy use:

- **Machine perfusion**: Provides functional assessment and biomarkers (e.g. resistive indices, lactate levels) [^notfound].

- **Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA)**: Emerging for detecting donor injury, though not yet standard for pre-transplant decisions [^notfound].

- **Virtual biopsy**: Machine learning models using donor data predict histologic lesions, but require validation [^bb658cb6].

---

## Special considerations for living donor kidneys

Routine pre-transplant biopsy is **not indicated** for living donors; it is reserved for unexplained abnormalities (e.g. hematuria, proteinuria) [^175ee77e] [^a991627d]. Biopsy is generally safe, but complications (bleeding, hematoma) can occur [^7ed4ef45].

---

Pre-transplant donor kidney biopsy is **not universally recommended** and should be reserved for selected cases where histology is likely to change management. It can inform decisions in ECD donors, AKI, or suspected malignancy, but risks sampling error, delays, and unnecessary discards. Decisions should integrate clinical and perfusion data, and non-invasive alternatives are being developed to reduce reliance on biopsy.

### Tackling the shortage of donor kidneys: how to use the best that we have [^627dae90]. American Journal of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Shortage of kidney donor is still a major limitation for renal transplantation programs. This review focuses on the emerging practices, adopted to increase transplant activities, of expanding the criteria for donor and recipient selection without exposing the recipient to the drawbacks of a graft with inadequate nephron mass. Expanding the donor pool inevitably led to consideration for kidney transplantation of organs from older donors or from donors with hypertension, diabetes or other renal diseases. To fit the reduced performance of these suboptimal organs with the renal requirement of the recipient, selection of recipients with reduced metabolic requirements or increase of nephron mass by simultaneous transplantation of two suboptimal kidneys in the same recipient have been pursued. However, a critical aspect of both approaches is to quantify functioning nephron mass provided to the recipient by pre-transplant kidney biopsies. Morphological parameters assessed on kidney biopsies at the time of donor evaluation may serve to quantify the preserved tissue and to discriminate chronic irreversible lesions from acute changes that may account for a transiently impaired renal function in the donor, but that may recover after transplant.

### The donor kidney biopsy and its implications in predicting graft outcomes: a systematic review [^c75b4710]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Despite a growing organ shortage in the United States, many deceased donor kidneys removed for transplantation are discarded. Kidney biopsy findings often play a role in these discards, although it is not clear whether biopsies reliably inform acceptance decisions. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of the medical literature on the utility of both procurement and implantation biopsies for predicting posttransplant outcomes. Between January 1, 1994 and July 1, 2014, 47 studies were published in the English language literature that examined the association between pretransplant donor biopsy findings from 50 or more donors (with more than half being from deceased donors) and either posttransplant graft failure, delayed graft function, or graft function. In general, study quality was poor. All were retrospective or did not indicate if they were prospective. Results were heterogeneous, with authors as often as not concluding that biopsy results did not predict posttransplant outcomes. The percent glomerular sclerosis was most often examined, and failed to predict graft failure in 7 of 14 studies. Of 15 semiquantitative scoring systems proposed, none consistently predicted posttransplant outcomes across studies. Routine use of biopsies to help determine whether or not to transplant a kidney should be reexamined.

### Kidney utilization in the Netherlands-do we optimally use our donor organs? [^01979a4f]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Given the paucity of deceased donor organs, it is essential to minimize unnecessary organ discard. Clinicians are continuously balancing the risks of accepting or declining marginal organs from suboptimal donors for their individual patients while keeping in mind the long-term effects of their judgment on national waiting lists.

Allocation of kidneys in the Netherlands takes place via the Eurotransplant collaboration network based on international allocation agreements supported by the Eurotransplant Kidney Advisory Committee. In the Netherlands, the decision to accept or decline a kidney is initially made by the on-call nephrologist and subsequently by the transplant surgeon. Allocation of kidneys can take place before, during or after surgical procurement. Preliminary kidney acceptance before retrieval is based on the donor's general medical data, while additional information on the macroscopic aspects during procurement is communicated immediately after removal. Pre-implantation biopsies are not part of the standard procedures and histopathological assessment during procurement is only performed to exclude malignant tissue.

Abstract

Transplantation using kidneys from deceased donors with marginal clinical characteristics is increasing to maximize access to transplant. Preimplantation biopsies of such kidneys are often obtained to determine the degree of chronic changes as an objective supplement to donor clinical based assessment of organ quality, particularly in the United States. There is conflicting evidence and heterogenous practice about how preimplantation biopsies should be performed, interpreted, and incorporated into organ disposition decisions. In 2022, The Banff Foundation for Allograft Pathology tasked its Time-Zero Biopsy Working Group with reviewing existing literature on preimplantation biopsies to prepare consensus recommendations on situations in which these biopsies should be performed and suggest best practices for improving reproducibility of biopsy readings. This workgroup report tabulates the Working Group's recommendations and identifies gaps that need to be filled to advance preimplantation biopsy clinical practice in donor selection. The major recommendations are that a preimplantation biopsy should only be performed when clinical assessment tools indicate that the kidney is unsuitable for utilization, that the clinical and preimplantation biopsy findings should be interpreted together for organ utilization decisions, and that digital whole slide images be promoted to facilitate setting up reporting networks of nephropathologists. Additional prospective studies using predictive modeling approaches are needed to optimize preimplantation biopsy criteria, sampling, interpretation, and incorporation into kidney allocation decisions.

### Can donor implantation renal biopsy predict long-term renal allograft outcome? [^5057b8a0]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Donor kidney implantation biopsy (IB) is performed on a regular basis, particularly as part of clinical studies.

Objective

To determine the utility of donor implantation renal biopsy to predict the long-term renal allograft outcome.

Methods

A Medline search for studies in English was performed with the following key words: implantation biopsy, renal transplantation and long-term outcome.

Results

Sixteen trials involving 8,122 kidney transplants were identified, of which 6 were prospective studies. The histological abnormalities were scored mainly by the Banff schema and the graft outcome was defined either by delineating the delta changes in the pathology score or glomerular filtration rate. Normal histology with a well-functioning renal allograft had a favorable outcome. The extent to which the baseline tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and vascular changes had on the long-term outcome varied from one study to another.

Conclusion

Abnormal IB has a better chance of predicting early graft outcome. The review questions the current wisdom for routine IB on all donors. In some donor kidneys, a biopsy provides significant prognostic information, such as older donor kidney, those with history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidneys with abnormal creatinine. Future research on IB is necessary to find a more useful method to predict the long-term transplant outcome.

### Can only histological evaluation determine the allocation of ECD kidneys? [^d870f3de]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is a recent debate on the "transplantability" of ECD (Expanded Criteria Donors) kidneys and the selection criteria used to allocate them to single or double transplantation. Remuzzi et al. have defined a protocol incorporating pre-transplant donor biopsy to guide the use of older donor organs. They allocated organs as single or double transplants on the basis of histological findings. We aim to show the pros and cons of the only histological evaluation in the allocation of ECD kidneys, to compare the different experiences in United States and Europe and thus to discuss whether this tool should be used alone or included in a comprehensive clinical and histopathological evaluation.

Discussion

In the United States many Authors stated that the biopsy actually increases the percentage of kidney discarded and they raised questions about the importance of the biopsy in evaluating ECD kidneys for transplantation. On the other hand, the experiences of the majority of european transplant centers showed that allocating kidneys as single or dual transplant based on biopsy findings may achieve good graft and patient outcomes.

Moreover, the experience of some centers as ours showed that kidneys allocated as DKT (Dual Kidney Transplant) on the basis of Remuzzi's score could have been suitable for single transplantation suggesting the need of an adjustment of the Remuzzi Score System. Many Authors, who are in favor of histological evaluation, actually believe that a comprehensive clinical and histopathological assessment before transplantation remains necessary.

Summary

We lack precise national- or international-based selection criteria to guide clinicians. An adjustment of the Remuzzi Score System could be taken into consideration such as narrowing the indication for DKT from those ECD kidneys with higher scores and including the histological evaluation in a multifactor score.

### Role of deceased donor kidney procurement biopsies in organ allocation [^fe5dfca0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There has been an increased emphasis by the transplant community and the federal government to increase the utilization of deceased donor kidneys. Procurement biopsies during allocation are the most common reason for kidney discards. This manuscript reviews the evidence of procurement biopsies practices and utility.

Recent Findings

Procurement biopsies are performed in over half of all the kidneys recovered in the United States and account for more than one third of the kidney discards. However, there is a significant heterogeneity across the organ procurement organizations regarding the indications for biopsy, biopsy techniques and their reporting. Procurement biopsy findings are not reproducible and poorly correlate to postimplantation histology, although reasons for these limitations are not clear. Procurement biopsy findings are not associated with posttransplant outcomes after accounting for readily available donor clinical characteristics.

Summary

Procurement biopsies contribute to deceased donor kidney discards but do not predict posttransplant outcomes. Research to establish the best practices for procurement biopsies is needed to improve organ utilization.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2018 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C [^ade02094]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Living kidney donors with prior hepatitis C virus (HCV) and terminology — The guideline affirms that "HCV-positive" potential living donors "can be accepted for donation if they achieve SVR12 and remain otherwise eligible to be a donor." We support that living kidney donors should be cured of HCV (defined as SVR12) before donation to prevent viral transmission to the recipient, and we affirm that a donor cured of HCV infection should not pose risk for HCV transmission to the recipient. For clarity of terms, HCV NAT should be considered consistent with current HCV infection, and therefore, we recommend that "HCV-viremic" be substituted to refer to patients specifically with detectable HCV nucleic acid. For donor evaluation, the long-term risks of prior HCV infection to donor kidney function are uncertain, the donor selection team should examine the donor urine and laboratory workup for possible evidence of prior or ongoing glomerular injury, and depending on clinical factors the donor selection team may consider kidney biopsy to rule out HCV-related injury to the kidney.

### Donor kidney biopsies: pathology matters, and so does the pathologist [^69969d99]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Histologic scoring of pre-implantation biopsies of expanded-criteria donor (ECD) kidneys has proven useful for predicting post-implantation allograft performance and guiding transplant clinicians as to which kidneys to discard. However, there is considerable interobserver variability in scoring these biopsies, as well as disagreements between studies examining the value of different histologic parameters in predicting graft function. Azancot and co-workers demonstrate that these biopsies' prognostic value is highly dependent on their being examined by an experienced renal pathologist.

### Ways to boost kidney transplant viability: a real need for the best use of older donors [^6fbb2521]. American Journal of Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Using kidneys from expanded criteria donors (ECD) increased transplant activity but resulted in a reduced graft survival. The relatively poor long-term outcome of ECD grafts may be the consequence of an imbalance between the number of viable nephrons supplied and the metabolic demand of the recipient. Providing more nephrons by dual transplants may improve outcomes but fails, per se, to confer the same benefit of single transplants from young donors. A biopsy-based score system has been presented by a panel of pathologists to assess whether kidneys from donors older than 60 years still contain enough viable nephrons to be made available for transplantation, and whether single or dual transplantation should be used. Allocating kidneys from older donors to a single or dual transplant on the basis of this scoring system allowed achieving a graft survival similar to that of single transplants from ideal donors and remarkably superior to that of single transplants from older donors not evaluated histologically before implantation. Thus, preimplantation histologic evaluation maximizes the success of ECD transplants and protects recipients from receiving organs at increased risk of premature failure. This may limit the number of patients who eventually must resume dialysis and need second transplants.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^26b8f1d7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Biopsy and treatment evidence base in recurrent disease after kidney transplant: "As stated, kidney biopsy and interpretation by a pathologist with expertise in transplant specimen readings is critical in the diagnosis of disease recurrence." "Treatment for most recurrent disease in renal transplantation is based on a combination of case reports, case cohorts, and retrospective reviews." "Recurrent diseases posttransplant are not common enough that randomized controlled trials can be implemented; therefore, most recommendations for treatment are based on a consensus of opinion."

### Protocol transplant biopsies: are they really needed? [^07c000f3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Studies suggest that surveillance or protocol biopsies that are performed during the first year after kidney transplantation may be clinically useful in identifying early acute rejection or chronic allograft nephropathy at a point when they may be amenable to treatment. Although the benefit of this approach has yet to be evaluated in large, multicenter, prospective trials, numerous studies suggest that implementation of protocol biopsies may improve long-term graft function. In particular, a number of reports suggest that detection of chronic allograft nephropathy in early protocol biopsies is predictive of subsequent graft function and loss and that early treatment may have a dramatic effect on the outcome of the graft. Protocol biopsies also have the potential to be of great value in high-risk patients, such as those with delayed graft function, by allowing for early intervention for acute rejection. Furthermore, the procedure seems to be relatively straightforward and safe. Nevertheless, paucity of data has meant that clear proof of a benefit of early treatment of subclinical rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy detected by protocol biopsy is lacking. Moreover, the optimal timing of protocol biopsies and reliable methods to quantify the histologic changes observed in biopsy specimens have yet to be determined. This review discusses the pros and cons of protocol biopsies and considers the place of this procedure in the routine treatment of kidney transplant patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^f5d93aa9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant biopsy — indications and thresholds: Renal allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of a change in renal allograft function, and patients showing a 20%-25% increase in creatinine level above baseline values warrant consideration for biopsy. Delayed graft function lasting longer than 48 hours should be monitored closely and a biopsy performed every 7–10 days until graft function recovers. New-onset proteinuria, protein ≥ 2.0 g/g creatinine or ≥ 2.0 g/24 h, also merits a kidney biopsy. Additional listed triggers include new onset of proteinuria (2C) and unexplained proteinuria ≥ 3.0 g per gram creatinine or ≥ 3.0 g per 24 hours. (2C).

### Kidney transplantation from a donor with sickle cell disease [^1962a1db]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

In the United States, > 100 000 patients are waiting for a kidney transplant. Given the paucity of organs available for transplant, expansion of eligibility criteria for deceased donation is of substantial interest. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is viewed as a contraindication to kidney donation, perhaps because SCD substantially alters renal structure and function and thus has the potential to adversely affect multiple physiological processes of the kidney. To our knowledge, transplantation from a donor with SCD has never been described in the literature. In this paper, we report the successful transplantation of two kidneys from a 37-year-old woman with SCD who died from an intracranial hemorrhage. Nearly 4 mo after transplant, both recipients are doing well and are off dialysis. The extent to which kidneys from donors with SCD can be safely transplanted with acceptable outcomes is unknown; however, this report should provide support for the careful expansion of kidneys from donors with SCD without evidence of renal dysfunction and with normal tissue architecture on preimplantation biopsies.

Kidney donor — role of preprocurement biopsy: In general, the benefit of kidney preprocurement biopsies is outweighed by the risk of bleeding, and biopsy is not routinely indicated. However, results of a kidney biopsy in potential extended criteria donors can help assess glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and vascular changes, factors in the kidney's suitability for transplantation. Routine biopsy is not indicated in standard criteria donors with normal creatinine. Biopsy should be considered in the evaluation of certain extended criteria donors.

Kidney transplant biopsy — safety and operational considerations: The safety of kidney transplant biopsies has been documented and the overall risk of complications is low, and most biopsies are performed in the transplant center by transplant nephrologists. Community nephrologists also may perform biopsies of the kidney in KTRs more than a year posttransplant. It is prudent to obtain a diagnostic ultrasound before biopsy to rule out unexpected alterations in blood flow or urinary tract obstruction, and it is imperative that a pathologist familiar with the transplant process interprets the pathology, in consultation with the referring nephrologist, using appropriate stains and other studies.

### The boundaries of normal kidney tissue for biomedical research [^2ded78bb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Autopsy

Kidneys obtained from autopsies have been extensively utilized in kidney research, particularly in studies examining kidney structure in aging populations and in large-scale studies investigating kidney health across diverse populations. Autopsy tissue also offers full, unbiased access to the entire organ and enables detailed histological analyses of all kidney components providing comprehensive insights into normal and pathological structures, although structural analysis may be limited to chronic changes, such as glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, due to variable autolysis in autopsy kidneys that mimics or obscures acute changes such as acute tubular necrosis. Notably, autopsies often reveal previously undiagnosed health conditions or exposures that impact kidney health. Unfortunately, the quality of RNA, protein, and metabolites deteriorates rapidly after death, making the tissue unsuitable for molecular analysis. Employing a rapid autopsy program to minimize postmortem degradation may help to maintain tissue viability and molecular integrity.

Deceased donor

Kidneys unsuitable for transplantation, whether due to factors such as age, minor injury, or logistical constraints, are often utilized for research purposes with proper consent. Similar to autopsy specimens, deceased donor kidneys provide access to the entire organ, enabling sampling from multiple anatomical regions. These kidneys also reflect a wide range of ages, ethnicities, and health conditions, offering a diverse resource for research. However, the process, medical interventions prior to and the specific circumstances of the patient's death and the procurement process are highly variable and may subject deceased donor kidneys to diverse types of acute injuries, potentially affecting in particular molecular integrity.

Living donor

Living donor kidney tissue is a valuable source of healthy reference material for research. One significant benefit is that donors are extensively screened to confirm optimal kidney function and the absence of comorbidities. Additionally, tissue collection occurs under controlled conditions with prompt preservation, minimizing degradation and maintaining molecular integrity. However, the use of living donor tissue has limitations. The small tissue sample size constrains its application in large-scale studies involving multiple omic technologies. While pathological findings are minimal, obtaining additional tissue cores increases the risk of adverse events, such as bleeding, for the donor. Furthermore, the biopsies are usually performed after the kidney has been removed from the donor, perfused with special solutions ex vivo and reimplanted into the recipient, potentially introducing artificial changes that could alter the molecular profile.

### Can only histological evaluation determine the allocation of ECD kidneys? [^ab2af1a9]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The disparity between supply of deceased donors and demand has increased in the last decades and has led to the increased use of organs from marginal donors, mostly in form of expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys. ECD is defined as all deceased donors ≥ 60 years of age or donor who were 50–59 years of age and had two of the following: donor history of hypertension; donor death due to cerebrovascular accident/stroke; or terminal serum creatinine value greater than 1,5 mg/dl.

Because of the decreased chance of survival of renal grafts from ECDs, the transplantation of two ECD kidneys into a single recipient (dual kidney transplantation[DKT]) has been introduced. It is considered when a single transplant exposes the recipient to the drawbacks of a limited nephron mass supply. This strategy has provided good outcomes in the experience of some transplant center.

To solve the problem of maximizing the use of ECD kidneys and choosing which ECD kidneys should be used for single or double use, it has become important to develop tools that permit an accurate evaluation of their "transplantability". Remuzzi et al. have defined a protocol incorporating pre-transplant donor biopsy to guide the use of older donor organs. They allocated organs as single or double transplants on the basis of histological findings. They reported excellent outcomes of the Dual Kidney Transplant Group at 5 years of follow-up. However, other protocols to allocate organs have been proposed, that consider glomerular filtration rate (GFR) alone, or GFR in combination with clinical and histological parameters, so that there is not yet a standardized score to address ECD allocation.

We aim to show in this review the pros and cons of the only histological evaluation in the allocation of ECD kidneys, to compare the different experiences in United States (US) and Europe and thus to discuss whether this tool should be used alone or included in a comprehensive clinical and histopathological evaluation.

### Renal and cardiac assessment of living kidney donor candidates [^175ee77e]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Living kidney donation provides the best therapeutic outcomes for eligible patients with end-stage renal disease. To ensure suitability for living kidney donation, donor candidates undergo a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial evaluation by a multidisciplinary transplant assessment team. Numerous guidelines are available to assist clinicians in the process of donor evaluation and selection. These guidelines outline the minimum recommended requirements for donor screening and additional tests that are indicated when abnormalities arise; however, evidence suggests that some of these additional tests might not be required in certain donor candidates. Measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using isotopic methods is more accurate than estimated GFR for the assessment of renal function; however, a new clinical tool might enable the identification of donor candidates for whom nuclear medicine renal scans are not needed. Persistent isolated microscopic haematuria caused by urologic or glomerular diseases can preclude donation and such abnormalities can often be identified by kidney biopsy. Cystoscopy might not be useful for young patients, however, owing to the rarity of urological cancers in this population. Currently, no evidence exists to support the notion that donor candidates at low-risk of cardiac events should undergo additional preoperative cardiovascular evaluation before donation. Reducing and/or eliminating the need for additional testing has the potential to enhance efficiency in the donor evaluation process, improve patient satisfaction, and increase access to living donor kidney transplantation.

### A systematic review of kidney transplantation from expanded criteria donors [^142b048f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

During the past few years, there has been renewed interest in the use of expanded criteria donors (ECD) for kidney transplantation to increase the numbers of deceased donor kidneys available. More kidney transplants would result in shorter waiting times and limit the morbidity and mortality associated with long-term dialysis therapy.

Study Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Setting & Population

Kidney transplantation population.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Studies were identified by using a comprehensive search through MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Inclusion criteria were case series, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials assessing kidney transplantation in adult recipients using ECDs.

Predictor

A special focus was given to studies comparing the evolution of kidney transplantation between standard criteria donors (defined as a donor who does not meet criteria for donation after cardiac death or ECD) and ECDs (defined as any brain-dead donor aged > 60 years or a donor aged > 50 years with 2 of the following conditions: history of hypertension, terminal serum creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, or death resulting from a cerebrovascular accident).

Outcomes

Criteria used to define and select ECDs, practice patterns, long-term outcomes, early complications, and some patient issues, such as selection criteria and immunosuppressive management.

Results

ECD kidneys have worse long-term survival than standard criteria donor kidneys. The optimal ECD kidney for donation depends on adequate glomerular filtration rate and acceptable donor kidney histological characteristics, albeit the usefulness of biopsy is debated.

Limitations

This review is based mainly on data from observational studies, and varying amounts of bias could be present. We did not attempt to quantitatively analyze the effect of ECD kidneys on kidney transplantation because of the huge heterogeneity found in study designs and definitions of ECD.

Conclusions

Based on the available evidence, we conclude that patients younger than 40 years or scheduled for kidney retransplantation should not receive an ECD kidney. Patients 40 years or older, especially with diabetic nephropathy or nondiabetic disease, but a long expected waiting time for kidney transplantation, show better survival receiving an ECD kidney than remaining on dialysis therapy.

### Do protocol transplant biopsies improve kidney transplant outcomes? [^2dd90c55]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The research undertaken on 'protocol' renal transplant biopsies has provided a rich, if not the richest, approach to better understanding of the immune and nonimmune impacts upon the transplant. The purpose of this review is to detail how the direct benefit to the patient also lies in these renamed 'surveillance' biopsies.

Recent Findings

Undertaken at fixed time points after transplantation, biopsy provides individual diagnoses with which the clinician can vary immunosuppression both in intensity and in the type of agent used to modify pathological processes early in their course. Initial nonfunction from acute tubular necrosis, subclinical cellular and humoral rejection, calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, BK virus nephropathy and recurrent glomerulonephritis are all important diagnoses for which early intervention provides better therapeutic outcomes than delaying until they are clinically evident.

Summary

This review provides the recent evidence that has convinced many transplant units to embark upon surveillance programmes for their patients in order to individualize their immunosuppression and thus gain better outcomes.

### The early impacts of an attempt to standardize kidney procurement biopsy practices [^eb97be0f]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Procurement biopsies are routinely obtained in the U.S. to evaluate kidneys considered for transplantation, but some argue they may contribute to kidney non-utilization. Historically, biopsy decisions have been left solely to the discretion of OPOs and transplant centers. In September 2022, an OPTN policy designating donors meeting specific clinical criteria as 'biopsy-required' went into effect. Using OPTN data from one year before and after policy implementation, we used causal inference methods to estimate the policy's impacts on biopsy practices and kidney utilization. The overall biopsy rate remained stable at 62%, rising from 90.6% to 95.8% (p < 0.001) among biopsy-required kidneys while falling from 49.1% to 43.4% (p < 0.001) among biopsy-optional kidneys. After adjusting for changing donor characteristics, the policy was associated with a 5% decline in the biopsy rate (aRR = 0.95; p = 0.007). The overall kidney non-use rate rose from 27.2% to 28.7%. After accounting for changes in donor characteristics, the policy was not associated with elevated non-use (aRR = 0.96, p = 0.06). Though most OPOs are now biopsying nearly all required kidneys, practices still vary widely regarding biopsy-optional kidneys. No correlation was found between OPO-level changes in adjusted biopsy and non-use rates (ρ = 0.05, p = 0.70). The OPTN policy has partially standardized biopsy practices without harming kidney utilization.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of kidney allograft rejection [^abd4a1ff]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Despite regular conventional monitoring of kidney transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a barrier for the long-term success of kidney transplantation and is one of the leading causes of graft failure. Kidney transplant rejection and graft failure are reported as the most feared outcomes by patients. Timely diagnosis of rejection and early treatment enable interventions which may attenuate alloimmune processes before irreversible graft injury has occurred. The evolving landscape of noninvasive diagnostic tools presents promising opportunities for early detection of kidney allograft rejection. These tools, alone or combined, may promptly signal the need for a biopsy, reduce the need for surveillance biopsies, or even potentially inform treatment monitoring. Therefore, they are of utmost importance, and their use should be informed by evidence, guiding both patients and their clinical teams. This review will cover noninvasive tests used for the diagnosis of kidney allograft rejection available or soon to be available in the clinical setting, and describe their diagnostic context, strengths and limitations, while proposing an ideal clinical framework for their use.

### Steroid pretreatment of organ donors does not impact on early rejection and long-term kidney allograft survival: results from a multicenter randomized, controlled trial [^ce8b520c]. American Journal of Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Brain death triggers a complex series of pathophysiological changes that drive alterations of gene expression in donor organs. 1, 2, 3 Kidney allografts from brain‐dead donors are characterized by a pro‐inflammatory state when compared to live kidney donation, which correlates with the incidence and severity of acute kidney injury in the allograft. 4, 5, 6, 7 Strategies to optimize and preserve quality and function of the allograft are needed. 8 Anti‐inflammatory treatment of the donor prior to organ procurement provides a promising strategy to improve transplant outcome. Nonrandomized and retrospective studies from the late 1970s and early 1980s suggested that steroid pretreatment of donors may improve short‐ and long‐term graft survival. 9, 10, 11

We previously reported the short‐term results of a randomized controlled trial on systemic steroid pretreatment of donors prior to organ retrieval. 12 We showed that steroid pretreatment of donors effectively reduced the molecular inflammation signature in preimplantation transplant kidney biopsy specimens. However, there was no reduction in the incidence of delayed graft function after steroid pretreatment compared to placebo control.

Current organ procurement guidelines advocate steroid pretreatment of organ donors before organ procurement despite the low level of evidence. 13 Long‐term effects of anti‐inflammatory treatment of the donor on kidney allograft and patient outcome remain elusive. We report here the long‐term outcome of the multicenter, randomized, controlled steroid pretreatment of organ donors trial.

### Influence of organ quality on the observed association between deceased donor kidney procurement biopsy findings and graft survival [^30b00be0]. American Journal of Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Deceased donor kidney procurement biopsies findings are the most common reason for kidney discard. Retrospective studies have found inconsistent associations with post-transplant outcomes but may have been limited by selection bias because kidneys with advanced nephrosclerosis from high-risk donors are typically discarded. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of kidneys transplanted in the United States from 2015 to 2019 with complete biopsy data available, defining "suboptimal histology" as glomerulosclerosis ≥ 11%, IFTA ≥ mild, and/or vascular disease ≥ mild. We used time-to-event analyses to determine the association between suboptimal histology and death-censored graft failure after stratification by kidney donor profile index (KDPI) (≤ 35%, 36%-84%, ≥ 85%) and final creatinine (< 1 mg/dl, 1–2 mg/dl, > 2 mg/dl). Among 30469 kidneys included, 36% had suboptimal histology. In adjusted analyses, suboptimal histology was associated with death-censored graft failure among kidneys with KDPI 36–84% (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09–1.36), but not KDPI ≤ 35% (HR 1.24, 0.94–1.64) or ≥ 85% (HR 0.99, 0.81–1.22). Similarly, suboptimal histology was associated with death-censored graft failure among kidneys from donors with creatinine 1–2 mg/dl (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.20–1.60) but not < 1 mg/dl (HR 1.07, 0.93–1.23) or > 2 mg/dl (HR 0.95, 0.75–1.20). The association of procurement histology with graft longevity among intermediate-quality kidneys that were likely to be both biopsied and transplanted suggests biopsies provide independent organ quality assessments.

Delayed graft function (DGF) — biopsy strategy is informed by evidence that the incidence of acute rejection during DGF is higher than in patients without DGF, and when used, biopsies have been obtained every 7–10 days while on dialysis, with acute rejection first detected on the second, third or even fourth biopsy; a biopsy may no longer be needed when DGF is resolving with rapidly increasing urine output or declining serum creatinine.

### Adopting orphan deceased donor kidneys for transplantation [^a541f05c]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In this report, we described the outcome of ten kidneys from six donors that were aggressively offered as last resort to our transplant center before being classified as non-use kidneys. Fortunately, all these kidneys were transplanted successfully. The cases presented here demonstrate an efficient option to utilize these organs, and reduce the non-use rate, if the organs are provided to the transplant center within a reasonable CIT and reasonable pre-implantation biopsy results. The CIT was 2,210, 2,038, 2,222, 2,437, 2,556 and 2,305 min respectively for the DCD kidneys, and 2,338, 2,182, 1,948, and 1,507 min for the DBD kidneys. It is widely recognized that longer CIT during transplantation is associated with adverse post-transplant outcomes and contributes to increased non-use kidney rate. To ameliorate the CIT consequences, and optimize the use of these organs, experienced centers and allocation systems can apply different strategies. On the allocation systems side, allocation and transportation needs to be agile, mobile and flexible to accommodate orphan organs. Hard-to-place organs need to be identified early, and an open offer policy to expedite placement, to improve the utilization rate. On regards of biopsy results, as mentioned in our method section, the organs were accepted based on the baseline criteria for our center, and repeat final biopsy performed in our center before transplantation is evaluated.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^019094ea]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) — observational studies have suggested KTRs with EBV disease are at high risk of developing PTLD, and observational studies have also shown that mortality from EBV-associated PTLD is over 50%. Reduction of immunosuppression may result in resolution of EBV disease, and as many as two thirds of patients presenting with EBV-associated PTLD will respond to reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppressive medication. This is less likely to be the case for patients presenting more than 1 year after transplantation, or with EBV-associated lymphoma; however, this strategy may still be considered even in these patients, though expectations of efficacy will be reduced. Rates of PTLD are higher in pediatric KTRs and those who are EBV-seronegative prior to transplant who experience primary infection after transplant, and adult EBV-seronegative recipients of kidneys from an EBV-seropositive donor are also felt to be at increased risk. Because of these concerns, it is appropriate that suspected PTLD lesions be biopsied and undergo histopathological evaluation by a pathologist experienced with the diagnosis of PTLD.

### Recipient outcomes following transplantation of allografts from live kidney donors who subsequently developed end-stage renal disease [^f0a8b434]. American Journal of Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Live kidney donors have an increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) compared with nondonors; however, it is unknown whether undetected, subclinical kidney disease exists at donation that subsequently contributes to this risk. To indirectly test this hypothesis, the authors followed the donated kidneys, by comparing the outcomes of 257 recipients whose donors subsequently developed ESRD with a matched cohort whose donors remained ESRD free. The compared recipients were matched on donor (age, sex, race/ethnicity, donor-recipient relationship), transplant (HLA mismatch, peak panel-reactive antibody, previous transplantation, year of transplantation), and recipient (age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, cause of ESRD, and time on dialysis) risk factors. Median recipient follow-up was 12.5 years (interquartile range 7.4–17.9, maximum 20 years). Recipients of allografts from donors who developed ESRD had increased death-censored graft loss (74% versus 56% at 20 years; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–2.0; p < 0.001) and mortality (61% versus 46% at 20 years; aHR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2–1.8; p < 0.001) compared with matched recipients of allografts from donors who did not develop ESRD. This association was similar among related, spousal, and unrelated nonspousal donors. These findings support a novel view of the mechanisms underlying donor ESRD: that of pre-donation kidney disease. However, biopsy data may be required to confirm this hypothesis.

### Donor-derived cell-free DNA monitoring for early diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation: a randomized trial [^753a221a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is an emerging biomarker in transplantation that non-invasively detects graft pathologies with increased cellular damage, such as allograft rejection. Its short half-life and injury-dependent release lead to superior diagnostic performance compared with the current standard-of-care parameters, especially for distinguishing AMR from no rejection. The successful validation of different methods and their increasing availability facilitate the integration of dd-cfDNA testing into clinical practice, but evidence-based implementation strategies are lacking.

Instead of screening for AMR in large heterogeneous cohorts, we aimed to examine the potential clinical benefit of dd-cfDNA in a more concise cohort of KTR with prevalent dnDSA, but without previous biopsy after dnDSA occurrence, who have a high pre-test probability for AMR. We conducted an investigator-initiated, diagnostic, single-center, open-label, 1:1 randomized clinical trial to evaluate the influence of dd-cfDNA-guided kidney allograft biopsy (intervention group) in comparison with clinician-guided biopsy (control group) on the time to diagnosis of biopsy-proven AMR. Thus, we hypothesized that longitudinal dd-cfDNA monitoring combined with dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy can reduce the time to AMR diagnosis compared with clinician-guided biopsy in this specific group of patients.

### Can only histological evaluation determine the allocation of ECD kidneys? [^2e3c97d1]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Assessment of the "transplantability" of ECD kidneys: single criterion vs. multifactor score

There are several methods reported in literature to assess the quality of ECD kidneys and so to allocate them to single or dual transplant. Transplantation centers may make this decision based on a single criterion or on a comprehensive clinical and histological assessment. In 2006, Remuzzi et al. reported the long-term graft survival of 62 patients who received a transplant (single or dual) from donors over 60 years of age. In this study, marginal kidneys with no macroscopic abnormalities were allocated on the basis of the only histological evaluation of the grafts before transplantation: histological changes in the vessels, glomeruli, tubules, and connective tissue in biopsy specimens received a score from 0 (no changes) to 3 (severe changes). When both donor kidneys had a total score of 0–3, each kidney was used for a SKT. When the total score was 4–6, the two kidneys were transplanted in the same recipient (DKT). Kidneys with a total score ≥ 7 were not utilized. 3 years after transplantation, recipients of SKT and DKT organs from donors over 60 years of age that had undergone preimplantation biopsy had a mean graft survival rate > 90%, which was similar to that observed in a matched cohort of recipients of SKT renal grafts from donors < 60 years of age. Moreover, the survival rate of grafts from donors > 60 years of age that had undergone preimplantation biopsy was significantly higher than that observed in a matched cohort of recipients of organs from donors > 60 years of age that had not undergone preimplantation biopsy (93% versus 72%). Other studies have tried to define the predictive value of pretransplant biopsy with opposed results. For instance, B. Ekser et al. use the North Italian Transplant Program (NITp) allocation criteria for older donors. Histological assessment forms part of the NITp allocation criteria. In their recent report, the Authors did not describe the detailed assessment of pretransplantation histopathology. However, they emphasized that the Remuzzi Score System was used in making the final decision on the allocation of the kidneys. They concluded that pretransplant kidney biopsy optimizes the utilization and allocation of kidneys from ECDs and may lead to optimal outcomes not only from donors > 60 years but also from donors > 70 years. But the experience of Ekser et al. is a single-center, nonrandomized experience on the utilization and value of pretransplant biopsy. On the other hand, Re et al performed a retrospective study among a group of kidney transplant recipients to evaluate postransplant evolution with clinical (Deceased Donor Score [DDS]) and histopathological (Remuzzi [REM]) scores. Briefly, the DDS is based on 5 donor clinical variables: age, history and duration of hypertension, cerebrovascular disease as cause of death, final creatinine clearance, and number of HLA mismatches. These Authors showed a significant correlation of DDS with serum creatinine values over 1 and 2 years. REM did not show a significant association with any event.

### Assessment of the utility of kidney histology as a basis for discarding organs in the United States: a comparison of international transplant practices and outcomes [^d2c0dd8a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many kidneys donated for transplant in the United States are discarded because of abnormal histology. Whether histology adds incremental value beyond usual donor attributes in assessing allograft quality is unknown.

Methods

This population-based study included patients who received a deceased donor kidney that had been biopsied before implantation according to a prespecified protocol in France and Belgium, where preimplantation biopsy findings are generally not used for decision making in the allocation process. We also studied kidneys that had been acquired from deceased United States donors for transplantation that were biopsied during allocation and discarded because of low organ quality. Using donor and recipient characteristics, we fit multivariable Cox models for death-censored graft failure and examined whether predictive accuracy (C index) improved after adding donor histology. We matched the discarded United States kidneys to similar kidneys transplanted in Europe and calculated predicted allograft survival.

Results

In the development cohort of 1629 kidney recipients at two French centers, adding donor histology to the model did not significantly improve prediction of long-term allograft failure. Analyses using an external validation cohort from two Belgian centers confirmed the lack of improved accuracy from adding histology. About 45% of 1103 United States kidneys discarded because of histologic findings could be accurately matched to very similar kidneys that had been transplanted in France; these discarded kidneys would be expected to have allograft survival of 93.1% at 1 year, 80.7% at 5 years, and 68.9% at 10 years.

Conclusions

In this multicenter study, donor kidney histology assessment during allocation did not provide substantial incremental value in ascertaining organ quality. Many kidneys discarded on the basis of biopsy findings would likely benefit United States patients who are wait listed.

### Factors related to suboptimal recovery of renal function after living donor nephrectomy: a retrospective study [^30c1ba79]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) substantially increases the risk of death and cardiovascular disease. Renal transplantation is the best treatment option for ESRD. In Japan, due to the shortage of deceased donors, 89.2% of renal transplants are from living donors. To minimize the risk of ESRD after donation, the selection of living donors requires great care.

The renal function of the remaining kidney in living donors usually recovers up to 60~70% of baseline function through a compensatory hypertrophy mechanism. However, the degree of this compensatory hypertrophy varies from donor-to-donor. The reason for this between-donor difference is unclear; however, considering the wide range of the health status among living donors, the presence of subtle metabolic syndromes or preclinical renal diseases prior to transplantation are possible, which could affect functional renal recovery after the donation.

Despite meticulous efforts to avoid adverse events for living donors, the 15-year risk of ESRD in donors is 3.5 to 5.3 times higher than that of a matched population. Therefore, accurate estimation of the residual glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is crucial in order to maintain a donor's life-long renal function and to prevent cardiovascular events.

We hypothesized that donors' baseline characteristics and findings on baseline renal biopsy would predict the extent of compensatory hypertrophy after renal donation. Therefore, our aim in this study was to identify the factors related to a suboptimal recovery of renal function in living donors after donation.

Introduction

In medicine, biopsy has become a standard test for establishing a diagnosis for both malignant and benign tumors as well as characterizing inflammatory diseases and other pathologic processes, thereby guiding therapeutic management.

In transplant medicine, the biopsy of the organ has been performed since the first pioneering work of Barry et al. and of Hamburger in Paris, becoming the gold standard for diagnosing allograft rejection and other various pathological processes that harm the allograft. The histological evaluation of donors, also called "day-zero biopsies," has been implemented in several transplant programs – to judge the quality of a donor organ and, on occasion, to rule out the possibility of underlying diseases in donors. In addition, day-zero biopsies provide a valuable baseline to which the findings of subsequent biopsies of the kidney allograft can be compared and may also advocate therapeutic strategies.

Despite their potential usefulness, day-zero biopsies are still not performed at many transplant centers and happen only in specific situations, since they remain invasive, time-consuming, and costly procedures that require organization of surgical, medical, pathological, and technical resources and might increase cold ischemia time associated with worst outcomes. In addition, as we previously reported, the organ quality assessment has become ever more important in the current worldwide increase of transplantation from older donors, donation after circulatory death, and donors with significant clinical risk factors to optimize the use of these kidneys to improve transplant outcomes –. These vulnerable organs may carry, at the time of transplantation, arteriosclerosis, fibrosis, hyalinosis, and glomerulosclerosis lesions. If identified in a post-transplantation biopsy without the finding of a day-zero biopsy, these histological lesions, because of their non-specificity, might be wrongly attributed to calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, infectious diseases, or allo-immune response with significant impact for decision-making and patient management –.

### Donor-derived cell-free DNA monitoring for early diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation: a randomized trial [^48346950]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) leads to graft loss in kidney transplant recipients with de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (dnDSA).
Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) detects AMR more accurately than routine biomarkers such as creatinine or urine albumin.
It is unknown how dd-cfDNA testing should be integrated into diagnostic pathways to improve clinically meaningful outcomes.

This study adds:

Dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy enables earlier diagnosis of AMR in patients with dnDSA compared with clinician-guided biopsy.
Dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy identifies subclinical AMR in stable patients with dnDSA.

Potential impact:

Early identification of patients with AMR at potentially reversible stages can lead to improved outcomes, especially due to emerging treatment options for AMR.
Dd-cfDNA can close the diagnostic gap between dnDSA monitoring and diagnosis of AMR.

### Banff histopathological consensus criteria for preimplantation kidney biopsies [^c6f4a623]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, the demand for donor kidneys far exceeds the number of available organs; however, the discard rate of recovered kidneys remains > 40%. Preimplantation biopsy — also referred to as procurement, harvest or donor biopsy — is often used by transplant centers in addition to clinical data and parameters of machine pump perfusion to make determinations regarding organ acceptance. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policies currently recommend preimplantation biopsy for all kidneys with a Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) > 85% or at the request of the accepting surgeon, according to the deceased donor allocation policy implemented in December 2014 within the United States (OPTN Policy 2.12. A) 1. The KDPI is derived from 10 donor factors (age, height, weight, ethnicity, history of diabetes and/or hypertension, cause of death, serum creatinine [SCr], hepatitis C virus [HCV] status and donor after circulatory death status). Under the former allocation system, preimplantation biopsy was previously recommended for all expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys, defined as organs from older donors (aged > 60 years) and persons aged 50–59 years with hypertension, SCr > 1.5 mg/dL or death from cerebrovascular accident 2, 3. These policies recommended that organ procurement organizations (OPOs) provide the receiving transplant program with biopsy information from a wedge biopsy 10 mm long by 5 mm wide and 5 mm deep to be taken from the kidney cortex to capture at least 25 glomeruli. After the implementation of these recommendations, requests for donor biopsy interpretation by hospital pathologists increased significantly. A pathology data form based on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) guidelines emphasizes the number of glomeruli present in a wedge biopsy and the percentage of global glomerulosclerosis. This form is currently customized by local OPOs. This practice deviates substantially from routine evaluation of postimplantation allograft biopsies for cause (indication biopsies), which are routinely needle biopsies to assess not only the glomeruli but the tubular, interstitial and vascular compartments, following recommendations established by the Banff group. The Banff group previously defined and subsequently refined the pathologic criteria for postimplantation biopsies performed for cause and more recently applied the same criteria for implantation biopsies in centers performing protocol biopsies 4, 5.

### Recurrent glomerulonephritis following renal transplantation and impact on graft survival [^dec4e0bc]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The increasing use of protocol biopsies is likely to increase reported risk of GN recurrence but should be viewed by clinicians with caution. This aggressive approach to transplant followup has yet to be shown to alter hard outcomes and, in the setting of recurrent GN, may be potentially misleading. The interpretation of immunoglobulin deposits in a donor kidney in the absence of clinical disease is far from clear. As demonstrated in the implantation biopsies of donor kidneys, the presence of IgA deposits in a kidney does not necessarily imply disease recurrence in the recipient and may instead be a marker of the donor's genetic predisposition to renal disease. At a minimum, the research community needs to establish that protocol biopsy data is clinically meaningful in terms of recurrent glomerulonephritis.

### Association of deceased donor acute kidney injury with recipient graft survival [^ac8d7b2b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Follow-up time was similar among recipients regardless of deceased donor AKI status as follows: 4.77 (IQR, 3.56–5.92) years for no AKI, 4.82 (IQR, 3.56–5.96) years for stage 1, 4.76 (IQR, 3.48–5.95) years for stage 2, and 4.77 (IQR, 3.49, 5.89) years for stage 3. Duration of follow-up, recipient sex, black race, and HLA mismatch level were comparable by deceased donor AKI status (Table 1). Recipients of kidneys from deceased donors with AKI were marginally older, experienced increased wait times, were more likely to have undergone prior transplants, and had longer ESRD duration (Table 1). Kidneys from deceased donors with AKI were more often biopsied and/or pumped before transplant and had longer cold ischemia times. Kidneys from deceased donors with stage 3 AKI were more likely to be biopsied and pumped than kidneys from deceased donors without AKI or deceased donors with lesser stages of AKI (Table 1).

### Is the kidney donor risk index a step forward in the assessment of deceased donor kidney quality? [^e76d9a41]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The allocation of deceased donor kidneys has become more complex because of the increasing spectrum of donors and recipients age and comorbidities. Several scoring systems have been proposed to evaluate the donor quality of deceased donor kidneys, based on clinical, pathological or combined parameters to predict the risk of renal allograft failure. Nonetheless, besides the dichotomous extended criteria donor (ECD) score, none of the others have been used in clinical practice because of numerous reasons, ranging from lack of robust validation to the technical challenges associated with the evaluation of donor biopsies. Recently, the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) and Profile Index (KDPI) were introduced in the USA as a refined version of the ECD score. This scoring system is based on 10 donor factors, therefore providing a finely granulated evaluation of donor quality without the need of a kidney biopsy. Here, we review the advantages and drawbacks of the main scoring systems, and we describe the components of the KDRI and KDPI. It is an easily accessible online tool, based solely on donor factors readily available at the moment of the donor offer. Importantly, the KDPI has also been made part of the 'longevity matching' allocation in the USA, where the best kidneys are allocated to the recipients with the longest predicted post-transplant survival. The KDRI should provide us with a robust qualitative evaluation of deceased donor quality, and therefore will probably play a role in deceased donor kidney allocation policies across Europe in the near future. Hopefully, the KDRI and the KDPI should help transplant programmes to better allocate the scarce resource of deceased donor kidneys.

Discussion

"Biopsy results" as a major reason for discard of ECD kidneys

In European countries, lack of elderly recipients on the waiting list as well as macroscopic or microscopic kidney abnormalities were the main causes for organ discard. On the other hand, biopsy findings and machine perfusion have revealed major reasons to discard ECD in the United States.

US transplant centers continue to discard an high percentage of deceased donor kidneys that have been procured for transplantation. Between October 1999 and June 2005, more than 9000 donated kidneys were determined to be unsuitable for transplantation, including 41% (5139 of 12536) of the expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys procured, according to an analysis from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in this issue. Sung et al. have also identified 'biopsy results' as a major reason for discard of ECD kidneys and use of pulsatile perfusion for kidney preservation as a mitigating factor.

### Donor-derived cell-free DNA monitoring for early diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation: a randomized trial [^4c42a3f7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) shows good diagnostic performance for the detection of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). However, the clinical benefits of dd-cfDNA monitoring need to be established. Early diagnosis of AMR at potentially reversible stages may be increasingly important due to emerging treatment options for AMR. We hypothesized that monitoring dd-cfDNA in KTR with de novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (dnDSA) and performing kidney biopsy in case of increased dd-cfDNA may reduce time to AMR diagnosis in comparison with clinical indication biopsy.

Methods

In this diagnostic, single-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial, we assigned 40 KTR with prevalent dnDSA and estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but without previous biopsy-proven AMR, to either dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy (intervention group) or clinician-guided biopsy (control group) over a 12-month period. In both groups, dd-cfDNA was assessed at inclusion and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. In the intervention group, dd-cfDNA > 50 copies/mL indicated a biopsy. Biopsies for clinical indication could be performed at any point during the study period in both groups. A protocol biopsy was scheduled after 12 months for patients without dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy or clinical indication biopsy until study completion. The primary endpoint was time from study inclusion to diagnosis of active or chronic active AMR.

Results

Thirty-nine of 40 patients had functioning grafts at study completion. From these, 26 patients underwent biopsy, 13 in each group. AMR was diagnosed earlier in the intervention group than in the control group [median 2.8 months, interquartile range (IQR) 1.7–5.3 vs median 14.5 months, IQR 13.3–16.7, P = 0.003]. Longitudinal dd-cfDNA monitoring had 77% positive predictive value and 85% negative predictive value for AMR.

Conclusions

Dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy in KTR with prevalent dnDSA can reduce the time to AMR diagnosis and hereby expedite therapy initiation.

### Dd-cfDNA and treg in prediction of kidney transplant acute rejection… [^0323a24f]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Dd-cfDNA and Treg in Prediction of Kidney Transplant Acute RejectionClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Background Despite advances in immunosuppression, 10-year graft survival after kidney transplantation has remained stagnant at around 50%. Timely diagnosis of acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients is essential for improving long-term graft survival. Clinical suspicion for acute rejection currently relies on monitoring elevation in serum creatinine and diagnostic confirmation with a kidney allograft biopsy. Serum creatinine elevation, however, is non-specific for acute rejection and is detected after significant immunological damage to the allograft already happens. Confirmation with a biopsy is invasive, associated with a 1% major complication rate, and subjected to inadequate sampling as well as expert reader variance.

Novel ways to monitor and diagnose acute rejection prior to immunological injury in a non-invasive fashion are needed in an effort to improve long-term graft survival after kidney transplantation. Cell-free DNA is normally released into the bloodstream when cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis. In the context of kidney transplantation and the presence of an allograft, donor-derived cell-free DNA is continuously shed into the bloodstream of the recipient as a result of allograft cell turnover and represents a small fraction of total cell-free DNA. Dd-cfDNA fraction is initially high from ischemia-reperfusion injury and usually decreases to a baseline level 10 to 14 days after kidney transplantation. Subsequently, episodes of allograft injury such as acute rejection leads to an increase in dd-cfDNA fraction into the recipient's bloodstream.

Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms-based multiplexed polymerase chain reaction technology and advanced bioinformatics, plasma dd-cfDNA fraction can now be measured in a kidney transplant recipient without the need for prior genotyping of the donor or the recipient. Recent studies have demonstrated that plasma dd-cfDNA is a promising novel method to detect acute rejection prior to immunological injury in a non-invasive fashion as it is elevated in advance and at the time of biopsy-proven acute rejection. A cutoff dd-cfDNA fraction greater or equal to 1% was able to predict acute rejection with moderate to good performance in those studies with area under the curves varying from 0. 59
- 0. 97 on receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. Collaborators and Investigators Principal Investigator: Minh-Tri Nguyen, MD PhD, Loma Linda University.

### Strategies to increase the donor pool and access to kidney transplantation: an international perspective [^6aa4788a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

STRATEGIES FOR EXPANDING THE DECEASED-DONOR POOL

Even for patients who are not sensitized, access to transplantation is limited by the increasing disparity between organ supply and demand. In an attempt to counter this trend and to manage the increasing proportion of older donors and donors with comorbidities, as well as the increasing number of elderly recipients, selection criteria for organ donors have been widened, leading to the use of donors that would have previously been deemed unsuitable.

Use of kidneys of suboptimal quality without compromising recipient's outcomes

Until the 1990s, organs from deceased donors over 55 years old were rarely used in transplantation. Thanks to the progressive improvement of the whole process of procurement and organ assessment, it became evident that age itself should not be a limiting parameter. However, the use of organs from elderly donors was associated with reduced graft function and reduced recipient and graft survival. To minimize this impact, age matching criteria between donors and recipients have been adopted in most European countries reasoning that elderly recipients have shorter life expectancy independently of the lifetime provided by the graft. Although somewhat shorter than the lifespan obtained with younger donors, recipients of kidneys from elderly donors still enjoy longer survival as compared with maintenance dialysis.

In the USA, despite implementation over 10 years ago of the ECD programme (the use of kidneys from donors older than 60 years or older than 50 years with at least two additional risk factors, offered with the potential incentive of earlier transplantation), the percentage of kidneys recovered but not transplanted remains over 40%. Major determinants of discard rates are biopsy findings on wedge biopsy (per cent glomerulosclerosis) and parameters of machine pump perfusion. The United Network of Organ Sharing Kidney Transplantation Committee has recently approved a new allocation policy, which will be implemented by the end of 2014. It is based on the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI), a numeric measure of donor quality. KDPI represents an improvement over the old ECD/standard criteria donor (SCD) dichotomy, by recognizing that not all ECD kidneys are alike. KDPI is a percentile rank, based on a number of donor risk indicators (KDPI = 85 means that 85% of donors are of better quality). Kidneys with KDPI > 85% are offered to a wider geographic area to promote broader sharing and to maximize utilization. Transplant programmes may choose to accept kidneys of different quality, depending on the age and the medical circumstances of each particular candidate, by establishing candidate-specific KDPI acceptability thresholds.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2018 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C [^5e94cf93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients with HCV — posttransplant testing and antiviral timing are addressed as follows. We are not aware of any high-quality evidence supporting routine HCV NAT after transplantation for kidney transplant recipients who achieved SVR12 before transplantation. Specifically, we neither support much of the notion that kidney transplantation might cause HCV infection to recur nor think that routine posttransplantation HCV NAT should be performed to confirm that HCV RNA remains undetectable. However, we support HCV NAT at least once after transplantation in specific situations, including: (1) transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney, (2) transplantation from an anti-HCV antibody–positive/NAT-negative donor, (3) transplantation with an increased risk kidney (as defined by the US Public Health Service), (4) liver dysfunction posttransplantation, and (5) glomerulonephritis posttransplantation. In the US context, we affirm that DAA treatment should be initiated posttransplantation for all recipients with HCV viremia to prevent the many potential complications of HCV infection in the setting of immunosuppression, and we think that treatment should be initiated as early as possible posttransplantation (eg, weeks to months posttransplantation). Trials indicate treatment in the first week posttransplantation can be comfortably integrated into usual care, and we advocate treatment with DAAs as early as the first week post-transplantation. To facilitate this, we suggest that the process of obtaining approval by third-party payer be initiated in the pretransplantation period. After HCV infection cure, these kidney recipients should be treated according to usual center guidelines for proteinuria screening and indications for kidney biopsy, and liver disease care should follow US general population HCV guidelines for patients who have achieved SVR12.

### Our approach to a renal transplant biopsy [^27c9d35f]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Kidney transplantation has become increasingly common in major health centres, making renal allograft evaluation through biopsy a common procedure. Early allograft dysfunction occurs in 30–50% of all transplants, while chronic graft failure is almost uniform at a rate of 2–4% a year. Allograft biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of graft dysfunction. Rejection, albeit the most important, is only one of many causes of allograft dysfunction. The widely accepted Banff classification has set criteria for the diagnosis of acute and chronic rejection. The major differential diagnoses are acute ischaemic injury, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (acute and chronic), infections, including pyelonephritis and polyomavirus nephropathy, chronic obstruction/reflux, hypertension, and recurrent and de novo disease. In this review, there is an outline of the Banff criteria and their implications, the various causes of graft dysfunction, and a discussion on morphological guidelines towards the various diagnoses.

### Prolonged normothermic perfusion of the kidney prior to transplantation: a historically controlled, phase 1 cohort study [^a1ecb192]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

NMP offers potential benefits in several distinct domains. Firstly, it may prove more efficacious than hypothermic preservation, defined as the ability to deliver an organ to a recipient in the same functional state as it was in whilst in the donor. Secondly, NMP may be valuable as assessment tool — there is preliminary evidence that safe transplantation of kidneys, declined on conventional clinical grounds, is possible after a period of NMP assessment. Finally, NMP may be useful as a platform on which the donor organ can be treated and modified, either to prepare the graft for the in-vivo reperfusion event, which it will undergo on transplantation, or to make it more compatible with the intended recipient.

In this work, we show that prolonged renal NMP prior to transplantation is safe and feasible. Longer perfusion durations are necessary for renal NMP to be a clinically useful technique in any of these domains and are enabled by an automated device that makes operator-independent, unsupervised preservation possible. Safe longer perfusion times make detailed ex-situ organ assessment (e.g. through biopsy, or measurement of biomarkers), delivery of treatment, and minimisation of cold ischaemia time (CIT) possible. The median CIT varies across different healthcare systems but is typically around 16 h –. We therefore sought to develop and evaluate a normothermic machine perfusion system and protocol suitable for ex-situ preservation of deceased-donor kidneys for up to 24 h prior to transplantation.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^84dbe65d]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplant recipients — protocol biopsies and subclinical acute rejection — evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is mixed: in patients (N = 72) on CsA, MMF and corticosteroids, detection and treatment resulted in better graft function; a larger multicenter RCT (N = 218) on tacrolimus, MMF and corticosteroids found protocol biopsies and treatment were not beneficial; and a single-center RCT of 102 recipients of living-donor kidneys reported improved graft function, while uncontrolled data suggest low clinical rejection incidence may make protocol biopsies inconvenient and costly.

### Preimplant histologic acute tubular necrosis and allograft outcomes [^907c7c30]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The influence of deceased-donor AKI on post-transplant outcomes is poorly understood. The few published studies about deceased-donor preimplant biopsy have reported conflicting results regarding associations between AKI and recipient outcomes.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This multicenter study aimed to evaluate associations between deceased-donor biopsy reports of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and delayed graft function (DGF), and secondarily for death-censored graft failure, first adjusting for the kidney donor risk index and then stratifying by donation after cardiac death (DCD) status.

Results

Between March 2010 and April 2012, 651 kidneys (369 donors, 4 organ procurement organizations) were biopsied and subsequently transplanted, with ATN reported in 110 (17%). There were 262 recipients (40%) who experienced DGF and 38 (6%) who experienced graft failure. DGF occurred in 45% of kidneys with reported ATN compared with 39% without ATN (P = 0.31) resulting in a relative risk (RR) of 1.13 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.9 to 1.43) and a kidney donor risk index-adjusted RR of 1.11 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.41). There was no significant difference in graft failure for kidneys with versus without ATN (8% versus 5%). In stratified analyses, the adjusted RR for DGF with ATN was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.34) for non-DCD kidneys and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23 to 2.06) for DCD kidneys (P = 0.02 for the interaction between ATN and DCD on the development of DGF).

Conclusions

Despite a modest association with DGF for DCD kidneys, this study reveals no significant associations overall between preimplant biopsy-reported ATN and the outcomes of DGF or graft failure. The potential benefit of more rigorous ATN reporting is unclear, but these findings provide little evidence to suggest that current ATN reports are useful for predicting graft outcomes or deciding to accept or reject allograft offers.

### The role of procurement biopsies in acceptance decisions for kidneys retrieved for transplant [^3f4f498c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

There is a shortage of kidneys for transplant, and many patients on the deceased donor kidney transplant waiting list would likely benefit from kidneys that are currently being discarded. In the United States, the most common reason given for discarding kidneys retrieved for transplant is procurement biopsy results. This study aimed to compare biopsy results from discarded kidneys with discard attributed to biopsy findings, with biopsy results from comparable kidneys that were successfully transplanted.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

In this retrospective, observational, case-control study, biopsy reports were examined from 83 kidneys discarded in 2010 due to biopsy findings (cases), 83 contralateral transplanted kidneys from the same donor (contralateral controls), and 83 deceased donors randomly matched to cases by donor risk profile (randomly matched controls). A second procurement biopsy was obtained in 64 of 332 kidneys (19.3%).

Results

The quality of biopsy reports was low, with amounts of tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammation, arteriolar hyalinosis, and acute tubular necrosis often not indicated; 69% were wedge biopsies and 94% used frozen tissue. The correlation between first and second procurement biopsies was poor; only 25% of the variability (R(2)) in glomerulosclerosis was explained by biopsies being from the same kidney. The percentages of glomerulosclerosis overlapped substantially between cases, contralateral controls, and randomly matched controls: 17.1% ± 15.3%, 9.0% ± 6.6%, and 5.0% ± 5.9%, respectively. Of all biopsy findings, only glomerulosclerosis > 20% was independently correlated with discard (cases versus contralateral controls; odds ratio, 15.09; 95% confidence interval, 2.47 to 92.41; P = 0.003), suggesting that only this biopsy result was used in acceptance decisions. One-year graft survival was 79.5% and 90.7% in contralateral and randomly matched controls, respectively, versus 91.6% among all deceased donor transplants in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.

Conclusions

Routine use of biopsies could lead to unnecessary kidney discards.

### Strategies to increase the donor pool and access to kidney transplantation: an international perspective [^1ba68f98]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

It should be noted that discard rates are much lower in Europe compared with the USA. In the beginning of 1999, the Eurotransplant foundation initiated a specific allocation scheme entitled the Eurotransplant Senior Programme (ESP) for donor kidneys older than 65 years. These kidneys are primarily allocated locally to wait-listed recipients older than 65 years in order to reduce cold ischaemic time and the rate of delayed graft function with the disadvantage of imperfect HLA matching. The main goal was to derive the most benefit from these marginal organs in terms of patient survival and to reduce the waiting time in elderly wait-listed patients. Indeed, it has been shown that graft and patient survival in participants of the ESP programme is not inferior to that of elderly recipients receiving a younger graft allocated through the routine Eurotransplant Kidney Allocation System (ETKAS) algorithm. In other countries, primarily Italy, the standardized assessment of a pre-transplant formalin-fixed biopsy is the key criterion by which the allocation of marginal donor organs is determined. It serves to establish which kidneys should be discarded or accepted, but also which kidneys should be allocated for dual transplantation. Suitable kidneys from donors aged 65 years or above can be allocated to younger donors, within pre-defined limits of donor–recipient age difference (e.g. ± 15–20 years). However, histologic scores are logistically difficult to implement in the allocation algorithm of most OPOs worldwide. Furthermore, the standardized assessment of pre-transplant formalin-fixed biopsy specimens requires a minimum of 4–5 h and may increase cold ischaemia times. Moreover, because results may show a great deal of variation between pathologists, it is advisable that OPOs have their own centralized pathological laboratory, with on-call pathologists 7 days a week.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^7e1617e0]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

What prior guidelines recommend — evaluation of hematuria in donor candidates includes defined tests and exclusions. Previous guidelines recommend that evaluation of donor candidates for causes of hematuria include urine culture and imaging, cystoscopy if older than 40 years, urine cytology and "complete" urological evaluation. A recent Canadian protocol recommends tests of urine culture, urine cytology, 24-hour urine calcium, metabolic stone workup, and then if the cause of hematuria is undetermined, cystoscopy and a native kidney biopsy. In the absence of an identified cause, evaluation by kidney biopsy has been advised if hematuria is ≥ 1+ or possibly caused by glomerular disease. Although many prior living donor guidelines recommend kidney biopsy for otherwise persistent microscopic hematuria before donation, few articulate criteria for donor selection. The 2011 British Transplantation Society offers a "moderate quality" recommendation that "glomerular pathology precludes donation, with the possible exception of thin basement membrane disease," and Canadian Blood Service's KPD protocol defines IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome (including carrier status) as exclusions to donation. The 2013 Expert Guidelines state that "Individuals with TBMN may be kidney donors if they have normal BP, proteinuria, and renal function" and "a biopsy is done and Alport syndrome is excluded," with close monitoring and nephroprotective strategies advised; they further state that "Living donation from families with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome, who have only one of the causative mutated alleles (parents, offspring, some siblings) may be kidney donors" provided specified clinical and genetic conditions are met.

Predonation hematuria — evaluation and selection criteria specify that donor candidates should be assessed for microscopic hematuria, and those with persistent microscopic hematuria should undergo testing to identify possible causes including urinalysis and urine culture to assess for infection, cystoscopy and imaging to assess for urinary tract malignancy, 24-hour urine stone panel to assess for nephrolithiasis and/or microlithiasis, and kidney biopsy to assess for glomerular disease; candidates with hematuria from a reversible cause that resolves may be acceptable for donation, whereas donor candidates with IgA nephropathy should not donate.

Overview of the consensus statements

Donors with acute kidney injury (with or without dialysis)

AKI is common in deceased donors (DDs) who are haemodynamically unstable after brain death, and kidneys from DDs with AKI are often discarded without evaluation (Table 2). Utilising these kidneys can significantly expand the donor pool. Studies show that KT from ECD kidneys, including those with AKI, results in similar recipient and graft survival rates compared to kidneys from standard criteria donors (SCD)., The risk of primary graft nonfunction is not higher for kidneys from donors with AKI. A multi-continent meta-analysis showed similar estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) at ≥ 12 months for recipients of kidneys from donors with or without AKI. Kidneys from donors with AKI and no significant cortical necrosis (< 10%) have similar outcomes to those from donors without AKI., However, the risk of graft failure increases with the severity of AKI, with a higher risk of delayed graft function (DGF) in more severe AKI stages. The Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine (ISCCM) recommends KT from DDs with AKI in selected cases, with decisions based on the AKI stage and procurement biopsy results (Fig. 1 A). According to the new Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network guidelines, procurement biopsies should be conducted on all deceased donors (DDs) with AKI that meet the specified criteria in Supplementary Table S3. If biopsy is not feasible, decisions should be based on clinical severity, degree of oliguria, and dialysis need. Kidneys from small paediatric donors with AKI also show high non-utilisation rates, but studies suggest they can be used for KT in children, with similar long-term outcomes. Experts recommend using a scoring system like the Maryland Aggregate Pathology Index (MAPI) to assess kidney quality before transplant. MAPI, based on histological features, predicts graft survival and is recommended for use in India. A low MAPI score (< 7) correlates with a 90% chance of graft survival, (Supplementary Table S4).

### Clinical role of the renal transplant biopsy [^d43c4b38]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous needle core biopsy is the definitive procedure by which essential diagnostic and prognostic information on acute and chronic renal allograft dysfunction is obtained. The diagnostic value of the information so obtained has endured for over three decades and has proven crucially important in shaping strategies for therapeutic intervention. This Review provides a broad outline of the utility of performing kidney graft biopsies after transplantation, highlighting the relevance of biopsy findings in the immediate and early post-transplant period (from days to weeks after implantation), the first post-transplant year, and the late period (beyond the first year). We focus on how biopsy findings change over time, and the wide variety of pathological features that characterize the major clinical diagnoses facing the clinician. This article also includes a discussion of acute cellular and humoral rejection, the toxic effects of calcineurin inhibitors, and the widely varying etiologies and characteristics of chronic lesions. Emerging technologies based on gene expression analyses and proteomics, the in situ detection of functionally relevant molecules, and new bioinformatic approaches that hold the promise of improving diagnostic precision and developing new, refined molecular pathways for therapeutic intervention are also presented.

CONCLUSION

Dd-cfDNA monitoring using absolute quantification and dd-cfDNA-guided biopsy in KTR with prevalent dnDSA can reduce the time to diagnosis of active or chronic active AMR in comparison with clinician-guided biopsy and can identify subclinical forms of AMR. Confirmation in larger multicenter studies including patients with incident dnDSA is needed.

### Machine learning-driven virtual biopsy system may increase organ discards at aggressive kidney transplant centers [^1c4d9f64]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

D. Yoo et al. Nature Communications 10.1038/s41467-023-44595-z (2024)

Over the recent years, organ shortage has resulted in expansion of kidney allograft acceptance criteria, including the use of organs from donors with high Kidney Donor Profile Index, high terminal creatinine, fibrin thrombi, metabolic disease, cardiovascular comorbidities or older age, with acceptable outcomes –. It has become increasingly common to review a preimplantation procurement biopsy, particularly on expanded criteria donors, to better characterize the deceased donor organ quality, optimize donor-recipient match, and obtain baseline kidney allograft histopathological characteristics should a post-transplant biopsy be needed.

Recently, concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and downstream sequelae of preimplantation biopsies: biopsies may be inadequate or result in a complication; they should be interpreted by trained nephropathologists and in a timely fashion, something often non-feasible. Biopsy misinterpretation may lead to unnecessary organ discards. Indeed, reportedly thousands of deceased-donor kidneys are annually discarded in the United States (US) due to unacceptable procurement biopsy reads. What is more, reproducibility of preimplantation biopsy findings is often poor. On an international multi-center study, the authors concluded that preimplantation kidney donor histology assessment did not add value to the organ allocation process but resulted in kidney discards of potentially usable organs. Also, preimplantation biopsy is costly and time-consuming. The precious time wasted awaiting the result, prolongs cold ischemia time. Accumulated cold ischemia time is associated with worse outcome, increased risk of organ decline by the transplant center, and ultimate non-use.

Yet, there is still an unmet need for a reliable method to assess the presence and severity of pertinent histopathological findings of the deceased donor kidney. The development of a machine learning tool employing basic donor variables may eliminate the inherent costs, delays, complication risk and interpretation bias. On this basis, a Machine-Learning Virtual Biopsy (VBx) model was published recently at Nature Communications. Yoo et al. used basic donor parameters to predict four Banff kidney lesions routinely used in deceased donor kidney transplant decision-making, namely arteriosclerosis (AS), arteriolar hyalinosis (AH), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), and percentile glomerular sclerosis (GS%). The model developed by the authors showed good performance on internal and external validation.

We endeavored to test this VBx model at an aggressive kidney transplant center in the United States.

### Banff histopathological consensus criteria for preimplantation kidney biopsies [^1a4a7817]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Numerous studies have addressed various issues related to preimplantation kidney biopsies and recommended a set of histopathologic parameters to be evaluated based on their predictive value for graft outcome 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Other investigators included clinical and additional histopathologic parameters in evaluation of donor kidneys 14, 15, 16, 17. Histopathologic scoring systems were suggested to assist decision making by transplant teams regarding organ acceptability for transplantation; however, none of the previously proposed scoring systems were as rigorously tested for reproducibility as in the current study. Furthermore, there is no widely accepted histopathologic scoring system for donor kidney biopsies (recently reviewed by Wang et al) 18. Reproducibility in our study is modest. In this regard, future studies should evaluate new histopathology metrics and tissue‐preparation techniques.

The significant disagreements among previous studies exist in part because of different methodologies applied to analysis, procurement and processing of donor biopsies 19, 20, 21. The significance of arterial intimal fibrosis was acknowledged both by Mazzucco et al and Bosmans et al 20, 21. A likely reason why different studies find different histologic lesions to be critical is that chronicity in any anatomic compartment is prognostic, but sampling considerations lead to different lesions being overrepresented in different biopsy sets. Thrombi were rare in our cohort; however, a recent study showed that thrombi can be missed due to sampling error even when kidney involvement is extensive 22.

### OPTN / SRTR 2023 annual data report: kidney [^cdf0aec3]. American Journal of Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2023, the field of kidney transplantation faced both successes and challenges. A record 28,142 total kidney transplants were achieved in the United States, largely due to an increase in deceased donor kidney transplants (DDKTs). While the number of adult candidates listed for DDKT slightly increased, it remained below the level in 2019, with 11.4% of candidates waiting 5 years or more. Across racial and ethnic groups, Black adult candidates had the largest increase in DDKT rate in 2023, in parallel with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy to modify waiting time (implemented January 5, 2023). Following increases in death rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, pretransplant mortality declined in 2023 across various age, race and ethnicity, sex, and blood type categories, although mortality continued to vary substantially by donation service area. The rate of deceased donor kidneys that were recovered for transplant but not transplanted (nonuse) increased to a notable high of 27.9%, from 26.6% in 2022, with even higher rates for biopsied kidneys (41.4%), those from donors aged 65 years or older (72.2%), and kidneys with a kidney donor profile index of 85% or higher (72.5%). In contrast, nonuse of kidneys recovered from hepatitis C virus nucleic acid test-positive donors declined to 27.2% in 2023, from 43.0% in 2017, likely reflecting more common use of protocols incorporating direct-acting antiviral therapy. Disparities in access to living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) persist and particularly affect non-White and publicly insured patients. Delayed graft function has risen over the past decade, but appears to have plateaued, at 26.1% overall for adult recipients in 2023. Five-year graft survival rates were 90.0% for LDKT compared with 82.2% for DDKT in recipients aged 18–34 years, and 80.2% for LDKT versus 66.1% for DDKT in those aged 65 years or older.

### The transcriptome of the implant biopsy identifies donor kidneys at increased risk of delayed graft function [^c6d73d74]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Improved assessment of donor organ quality at time of transplantation would help in management of potentially usable organs. The transcriptome might correlate with risk of delayed graft function (DGF) better than conventional risk factors. Microarray results of 87 consecutive implantation biopsies taken postreperfusion in 42 deceased (DD) and 45 living (LD) donor kidneys were compared to clinical and histopathology-based scores. Unsupervised analysis separated the 87 kidneys into three groups: LD, DD1 and DD2. Kidneys in DD2 had a greater incidence of DGF (38.1 vs. 9.5%, p < 0.05) than those in DD1. Clinical and histopathological risk scores did not discriminate DD1 from DD2. A total of 1051 transcripts were differentially expressed between DD1 and DD2, but no transcripts separated DGF from immediate graft function (adjusted p < 0.01). Principal components analysis revealed a continuum from LD to DD1 to DD2, i.e. from best to poorest functioning kidneys. Within DD kidneys, the odds ratio for DGF was significantly increased with a transcriptome-based score and recipient age (p < 0.03) but not with clinical or histopathologic scores. The transcriptome reflects kidney quality and susceptibility to DGF better than available clinical and histopathological scoring systems.

### Can only histological evaluation determine the allocation of ECD kidneys? [^3c3018d3]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

With the goal to find a tool for identification of ECD kidneys that can be accepted for tranplantation, Gandolfini et al. analyzed the contribution of donor biopsies in the acceptance or rejection of marginal kidneys. The majority of the kidneys in this study qualified to be extended criteria donor (ECD) kidneys, in this sense it may be considered as confirmatory study of a previous study by Remuzzi et al. Similar to the previous study by Remuzzi et al, the use of pretransplant biopsies increased utilization of marginal kidneys in this cohort of patients. The Authors also characterized these kidneys with the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) and used this for further analysis. They found that kidneys with the highest KDPI might have superior outcomes with a lower Remuzzi score than those with a higher score. The results of the current study are far from definitive in the controversy over the utility of pretransplant biopsies, but offer added evidence that perhaps in marginal/ECD/high KDPI kidneys biopsy data may have some incremental utility. The study by Gandolfini et al. gives an opportunity to reflect on the role of KDPI scoring system which is not a decision tool but only a score for better characterizing potential organ donors.

In order to reduce discard rate of marginal kidneys a potential option is to allocate them as a DKT. In Europe DKT proved to be a successful strategy for compensating the declining number of cadaver donor kidney transplants. On the other hand DKT is not a part of the allocation system in US and comprises less than 2% of the deceased donor transplants performed. The criteria proposed by UNOS recommend consideration of DKT if any two of the following criteria exist: donor age greater than 60 years; estimated donor creatinine clearance less than 65 ml/min, rising serum creatinine (greater than 2,5 mg/dl) at time of retrieval; history of medical disease in donor (defined as either longstanding hypertension or diabetes mellitus); adverse donor kidney histology, which is defined as moderate to severe glomerulosclerosis (greater than 15% and less than 50%). Potential factors associated with low utilization of DKT in US are higher surgical risk, longer ischemic time and the uncertainty in determining which organs are suitable for single versus dual use.

### Textbook outcome as a quality metric in living and deceased donor kidney transplantation [^5f49af0f]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Using multidisciplinary input from our institution's kidney transplantation team and our outcomes research group, an initial list of parameters defining TO after kidney transplantation was created. Consideration was given to relevant clinical outcomes, complications, efficient resource use, and patient satisfaction. This ideal list was then narrowed to data available from the United Network for Organ Sharing to create a final and nationally measurable definition of TO after kidney transplantation (Table 1; complete details provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Table 1.
Textbook Outcomes after Kidney Transplantation

Standard transplantation analysis and research file data for kidney transplant recipients undergoing transplantation between 2013 and 2017 were queried (based on Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data as of September 2021). Exclusion criteria included recipient age younger than 18 years, multi-organ transplantation, and re-transplantation within 1 year. Recipients with a missing covariate (not including warm ischemia time for deceased from cardiac death [DCD] donors and percent glomerulosclerosis for biopsied kidneys) were excluded from this complete-case analysis. Covariates were chosen (Table 2; complete details provided in Supplemental Digital Content 2,), and bivariate analysis of donor and recipient characteristics was performed using Welch's t -test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. Supplemental Digital Content 3 and 4 list the percentage of data missing for each covariate.

### Banff histopathological consensus criteria for preimplantation kidney biopsies [^fb031ab1]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Such discrepant results have caused ambiguity. It is unclear whether donor kidney biopsies are able to minimize inappropriate discard of marginal organs. Many investigators are seeking additional prognostic information beyond histopathology. Reese et al, for example, explored the role of urine biomarkers and showed an association of high urinary neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin and liver‐type fatty acid binding protein concentrations with lower recipient estimated glomerular filtration rate at 6 mo and good correlation with donor acute kidney injury but found no predictive value for DGF or early allograft dysfunction after transplantation 23. It appears that the fundamental question of how best to predict deceased donor kidney function after transplantation remains elusive. Our study shows that histopathologic parameters in the donor biopsy may be useful but do not all correlate with graft outcome; however, the study is limited by selection bias. Only allografts that are clinically acceptable for transplantation have outcome data. Nonetheless, our results are in agreement with previously published studies 20, 21, 24, 25. Perhaps the difficulty lies in discriminating between changes related to normal aging without significant kidney dysfunction and changes, possibly related to aging, that are predictive of graft outcome. This line of questioning is an ongoing investigation 26.

The working group developed a consensus scoring sheet for donor biopsies, as shown in Figure 2. Following extensive debate, a simplified scoring schema was determined, distinct from Banff scoring for indication biopsies. During this study, we found nonuniformity across multiple institutions with regard to scoring parameters in actual procurement practices. We found, for example, that most centers use wedge biopsies because of perceived higher risk for bleeding associated with needle core biopsies; however, others found needle biopsies acceptable 27. Our study shows some superiority of frozen wedge versus needle core biopsies. This may be related to the lack of standardization of needle biopsies. Different needle gauges lead to different degrees of sampling that are not apparent in standardized wedge biopsies. Banff participants expressed the opinion that there are technical difficulties in cutting 18‐gauge needle core biopsies, resulting in inadequate material for frozen section interpretation (data not shown). Needle biopsies are perceived to be more likely to damage larger caliber medullary vessels. The possibility of using punch biopsies instead was suggested, but most in the working group thought that an ample wedge biopsy with good cortical sampling is more likely to yield sufficient number of glomeruli and is likely superior to needle or punch biopsies. We also found that wedge biopsies were often subcapsular and not deep enough to capture vessels (data not shown).

### Use of preprocurement biopsy in donation after circulatory death liver transplantation [^cfe02502]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

From an organizational standpoint, preprocurement liver biopsy can help to optimize human and equipment resources. In the case of a liver‐only potential donor, a preprocurement biopsy may prevent the unnecessary deployment of resources for a nontransplantable organ. In the evolving era of machine perfusion of liver allografts and the increasing use of normothermic regional perfusion, having pathologic information available prior to recovery can further optimize resource allocation and the use of marginal grafts.

There are a number of limitations to the current study primarily owing to its design as a retrospective review of a limited database, including the lack of tracking of biopsy‐related complications outside of lost donors as described previously and an inability to correlate recipient outcomes after transplant from biopsied versus not‐biopsied livers. In addition, our review included only donors — that is, those individuals who deteriorated to death with at least one organ recovered with intent to transplant. Not included are those potential donors who did not die within a time frame suitable even for kidney donation or patients referred as potential donors who were excluded from donation; data on these individuals and intent for transplant prior to recovery would give us a better idea of the impact of preprocurement biopsy in this setting. Moreover, data entered at the time of recovery are primarily in preset categories and variables; lack of granularity for some variables (e.g. those organs deemed not transplantable for an unspecified reason) limits our review. However, frequency of organs deemed not transplantable either for WIT or for an unspecified reason was relatively low and similar between the biopsied and not‐biopsied groups.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the care of kidney transplant recipients [^ed77cad8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Medium credibility.

KDIGO kidney allograft biopsy — Increases in serum creatinine: Although serum creatinine has many limitations for estimating GFR, an unexplained rise in serum creatinine is generally indicative of a decline in GFR, and only a persistent increase that is outside normal variability is clinically relevant; a 25–50% increase over baseline is often arbitrarily used in studies, and at least one study suggested that a persistent 30% rise in serum creatinine was an excellent predictor of subsequent graft failure. Causes of acute, reversible declines in GFR should be ruled out, including dehydration, urinary obstruction and CNI toxicity (by demonstrating high blood levels), before a biopsy is performed; if there are no apparent causes of a decline in GFR, then an allograft biopsy is generally warranted to detect the nature of potentially treatable causes of kidney injury, including rejection, infections like BKV nephropathy, recurrent or de novo kidney disease or infiltration within posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease.

### Procurement biopsies in the evaluation of deceased donor kidneys [^fd7ceed7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Biopsies taken at deceased donor kidney procurement continue to be cited as a leading reason for discard; however, the reproducibility and prognostic capability of these biopsies are controversial.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We compiled a retrospective, single-institution, continuous cohort of deceased donor kidney transplants performed from 2006 to 2009. Procurement biopsy information-percentage of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, and vascular disease-was obtained from the national transplant database. Using univariable, multivariable, and time-to-event analyses for death-censored graft survival, we compared procurement frozen section biopsy reports with reperfusion paraffin-embedded biopsies read by trained kidney pathologists (n = 270). We also examined agreement for sequential procurement biopsies performed on the same kidney (n = 116 kidneys).

Results

For kidneys on which more than one procurement biopsy was performed (n = 116), category agreement was found in only 64% of cases (κ = 0.14). For all kidneys (n = 270), correlation between procurement and reperfusion biopsies was poor: overall, biopsies were classified into the same category (optimal versus suboptimal) in only 64% of cases (κ = 0.25). This discrepancy was most pronounced when categorizing percentage of glomerulosclerosis, which had 63% agreement (κ = 0.15). Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy and vascular disease had agreement rates of 82% (κ = 0.13) and 80% (κ = 0.15), respectively. Ninety-eight (36%) recipients died, and 56 (21%) allografts failed by the end of follow-up. Reperfusion biopsies were more prognostic than procurement biopsies (hazard ratio for graft failure, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 3.74 versus hazard ratio for graft failure, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 2.76), with procurement biopsies not significantly associated with graft failure.

Conclusions

We found that procurement biopsies are poorly reproducible, do not correlate well with paraffin-embedded reperfusion biopsies, and are not significantly associated with transplant outcomes.

### Utilization of kidneys with similar kidney donor risk index values from standard versus expanded criteria donors [^a8b9aa13]. American Journal of Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

With the shortage of standard criteria donor (SCD) kidneys, efficient expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidney utilization has become more vital. We investigated the effects of the ECD label on kidney recovery, utilization and outcomes. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from November 2002 to May 2010, we determined recovery and transplant rates, and modeled discard risk, for kidneys within a range of kidney donor risk index (KDRI) 1.4–2.1 that included both SCD and ECD kidneys. To further compare similar quality kidneys, these kidneys were again divided into three KDRI intervals. Overall, ECD kidneys had higher recovery rates, but lower transplant rates. However, within each KDRI interval, SCD and ECD kidneys were transplanted at similar rates. Overall, there was increased risk for discard for biopsied kidneys. SCD kidneys in the lower two KDRI intervals had the highest risk of discard if biopsied. Pumped kidneys had a lower risk of discard, which was modulated by KDRI for SCD kidneys but not ECD kidneys. Although overall ECD graft survival was worse than SCD, there were no differences within individual KDRI intervals. Thus, ECD designation adversely affects neither utilization nor outcomes beyond that predicted by KDRI.

### Molecular profile of urine extracellular vesicles from normo-functional kidneys reveal minimal differences between living and deceased donors [^9e2b93eb]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this pilot study, we aimed to characterise the miRNA and protein profiles of SEC-isolated uEVs from living and deceased kidney donors to profile the organ status before Kidney transplantation (KTx). Several factors account for the outcome of KTx, including those related to the characteristics of the donor. Although one of the most important factors directly affecting KTx outcome is the time of cold ischemia, which is usually longer in DD organs, an additional factor to be considered is the status of the organ before the extraction. This could be affected by several factors such as age, donor general condition, or cause of death in DDs. In these aspects, the cohort of patients included in this pilot study shared the same characteristics of larger reported cohorts in terms of mean age and cold ischemia time in DD.

Acceptance of a given organ for transplantation is currently based on clinical and histopathological parameters. The latter are based on a kidney biopsy prior to transplantation, performed only under some circumstances -such as donors aged > 60 years old, or suffering from cardiovascular disorders-, with the aim to verify the quality of the kidney. Yet, as biopsy sampling variability and differences in criteria of analysis may lead to different assessment of the quality of the organ, gathering additional information (such that found in uEVs) may be of help defining clearer criteria for organ acceptance.

Given that organ transplant donor characteristics are evolving to older donors (most of them with chronic pathologies) pre-transplant biopsy in these expanded criteria donors is highly recommended to evaluate the state of the organ. As kidney biopsies have limitations, there is a need to improve the analysis of the kidney status prior to transplantation. In this context, the content of uEVs that come from the excretory system may be of interest. Several studies have already shown that urinary EVs may contain specific signatures which may potentially serve as biomarkers of disease. Similarly, normal kidneys also produce EVs, and their specific profile may be indicative of the physiological status of each particular organ. Profiling some specific markers found in urinary EVs may be of clear interest in this particular scenario as a source of non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers on the kidney status before nephrectomy.

### A machine learning-driven virtual biopsy system for kidney transplant patients [^bb658cb6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

The population consisted of living or deceased and transplanted or discarded adult donors for kidney transplantation enrolled from January 1st, 2000, to December 31st, 2021, who underwent kidney biopsies performed prior to kidney transplantation as part of standard of care. For the derivation cohort, the study involved 15 centers including 14 institutions from seven countries (France, Belgium, Croatia, Spain, United States, Canada, and Australia) and the largest OPO in the USA (OneLegacy). For the external validation cohorts, two institutions from two countries were involved: Columbia university medical center from the USA and Sun-Yat-sen university from China. A total of 15,121 kidney biopsies were assessed overall. Exclusion criteria were inadequate biopsies according to Banff international classification requirements (n = 1089, 7.2%). A total of 14,032 kidney allograft biopsies were included for the final analyses including 1372 (9.8%) from discarded kidneys. Among them, 12,402 were in the derivation cohort and 1630 were in the external validation cohorts.

### Expanded criteria donor kidney allocation: marked decrease in cold ischemia and delayed graft function at a single center [^f161f3fa]. American Journal of Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidney allocation aims to increase utilization and facilitate placement. We implemented an ECD program for pre-consented candidates and studied whether ECD allocation decreased cold ischemia time and delayed graft function (DGF). We compared donor, recipient and transplant data for ECD transplants performed during the first year of our program to those performed in the preceding 5 1/2 years. Logistic regression identified risk factors for DGF. Of 356 candidates, 107 (30%) consented, 32 (9%) completed evaluation and 20 (6%) underwent ECD transplantation during the program's first year. The recent and historical ECD cohorts had similar donor and recipient characteristics, except that recent ECD recipients were older. The rate of donor kidney biopsy dropped from 85% to 24% (p < 0.001). Cold ischemia time decreased from 16.4 to 7.4 h (p < 0.001), as did the incidence of DGF from 43% to 15% (p = 0.031). Three independent risk factors for DGF emerged: recipient height (OR 1.21/10 cm; p = 0.008), > 4 HLA mismatches (OR 20.46; p = 0.0033) and cold ischemia time (OR 1.24/h; p = 0.0036). We conclude the ECD designation provides a description of kidney quality that may obviate biopsy. ECD allocation decreased cold ischemia time and DGF, which may improve graft survival.
