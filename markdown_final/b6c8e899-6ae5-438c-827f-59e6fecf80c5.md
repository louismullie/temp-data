## Question

Is a 4+ candida albicans/dubliniensis result considered normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a "4+ Candida albicans/dubliniensis" culture result is considered normal or not, and how to interpret it, especially across different specimen sources and host contexts, with guideline support, risk stratification, and next steps for workup and treatment decisions, if indicated [^112z1b2x] [^1145i9b4] [^116Zw9Fd] [^114JCvw5]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "4+" semi-quantitative growth typically signifies in the laboratory. Then, I should verify the anatomic source of the specimen because sterile versus non-sterile sites fundamentally change interpretation. Next, I need to review host risk factors and symptoms to distinguish colonization from infection. After that, I should confirm what major guidelines recommend for species-level identification, susceptibility testing, and adjunct diagnostics. Finally, I will synthesize whether 4+ can ever be "normal", clarify when it indicates disease, and outline practical next steps for clinicians and patients [^112z1b2x] [^1145i9b4] [^116Zw9Fd] [^114JCvw5].

> Let me first confirm the meaning of "4+" on a semi-quantitative scale; in routine clinical microbiology, ordinal scales from 1+ to 4+ generally reflect increasing organism burden, with 4+ indicating heavy growth, but wait, I should verify that this aligns with the specific laboratory's reporting scheme because grading conventions can vary across institutions even if the general interpretation of "heavy growth" holds [^113b5usu] [^114qACBY].

> Now, let me consider the baseline biology of these organisms before jumping to conclusions; Candida albicans commonly colonizes human mucosa and skin as a commensal yet is an opportunistic pathogen when host defenses or barriers are compromised, whereas Candida dubliniensis is less frequently found in healthy individuals but has been documented in oral niches, especially among people with HIV, so both species can exist as colonizers or as pathogens depending on context [^1154gr4q] [^112XqKkH] [^117UB6uW].

> Hold on, I should verify the specimen source because that is pivotal for interpretation; if the isolate came from a sterile site such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural or peritoneal fluid, or deep tissue, any growth of Candida is clinically significant and not normal, whereas if the isolate is from a non-sterile site such as the oral cavity, sputum, skin, vagina, or a superficial wound, heavy growth might still represent colonization or overgrowth, but it requires careful clinical correlation to determine if it reflects true infection rather than mere carriage [^1145i9b4] [^114JCvw5] [^113b5usu].

> I need to check host risk factors and symptoms next; in immunocompromised patients, those in intensive care, individuals with intravascular devices, recent broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, diabetes, or breaches of mucocutaneous barriers, heavy Candida growth is more likely to indicate clinically meaningful infection and warrants prompt evaluation, whereas in immunocompetent hosts, colonization is common but a 4+ result, especially with compatible symptoms or signs of inflammation, should still trigger assessment rather than being dismissed as "normal" [^116PoHw5] [^114GJcjA] [^1145i9b4].

> Let me verify guideline-directed diagnostics to avoid premature conclusions; major guidelines recommend species-level identification for clinically relevant Candida isolates and obtaining antifungal susceptibility testing when treatment is contemplated, with consideration of molecular tools and serum biomarkers alongside clinical parameters when invasive disease is suspected, but wait, biomarkers should not be used in isolation and clinical context remains decisive [^112z1b2x] [^116Zw9Fd] [^114qACBY] [^113XmNNT] [^114qkQTs] [^111g6xN6].

> I will now examine the central question and synthesize; a "4+ Candida albicans/dubliniensis" result is not considered normal from a sterile site because any growth there represents infection requiring treatment, and from a non-sterile site, 4+ indicates heavy overgrowth that is atypical for healthy colonization and should not be labeled "normal" without correlating to symptoms, host factors, and the clinical scenario, as heavy growth increases the likelihood of disease in vulnerable hosts and may herald progression if left unchecked [^1145i9b4] [^114JCvw5] [^112z1b2x].

> But wait, what if this was a non-sterile mucosal source and the patient is asymptomatic and immunocompetent; I should double-check that even then, the prudent approach is clinical surveillance and risk assessment rather than reflex treatment, whereas in symptomatic patients or those with risk factors, I need to ensure timely therapy guided by species identification and susceptibilities, recognizing that Candida dubliniensis can be misidentified and that accurate speciation methods may be necessary to inform optimal management [^116PoHw5] [^116Zw9Fd] [^114qACBY] [^114HP5Px].

> Next, I should review actionable next steps to keep this clinically useful; confirm the specimen source and collection method, reassess host risk factors and local/systemic signs, obtain or confirm species-level identification and antifungal susceptibility if treatment is being considered, avoid relying on a single biomarker result in isolation, and in candidemia follow IDSA guidance for serial blood cultures to document clearance while managing sources such as catheters and initiating appropriate antifungal therapy if invasive disease is suspected or confirmed [^113b5usu] [^116Zw9Fd] [^114JgPsT] [^113XmNNT] [^1145i9b4].

No, a **4+ Candida albicans/dubliniensis** result is not normal and indicates **heavy colonization or infection**; it warrants **clinical evaluation and management**. C. albicans is a common commensal [^1154gr4q], but this high load suggests **overgrowth**, particularly in **immunocompromised or high-risk patients** [^1145i9b4]. C. dubliniensis is less common and more often associated with immunocompromised hosts, particularly HIV-positive individuals [^117UB6uW]. Management should include species-level identification [^112z1b2x], antifungal susceptibility testing [^116Zw9Fd], and targeted therapy; **echinocandins** are preferred for severe or invasive disease [^1145i9b4].

---

## Clinical significance of 4+ candida albicans/dubliniensis

A **4+ result** reflects heavy growth on semi-quantitative culture, indicating significant colonization or infection rather than normal commensal presence and requiring further evaluation and management.

---

## Normal colonization levels

At normal colonization levels, **Candida albicans** commonly colonizes mucosal surfaces (oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, vagina) in healthy individuals [^1154gr4q], typically at low levels without causing disease [^115Hhu6G]. **Candida dubliniensis** is less common in healthy hosts and more often associated with immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV infection [^117UB6uW]. A 4+ growth level is **not considered normal** for either species and indicates abnormal overgrowth or infection.

---

## Clinical implications of heavy candida growth

Heavy growth of Candida albicans or Candida dubliniensis can lead to **various clinical manifestations**, including:

- **Mucosal infections**: Oral thrush, esophagitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117So23u].

- **Cutaneous infections**: Intertrigo, diaper dermatitis [^112XqKkH].

- **Invasive infections**: Candidemia [^114JCvw5], endocarditis, meningitis, ocular infections (endophthalmitis) [^11535MLu].

Heavy colonization or infection is particularly concerning in **immunocompromised patients**, such as those with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy [^1145i9b4].

---

## Risk factors for heavy candida colonization or infection

Several factors **predispose** individuals to heavy colonization or infection with Candida species:

- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, corticosteroid use, immunosuppressive medications [^1145i9b4].

- **Antibiotic use**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics disrupting normal microbiota [^114JCvw5].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Poor glycemic control [^116G8SKE].

- **Medical devices**: Indwelling catheters, prosthetic devices [^1129U6FA].

- **Hospitalization**: Intensive care unit stays, prolonged hospitalization [^114GJcjA].

## Diagnostic methods for differentiating candida albicans and candida dubliniensis

Accurate identification of Candida species is essential for **appropriate management**. Diagnostic methods include:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Accuracy** |
|-|-|-|
| Chromogenic agar | Differentiates species based on colony color | High [^115yr5Je] |
| MALDI-TOF MS | Rapid species-level identification | High [^114wQKYD] |
| PCR | Molecular identification of species-specific genes | High [^114qACBY] |
| Biochemical tests | Traditional phenotypic identification | Moderate [^113VJ6fu] |

---

## Clinical management of heavy candida colonization or infection

Management strategies depend on the **clinical context and patient risk factors**:

- **Antifungal therapy**: Fluconazole for mild infections; echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin) or amphotericin B for severe or invasive infections [^116Zw9Fd] [^112z1b2x].

- **Removal of predisposing factors**: Discontinuation of antibiotics, removal of indwelling devices, improved glycemic control [^1145i9b4].

- **Monitoring and follow-up**: Regular clinical assessment and repeat cultures to ensure clearance of infection [^114JgPsT].

---

## Potential complications of untreated heavy candida colonization

Untreated heavy colonization or infection can cause **invasive candidiasis** — bloodstream infections, endocarditis, and meningitis — as well as chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with persistent infections of skin, nails, and mucosa [^114JCvw5]. It can also promote antifungal resistance due to prolonged colonization or inadequate treatment [^1129U6FA].

---

## Conclusion

A 4+ Candida albicans/dubliniensis result is **not normal** and indicates significant colonization or infection. This finding requires **clinical evaluation** [^116PoHw5], **species-level identification** [^114wQKYD], and appropriate antifungal management to prevent complications [^116Zw9Fd].

### Skin immunity to Candida albicans [^112XqKkH]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a dimorphic commensal fungus that colonizes healthy human skin, mucosa, and the reproductive tract. C. albicans is also a predominantly opportunistic fungal pathogen, leading to disease manifestations such as disseminated candidiasis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). The differing host susceptibilities for the sites of C. albicans infection have revealed tissue compartmentalization with tailoring of immune responses based on the site of infection. Furthermore, extensive studies of host genetics in rare cases of CMC have identified conserved genetic pathways involved in immune recognition and the response to the extracellular pathogen. We focus here on human and mouse skin as a site of C. albicans infection, and we review established and newly discovered insights into the cellular pathways that promote cutaneous antifungal immunity.

### Environmental source of Candida dubliniensis [^117UB6uW]. Emerging infectious diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The ever-increasing number of immunosuppressed individuals has led to a marked rise in opportunistic infections, particularly those caused by fungi. Candida albicans is the yeast species most commonly associated with oropharyngeal and systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised patients. However, the last two decades have seen an increase in infections by other Candida species, including Candida dubliniensis, which was first recognized as distinct from C. albicans in 1995 in Ireland. C. dubliniensis has been recovered mainly from the oral cavities of HIV-infected persons but also from the lungs, vaginas, blood, and feces. Occasionally, this organism causes fatal systemic infections. Isolates are assigned to four genotypes, defined by the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer regions of the rRNA gene.

C. dubliniensis is globally distributed. In HIV-infected patients, the oral prevalence is 1.5%–32%. In healthy individuals not infected with HIV, C. dubliniensis is absent or rare; however, 14% of healthy Caucasians in a South African study had oral C. dubliniensis. Like C. albicans, C. dubliniensis may be part of the normal oral microbial flora of humans, and oral candidosis may result from the overgrowth of resident strains. In contrast to other Candida species, some of which are associated with birds, C. dubliniensis has not been found in nonhuman environmental sources at the time of writing. This has led to speculation that the species may be restricted to humans, possibly occupying sites deep within the oropharynx or upper respiratory tract.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^1154gr4q]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of most people and a pathogen in the immunocompromised or in patients where barriers preventing dissemination have been disrupted. Both the commensal and pathogenic states involve regulation and adaptation to the host microenvironment. The pathogenic potential can be downregulated to sustain commensalism or upregulated to damage host tissue and evade immune surveillance. In either case, it seems the cell biology of this fungus has evolved to establish different types of relationships with the human host. Here we summarize the latest advances in understanding the mechanisms that enable C. albicans to occupy different body sites while avoiding elimination by the sentinel activities of the human immune system.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: An initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^111g6xN6]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, specifically concerning molecular tests, the ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of molecular-based tools (PCR or time-to-target testing) combined with various biomarkers for the diagnosis of candidemia. This is particularly important in the absence of established alternative methods, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, or when rapid identification of potentially problematic species, such as Candida auris, is needed.

### Epidemiological study of Candida species in cutaneous candidiasis based on PCR using a primer mix specific for the DNA topoisomerase II gene [^115DgfwM]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2005). Low credibility.

We have previously reported a PCR-based identification system for pathogenic fungi by targeting the DNA topoisomerase II gene, in which primer mixes specific for this gene were used for the PCR amplifications.

- **Objective**: To test the potential of the PCR using a primer mix that is specific for the DNA topoisomerase II gene, designated as PsVIc, for rapid identification of Candida species involved in cutaneous candidiasis, and to define the relation between Candida species and the infection lesion.

- **Methods**: Scales from 48 patients with cutaneous candidiasis were cultured on GYEP agar plates. The genomic DNAs were purified from the colonies and used as DNA templates for PCR amplifications. Candida was identified as individual species based on the sizes of the PCR products generated in the PCR amplifications using PsVlc.

- **Results**: Four Candida species (five genotypes; Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis I, Candida parapsilosis II, and Candida tropicalis II) were identified in the patients' scales. In 19 of the patients (39.6%), multiple PCR products (two or three bands) were amplified in a DNA sample, especially derived from scales at the groin of bed-ridden older patients using napkins.

- **Conclusion**: The PCR-based identification using the primer mix was useful for an epidemiological study of Candida species in cutaneous candidiasis.

### Cases of endophthalmitis caused by Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis identified via internal transcribed spacer deep sequencing [^115gRo1k]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Candida is the most common fungal pathogen; it is associated with catheter infections, bursa abscesses, and trauma. Ocular candidiasis occurs in 10% of patients with candidemia, necessitating the recommendation of performing a fundus examination in all patients with this condition. Candida species are the predominant pathogens responsible for ocular infections in compromised hosts, accounting for 97% of fungal pathogens. Notably, Candida albicans is detected in 60–65% of cases of fungal endophthalmitis. However, the prevalence of non-albicans Candida species, such as Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida dubliniensis, is gradually increasing. In particular, Candida dubliniensis is closely related to Candida albicans and represents a major issue for public health because of its drug resistance potential.

Identifying pathogens comprehensively, especially fungi, proves challenging with established detection methods such as PCR and culture. This difficulty arises due to the need for optimized culture conditions and primer sets. Consequently, culture-based identification of fungi typically requires at least 7 days to 2 weeks. Existing primer sets are limited to identifying specific fungal species through PCR-mediated amplification of 18–28 S rRNA. However, recently developed next-generation sequencing platforms have enabled metagenomic analyses using fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA sequences, facilitating comprehensive fungal identification. The ITS region has a high degree of sequence variation, providing a basis for the identification of fungi at the species level.

### ESCMID guideline for the diagnosis and management of Candida diseases 2012: Diagnostic procedures [^114QzPqw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

As the mortality associated with invasive Candida infections remains high, it is important to make optimal use of available diagnostic tools to initiate antifungal therapy as early as possible and to select the most appropriate antifungal drug. A panel of experts from the European Fungal Infection Study Group (EFISG) of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) undertook a data review and compiled guidelines for the clinical utility and accuracy of different diagnostic tests and procedures for the detection of Candida infections. Recommendations about the microbiological investigation and detection of candidaemia, invasive candidiasis, chronic disseminated candidiasis, and oropharyngeal, oesophageal, and vaginal candidiasis were included. In addition, remarks about antifungal susceptibility testing and therapeutic drug monitoring were made.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^115HfbiJ]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

- **The cell biology of Candida albicans**: This organism is adapted for life both as a commensal and as a pathogen. It is capable of modulating its virulence properties in the human host, either by downregulating or upregulating them. Additionally, the fungus can influence the activity of phagocytes to ensure its survival.
- **Metabolic flexibility**: Candida exhibits metabolic flexibility, allowing it to survive across multiple niches within the host.

### Coping with Candida infections [^114GJcjA]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2010). Low credibility.

Although Candida spp. exist as normal flora on much of the human body, life-threatening invasive infections by these organisms have increased in recent decades. Candida spp. are now one of the most common causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections worldwide, and patients with critical illness or malignant disease demonstrate particular susceptibility. Risk factors are identifiable for virtually all patients who develop invasive candidiasis, and clinicians must maintain vigilance for Candida infections in the appropriate clinical context, given the attributable mortality. This review addresses the clinical and molecular epidemiology of invasive Candida infections, common clinical manifestations, available diagnostic methods, and recommendations for initial therapy.

### Environmental source of Candida dubliniensis [^112dZ4qc]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

- **Phenotypic characteristics**: The phenotypic characteristics of environmental *Candida dubliniensis* isolates and the reference strain of *C. albicans* are exhibited in Figure 1. Morphology of pseudohyphal terminal chlamydospores of *C. albicans* (ATCC90028) and *C. dubliniensis* SL370 grown at 37°C on Corn Meal Tween 80 agar is shown with a magnification of × 50. The growth of representative Great Saltee (SL) isolates on Sabouraud agar after 48 hours of incubation at 37°C and 43°C is demonstrated. This includes *C. albicans* (ATCC90028), *C. dubliniensis* (NCPF3949), and *C. dubliniensis* SL370, SL397, SL407, and SL410, arranged clockwise from the top in each panel.

- **Substrate assimilation**: Table 2 details substrate assimilation by Great Saltee fungi and *Candida albicans*. Results for 48 hours are presented, with all 22 Great Saltee isolates showing similar profiles. By 72 hours, all Saltee isolates displayed some assimilation of trehalose, with varying degrees of assimilation observed among isolates.

- **Genetic alignment**: Figure 2 illustrates the alignment of the ITS1 5.8S ITS2 DNA region of *Candida dubliniensis* Saltee (SL) isolates with representative human isolates of genotypes 1–4. All polymorphic sites are presented: ITS1 (bp 32–137), 5.8S rRNA exon (bp 312–315), ITS2 (bp 358–450). Dots signify identity, while highlighted dashes indicate gaps in the alignment. GenBank accession numbers include AJ311895 (CD33 genotype 1), AJ311896 (CD520 genotype 2), AJ311897 (CD519 genotype 3), AJ311898 (p7718 genotype 4), AB049119 (*C. albicans* ATCC90028), and EF032487–EF032495 for SL375–1, SL397, SL375–2, SL387, SL407, SL410, SL411, SL417, SL422, respectively.

### Candidemia and invasive candidiasis [^117QjCCB]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a collective term that refers to a group of infectious syndromes caused by a variety of species of Candida, six of which cause most cases globally. Candidemia is probably the most commonly recognized syndrome associated with IC. However, Candida can cause invasive infection of any organ, especially visceral organs, vasculature, bones and joints, the eyes and central nervous system.

Targeted prevention and empirical therapy are important interventions for patients at high risk for IC; the approach should be based on a combination of clinical risk factors and non-culture-based diagnostics, when available.

### Comparison of the hydrophobic properties of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis [^114oH2Pu]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Although Candida dubliniensis is a close genetic relative of Candida albicans, it colonizes and infects fewer sites. Nearly all instances of candidiasis caused by C. dubliniensis are restricted to the oral cavity. As cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) influences the virulence of C. albicans, CSH properties of C. dubliniensis were investigated and compared to those of C. albicans. Growth temperature is one factor that affects the CSH status of stationary-phase C. albicans. However, C. dubliniensis, similar to other pathogenic non-albicans species of Candida, was hydrophobic regardless of growth temperature.

For all Candida species tested in this study (C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis), CSH status correlated with coaggregation with the anaerobic oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. Previous studies have shown that the CSH status of C. albicans involves multiple surface proteins and surface protein N-glycans.

The hydrophobic surface glycoprotein CAgp38 appears to be expressed by C. albicans constitutively, regardless of growth temperature and medium. C. dubliniensis expresses a 38-kDa protein that cross-reacts with the anti-CAgp38 monoclonal antibody; however, expression of the protein was growth medium and growth temperature dependent. The anti-CAgp38 monoclonal antibody has been shown to inhibit the adhesion of C. albicans to extracellular matrix proteins and to vascular endothelial cells. Since protein glycosylation influences the CSH status of C. albicans, we compared the cell wall mannoprotein content and composition between C. albicans.

### Molecular characterization of new clinical isolates of Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis in Japan: Analysis reveals a new genotype of C. albicans with group I intron [^116FAvBE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The genetic diversity of recent clinical isolates of Candida albicans in Japan was studied on the basis of amplified DNA band lengths determined with a specific PCR primer reported to have been designed to span a transposable intron region in the 25S rRNA gene. Our analyses of 301 clinical isolates of C. albicans showed that they could be classified into five genotypes: genotype A (172 isolates), genotype B (66 isolates), genotype C (56 isolates), genotype D (C. dubliniensis; 5 isolates), and a new genotype (designated genotype E; 2 isolates). The new genotype E was characterized to have a group I intron-like sequence, which is longer than hitherto reported ones and has a nucleotide sequence length of 962 bp.

Our analysis of the 962-bp sequence indicated that it is composed of an intron similar to that of C. dubliniensis of 621 bp with a 341-bp insertion. Analysis of the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the genotype E strain showed that its sequence is identical to those of strains of other genotypes, with only a few base substitution differences. Throughout the study, the possible horizontal transfer of the group I intron between C. dubliniensis and C. albicans was suggested. A high degree of correlation between the presence of a group I intron in C. albicans genotype E and susceptibility to the antifungal agent flucytosine was observed.

The five isolates of C. dubliniensis examined in the present study showed genetic diversity when they were compared by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting pattern analysis, demonstrating significant genetic diversity.

### Evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic assay for identification of Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis [^115SkjrA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Candida dubliniensis was first established as a novel yeast species in 1995. It is particularly associated with episodes of oral candidosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but it has also been detected at other anatomical sites and at a low incidence level in non-HIV-infected patients. It shares so many phenotypic characteristics with C. albicans that it is easily misidentified as such. Until now, no rapid, simple, and commercial test has allowed differentiation between C. dubliniensis and C. albicans. Accurate species identification requires genotype-based techniques that are not routinely available in most clinical microbiology diagnostic laboratories.

The present study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of a new test, the immunochromatographic membrane (ICM) albi-dubli test (SR2B, Avrille, France), to differentiate between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The organisms evaluated were strains whose identities had previously been confirmed by PCR tests and freshly isolated clinical strains. This included 58 C. albicans isolates, 60 C. dubliniensis isolates, and 82 isolates belonging to other species of yeast.

The ICM albi-dubli test is based on the principle of immunochromatographic analysis and involves the use of two distinct monoclonal antibodies that recognize two unrelated epitopes expressed by both species or specific to only one species. The assay requires no complex instrumentation for analysis and can be recommended for routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Results are obtained within minutes, providing a rapid and efficient method for species differentiation.

### Screening clinical Candida albicans isolates for invasiveness by mimicking the human environment [^116jdiK4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Low credibility.

Candida albicans virulence is associated with filamentation, triggered by environmental factors encountered in the host. Here, we monitored the growth behavior of C. albicans isolated from a patient's abscess and established an in-vitro screening framework of filamentation to assess the invasiveness potential of ten clinical isolates.

- **Objectives**: Routine microbiology testing and convenience sampling were used for patient selection. We monitored colony appearance time of one abscess isolate ex-vivo using time-lapse imaging. Filamentation patterns of ten isolates were followed over 14 days using 48 variations of growth conditions (glucose and nitrogen concentrations, pH, temperature) to mimic host environment fluctuations. An automated image analysis pipeline was developed to quantify filamentation. Filamentation was also tested by growing isolates on modified filtration membranes, mimicking physical human body barriers.

- **Results**: The abscess isolate displayed heterogeneous colony appearance times and filamentation morphologies, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity within a growing population. Filamentation of all isolates was growth parameter and isolate-dependent. Based on their filamentation response to environmental changes, the isolates clustered into three distinct groups, reflecting their site of isolation in the host. Colony transmigration on modified filtration membranes was a predictor for filamentation on agar.

- **Conclusion**: We observed diverse filamentation morphologies in all isolates, indicating a phenotypically heterogeneous behavior. Using our new method…

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: An initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^113pssNr]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, and more specifically with respect to biomarkers, the ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend considering obtaining serum mannan antigen combined with anti-mannan antibody as an additional tool for the diagnosis of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. Additionally, consider obtaining anti-C. albicans germ tube antibodies for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis caused by C. albicans.

### The role of yeasts other than Candida albicans in oropharyngeal candidiasis [^111Y2QJi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Candida albicans has been recognized as the predominant infecting organism in oropharyngeal candidiasis. Yeasts other than C. albicans are commonly recognized as colonizing the oral cavity but have not been thought to be a significant cause of disease. This review describes the emergence of yeasts other than C. albicans as causative pathogens in oropharyngeal candidiasis, both as co-infecting organisms with C. albicans and as sole pathogens themselves. Diagnosis and treatment of these emerging infections are also discussed.

### Biofilm formation by Candida dubliniensis [^116o4zDb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Candida dubliniensis is an opportunistic yeast closely related to Candida albicans that has been recently implicated in oropharyngeal candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Most manifestations of candidiasis are associated with biofilm formation, with cells in biofilms displaying properties dramatically different from free-living cells grown under normal laboratory conditions. Here, we report on the development of in vitro models of C. dubliniensis biofilms on the surfaces of biomaterials (polystyrene and acrylic) and on the characteristics associated with biofilm formation by this newly described species. Time course analysis using a formazan salt reduction assay to monitor metabolic activities of cells within the biofilm, together with microscopy studies, revealed that biofilm formation by C. dubliniensis occurred after initial focal adherence, followed by growth, proliferation, and maturation over 24 to 48 hours.

Serum and saliva preconditioning films enhanced the initial attachment of C. dubliniensis and subsequent biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to further characterize C. dubliniensis biofilms. Mature C. dubliniensis biofilms consisted of a dense network of yeast cells and hyphal elements embedded within exopolymeric material. C. dubliniensis biofilms displayed spatial heterogeneity and an architecture showing microcolonies with ramifying water channels. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated the increased resistance of sessile C. dubliniensis cells, including the type strain.

### Immune defence against Candida fungal infections [^115Hhu6G]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The immune response to Candida species is shaped by the commensal character of the fungus. There is a crucial role in discerning between colonization and invasion at mucosal surfaces, with the antifungal host defense mechanisms used during mucosal or systemic infection with Candida species differing substantially.

We describe how innate sensing of fungi by pattern recognition receptors and the interplay of immune cells (both myeloid and lymphoid) with non-immune cells, including platelets and epithelial cells, shapes host immunity to Candida species. Furthermore, we discuss emerging data suggesting that both the innate and adaptive immune systems display memory characteristics after encountering Candida species.

### Risk factors for and clinical implications of mixed Candida/bacterial bloodstream infections [^115xxTkL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Candida species are normal commensals of humans that commonly inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, the female genital tract, and the skin, where diverse bacteria are most commonly found. Candida and bacteria directly and indirectly influence each other in many ways and can have important effects on each other's survival, colonization, and pathogenesis. Although data on the clinical relevance of interactions between Candida and bacteria are still lacking, several studies have described associations between this genus of fungus and bacterial species in clinical specimens. Previous studies have demonstrated both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between Candida and various bacterial species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii.

With the recent advances in medical technology, Candida species are the most common cause of invasive fungal infections. The occurrence of invasive candidiasis has increased over the past several decades, especially in immunocompromised or critically ill patients, and may contribute to high mortality and morbidity. In most cases of candidaemia, the gastrointestinal tract and the skin have been considered the sources of infection. As mentioned above, the extensive distribution of bacterial species can lead to candidaemia with concomitant bacteraemia. Mixed Candida/bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been reported to occur in over 23% of all episodes of candidaemia. However, the mechanisms of Candida-bacterial interaction in mixed Candida/bacterial BSIs and their clinical importance are not fully understood.

### Cases of endophthalmitis caused by Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis identified via internal transcribed spacer deep sequencing [^114NZyhR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

The patient was an immunocompromised 64-year-old woman who had undergone cataract surgery on the left eye 10 days prior at our hospital. She had a history of myasthenia gravis, oral steroid use, primary anal malignant melanoma, and systemic metastasis of melanoma. The malignant melanoma infiltrated into the uterovaginal region, cervix, urethra, and rectum, and the patient had previously undergone chemotherapy. She had a history of fungemia originating from anal ulcers caused by primary anal melanoma and was treated with systemic antifungal drugs. Subsequently, the culture results of the blood sample confirmed the presence of Candida dubliniensis.

One month before the cataract operation, the best-corrected visual acuity was 35/50 and 20/50 for the right and left eye, respectively. Intraocular pressure was within normal limits in both eyes, and no obvious abnormal findings were observed at the anterior or posterior segments of either eye.

In the early postoperative period, five days after surgery, the best-corrected visual acuity of the left eye improved to 45/50, while the visual acuity in the right eye remained stable. However, 10 days after surgery, during follow-up, the patient suddenly noticed a decrease in vision, with her visual acuity in the left eye worsening to 20/50 and intraocular pressure at 12 mmHg. In the left eye, severe anterior chamber inflammation was noted, characterized by findings such as a cell grade of +2, keratic precipitates, injection of conjunctiva, and hypopyon (Fig. 1 A). The fundus was not visible (Fig. 1 B).

### Interplay between Candida albicans and the mammalian innate host defense [^114JWnoA]. Infection and Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is both the most common fungal commensal microorganism in healthy individuals and the major fungal pathogen causing high mortality in at-risk populations, especially immunocompromised patients. In this review, we summarize the interplay between the host innate system and C. albicans, ranging from how the host recognizes, responds to, and clears C. albicans infection to how C. albicans evades, dampens, and escapes from host innate immunity.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116G8SKE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are more than 200 known species of *Candida*, a ubiquitous eukaryotic yeast that is part of the normal microbial flora of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract in healthy individuals. When host immunity is compromised, the risk of developing opportunistic *Candida* infections increases. *C. albicans* is the most common species associated with *Candida* infections, which often presents as oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, or cutaneous candidiasis. Predisposing factors for candidiasis include diabetes and other endocrinopathies, obesity, pregnancy, underlying HIV infection, poor hygiene, and recent treatment with antibiotics or corticosteroids. Individuals who wear dentures are also at increased risk for oral candidiasis.

### Identification of Candida spp. by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and differentiation between Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis by direct PCR methods [^1115PxqF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Because Candida species have innately highly variable antifungal susceptibilities, the availability of a fast and reliable species identification test is very important so that suitable and effective therapeutic measures may be taken. Using three oligonucleotide primers, we established a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis method that enabled direct identification of the most common opportunistic pathogenic Candida species. RAPD analysis revealed a characteristic molecular fingerprint for each Candida species. Differences between the profiles for Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis were evident. RAPD analysis is a relatively easy, reproducible, and reliable technique that can be useful in providing genetic fingerprints for the identification of strains. In addition, a collection of different C. albicans strains was identified by a specific PCR based on multiple secreted aspartic proteinase (SAP) genes and the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DAP2) gene. Our findings demonstrate that PCR based upon the SAP and DAP2 sequences is a simple, rapid, clear, and direct technique for the identification and differentiation of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis.

### Antifungal susceptibility testing and identification [^117JLATh]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The requirement for antifungal susceptibility testing is increasing given the availability of new drugs, the growing populations of individuals at risk for fungal infection, and the emergence of multiresistant fungi. Rapid and accurate fungal identification remains at the forefront of laboratory efforts to guide empiric therapy. Antifungal susceptibility testing methods have greatly improved, although they are subject to variation in results between methods. Careful standardization, validation, and extensive training of users are essential to ensure susceptibility results are clinically useful and interpreted appropriately. Interpretive criteria for many drugs and species are still lacking, but this will continue to evolve.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1145i9b4]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important fungal disease caused by Candida albicans and, increasingly, non-albicans Candida pathogens. Invasive Candida infections originate most frequently from endogenous human reservoirs and are triggered by impaired host defenses. Signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis are non-specific; candidaemia is the most diagnosed manifestation, with disseminated candidiasis affecting single or multiple organs. Diagnosis poses many challenges, and conventional culture techniques are frequently supplemented by non-culture-based assays. The attributable mortality from candidaemia and disseminated infections is approximately 30%.

Fluconazole resistance is a concern for Nakaseomyces glabratus, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida auris, and less so in Candida tropicalis infection; acquired echinocandin resistance remains uncommon. The epidemiology of invasive candidiasis varies in different geographical areas and within various patient populations. Risk factors include intensive care unit stay, central venous catheter use, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, abdominal surgery, and immune suppression.

Early antifungal treatment and central venous catheter removal form the cornerstones to decrease mortality. The landscape of novel therapeutics is growing; however, the application of new drugs requires careful selection of eligible patients as the spectrum of activity is limited to a few fungal species. Unanswered questions and knowledge gaps define future research priorities, and a personalized approach to diagnosis and treatment of invasive candidiasis is of paramount importance.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: An initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^113b5usu]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for invasive candidiasis, specifically with respect to fungal culture, the ASM/ECMM/ISHAM 2025 guidelines recommend performing sampling from the focus. This includes using a sterile site culture, such as aspirate, biopsy, and drainage, for the conventional diagnosis of deep-seated invasive candidiasis. They advise obtaining fluid or tissue culture, conducting direct Gram staining of any positive fluid culture, and using direct microscopy from fluids with an optical brightener to enhance the visualization of Candida elements. Additionally, histopathology with Grocott-Gömöri methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff staining is recommended.

### Candida auris: what have we learned so far [^113sQj54]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of fungal infections due to Candida species has been well described in critically ill patient populations, but in recent years a new species, Candida auris, has received attention from the medical community worldwide. We aim to summarize the knowledge related to C. auris as new identification techniques, novel antifungal agents, and more experience with outbreak management have been published in the past few years.

- **Recent findings**: C. auris has been described in several countries, arising independently in separate clades. Its resistance to multiple antifungals and persistent colonization of patients and medical surfaces have become a therapeutic and infection control challenge. Recent elucidation of some of the molecular mechanisms related to pathogenicity and studies of in-vitro efficacy of novel antifungal agents can better guide therapy.

As C. auris continues to cause outbreaks worldwide, newer and more efficient identification techniques, novel antifungals, and more knowledge in effective infection control techniques will allow better clinical outcomes in the management and control of invasive fungal disease.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: An initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^116PoHw5]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospitals, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, reinfections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or those taking immunosuppressive therapies.

The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp., potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: Insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^112VumVc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Candida species are the most common causative pathogens of fungal infections that can range from superficial (mucosal and cutaneous) and isolated diseases to systemic involvement. Among them, Candida albicans is mainly responsible for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), a disease characterized by recurrent or persistent infections of the nails, skin, mouth, and genital organs.

Candida infections are very common in adults and children and can appear in different settings, such as transient alterations of the normal flora, immune dysregulation in healthy individuals, in very or extremely low birth weight preterm babies, or in cases of diabetes. Primary (inborn errors of immunity or IEI) or secondary (HIV or lymphoproliferative diseases) impairment of the immune system should be suspected in cases of invasive or chronic Candida infections.

Recent advances in genetics through enhancements in next-generation sequencing techniques have led to the discovery of new genes and improved the understanding of the mechanisms involved in human host defense against fungi. Immune responses against Candida consist of both innate and adaptive immunity. Defects along these pathways can cause immune system diseases presenting with CMC (CANDF 1–9) as the only or the main clinical manifestation. However, CMC can be part of a broader spectrum of infectious manifestations and noninfectious comorbidities, such as in the case of complex diseases like Hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES) and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1/autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy (APS-1/APECED).

### The importance of strain variation in virulence of Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans: Results of a blinded histopathological study of invasive candidiasis [^113EXJvJ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

The pathogenic yeast, Candida dubliniensis, is increasingly reported as a cause of systemic fungal infections. We compared the virulence of nine clinical bloodstream isolates of C. dubliniensis with three C. albicans isolates in a murine model of invasive candidiasis. Quantification of organisms and inflammatory changes in kidneys of infected animals were evaluated in a blinded, systematic manner. The average 7-day mortality among animals infected with C. dubliniensis was 21.0% (33/157 animals; range for strains: 0–57.1%) and with C. albicans, 23.2% (23/99 animals; range for strains: 6.7–85.0%) [p 0.65]. Greater strain variation was noted within species than between the two species. Both species comprised strains of either high or low virulence, and six of the nine C. dubliniensis strains showed negligible virulence.

Colony counts determined on samples from the liver and kidneys did not differ between species. According to histopathological analysis, C. dubliniensis produced significantly lower levels of hyphae than C. albicans [p < 0.001]. Candida albicans caused a greater inflammatory response in kidneys [p < 0.001] and was more commonly associated with granulomatous inflammation [p 0.003] and greater mononuclear infiltrate [p < 0.001]. According to multivariate analysis, increasing tissue burden of both hyphal forms [p 0.032] and yeasts [p 0.016] was independently associated with death, whereas higher levels of mononuclear cells were protective [p < 0.001].

The results suggest a great overlap between the virulence properties of C. dubliniensis and C. albicans. Both yeast and hyphal forms are involved in the virulence characteristics of these species.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^115agfRL]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is the most common serious fungal pathogen of humans, varying in reports to cause between 250,000 and 400,000 deaths annually worldwide, as well as extensive morbidity with around 100 million episodes of recurrent vaginitis. This fungus is a classical opportunistic pathogen residing harmlessly as a commensal in approximately 50% of individuals, kept in check by the immune system and a protective bacterial microbiome in the gut and other mucosal surfaces. In this review, we survey the latest advances in the cell biology of C. albicans, which underpin its ecology as an organism exploring the interface between commensalism and pathogenesis.

### Invasive candidiasis [^114JCvw5]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on invasive candidiasis:

- **Definition**: Invasive candidiasis refers to a bloodstream infection (candidemia) caused by Candida species that can lead to deep-seated infections, including intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, and osteomyelitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Invasive candidiasis is most frequently caused by C. albicans. Candidemia pathways include long-term use of antibiotics; gastrointestinal and cutaneous perforation due to chemotherapy, gastric surgery, or venous catheters; and immunosuppressive medication.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of invasive candidiasis in the US is estimated at 8 per 100,000 population per year, with peak rates at the extremes of age. Half of all invasive candidiasis cases occur in the ICU setting.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include unexplained fever nonresponsive to antibacterial treatment. Complications of candidemia can lead to ocular involvement (choroiditis, retinitis, endophthalmitis, and blindness); abdominal cavity complications (abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, peritonitis); bone complications (osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis); brain complications (brain abscess, meningoencephalitis); heart involvement (endocarditis); kidney issues (candiduria, pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, renal abscess); involvement of the liver and spleen (chronic disseminated candidiasis, focal abscess); and lung issues (focal abscess). The disease decreases the quality of life (QoL).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting is associated with a high mortality rate of 35–80%.

### A phenotypic profile of the Candida albicans regulatory network [^1132wJXA]. PLoS Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a normal resident of the gastrointestinal tract and also the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans. It last shared a common ancestor with the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae over 300 million years ago. We describe a collection of 143 genetically matched strains of C. albicans, each of which has been deleted for a specific transcriptional regulator. This collection represents a large fraction of the non-essential transcription circuitry. A phenotypic profile for each mutant was developed using a screen of 55 growth conditions. The results identify the biological roles of many individual transcriptional regulators; for many, this work represents the first description of their functions.

For example, a quarter of the strains showed altered colony formation, a phenotype reflecting transitions among yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal cell forms. These transitions, which have been closely linked to pathogenesis, have been extensively studied, yet our work nearly doubles the number of transcriptional regulators known to influence them. As a second example, nearly a quarter of the knockout strains affected sensitivity to commonly used antifungal drugs; although a few transcriptional regulators have previously been implicated in susceptibility to these drugs, our work indicates many additional mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. Finally, our results inform how transcriptional networks evolve. Comparison with the existing S. cerevisiae data (supplemented by additional S. cerevisiae experiments reported here) allows the first systematic analysis of phenotypic profiles between these two species.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^116J4AB2]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

C. albicans is largely an asexual fungus; nevertheless, it is morphologically and physiologically a highly variable and adaptable organism. It is pleomorphic, able to grow either as a budding yeast, a pseudomycelium of elongated and conjoined yeast cells, or true hyphae formed of generated parallel-sided tip-growing filaments. It also exhibits a non-sexual form of variation called phenotypic switching that can generate stable cell and colony variants with distinct properties. C. albicans can thrive in different host niches (gut, vagina, oral mucosa, skin) without causing disease, indicating its adaptation for commensalism.

- **Life as a successful saprophyte**: GI tract colonization seems to involve the predominant carriage of the yeast form of the fungus, and low-level systemic dissemination in the gut can occur even in yeast-locked mutants. A mouse model of stable gastrointestinal candidiasis demonstrated that the passage of C. albicans through the mammalian gut leads to the transition to a modified yeast cell, known as the 'GUT phenotype' (gastrointestinally induced transition). This phenotype expresses a specialized transcriptome in the digestive tract that promotes the assimilation of common nutrients in the bowel. These GUT cells are morphologically altered and suppress the propensity for tissue invasion and the expression of certain virulence traits. Hence, the commensal state of C. albicans does not depend solely on host immune status but is also supported by organism-specific adaptations mediated by transcriptional changes in the host-associated commensal state.

### Comparison and correlation of candidal colonization in diabetic patients and normal individuals [^115WZoZ3]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The oral cavity harbors various normal microbial flora. Among these, Candida is a harmless commensal organism present in 20 to 40% of healthy individuals. Candida is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus; among these, Candida albicans is the most common species causing oral candidiasis. Several local and systemic factors of diabetes mellitus can predispose individuals to oral candidiasis.

Oral lesions are prevalent among diabetics, and oral candidiasis is the most common among these lesions, which can be diagnosed by their differential patterns of mucosal changes like erythematous, pseudomembranous, and curd-like plaques. However, in the diabetic group, Candida albicans colonization can occur even in the absence of any clinical lesion.

Candidal colonization can be confirmed by culture methods, which are very time-consuming. On the other hand, oral exfoliative cytology is a very easy and effective chair-side method.

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of candidal colonization in diabetics.

### Gene flow contributes to diversification of the major fungal pathogen Candida albicans [^114u3b9S]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

Elucidating population structure and levels of genetic diversity and recombination is necessary to understand the evolution and adaptation of species. *Candida albicans* is the second most frequent agent of human fungal infections worldwide, causing high mortality rates. Here we present the genomic sequences of 182 *C. albicans* isolates collected worldwide, including commensal isolates, as well as ones responsible for superficial and invasive infections, constituting the largest dataset at the time of writing for this major fungal pathogen. Although *C. albicans* shows a predominantly clonal population structure, we find evidence of gene flow between previously known and newly identified genetic clusters, supporting the occurrence of (para)sexuality in nature. A highly clonal lineage, which experimentally shows reduced fitness, has undergone pseudogenization in genes required for virulence and morphogenesis, which may explain its niche restriction. *Candida albicans* thus takes advantage of both clonality and gene flow to diversify.

### Candida albicans natural diversity: a resource to dissect fungal commensalism and pathogenesis [^116UADkR]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a ubiquitous fungus in humans. It is not only a component of the oral and intestinal microbiota of most healthy adults but also a major cause of mucosal disorders and life-threatening disseminated infections. Until recently, research on the biology and pathogenesis of the fungus was largely based on a single clinical isolate. We review investigations that have started to dissect a diverse set of C. albicans strains. Using different approaches to leverage the species' phenotypic and/or genetic diversity, these studies illuminate the wide range of interactions between fungus and host. While connecting genetic variants to phenotypes of interest remains challenging, research on C. albicans' natural diversity is central to understanding fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.

### Candida albicans is phagocytosed, killed, and processed for antigen presentation by human dendritic cells [^1123j1Zx]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a component of the normal flora of the alimentary tract and is also found on the mucocutaneous membranes of the healthy host. Candida is the leading cause of invasive fungal disease in premature infants, diabetics, and surgical patients, and of oropharyngeal disease in AIDS patients. As the induction of cell-mediated immunity to Candida is of critical importance in host defense, we sought to determine whether human dendritic cells (DC) could phagocytose and degrade Candida and subsequently present Candida antigens to T cells.

Immature DC obtained by culture of human monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 phagocytosed unopsonized Candida in a time-dependent manner, and phagocytosis was not enhanced by opsonization of Candida in serum. Like macrophages (Mphi), DC recognized Candida by the mannose-fucose receptor. Upon ingestion, DC killed Candida as efficiently as human Mphi, and fungicidal activity was not enhanced by the presence of fresh serum.

Although phagocytosis of Candida by DC stimulated the production of superoxide anion, inhibitors of the respiratory burst (or NO production) did not inhibit killing of Candida, even when phagocytosis was blocked by preincubation of DC with cytochalasin D. Further, although apparently only modest phagolysosomal fusion occurred upon DC phagocytosis of Candida, killing of Candida under anaerobic conditions was almost equivalent to killing under aerobic conditions. Finally, DC stimulated Candida-specific lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner.

### Living in your skin: Microbes, molecules, and mechanisms [^1126Yn9F]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the relative proportions of pathobionts within the healthy skin microbiome, the average abundances of select pathobionts, such as those previously described, across the human body were calculated from published relative abundance data and are presented in Fig. 3. Reflecting prior studies showing that the skin microbiome composition varies by skin site characteristics, pathobiont distribution also varies according to the skin microenvironment. Notably, there is a dominance and co-occurrence of Malassezia spp. and C. acnes in sebaceous sites, which are often the location for skin diseases attributed to these pathobionts. Fungal pathogens such as Candida and Trichosporon are also found within the healthy skin microbiome, although at relatively low abundance, suggesting that the skin may be well-equipped to limit fungal pathogen colonization. Overall, the presence of pathobionts in the skin microbiome underscores the essential role of the skin in maintaining homeostasis while also conferring protection against microbial overgrowth or pathobiont-induced inflammation.

### Replacement of Candida albicans with C. dubliniensis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis treated with fluconazole [^115dq73C]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Candida dubliniensis is an opportunistic yeast increasingly implicated in oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients but may be underreported due to its similarity with Candida albicans. Although most C. dubliniensis isolates are susceptible to fluconazole, the inducibility of azole resistance in vitro has been reported. Thus, the use of fluconazole prophylaxis in the treatment of these patients may have contributed to the increasing rates of isolation of C. dubliniensis.

In this study, yeast strains were collected from the oral cavities of HIV-infected patients enrolled in a longitudinal study of OPC. Patients received fluconazole for the suppression or treatment of OPC, and isolates collected at both study entry and the end of the study were chosen for analysis. Samples were plated on CHROMagar Candida medium for initial isolation and further identified by Southern blot analysis with the species-specific probes Ca3 (for C. albicans) and Cd25 (for C. dubliniensis). Fluconazole MICs were determined using NCCLS methods.

At study entry, susceptible C. albicans isolates were recovered from oral samples in 42 patients who were followed longitudinally (1 to 36 months). C. albicans strains from 12 of these patients developed fluconazole resistance (fluconazole MIC, ≥ 64 µg/ml). C. dubliniensis was not detected at the end of the study in any of these patients. Of the remaining 30 patients, eight (27%) demonstrated a replacement of C. albicans by C. dubliniensis when a comparison of isolates obtained at baseline and those from the endpoint was made.

**Observations for case 1**: Severe inflammation was observed, including hyperemia, hypopyon, a cell grade of 2+, and keratic precipitates at the anterior chamber. Visibility of the fundus was poor. B-scan ultrasonography did not reveal retinal traction and retinal detachment, but slight vitreous opacity was noted. Electroretinography (ERG) findings recorded normal rod response in the right eye and a reduction of rod response in the left eye. Results of the ITS1 deep-sequencing analyses showed the relative abundance of the fungal agents; the same color represents the same fungal population. In this case, the abundance of Candida dubliniensis was 99.6%. In distilled water (DW), which was used as a negative control, there were no predominant fungal populations and Candida dubliniensis was not detected. One month after the operation and antifungal treatment, hemorrhage and vitreous opacity were not observed, and photocoagulation was observed at the fundus.

### Thinking beyond the common Candida species: Need for species-level identification of Candida due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida auris [^114HP5Px]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Candida species are one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. Because much of the treatment for Candida infections is empirical, some institutions do not identify Candida to the species level. With the worldwide emergence of the multidrug-resistant species Candida auris, identification of Candida to the species level has new clinical relevance. Species should be identified for invasive candidiasis isolates, and species-level identification can be considered for selected noninvasive isolates to improve detection of C. auris.

### Candida albicans biofilms do not trigger reactive oxygen species and evade neutrophil killing [^117LcRM4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are found within Candida albicans biofilms in vivo and could play a crucial role in clearing the pathogen from biofilms forming on catheters and mucosal surfaces. Our goal was to compare the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils against developing and mature C. albicans biofilms and identify biofilm-specific properties mediating resistance to immune cells. Antibiofilm activity was measured with the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay and a molecular Candida viability assay. Reactive oxygen species generation was assessed by measuring fluorescence of 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester in preloaded neutrophils.

We found that mature biofilms were resistant to leukocytic killing and did not trigger reactive oxygen species, even though neutrophils retained their viability and functional activation potential. Beta-glucans found in the extracellular matrix negatively affected antibiofilm activities. We conclude that these polymers act as a decoy mechanism to prevent neutrophil activation and that this represents an important innate immune evasion mechanism of C. albicans biofilms.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1177F7az]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important healthcare-associated fungal infection caused by several Candida species; the most common species is Candida albicans. However, the prevalence of these organisms varies considerably depending on geographical location. The spectrum of disease ranges from minimally symptomatic candidaemia to fulminant sepsis, with associated mortality exceeding 70%. Candida species are common commensal organisms in the skin and gut microbiota, and disruptions in the cutaneous and gastrointestinal barriers (such as gastrointestinal perforation) promote invasive disease.

A deeper understanding of specific Candida species' virulence factors, host immune response, and host susceptibility at the genetic level has led to key insights into the development of early intervention strategies and vaccine candidates. The early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is challenging but crucial for effective management. The development of rapid molecular diagnostics could improve the ability to intervene quickly and potentially reduce mortality.

First-line drugs, including echinocandins and azoles, are effective, but the emergence of antifungal resistance, especially among Candida glabrata, is concerning and underscores the need to use antifungal medications judiciously, avoiding overuse when possible. A newly described pathogen, Candida auris, is an emerging multidrug-resistant organism that poses a global threat.

### Candida dubliniensis infections in a pediatric population: Retrospective identification from clinical laboratory isolates of Candida albicans [^114NQwGw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Candida dubliniensis is a recently described species that shares many phenotypic and morphological features with Candida albicans. The clinical significance of isolating C. dubliniensis from the pediatric population is not clear, as most clinical isolates have been recovered from the oral cavities or bloodstreams of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

In order to further understand the epidemiology of C. dubliniensis in our pediatric population, we identified C. dubliniensis isolates from clinical isolates previously identified in the laboratory as C. albicans and conducted a retrospective chart review of cases of C. dubliniensis infections. A total of 205 isolates from 183 patients were tested, and only 14 (6.8%) were identified as C. dubliniensis.

- **Isolate findings**: In 5 of the 14 positive cultures, C. dubliniensis was the sole organism isolated (two respiratory tract specimens, one tongue specimen, one vaginal specimen, and one skin specimen).

- **Clinical outcomes**: A case review showed that there were no adverse outcomes for any of the patients, and only one of the patients with cultures positive for C. dubliniensis was immunocompromised.

In our pediatric population, the distinction of C. dubliniensis from C. albicans did not prove to have significant clinical relevance. Data from further investigations may help to better define the role of C. dubliniensis as a potential pathogen in children.

### The transcriptional stress response of Candida albicans to weak organic acids [^114mbofh]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is the fungal pathogen most frequently associated with human mycoses, ranging from superficial lesions of the skin and mucosae to life-threatening systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Despite its negative reputation, this organism is also the most widely associated fungus across the general population, colonizing all body surfaces, including the vaginal mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract (GI) of most healthy individuals, suggesting it to be a member of the commensal microbiota. Of note, bloodstream infections by C. albicans often originate from the same strain carried in the GI tract of the respective patients, indicating an opportunistic nature of this pathogen. However, what precisely controls the switch between asymptomatic colonization and invasive fungal infection is not fully understood.

Bacterial−fungal interactions occur in all niches of the human body, and some of them have been described to influence pathogenesis and disease outcomes. For instance, probiotic lactobacilli were reported to induce immunomodulatory effects protecting mice from subsequent C. albicans infection. C. albicans also directly responds to bacteria-derived metabolites like quorum-sensing molecules or muramyl dipeptides, which have been described to respectively inhibit or promote the yeast-to-hyphal transition, an important virulence factor of C. albicans. Among the most abundant metabolites of bacterial origin that can be found on mucosal surfaces of the human body are weak organic acids (WOAs), such as lactic, acetic, propionic acids.

### Fungal biofilms and drug resistance [^1129U6FA]. Emerging infectious diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Candida biofilms share several properties with bacterial biofilms. Two consequences of biofilm growth with profound clinical implications are the markedly enhanced resistance to antimicrobial agents and protection from host defenses. These are the main reasons why biofilm-associated infections are frequently refractory to conventional therapy. Recently, studies showed that C. dubliniensis has the ability to adhere to and form biofilms with structural heterogeneity and typical microcolony and water channel architecture, similar to what has been described for bacterial and C. albicans biofilms. Additionally, resistance of C. dubliniensis to fluconazole, as well as increased resistance to clinically applied amphotericin B, was demonstrated in biofilms.

- **Illustration of biofilm development in Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis**: A, early 0–11 h; B, intermediate 12–30 h; C, mature 38–72 h; FS, flat surface; YC, yeast cell; H, hyphae; EP, exopolymeric matrix.

- **Typical field found in scanning electron micrograph**: Biofilm formed by Candida albicans on an intravascular disc prepared from catheter material.

### Differentiation between Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans by fatty acid methyl ester analysis using gas-liquid chromatography [^116CfH51]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2000). Low credibility.

Candida dubliniensis is often found in mixed culture with C. albicans, but its recognition is hampered as the color of its colonies in primary culture on CHROMagar Candida varies. Furthermore, definite identification of C. dubliniensis is difficult to achieve, time-consuming, and expensive. Therefore, a method to discriminate between these two closely related yeast species by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis using gas-liquid chromatography (Sherlock Microbial Identification System [MIS]; MIDI, Inc, Newark, Del.) was developed. Although the chromatograms of these two species revealed no obvious differences when applying FAME analysis, a new library (CADLIB) was successfully created using Sherlock Library Generation Software (MIDI). The amount and frequency of FAME was analyzed using library training files (n = 10 for each species), preferentially those comprising reference strains.

- **Performance testing**: For testing the performance of the CADLIB, clinical isolates genetically assigned to the respective species (C. albicans, n = 32; C. dubliniensis, n = 28) were chromatographically analyzed. For each isolate tested, MIS computed a similarity index (SI) indicating a hierarchy of possible strain fits. When using the newly created library CADLIB, the SIs for C. albicans and C. dubliniensis ranged from 0.11 to 0.96, and 0.53 to 0.93 (for all but one), respectively.

- **Differentiation accuracy**: Only three isolates of C. albicans (9.4%) were misidentified as C. dubliniensis, whereas all isolates of C. dubliniensis were correctly identified. The resulting differentiation accuracy was 90.6% for C. albicans and 100% for C. dubliniensis.

### A phenotypic profile of the Candida albicans regulatory network [^111Jkcyk]. PLoS Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a normal resident of the gastrointestinal tract and also the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans. It last shared a common ancestor with the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae over 300 million years ago. We describe a collection of 143 genetically matched strains of C. albicans, each of which has been deleted for a specific transcriptional regulator. This collection represents a large fraction of the non-essential transcription circuitry.

A phenotypic profile for each mutant was developed using a screen of 55 growth conditions. The results identify the biological roles of many individual transcriptional regulators; for many, this work represents the first description of their functions. For example, a quarter of the strains showed altered colony formation, a phenotype reflecting transitions among yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal cell forms. These transitions, which have been closely linked to pathogenesis, have been extensively studied. However, our work nearly doubles the number of transcriptional regulators known to influence them.

As a second example, nearly a quarter of the knockout strains affected sensitivity to commonly used antifungal drugs. Although a few transcriptional regulators have previously been implicated in susceptibility to these drugs, our work indicates many additional mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. Finally, our results inform how transcriptional networks evolve. Comparison with the existing S. cerevisiae data (supplemented by additional S. cerevisiae experiments reported here) allows the first systematic analysis of phenotypic profiles.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1148A4xE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) refers to a group of infectious syndromes caused by various Candida species, with six species responsible for most cases globally. Candidemia is the most commonly recognized syndrome associated with IC. However, Candida species can cause invasive infections in any organ, particularly visceral organs, vasculature, bones and joints, eyes, and the central nervous system. The optimal use of these newer diagnostics, coupled with a thoughtful clinical assessment of at-risk patients and judicious use of effective antifungal therapy, is key to achieving good antifungal stewardship and improved patient outcomes.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: Insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^112EZyc7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic approach to CMC**: CMC needs to be suspected in patients with chronic (more than 6 months) or recurrent Candida infections of the nails, skin, and mucosae as the main or exclusive clinical manifestation. However, a fungal culture of the site of infection must always be performed to confirm positivity to Candida.

Secondary causes must be excluded, such as prolonged use of antibiotics, systemic steroids (> 10 mg/day or less with immunosuppressors or comorbidities), other kinds of immunosuppressors, and comorbidities such as diabetes and HIV infection. Other infectious or noninfectious complications must be considered in the clinical spectrum of these patients, which may lead to a specific genetic cause of CMC.

Having received a clinical and microbiological diagnosis of CMC, in the suspected case of inborn errors of immunity (IEI), immunological and genetic investigations are required to identify the underlying deficit.

### Scratching the surface: A comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^1133uHFx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal itching of acute onset is frequently attributed to infections with fungal, bacterial, or parasitic species. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) results from an overgrowth of Candida species, predominantly Candida albicans, due to disruptions in the normal vaginal flora. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines stimulates nerve endings in the vaginal area, resulting in pruritus, edema, and erythema of the region. VVC is not typically acquired through contagion but rather from alterations in the environment that are favorable for fungal species, such as the obliteration of healthy vaginal microbiome defenses, moisture trapping in the inguinal region, elevated skin surface pH, and states with lower immunological defenses. These include conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or higher glucose availability seen in pregnancy and diabetes.

Research by Yosipovitch et al. found that the skin surface pH in intertriginous areas, such as the inguinal region, is significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with healthy individuals, which may promote susceptibility to candidal infections. This elevated pH can create an environment conducive to Candida overgrowth and infection. Tinea cruris affects the inguinal creases and labia majora, presenting with a visible rash, unlike the discharge characteristic of candidiasis.

In bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance in the vaginal microbiota results in an elevated pH that is more favorable for pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, than for protective bacteria, such as Lactobacilli. While BV does not typically cause inflammation, it is significant in the context of vulvovaginal health.

### Fungal biofilms and drug resistance [^117Y76es]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The genus Candida is composed of an extremely heterogeneous group of organisms that grow as yeasts. Most members of the genus also produce a filamentous type of growth, pseudohyphae. In addition to pseudohyphae, Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis form true hyphae (germ tubes) and thick-walled cells referred to as chlamydospores, both of which are used by mycology diagnostic laboratories in identifying these species. Candida species are now emerging as major agents of hospital-acquired infections; they are ranked as the third or fourth most commonly isolated bloodstream pathogens, surpassing gram-negative bacilli in frequency.

Although C. albicans is the predominant etiologic agent of candidiasis, other Candida species, such as C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. lusitaniae, and the newest species, C. dubliniensis, tend to be less susceptible to the commonly used antifungal drugs and have emerged as substantial opportunistic pathogens. Candida dubliniensis shares with C. albicans many virulence factors, such as germ tube formation, exoenzyme production, and phenotypic switching. This species, however, unlike C. albicans, has been shown to readily develop stable resistance to fluconazole in vitro and in infected patients, strongly suggesting that C. dubliniensis possesses a readily inducible fluconazole resistance mechanism.

Indwelling intravascular catheters represent a risk factor associated with nosocomial Candida infections. The devices become colonized by the microorganisms, forming a biofilm of cells, the detachment of which can result in septicemia.
