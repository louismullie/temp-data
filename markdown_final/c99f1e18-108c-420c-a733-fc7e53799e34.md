## Question

Recommended treatment for major depressive disorder resistant to first line therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage major depressive disorder that is resistant to first-line therapy, including how to define treatment resistance, verify adequacy of prior treatment, and choose among switching, augmentation, psychotherapy, and neurostimulation options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ensuring the prior antidepressant trial was adequate. Then, I should define treatment-resistant depression using accepted criteria. Next, I will review core second-line strategies and their comparative evidence. After that, I need to tailor choices to symptom profile, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Finally, I will outline monitoring, safety, and escalation pathways, including when to consider ECT or ketamine/esketamine, and close with a concise decision framework and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out mimics or secondary causes of depression, because misdiagnosis and medical comorbidity are common reasons for apparent treatment resistance. I should verify adherence, dosing, and duration of the prior antidepressant, and use measurement-based care with standardized scales such as PHQ-9, QIDS, or HAM-D to quantify baseline severity and track change, since guidelines emphasize MBC and confirmatory diagnostics before labeling TRD [^11567J87] [^115Bfngj].

> I need to ensure the prior antidepressant trial was truly adequate. That generally means at least 4–6 weeks at a therapeutic dose with reasonable adherence, and if there is uncertainty about adherence or pharmacokinetics, I should double-check refill data, pill counts, or even plasma levels when available, because inadequate trials are a frequent cause of pseudo–treatment resistance and dose escalation alone rarely helps after nonresponse is established [^113ZfV4m] [^113nRYr1] [^117UzK3r].

> Now, I should define treatment-resistant depression carefully. The most commonly used definition is nonresponse to at least two separate antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration, with some expert consensus recommending different mechanisms of action across the two failures and prospective symptom ratings to quantify response, while acknowledging that definitions vary and many trials use lower thresholds, which complicates cross-study comparisons [^113UZ49B] [^113XpMPU] [^113vrr12].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also distinguish partial response from nonresponse, because that distinction guides strategy selection, with partial responders often benefiting from augmentation and nonresponders more often switched, and I should remember that STAR*D showed diminishing returns with each successive monotherapy step, reinforcing the need to pivot rather than persist with the same approach [^114xcgd4] [^112bwbGJ].

> Next, I will examine core second-line strategies: switching to a different antidepressant, augmenting with a second agent, adding psychotherapy, or combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Guidelines generally endorse any of these as acceptable next steps, and there is insufficient evidence to rank one over another for all patients, so shared decision-making is essential [^116QPGY7] [^114jh2b4] [^112e8kXW].

> Let me consider switching first. Switching is reasonable when there was minimal benefit or poor tolerability with the initial agent, and while switching within or across classes can work, some data suggest out-of-class switches may be preferable in more severe presentations, though high-quality comparative evidence is limited and washout must be planned to avoid interactions, especially with MAOIs [^116YWLng] [^116HVjWS] [^113PVR2R].

> I should double-check augmentation options. Adding a second-generation antipsychotic such as aripiprazole or quetiapine is supported and recommended in primary care guidance for TRD, with meta-analytic data showing meaningful effect sizes, and lithium or liothyronine remain evidence-based augmenters. For early-stage nonresponse after one failed trial, esketamine has among the largest effect sizes in meta-analyses, though guidelines generally position it after conventional strategies, and clinicians should monitor metabolic and extrapyramidal risks with antipsychotic augmentation [^111EzeEL] [^111tKVfj] [^116DgY3w].

> Wait, let me verify the role of psychotherapy. Adding CBT or other structured psychotherapies to ongoing pharmacotherapy improves symptoms and remission rates in TRD compared with usual care, with benefits persisting in some longer-term analyses, and guidelines endorse adding psychotherapy when medication response is incomplete, which is particularly useful when residual symptoms or functional impairment persist [^112pbv2b] [^114Hm3TR] [^114jh2b4].

> But wait, what if the presentation is severe, psychotic, catatonic, or urgently suicidal? In those cases, I need to escalate promptly to ECT, which has the most robust evidence among neurostimulation modalities for TRD and can produce rapid clinical improvement, while rTMS is a reasonable alternative when ECT is not feasible or acceptable, and ketamine or esketamine can reduce suicidal ideation more rapidly than traditional antidepressants in selected patients [^11691DrY] [^114VMoQC].

> I will now tailor the choice to the patient's symptom profile and context. For anhedonia or fatigue, bupropion augmentation or switching may help. For insomnia or anxiety, mirtazapine or a sedating atypical antipsychotic might be preferable. For chronicity or recurrent episodes, lithium augmentation is attractive given relapse prevention benefits. For older adults or those with cardiovascular risk, I should prioritize psychotherapy or safer pharmacologic options and avoid antipsychotics with high metabolic liability [^113PVR2R] [^114VMoQC] [^116VdHo9].

> Let me first confirm safety and interaction risks before choosing augmentation. I need to check for QT prolongation, metabolic syndrome, anticholinergic burden, and drug–drug interactions, and I should counsel on side effects and monitoring plans, including weight, glucose, and lipids for atypical antipsychotics, and thyroid and renal function for lithium, aligning with guideline cautions and patient preferences [^112C92B1].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and when to declare a strategy failed. Using the same validated scales every 2–4 weeks, I would reassess at about 6–8 weeks to judge response or remission, aiming for at least a 50% reduction in symptom scores for response and a score below standard remission thresholds for full remission, and if there is less than 25% improvement after an adequate trial, I should pivot rather than persist [^112C92B1] [^113ZfV4m] [^113UZ49B].

> Hold on, I should verify the escalation pathway. If two evidence-based second-line strategies fail, I should consider ECT, ketamine or esketamine, or clinical trials, and I should also revisit the diagnosis, comorbidities, and adherence, because misattributed TRD is common and the risk of relapse increases with each successive treatment failure, especially beyond two to four steps [^11691DrY] [^114VMoQC] [^113nxh5m].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework without overstating hierarchy. After confirming diagnosis and adequacy of prior treatment, I can offer switching, augmentation with an antipsychotic or lithium, adding psychotherapy, or combination therapy, with the choice driven by prior response, tolerability, comorbidities, urgency, and patient preference, and if the patient had a partial response, augmentation or adding psychotherapy is sensible, whereas if there was minimal response, switching or a more robust augmentation such as an atypical antipsychotic or esketamine may be preferable [^116QPGY7] [^114jh2b4] [^111tKVfj].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal care and relapse prevention. Once remission is achieved, I should continue the effective regimen for at least 6–12 months and often longer for those with recurrent or chronic depression, maintain measurement-based care, and schedule regular follow-up to detect early relapse, adjusting the plan as needed based on evolving symptoms and patient goals [^115u7BUk] [^112C92B1] [^112PXfBN].

For MDD not responding to first-line therapy, **switch to a different antidepressant class** (e.g. SNRI, bupropion, mirtazapine) or **augment with a second-generation antipsychotic** (e.g. aripiprazole, quetiapine) [^111EzeEL] or CBT [^112pbv2b]. If response remains inadequate, consider **lithium or liothyronine augmentation**, or **ketamine/esketamine** for rapid effect in severe cases [^111tKVfj]. For refractory cases, **ECT or rTMS** are effective options [^11691DrY]. Always confirm diagnosis, adherence, and adequate dose/duration before declaring treatment resistance, and tailor choices to patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profile [^11567J87] [^112rNpvs].

---

## Definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD)

TRD is commonly defined as **inadequate response to at least two different antidepressant trials** of adequate dose and duration (typically 4–6 weeks) [^113UZ49B] [^113vrr12]. Before diagnosing TRD, confirm the diagnosis, ensure adherence, and verify that each trial was at an adequate dose and duration [^115wYXzQ].

---

## Alternative pharmacological strategies

### Switching antidepressants

Switching to a different class is appropriate when there is minimal response or intolerance to the initial agent [^116YWLng]; **switching within or between classes** (e.g. SSRI to SNRI, bupropion, or mirtazapine) is supported [^116YWLng]. Evidence indicates that switching is effective, with response rates around 50% [^116HVjWS].

---

### Augmentation strategies

- **Second-generation antipsychotics**: Aripiprazole, quetiapine, and risperidone are effective augmenters [^111tKVfj] [^114NFSCc].
- **Lithium**: Effective augmentation, especially with suicidal ideation or recurrent depression [^114VMoQC].
- **Liothyronine (T3)**: Useful for patients with residual symptoms or fatigue.
- **Ketamine/esketamine**: Rapid-acting options for severe TRD or acute suicidality [^115wYXzQ].

---

### Combination therapy

Combining two antidepressants with different mechanisms (e.g. SSRI + bupropion or mirtazapine) can improve response, though **monitor for side effects and interactions** [^111FuA3Z].

---

## Psychotherapeutic interventions

CBT is effective as adjunctive therapy, improving symptoms and remission rates in TRD [^112pbv2b]. IPT and psychodynamic psychotherapy are also **reasonable adjunctive options** based on patient preference and availability [^114Hm3TR].

---

## Neuromodulation techniques

- **Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)**: Highly effective for severe, refractory depression or when rapid response is needed [^114VMoQC].
- **Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)**: Effective, well-tolerated alternative for patients who decline or cannot access ECT [^115wYXzQ].
- **Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)**: Option for chronic, treatment-resistant cases.

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

- **Psychedelics**: Psilocybin and MDMA are under investigation with promising early results.
- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)**: Investigational for severe, refractory depression.
- **Pharmacogenetic testing**: Limited evidence; not routinely recommended [^115wYXzQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines recommend **personalized, stepwise care** — switching, augmentation, or combination therapy — based on patient preference, comorbidities, and side-effect profiles [^112C92B1] [^113xPxeq]. Measurement-based care with regular symptom tracking is essential to guide adjustments [^1117eMwL].

---

## Factors influencing treatment selection

- **Patient preference**: Strongly influences adherence and outcomes [^114xuTJn].
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiac, metabolic, and psychiatric comorbidities guide safe choices [^114qt5A5].
- **Side-effect profile**: Tailor to patient tolerance and priorities [^116ekByx].
- **Severity and chronicity**: Severe or chronic cases may need ECT or ketamine earlier [^117HqvqH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring should track depressive symptoms, side effects, and adherence to guide adjustments [^115u7BUk]. Maintain **follow-up** with consistent visits to assess response and modify treatment as needed [^115u7BUk].

---

## Summary of recommended treatment algorithm

1. Switch to different antidepressant class**: Inadequate response or intolerance to initial agent
2. Augment with second-generation antipsychotic or CBT**: Partial response or residual symptoms
3. Lithium or liothyronine augmentation**: Continued inadequate response
4. Ketamine or esketamine**: Severe TRD or acute suicidality
5. ECT or rTMS**: Refractory cases or patient preference

---

Patients with MDD not responding to first-line therapy have several evidence-based options: **switching antidepressants, augmentation, combination therapy, psychotherapy, and neuromodulation**. Treatment should be individualized, with close monitoring and shared decision-making to optimize outcomes [^112e8kXW].

### Switching antidepressants in the treatment of major depression: when, how and what to switch to? [^116YWLng]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching antidepressant medications is recommended when an initial antidepressant is not effective, when it is unable to be tolerated or when there are significant drug interactions. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence regarding when to switch antidepressants and the optimal approach to switching.

Methods

Clinical and academic experts in mood disorders from Australia and New Zealand (Treatment Algorithm Group, TAG) met to discuss the key considerations regarding switching antidepressants in the treatment of depression and formulate recommendations about switching strategies.

Results

While switching is recommended, there is limited data to guide on how best to approach switching antidepressants (e.g. whether to switch within class or out of class), and how to define the best time to consider switching. Broadly, switching within class after non-response is recommended for mild-moderate depression and out-of-class for patients with a more severe depression or melancholia.

Limitations

There is a limited evidence-base to draw on to make definitive recommendations on switching approaches.

Conclusions

Switching antidepressants is an appropriate strategy to use if there is a minimal response to an initial antidepressant. Further research is required to determine the optimal switching approach.

### Achieving remission and managing relapse in depression [^1125zSdF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Although antidepressants are effective, no more than one third of the depressed patients who begin treatment achieve full remission within 8 weeks of therapy. Remission, defined as virtually complete relief of symptoms and return to full functioning in all areas of life, should be thought of as the optimal goal for the initial phase of treatment of depression. This goal is recommended because residual symptoms (i.e., response without remission) are associated with a myriad of risks, including a higher rate of relapse. When compared with monotherapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (i.e., the current first-line standard of care) strategies may improve remission rates. These strategies include using maximally tolerated (i.e., higher than usual) doses of medication, switching to an antidepressant thought to have more than one mechanism of action, combining dissimilar medications (to presumably treat a broader range of symptoms), and using a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Ensuring that patients are indeed adherent with treatment is also worthwhile before assuming that a treatment has failed.

### Current treatments used in clinical practice for major depressive disorder and treatment resistant depression in england: a retrospective database study [^114QDM8n]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic recurrent or episodic psychiatric illness that can be successfully treated with oral antidepressants, yet one-in-three patients do not respond to currently-available treatments. According to the FDA and EMA, patients are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD) when their MDD fails to respond adequately to ≥ 2 successive antidepressants in a single episode.

Aims

To describe current clinical management of patients with MDD and TRD in England, including treatment strategies and referral to secondary mental healthcare.

Method

A retrospective cohort study of adult patients identified in primary care with diagnosed MDD, including a TRD subgroup (≥ 2 treatment failures as determined by treatment dynamics) was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD primary care database linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Mental Health Services Data Set data (Protocol 19_019R).

Results

41,375 patients with MDD (mean age 44yrs, 62% female, median follow-up 29mths); and 1,051 (3%) patients with TRD were identified. Mean time-to-TRD was 18 months. Most patients (> 99%) received first-line antidepressant monotherapy. Following TRD criteria being met, antidepressant monotherapy use remained most frequent from TRD first-line (70%) to fifth-line (48%). Dual/triple antidepressant use remained constant (range:24%-26%), while augmented antidepressant use increased from TRD first-line (7%) to third-line (17%). Minimal non-pharmacological therapies were observed.

Conclusions

Despite current clinical guidelines recommending a stepwise approach, many patients frequently cycle through numerous antidepressants with similar mechanisms of action and efficacy. These findings indicate a high unmet need for new treatments that improve outcomes in these patient populations.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113nxh5m]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many medications have proven efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD), but frequently and even with multiple medication exposures, they fail to improve MDD symptoms; one third of individuals do not achieve full symptomatic remission, and even fewer meet criteria for both symptomatic and functional remission. In individuals with ineffective initial treatments, even if subsequent treatments are effective, there is a very high relapse rate while continuing the treatment; for example, in the STAR*D trial, individuals who required more treatment steps had higher relapse rates (up to 71% after the fourth step).

'Incomplete response' is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, but rather a continuum that ranges from partially responsive depression (PRD), to treatment-resistant depression (TRD), to 'multi-therapy-resistant MDD (MTR-MDD)', to 'refractory depression', which implies an absence of response to all currently available treatments. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus definitions around concepts such as PRD, TRD, and 'adequate' treatments. Moreover, guidelines on how to treat TRD/PRD, such as pharmacological augmentation, are not consistent, and evidence on effectiveness is sparse. This complicates the generalizability of results from research settings to the real-world, and hinders progress in this field, as there is no uniform population for clinical and biological investigations in TRD/PRD, including clinical trials for new or repurposed medications. Importantly, regulators acknowledge that response, partial response, and non-response exist on a continuum without universally accepted definitions, but nevertheless distinguish between these conditions; indeed, treatments for TRD and PRD already have accepted regulatory paths for drug approval.

### Initial treatment approaches for patients with major depressive disorder [^112J7rwi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for major depressive disorder has been antidepressant monotherapy or, preferably, the combination of psychotherapy and antidepressants. However, combining antidepressant agents as a first-line treatment is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely practiced. Factors for choosing an antidepressant include indication, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Patient preference and treatment history should also be considered when deciding which initial treatment approach is appropriate.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to management of inadequate response, APA 2019 guidelines recommend to offer any of the following options in adult patients with depression not responding or only partially responding to initial antidepressant therapy:

- switching to cognitive therapy

- switching to another antidepressant medication.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering combination therapy with CBT and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate-to-severe MDD.

### How do you choose a second-line treatment option for depression? [^114qt5A5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A majority of patients with major depression do not remit or adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy. When response is insufficient, a diagnosis of depression and any comorbidities should be confirmed, treatment adherence should be established, and antidepressant dosages should be optimized as tolerated. If response is still insufficient, then implementing second-line treatment strategies is warranted. Second-line strategies of switching to or combining/augmenting the initial agent with one of a variety of antidepressant medications and/or psychotherapies improves remission rates, although no single approach or agent has demonstrated clear superiority over any other. Second-line treatment selections should be driven by safety considerations, patients' symptom profiles, and patient preference. Comorbid medical conditions, especially cardiac and cerebrovascular complications, and potential drug-drug interactions should be considered when making treatment decisions.

### Mental health gap action programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders [^115u7BUk]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to maintenance therapy, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider continuing antidepressant therapy for at least 6 months after remission in adult patients with moderate-to-severe depression benefited from initial antidepressant therapy. Obtain regular monitoring of treatment with special attention to treatment adherence, change in depressive symptoms, and possible adverse effects.

---

### Limitations in efficacy of antidepressant monotherapy [^114xcgd4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment for major depressive disorder does not achieve remission in about 50% of patients following 2 treatment trials. Researchers conducted the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study to compare various treatments for efficacy and tolerability. This article will focus on the efficacy of antidepressant monotherapy as determined by the STAR*D trial. Patients in the first treatment step of STAR*D received citalopram monotherapy and, depending on their response, moved either to follow-up or through a series of up to 4 additional treatment steps, each comprising different monotherapies, combinations, or augmentation treatment options. Only 1 of 3 patients remitted with the initial monotherapy. Rates of remission for each consecutive monotherapy were increasingly lower, suggesting that a series of monotherapy options may not be the best treatment strategy for patients who are nonresponsive to an initial monotherapy.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. III. pharmacotherapy [^113PVR2R]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008–2009 to reflect advances in the field.

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included Levels of Evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Pharmacotherapy" is one of 5 guideline articles.

Results

Despite emerging data on efficacy and tolerability differences amongst newer antidepressants, variability in patient response precludes identification of specific first choice medications for all patients. All second-generation antidepressants have Level 1 evidence to support efficacy and tolerability and most are considered first-line treatments for MDD. First-generation tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants are not the focus of these guidelines but generally are considered second- or third-line treatments. For inadequate or incomplete response, there is Level 1 evidence for switching strategies and for add-on strategies including lithium and atypical antipsychotics.

Limitations

Most of the evidence is based on trials for registration and may not reflect real-world effectiveness.

Conclusions

Second-generation antidepressants are safe, effective and well tolerated treatments for MDD in adults. Evidence-based switching and add-on strategies can be used to optimize response in MDD that is inadequately responsive to monotherapy.

### What alternatives to first-line therapy for depression are effective? [^115Bfngj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression is often a chronic illness that requires a methodical, long-term approach to manage it optimally. A single antidepressant trial is often insufficient for patients to achieve remission. Remission rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are about 30% to 35%. Using successive treatment steps with optimal medication dosing and making measurement-based treatment decisions can help patients achieve remission, but, at each step, remission is less likely than at the first step. Depression is considered treatment-resistant if 2 adequate trials of medication fail. Clinicians can use validated symptom checklists such as the 16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, Global Assessment of Functioning, and Sheehan Disability Scale to identify patients with treatment-resistant depression. Treatment resistance is likely in patients with a history of depressive chronicity and concurrent psychiatric and medical disorders and may be mistakenly suspected in patients who have had an inadequate trial of medication or who have been misdiagnosed. Strategies that can be effective to combat treatment resistance include optimizing treatment, switching to another antidepressant, combining antidepressants, and augmenting antidepressants with nonantidepressant treatments such as buspirone, lithium, liothyronine, atypical antipsychotics, or other agents. In addition, clinicians need to cultivate strong therapeutic alliances with patients, use objective measurements, practice evidence-based medicine, and educate patients about the disease and its treatments.

Type of medications

Different classes and mechanisms of action

The EMA mentions that the two treatment failures could be with medications of "same or different class". Other guidelines, including the FDA guidance, do not make this distinction. Interestingly, the concept of 'different mechanisms' may overlap with 'different classes', although the pharmacological overlap between classes and mechanism of action is not absolute; the Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN) for psychotropic agents has greatly contributed to clarify this issue. Moreover, there are some geographically-relevant label limitations to the usage of some medications (see also Appendix).

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 75%) that, to define TRD, the two antidepressant treatment failures should be with two established (licensed) medications for MDD of different mechanisms of action. The two treatments could be separated by a drug free period (and there is failure to both), prescribed sequentially (switching, with failure to both), or one is prescribed as augmentation to the other (because of the first drug failing, and with the augmentation also failing).

Moreover, we also recommend (with moderate consensus, 78%) that a failed course of psychotherapy should not be included as one of the previous treatments required for the definition of TRD/PRD, but this information should be reported for staging (see below). Notably, this recommendation does not have implications for the role of psychotherapies in the treatment of TRD, and, similarly to other TRD models proposed, we support the use of psychotherapies as a treatment strategy for TRD in clinical practice.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder — first-line treatment for uncomplicated mild to moderate MDD: As first-line treatment for uncomplicated mild to moderate MDD (see Recommendation 17 for complex cases), we recommend offering one of the following treatments based on patient preference, safety/side effect profile, history of prior response to a specific medication, family history of response to a medication, concurrent medical illnesses, concurrently prescribed medications, cost of medication and provider training/competence: evidence-based psychotherapy — Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), Behavioral therapy/behavioral activation (BT/BA), Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Interpersonal therapy (IPT), Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and Problem-solving therapy (PST); or evidence-based pharmacotherapy — Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine) (SSRIs), Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), Mirtazapine, or Bupropion. The evidence does not support recommending a specific evidence-based psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy over another.

Progressing towards optimised evidence-based guidelines

Our demonstration of (es)ketamine being well-studied with high efficacy adds to the current literature indicating the potential for being upgraded in guidelines. It is not currently recommended as a first-line augmentation strategy in major national/international guidelines. Its highest position is in the MPG where it is considered a second-line choice, but some (older) guidelines do not recommend this yet (e.g.).

Likewise, bupropion appears effective and well-studied in early-stage TRD (albeit with marked heterogeneity), but is only regarded as a first-line pharmacological augmenter by one of the ~10 major national/international guidelines (MPG). Furthermore, its efficacy, safety and tolerability in MDD have been reasonably demonstrated. Monotherapeutic bupropion is not currently licenced for MDD in some countries (e.g. UK); therefore, we would cautiously recommend that the licencing status of bupropion in the UK be reconsidered.

Finally, despite a general paucity of evidence overall for psychological therapies, the ES of CBT was greater than for other treatments and although CBT is recommended in national guidelines for treating MDD, it is rarely specifically recommended as a therapy for TRD. Given the results presented in this work, we suggest reconsideration of this position.

In summary, in this large synthesis of augmentation and combination treatments of pharmacological and psychological treatments for TRD, we find both pharmacological and psychological therapies show larger treatment effects than placebo. Our findings firstly support lithium, aripiprazole and quetiapine as current first-line augmenters for TRD; our findings do not show support for brexpiprazole over these agents, although it is a second-line augmenter in some guidelines. We urge large-scale investigations of understudied agents showing promise, including modafinil, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy. Finally, we hope that our findings are considered in updating treatment guidelines, particularly in the potential for upgrading (es)ketamine, CBT, mecamylamine and bupropion. We acknowledge, however, that our findings are not free from methodological problems and considerable heterogeneity remains between studies for most treatment approaches, in addition to an enduring overall relative paucity of evidence for monotherapy-resistant depression.

Limitations and conclusions

While we discuss many points of debate in the Appendix, here we want to acknowledge the main limitations of this report.

First, the recommendations are based on experts' and stakeholders' clinical and professional judgement, supported by research and clinical evidence, but without any hard and objective validation. Second, our recommendations try to strike a balance between being 'too broad' and being 'too narrow', with the aim to identify 'clinically homogenous' samples, based on a pragmatic and non-aetiologically-based approach; still, we cannot exclude that significant phenotypic or biological heterogeneity is present within the defined TRD/PRD samples, and future research will allow to define this inherent variability, if any, in clinical features, biomarkers, and clinical response. Third, the opposite risk is also present: that we define groups so narrowly that the findings are not generalisable to the larger population of PWLE in clinical settings, and do not translate into better care; however, maintaining narrow definitions may help avoiding overmedicalisation and may prevent the lowering of the threshold above which treatments which are specific for TRD are offered to patients, as a recent commentary on this topic highlighted.

In terms of theoretical limitations, some of our contributors have argued that the proposed TRD/PRD definitions are unhelpful from a clinical and a conceptual perspective, as they arbitrarily apply thresholds on a continuum, and are influenced by the different healthcare systems. Moreover, TRD and PRD concepts are based upon a conceptualisation of depression as an episodic illness with good inter-episode recovery, while many individuals with MDD have a chronic illness with waxing and waning course; this might create difficulties when trying to accurately identify the beginning and end of the current/previous episodes, in order to define response to the antidepressants. Finally, we recognise that, according to our recommendations, individuals with MDD with an ineffective (< 25%) single antidepressant trial are not defined as either TRD or PRD; as in standard clinical practice, these subjects should be prescribed a second antidepressant before a decision can be made on their TRD status.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^116Wk65d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Criteria for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and partially responsive depression (PRD) as subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD) are not unequivocally defined. In the present document we used a Delphi-method-based consensus approach to define TRD and PRD and to serve as operational criteria for future clinical studies, especially if conducted for regulatory purposes. We reviewed the literature and brought together a group of international experts (including clinicians, academics, researchers, employees of pharmaceutical companies, regulatory bodies representatives, and one person with lived experience) to evaluate the state-of-the-art and main controversies regarding the current classification. We then provided recommendations on how to design clinical trials, and on how to guide research in unmet needs and knowledge gaps. This report will feed into one of the main objectives of the EUropean Patient-cEntric clinicAl tRial pLatforms, Innovative Medicines Initiative (EU-PEARL, IMI) MDD project, to design a protocol for platform trials of new medications for TRD/PRD.

Prospective or retrospective assessment

A related issue, particularly important for regulatory clinical trials, is whether one treatment failure should be 'prospective within the trial', i.e. the trial starts with an established medication for MDD at an adequate dose, and then the person is offered a new intervention only if the medication fails to improve or eliminate MDD symptoms. We acknowledge that this, while ideal, would lead to operational execution challenges within a trial, with increased complexity and burden for the sites and study participants.

We recommend (with moderate consensus, 75%) that it is possible to assess ineffective past/current antidepressant treatment attempts, but only if properly documented, that is, based not only on subjective recollection or standardised instruments to assess psychiatric history and previous treatments (see below), but also on clinical documentation, such as pharmacy, hospital, or other health records. This documentation can also be used to confirm some degree of adherence to the failed treatments, and to screen people with depressive symptoms for previous episodes of mania, hypomania, or sub-threshold bipolarity, since these individuals should be excluded (see below).

Adherence to treatment is a well-recognized critical issue in both clinical and research settings. Rates of adherence vary across the literature and generally are limited by different and/or restricted time periods. However, people with MDD have typically high reported rates of non-adherence (up to more than 50%). It is therefore vital to properly confirm the individual's adherence in order to define non-response: many cases of TRD may not be true TRD, but, instead, represent partial or full non-adherence. However, the assessment of treatment adherence can be difficult and is often not addressed in everyday settings, or in most current studies in TRD. The most reliable method to assess adherence is to perform a blood test to measure the concentration of the medication in the plasma (which would also allow the recognition of fast and slow metabolisers), even though it may increase the participants' burden during the trial. Although this suggestion was clearly supported by the experts, systematic use of plasma level monitoring in TRD/PRD definitions is not current practice. It is important to note that the FDA does not accept data analyses that exclude individuals not compliant to the previous treatment based on a blood dosing of the medicine. Further discussion on adherence is presented in the Appendix. However, we recommend assessing the usefulness of different methods to measure a person's adherence for a potential (and desirable) future implementation (see Future directions).

Treatment-resistant depression can be attributed to multiple causes, including nonadherence to medication and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Selecting the appropriate strategy for a patient with treatment-resistant depression, whether it be a single antidepressant, a combination of medications, or a nonpharmacologic method, depends on a correct determination of the cause of the patient's resistance to treatment.

### Augmentation and combination strategies in resistant depression [^115edWSK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

A minority of patients with depression achieves remission with first-line antidepressant treatment; consequently, a second medication is often added to enhance the effects of the initial agent. The second medication may or may not be another antidepressant. Clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of many agents commonly used for augmentation or combination therapy, but well-designed, large trials with a clear definition of treatment resistance are needed.

GRADE suggests that randomized controlled trials start as high‐quality evidence and observational studies as low‐quality evidence, and in accordance with the GRADE criteria, each article is rated as providing a weak, moderate, or high certainty of evidence (Table 1) (Burns et al. 2011; Schünemann et al. 2013). The GRADE system is a widely accepted tool used in the process of building recommendations and answering clinical questions with recommendations. A third reviewer (Amer M. Burhan) resolved disagreements in ratings between the two reviewers to assist in reaching a consensus.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^1111HenB]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent reviews usually define failure to respond as "lack of decrease in depressive severity of at least 50%" (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). The report from the European Group for the Study of Resistant Depression identifies resistance as less than 50% symptom reduction (Bartova et al. 2019). Although reports do not consistently agree on a definition of adequate dose and duration, the minimum duration cited is typically 4 weeks (Gaynes et al. 2018), and the range of 4–12 weeks (Ng et al. 2019). This expert panel proposes the following criteria for initial treatment resistance (Table 3).

Table 3
Operational definition suggested for the initial stage of treatment‐resistant depression (TRD)

The treatment failure component of the definition of TRD revealed a diversity of opinions among experts based on conflicting data on the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and the benefits of using antidepressants from different groups in managing TRD. There exists mixed evidence regarding the advantages of prescribing medications from the same class or different classes and therefore this study deliberately did not explore this (Bschor et al. 2018; Carvalho et al. 2014). The other area of consideration is how the failure of an antidepressant trial is defined. On one hand, failure of two antidepressants can mean nonresponse during the initiation of treatment, but the failure of an antidepressant may also occur during the maintenance phase of treatment with the relapse of a depressive episode following a remission despite being on adequate doses of medication. The mechanism of tachyphylaxis remains unclear and continues to be under investigation (Targum, 2014). Given the multifactorial etiology for medication failures, these considerations further warrant a dimensional approach to define TRD and clarify the heterogeneity of this population.

Recent evidence continues to support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as first-line agents in the elderly, and although the transdermal monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegilene has shown promise in adult patients, it has not been studied in geriatric depression. Augmentation therapy with atypical antipsychotics or other agents may provide benefits for agitated, psychotic, or resistant MDD in the elderly. The few treatment studies that have been conducted in the geriatric population since the publication of the guidelines have had mixed results and high placebo response rates. More large controlled trials are needed.

Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the biggest causes of disability worldwide, affecting 300 million people, the equivalent to 4.4% of the world's population. In 2015, depressive disorders led to a global total of over 50 million years lived with disability. In England, the total cost of services for depression (health and social care, criminal justice services and informal care from family members) was estimated to be in the region of £1.7 billion; adding lost employment increased this by a further £5.8 billion – 2007 data from.

MDD is often considered as an episodic condition. If an episode is causing significant functional impairment, it may warrant treatment using psychotherapeutic, pharmacological or neurostimulatory treatments. However, a significant proportion of patients have sub-optimal responses to treatment and experience MDD as a chronic condition. In the largest clinical trial ever conducted of what would be consistent with first-line UK treatment of MDD, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram led to around 30% of patients being relatively free of symptoms, that is, in remission. For those who do not respond, an alternative treatment can be tried, but a significant proportion of patients do not achieve remission despite serial treatments. Such patients are often described in the literature as suffering from 'treatment-resistant depression' (TRD). TRD is an arbitrary academic construct with no universally accepted criteria. It is based on failure to achieve a response or remission from a series of sequential acute treatment trials. Most commonly, TRD is defined as a failure to respond to adequate trials of two different treatments but there is lack of consensus regarding the required length of trial, dose of drug for depression and outcome measures to assess response for those treatment trials. Even the 'classic' criteria of failure to respond to two drugs for depression ('antidepressants'), the most common element in TRD definitions, was present in just 50.3% of 150 trials systematically reviewed. TRD definitions also rarely take into account non-response to psychotherapy or neurostimulatory treatments. In addition, the concept of TRD does not address issues of lack of tolerability of treatment or the key issue of a non-sustained response/remission, the risk of which is known to be higher the more previous failed treatment trials a patient has had. The first recommendation of a Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for the definition of TRD was the need for a 'definition of TRD for clinical trials conducted for regulatory purposes', highlighting the challenge arising from the lack of clear criteria. It has been proposed that a more heuristic conceptualisation is of 'difficult-to-treat depression' (DTD) based upon a clinically determined situation in which a patient is suffering from MDD that continues to be associated with a significant burden despite usual treatment interventions. A DTD model is more pragmatic, drawing on the models of care for chronic physical health problems with waxing and waning symptoms such as arthritis, diabetes and hypertension. DTD is not a diagnosis per se, but rather a framework or model of care arguably more appropriate for examining the burden of depression in naturalistic clinical practice.

1 INTRODUCTION

Depressive disorders constitute one of the most common disabling diseases worldwide with an estimated prevalence of 264 million globally (Disease, and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2018). In the Canadian population, depression has a lifetime prevalence of 9.9% (Patten et al. 2015) with an estimated economic cost of 12 billion dollars a year (Tanner et al. 2020). Among those who receive first‐line treatment for depression, approximately 50% do not achieve remission and about two‐thirds require further sequential treatment trials to achieve remission (Ferrari et al. 2013; Rush, Trivedi, Wisniewski, Stewart, et al. 2006). This disease burden confers increased morbidity and mortality, decreases the quality of life (Alonso et al. 2011), impairs occupational, social, and offspring development (Greenberg et al. 2015; Ishak et al. 2013; Lim et al. 2008), and translates into increased costs on the health‐care system (Coiro et al. 2012; Weissman et al. 2014). For both patients living with depression that does not remit despite multiple treatment trials, and clinicians providing treatment, consensus on the definition, and treatment protocols for treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) are needed.

There is a lack of consensus on the definition of TRD. Broadly conceptualized as partial or no response to adequate evidence‐based trials of treatment, TRD has a prevalence of up to 60% of the depression cohort (Berman et al. 1997). Treatment resistance may be conceptualized to include characteristics, such as chronic and persistent symptoms of low mood, repeated depressive episodes, or poor response to medications or other therapies. The challenges of defining TRD include the heterogeneity of the syndrome, lack of standardization of criteria for an "adequate trial", and whether to include nonpharmacological treatments, resulting in a lack of consensus and validity of definition. The most utilized definition in the last 2 decades with support from the largest naturalistic trial (sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression [STAR*D]) is the lack of response after two antidepressant treatment trials (Berman et al. 1997). Several countries have suggested an internationally accepted TRD definition (Vaccarino & Kennedy, 2020), but unanimity has been elusive (Fava, 2003).

### Depression: managing resistance and partial response to treatment [^115wYXzQ]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is defined as absence of remission despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications and can occur in up to 31% of patients with major depressive disorder. Partial response to treatment is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. Before diagnosing treatment-resistant depression or partial response to treatment, adherence to adequate doses and duration of medications should be confirmed. Management strategies include adding psychotherapy, switching antidepressant medication class, or augmenting with additional medications. Current guidelines recommend augmentation with a second-generation antidepressant, an atypical antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, or a triiodothyronine medication as pharmacologic options. Ketamine and esketamine can also be used as augmentation for treatment-resistant depression and may help reduce suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be effective. Pharmacogenetic testing has limited evidence and is not recommended. Nonpharmacologic therapies include psychotherapy, exercise, and focused dietary changes.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

TRD and PRD definitions

What is lack of response?

A treatment response in MDD is defined by a reduction of at least 50% in MDD severity on a standardised rating scale (see below); 'lack of response', encompassing both TRD and PRD, is the mirror image of this definition, that is, less than 50% reduction in depression severity. TRD is further associated, in most definitions, with the 'classic criteria' of lack of response to at least two medications at an adequate dose and duration (see below). There is, however, much variability around the definition of TRD. In a recent systematic review, Brown et al. reported that, out of 155 TRD definitions identified in the published literature, 48.4% specified at least two sequential treatment failures as a requirement. In an even more recent systematic review, Gaynes and colleagues found that only 37% of intervention studies in TRD had enrolled individuals with MDD meeting the criteria of at least two failed antidepressants, and only 19% had also described failure to adequate doses and durations of treatments. In fact, the most common definition for TRD in intervention trials involved a minimum of only one previous failed treatment (48%). Thus, the majority of studies on TRD do not seem to use the 'classic criteria', making it difficult to pool or compare data across these TRD studies. Not surprisingly, there was a strong consensus (98%) for our first recommendation that a definition of TRD for clinical trials conducted for regulatory purposes is necessary.

Operational criteria for TRD and PRD

Based on a number of guidelines and other expert documents, in this report we adopt the definition of TRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of less than 25% in MDD severity to at least two antidepressants, and of PRD as indicating individuals who show a reduction of between 25% and < 50% in MDD severity to at least one antidepressant. This should ideally be established using prospective psychometric assessments, or at least using clinical interviews and health records to measure retrospectively the improvement in depression severity (see below).

The majority of experts, even though with moderate consensus (85%), recommended the importance of this distinction between TRD and PRD for randomized clinical trials for new treatments, especially because of the potential advantage of separating these individuals for different types of randomized controlled trials (for example, switching for TRD vs. augmentation for PRD).

### Polygenic risk scores of lithium response and treatment resistance in major depressive disorder [^114VMoQC]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is associated with a staggering burden for affected individuals and society. Antidepressants are a first-line treatment for MDD and are generally effective in reducing symptoms and preventing relapse. However, only one-third of individuals with MDD reach complete symptom remission, while another one-third or more fail to respond to antidepressant medications. When individuals with MDD experience an insufficient response to first-line antidepressants, alternative treatment strategies, such as lithium augmentation, switching to a different antidepressant, or a combination of antidepressants, may be used to improve treatment outcomes. Lithium, primarily used to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder, has been found to be effective in preventing relapse and hospital readmission in MDD when used as an augmentation therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is typically recommended as second- or third-line treatment for individuals with severe MDD who are not responsive to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or who have an urgent need for rapid clinical improvement in mood due to psychotic symptoms or suicidality.

### Strategies for achieving full remission when first-line antidepressants are not enough [^111mcX5y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Remission rates for patients with major depressive disorder are discouragingly low. Even when first-line treatment is administered at an adequate dose for a sufficient duration, approximately two-thirds of patients will fail to achieve remission, and many who remit have residual symptoms. Clinicians must assess problems with the first treatment and select the most appropriate second-line treatment based on patient preference, clinical judgment, and any comorbid conditions. Strategies like implementing psychotherapy, switching agents, or augmenting antidepressants may help patients achieve remission. Patients may also require adjunctive therapy to target common residual symptoms such as fatigue or insomnia.

### Treatment-resistant depression: prevalence, risk factors, and treatment strategies [^1117eMwL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Full symptomatic remission is the optimal outcome for patients with major depression. Unfortunately, initial antidepressant efficacy is limited to partial response for many patients. Incomplete remission of depressive symptoms is associated with increased risk of relapse, decreased functioning in work and social settings, and increased risk of suicide. Factors that increase the likelihood of treatment resistance include chronicity, severe symptomatology, and comorbid illnesses. Strategies to manage patients who do not respond to an initial course of antidepressant medication include optimizing the dose, switching antidepressants, or adding adjunctive treatment (ie, psychotherapy or a second medication). Augmentation may be the preferred strategy for improving response if tolerability to the original agent is acceptable and the initial medication has had some beneficial effects. Tracking patients' depressive symptoms with standardized measurement tools during the course of treatment is necessary for identifying incomplete remission and providing appropriate treatment modification.

### Issues in treatment-resistant depression [^11129XY9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating disease that imposes significant social and economic burdens not only on patients but also on society. Although various treatment options are available, treatment-resistant depression is common. Determining the exact prevalence of treatment-resistant depression is difficult because definitions vary, as do definitions of antidepressant response. Operational definitions of antidepressant response, nonresponse, partial response, and remission will be discussed in this article. Pharmacotherapy options for patients with treatment-resistant depression include augmentation, combination, and switching therapies; however, data from controlled clinical trials supporting these therapies are limited. Electroconvulsive therapy and psychotherapy offer additional treatment strategies. New nonpharmacologic therapies are under investigation. Remission is the goal of treatment.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^112Vu4PK]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis of augmentation strategies for TRD using the definition of two failed treatments (FTs) identified only 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological therapies for qualitative synthesis, of which only 27 were suitable for network meta-analysis. Similar results were reported in a previous meta-analysis, using the same inclusion criteria. Only three psychological trials were identified. High pre-post effects were evident across several interventions, albeit in the presence of high between-study heterogeneity. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-targeting agents, which are not included as first-line augmenters in treatment guidelines, elicited higher effect sizes (ESs) than other classes and with lower heterogeneity.

However, this TRD definition does not capture the large proportion of clinical trials of adjunctive treatments in MDD that utilise an inclusion criterion of non-response to one adequate treatment in the current episode. This is clinically significant as non-responders to first-line treatment are at increased risk of non-response to subsequent treatments and poorer long-term functional outcomes. Moreover, in large pragmatic trials, such as STAR*D, approximately one in every two patients with MDD do not respond to initial antidepressant treatment. Therefore, they represent a large, clinically important population in whom further study of treatment efficacy is necessary. Additionally, to our knowledge, ketamine treatments have not been subjected to meta-analysis in this population of individuals with early-stage TRD. We acknowledge that there are various considerations being made around the terminology used to refer to this population of people. The most common name still in use here is Stage I of the Thase and Rush model of treatment resistance. However, neither this nor other validated staging models incorporate non-response to psychological therapies in their definitions, despite there being arguments in favour of this. In order to mirror the substantial previous research using the term 'TRD' but to differentiate this article's definition from TRD defined as non-response to two therapies, we henceforth use the term 'early-stage TRD' in reference to a non-response to one adequate pharmacological or psychological therapy for depression. Although we use the term early-stage TRD, which we believe does describe a clinically important and distinct group, we do not suggest that this cohort necessarily follows a linear progression into Stage II TRD.

### Switching antidepressants for treatment-resistant major depression [^116HVjWS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients suffering from major depression experience insufficient clinical response, despite appropriate treatment. Switching to a different monotherapy antidepressant medication is the preferred option for many patients and clinicians. The possible advantages of switching to a different monotherapy, as compared with adding a second agent (i.e., augmenting or combining), include reduced medication costs, fewer drug interactions, better adherence, and less patient burden over time. Response rates for switching, are based largely on open trials, which reveal a response rate of approximately 50%. These response rates are comparable to the response rates reported with augmentation or combination, again established largely by noncomparative open trials. This review article summarizes clinical considerations and available evidence regarding switching antidepressants in the treatment of major depression. Practical issues, such as when to consider switching and how to switch from one medication to another, are addressed.

### Psychological therapies for treatment-resistant depression in adults [^112pbv2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are a first-line treatment for adults with moderate to severe major depression. However, many people prescribed antidepressants for depression don't respond fully to such medication, and little evidence is available to inform the most appropriate 'next step' treatment for such patients, who may be referred to as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance suggests that the 'next step' for those who do not respond to antidepressants may include a change in the dose or type of antidepressant medication, the addition of another medication, or the start of psychotherapy. Different types of psychotherapies may be used for TRD; evidence on these treatments is available but has not been collated to date. Along with the sister review of pharmacological therapies for TRD, this review summarises available evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults (18 to 74 years) with TRD with the goal of establishing the best 'next step' for this group.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with TRD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (until May 2016), along with CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO via OVID (until 16 May 2017). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. There were no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants aged 18 to 74 years diagnosed with unipolar depression that had not responded to minimum four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose. We excluded studies of drug intolerance. Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression were based onthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) or earlier versions, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, Feighner criteria, or Research Diagnostic Criteria. We included the following comparisons.1. Any psychological therapy versus antidepressant treatment alone, or another psychological therapy.2. Any psychological therapy given in addition to antidepressant medication versus antidepressant treatment alone, or a psychological therapy alone. Primary outcomes required were change in depressive symptoms and number of dropouts from study or treatment (as a measure of acceptability).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate, and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third person. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses when appropriate. We summarised continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs), and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs).

Main Results

We included six trials (n = 698; most participants were women approximately 40 years of age). All studies evaluated psychotherapy plus usual care (with antidepressants) versus usual care (with antidepressants). Three studies addressed the addition of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) to usual care (n = 522), and one each evaluated intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) (n = 60), interpersonal therapy (IPT) (n = 34), or group dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) (n = 19) as the intervention. Most studies were small (except one trial of CBT was large), and all studies were at high risk of detection bias for the main outcome of self-reported depressive symptoms. A random-effects meta-analysis of five trials (n = 575) showed that psychotherapy given in addition to usual care (vs usual care alone) produced improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms (MD -4.07 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.07 to -1.07 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale) over the short term (up to six months). Effects were similar when data from all six studies were combined for self-reported depressive symptoms (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.14; n = 635). The quality of this evidence was moderate. Similar moderate-quality evidence of benefit was seen on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale (PHQ-9) from two studies (MD -4.66, 95% CI 8.72 to -0.59; n = 482) and on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) from four studies (MD -3.28, 95% CI -5.71 to -0.85; n = 193). High-quality evidence shows no differential dropout (a measure of acceptability) between intervention and comparator groups over the short term (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.24; six studies; n = 698). Moderate-quality evidence for remission from six studies (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.52; n = 635) and low-quality evidence for response from four studies (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.7; n = 556) indicate that psychotherapy was beneficial as an adjunct to usual care over the short term. With the addition of CBT, low-quality evidence suggests lower depression scores on the BDI scale over the medium term (12 months) (RR -3.40, 95% CI -7.21 to 0.40; two studies; n = 475) and over the long term (46 months) (RR -1.90, 95% CI -3.22 to -0.58; one study; n = 248). Moderate-quality evidence for adjunctive CBT suggests no difference in acceptability (dropout) over the medium term (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.47; two studies; n = 549) and lower dropout over long term (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.97; one study; n = 248). Two studies reported serious adverse events (one suicide, two hospitalisations, and two exacerbations of depression) in 4.2% of the total sample, which occurred only in the usual care group (no events in the intervention group). An economic analysis (conducted as part of an included study) from the UK healthcare perspective (National Health Service (NHS)) revealed that adjunctive CBT was cost-effective over nearly four years.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence shows that psychotherapy added to usual care (with antidepressants) is beneficial for depressive symptoms and for response and remission rates over the short term for patients with TRD. Medium- and long-term effects seem similarly beneficial, although most evidence was derived from a single large trial. Psychotherapy added to usual care seems as acceptable as usual care alone. Further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of different types of psychotherapies for patients with TRD. No evidence currently shows whether switching to a psychotherapy is more beneficial for this patient group than continuing an antidepressant medication regimen. Addressing this evidence gap is an important goal for researchers.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately half of patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a nonantidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

NDSP for major depressive disorder is reported as less efficacious than other psychotherapies and pharmacotherapy and is not considered a first-line treatment; for example, Cuijpers et al. (2012) found the differential effect size of NDST compared to other psychological treatments to be small (g = -.20), yet it is appropriate to offer this modality to patients who decline or cannot access first-line treatments, either locally or via telehealth, with providers following the principles of MBC and regularly assessing patient symptoms and functioning and revisiting the treatment plan if improvements are not demonstrated; this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, and the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation, noting that the possible benefits of receiving NDSP outweigh the potential harms of receiving no treatment.

American College of Physicians guideline — Recommendation 3 for patients not responding to a second-generation antidepressant states: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence); Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant (conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence); Switching to a second-generation antidepressant from a different pharmacologic treatment (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.

### Treatment-resistant depression [^1142LZDp]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a common clinical occurrence among patients treated for major depressive disorder. However, a clear consensus regarding the criteria defining TRD is lacking in the psychiatric community. Many patients who are considered treatment resistant are actually mis-diagnosed or inadequately treated. Clinicians need to accurately diagnose TRD by examining primary and secondary (organic) causes of depression and acknowledging paradigm failures that contribute to a misdiagnosis of TRD. A correct determination of what constitutes TRD requires consensus on criteria of treatment response (i.e., dose, duration, and compliance) and on the number of adequate trials required before a patient is determined to be nonresponsive. Additionally, clinical validation of available staging models needs to be completed. While several studies have identified predictors of non-response, clinical studies investigating the predictors of resistance following the failure of 2 or more antidepressant trials should be pursued. In managing TRD, 3 pharmacotherapy strategies are in clinical use: optimization of antidepressant dose, augmentation/combination therapies, and switching therapies. However, the optimal strategy for treating TRD has yet to be identified. Therefore, further controlled clinical trials are essential to identify the most effective treatment strategies.

### Prognosis and improved outcomes in major depression: a review [^114s7HsG]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment outcomes for major depressive disorder (MDD) need to be improved. Presently, no clinically relevant tools have been established for stratifying subgroups or predicting outcomes. This literature review sought to investigate factors closely linked to outcome and summarize existing and novel strategies for improvement. The results show that early recognition and treatment are crucial, as duration of untreated depression correlates with worse outcomes. Early improvement is associated with response and remission, while comorbidities prolong course of illness. Potential biomarkers have been explored, including hippocampal volumes, neuronal activity of the anterior cingulate cortex, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and central and peripheral inflammatory markers (e.g., translocator protein (TSPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)). However, their integration into routine clinical care has not yet been fully elucidated, and more research is needed in this regard. Genetic findings suggest that testing for CYP450 isoenzyme activity may improve treatment outcomes. Strategies such as managing risk factors, improving clinical trial methodology, and designing structured step-by-step treatments are also beneficial. Finally, drawing on existing guidelines, we outline a sequential treatment optimization paradigm for selecting first-, second-, and third-line treatments for acute and chronically ill patients. Well-established treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are clinically relevant for treatment-resistant populations, and novel transcranial stimulation methods such as theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) have shown promising results. Novel rapid-acting antidepressants, such as ketamine, may also constitute a paradigm shift in treatment optimization for MDD.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in Japan [^111j4s3w]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Japanese treatment guidelines, consensus guidelines, and treatment algorithms for managing patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been developed and/or updated in the past decade. The treatment guidelines, which are evidence-based, are the most detailed of the 3 types of guidance; they describe how to establish a treatment plan, treatment methods, and special problems such as intractable depression and suicide. The Japanese consensus guidelines were compiled from the results of a survey about treatment choices in MDD that was sent to members of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were the most common first-line treatments, followed by tricyclic antidepressants and tetracyclic antidepressants. The consensus guidelines are not evidence-based but are practical and easy to use. The Japanese treatment algorithm for MDD is a flowchart created in conjunction with the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project. The flowchart shows steps in treatment both for patients who respond to initial treatment and for those who need several trials of treatment. These 3 forms of guidance for managing patients with MDD in Japan are reviewed.

### Major depressive disorder: understanding the significance of residual symptoms and balancing efficacy with tolerability [^112GrDhr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder is a complex and frequent psychiatric condition that poses significant challenges to both the patients who experience it and the physicians who treat them. The goal of therapy is for patients to achieve remission, which requires identifying and measuring symptoms at the outset and throughout treatment to document both response and resistance to treatment. A number of validated instruments are available both for diagnosis of and response to treatment. Many factors affect a patient's ability to achieve remission, but although many patients do achieve remission, a significant number continue to have residual symptoms that cause functional impairment.

Methods

Review of the literature for treatment of major depression, including mechanisms of action, individualized treatment optimization, residual symptom reduction, and minimization of side effects.

Results

For sustained remission, all symptoms must be treated until they are undetectable. Patients who do not achieve remission after adequate treatment trials should be evaluated for adherence to treatment, as well as comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders. In these cases, consideration should be given to changing therapy by switching, combining, or augmenting initial therapy, as well as referring some patients to a psychiatrist for treatment with specialized modalities. Linking symptoms with malfunctioning brain circuits and neurotransmitters provides a targeted approach for achieving sustained remission. Neurobiology also provides a rational basis for combination therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression, because it can aid selection of different drugs with different mechanisms of action or of multifunctional/multimodal antidepressant drugs that target more than 1 molecular mechanism.

Discussion

Recent advances and better understanding of neurobiology provide a rational basis for individualizing treatment of patients with major depression.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111tKVfj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment (augmentation/combination) is recommended for the ~50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

Methods:

We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

Results:

In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9 weeks (range 5 days to 18 months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73) and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a not inconsiderable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's (aripiprazole, (es)ketamine, mirtazapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone). We report marked heterogeneity between studies for almost all analyses.

Conclusions:

Our findings support cautious optimism for several augmentation strategies; although considering the high prevalence of TRD, evidence remains inadequate for each treatment option.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^113nRYr1]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians face another challenge because, after several weeks of the first-line treatment, only 50% of patients respond (i.e. achieve depression severity less than half that at pre-treatment), and only 30% remit (i.e. return to a euthymic state). Patients' failure to respond or remit requires consideration of alternative treatments. Guideline recommendations for second-line treatment include dose escalation, switching to a different antidepressant or adding a different drug. The last strategy may be divided into 'augmentation' when a non-antidepressant drug is added to an antidepressant and 'combination' when two antidepressants are used together. Systematic reviews of RCTs agree that dose escalation confers no benefit beyond continuing the initial drug dose; consistent with these results, the German National Guideline clearly states that dose escalation for SSRI does not work. Two previous systematic reviews have found some support for the switching strategy, especially to an antidepressant from a different class. However, a recent more rigorous meta-analysis found no high-level evidence that switching the antidepressant is effective when compared to simply continuing the initial antidepressant. There are also reviews that support various augmentation strategies and combination strategies. However, most of the RCTs addressing patients who fail to respond to initial pharmacotherapy for depression compared new strategies against continuing preceding treatment; far less evidence exists comparing alternative second-line strategies against one another. For example, only two reports have directly compared switching vs combination strategies among patients who failed first-line treatment: one study compared combination vs switching vs continuing the prior treatment, while another compared dose escalation vs combination vs continuing the prior treatment. Unfortunately, neither study was sufficiently powered (only 32–38 patients in each arm in the first study and 98–99 patients in the second study) to reach meaningful conclusions. The STAR*D trial randomised 1439 patients with major depression who had not remitted on citalopram to various switching strategies or augmentation/combination strategies. However, they used an equipoise-stratified design which gave patients choices in their treatment regimen: only 105 patients consented to randomisation to any of the drug switching or augmentation strategies, and consequently the analyses had to be conducted separately among the switching strategies or among the augmentation/combination strategies. A recently published study compared switching to bupropion against combining with bupropion or augmenting with an antipsychotic aripiprazole among 1522 patients with antidepressant-refractory major depression and found that aripiprazole augmentation significantly increased response over bupropion combination or switching. Most patients in this trial were, however, chronically depressed and highly refractory (the mean duration of index episode was more than 85 months and the mean number of previous medication courses was 2.4). The trial does not, therefore, address the initial treatment of a new depressive episode.

### Defining treatment-resistant depression [^113vrr12]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Varying conceptualizations of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have made translating research findings or systematic reviews into clinical practice guidelines challenging and inconsistent.

Methods

We conducted a review for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to clarify how experts and investigators have defined TRD and to review systematically how well this definition comports with TRD definitions in clinical trials through July 5, 2019.

Results

We found that no consensus definition existed for TRD. The most common TRD definition for major depressive disorder required a minimum of two prior treatment failures and confirmation of prior adequate dose and duration. The most common TRD definition for bipolar disorder required one prior treatment failure. No clear consensus emerged on defining adequacy of either dose or duration. Our systematic review found that only 17% of intervention studies enrolled samples meeting the most frequently specified criteria for TRD. Depressive outcomes and clinical global impressions were commonly measured; functional impairment and quality-of-life tools were rarely used.

Conclusions

Two key steps are critical to advancing TRD research: (a) Developing a consensus definition of TRD that addresses how best to specify the number of prior treatment failures and the adequacy of dose and duration; and (b) identifying a core package of outcome measures that can be applied in a standardized manner. Our recommendations about stronger approaches to designing and conducting TRD research will foster better evidence to translate into clearer guidelines for treating patients with this serious condition.

APA adolescent depression — initial treatment recommendations state that for initial treatment of adolescent patients with depressive disorders, the panel recommends that clinicians offer cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy adapted for adolescents (IPT-A), with the strength listed as "Recommendation for use" and justification that, based on the literature reviewed that met the AMSTAR requirements, these were the only psychotherapy interventions with evidence of efficacy. The panel recommends fluoxetine as a first-line medication compared to other medications for adolescent patients with major depressive disorder, specifically when considering medication options, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend either treatment (psychotherapy or fluoxetine) over the other for major depressive disorder.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^115ewQdW]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3 What is the operational definition for initial treatment resistance?

On the basis of the most recent systematic review, no agreed‐upon dichotomous definition exists for TRD (GRADE‐high) (Gaynes et al. 2018). Although experts often agree on a requirement for two treatment failures, they do not agree on the definition for the adequacy of either dose or duration or outcome measures. Definitions do not regularly incorporate failure with regard to augmentation agents (Vaccarino & Kennedy, 2020). Besides differences in criteria, none of the definitions of TRD have been systematically examined for reliability and predictive value utility (GRADE‐high; Gaynes et al. 2018; Souery et al. 2006). In reviewing the STAR*D reports, one can clearly see that the crucial point at which the risk of treatment resistance markedly increased was after two treatment failures (Rush, Trivedi, Wisniewski, Nierenberg, et al. 2006).

### Switching treatments for complicated depression [^116REw2c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of depressed patients will not experience remission when treated with a first-line antidepressant. As a next-step strategy for patients who achieve partial response to the initial antidepressant, clinicians may opt to augment the first antidepressant with another medication or combine it with a second antidepressant. For nonresponders or for patients experiencing intolerable side effects, clinicians may choose to switch medications. Switching can be done within the same drug class to obtain different pharmacologic properties, or to another class to obtain a different neurochemical effect. Switching appears to be fairly well tolerated and effective for patients with treatment-resistant depression, but should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and preferences.

### Use of risperidone as augmentation treatment for major depressive disorder [^114NFSCc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of risperidone for augmentation treatment in patients with major depressive disorder who fail to achieve adequate response to antidepressant monotherapy.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-August 2010) and EMBASE (1980-August 2010) was conducted, using the terms risperidone and major depressive disorder. In addition, a manual search of the references cited in each publication identified from the database search was conducted to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language, peer-reviewed publications identified from the data sources were evaluated. Four clinical trials and 1 subanalysis of a clinical trial were included for analysis.

Data Synthesis

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that displays antidepressant properties due to its activity at various serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Studies have demonstrated that risperidone augmentation may be effective and safe when used at low doses. Although several of the studies identified had limited sample sizes, all studies demonstrated improvement on various standardized depressive symptom assessment scales. Study durations ranged from 4 to 24 weeks, with doses ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg/day. The most common adverse effects associated with risperidone therapy were headache, dry mouth, and increased appetite.

Conclusions

Clinical evidence suggests that the use of risperidone as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression may improve rates of response and remission, but long-term effectiveness and safety cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, an adequate trial of first-line agents from different classes and/or a combination of agents from different classes would be recommended prior to initiation of risperidone. If the decision is made to start risperidone, health-care providers should ensure that patients are educated regarding the potential benefits and adverse effects before initiating risperidone.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^113UZ49B]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous antidepressant treatments

Here we discuss: (1) how many previous treatments should be considered, (2) in which episode (current and/or past) and (3) the way the treatment failure or partial response should be assessed for inclusion in clinical trials (prospectively and/or retrospectively).

Number of previous treatments

The FDA guidance acknowledges that no universally accepted definitions exist for TRD or PRD, and proposes that TRD studies should include people with MDD who have not responded to more than one (so, at least two) prior medications administered at an adequate dose and duration. Similarly, the EMA opts for the same definition of at least two failed treatments when considering the matter "in a clinical pragmatic view". This same definition is confirmed as the most common in the review by Gaynes and colleagues, and endorsed by the DTD consensus statement by McAllister–Williams and colleagues, although the last document states that some individuals might be considered to have DTD even with a single treatment failure, for example when standard treatments are contraindicated. There is also an uncertainty around PRD. EMA documents do not specify a precise number of previous treatments to diagnose PRD, while the FDA indicates that "for adjunctive treatment, studies should include patients with partial responses to other antidepressant therapies".

Consistent with the most commonly used criteria, we recommend that TRD should be defined after a minimum of two failed treatments with < 25% of improvement with adequate dosing and duration (strong consensus, 96%), while PRD can be defined even after a single treatment (improvement 25 to < 50%) with adequate dosing and duration (moderate consensus, 76%).

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^117Ccn8h]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a debilitating chronic mental illness that confers increased morbidity and mortality, decreases the quality of life, impairs occupational, social, and offspring development, and translates into increased costs on the healthcare system. The goal of this study is to reach an agreement on the concept, definition, staging model, and assessment of TRD.

Methods

This study involved a review of the literature and a modified Delphi process for consensus agreement. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II guidelines were followed for the literature appraisal. Literature was assessed for quality and strength of evidence using the grading, assessment, development, and evaluations system. Canadian national experts in depression were invited for the modified Delphi process based on their prior clinical and research expertize. Survey items were considered to have reached a consensus if 80% or more of the experts supported the statement.

Results

Fourteen Canadian experts were recruited for three rounds of surveys to reach a consensus on a total of 27 items. Experts agreed that a dimensional definition for treatment resistance was a useful concept to describe the heterogeneity of this illness. The use of staging models and clinical scales was recommended in evaluating depression. Risk factors and comorbidities were identified as potential predictors for treatment resistance.

Conclusions

TRD is a meaningful concept both for clinical practice and research. An operational definition for TRD will allow for opportunities to improve the validity of predictors and therapeutic options for these patients.

VA/DoD major depressive disorder (MDD) guideline — perinatal and geriatric populations: For individuals with mild to moderate MDD who are breastfeeding or pregnant, we recommend offering an evidence-based psychotherapy as a first-line treatment (see Recommendation 7). In patients with a history of MDD prior to pregnancy who responded to antidepressant medications, and are currently stable on pharmacotherapy, weigh risk/benefit balance to both mother and fetus in treatment decisions. For older adults (≥ 65 years) with mild to moderate MDD, we suggest offering a first-line psychotherapy (see Recommendation 7). Patient preference and the additional safety risks of pharmacotherapy should be considered when making this decision.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^112PXfBN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

### Real-world characteristics of European patients receiving SNRIs as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder [^113Eogvv]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are among the most frequently prescribed antidepressants (ADs) for major depressive disorder (MDD), with an increasing trend in the last decade. Given the relative dearth of information regarding rationales for their preferred use as first-line ADs in the broad clinical routine, the present study systematically investigated real-world characteristics of MDD patients prescribed either SNRIs or other AD substances across different countries and treatment settings.

Methods

In the present secondary analyses based on a large European, multi-site, naturalistic and cross-sectional investigation with a retrospective assessment of treatment outcome, we firstly defined the proportion of MDD patients receiving SNRIs as first-line AD psychopharmacotherapy and secondly compared their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to those patients prescribed alternative first-line ADs during their current major depressive episode (MDE).

Results

Within the total sample of 1410 MDD patients, 336 (23.8%) received first-line SNRIs. Compared to other ADs, SNRIs were significantly associated with inpatient care, suicidality and treatment resistance during the current MDE, and a longer lifetime duration of psychiatric hospitalizations. Moreover, greater severity of depressive symptoms at study entry, higher daily doses of the administered ADs, as well as more frequent prescriptions of psychopharmacotherapeutic add-on strategies in general and antipsychotic augmentation in particular, were significantly related to first-line SNRIs.

Conclusions

Considering the limitations of a cross-sectional and retrospective study design, our data point towards a preferred use of first-line SNRIs in a generally more severely ill MDD patients, although they did not lead to superior treatment outcomes compared to alternative ADs.

Second-generation antidepressant strategies after inadequate response — evidence gap: For adult patients with major depressive disorder who have either not responded or only partially responded to an initial adequate second-generation antidepressant treatment attempt, there is insufficient evidence to determine differences in treatment effect for switching to another second-generation antidepressant, switching to a nonpharmacologic (i.e., cognitive therapy) monotherapy, or augmenting with guided cognitive-behavioral therapy self-help; the panel labels this Insufficient evidence for a recommendation and states the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against these options.

### A Delphi-method-based consensus guideline for definition of treatment-resistant depression for clinical trials [^1166xNR2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Current or past episodes

The preferred definition of TRD for clinical trials includes a current failure and a past failure, i.e. subjects are currently receiving an antidepressant and they are still depressed according to current clinician's assessment, and they were also treated with another antidepressant in the past and showed no response based on retrospective assessment. However, it is unclear whether both of these treatments should apply to the same (current) episode or to clearly distinct episodes. Indeed, although the EMA definition of MDD emphasizes the current episode for the characterisation of the disease, it does not clarify whether the two failures should both be during the current episode. Of course, it is difficult to retrospectively defining the response to an antidepressant, especially if the current episode is of long duration (years) and the previous treatment was closer to the onset of the episode.

We recommend (with weak consensus, 51%) that the definition of TRD should include two treatment failures both within the current episode, and the definition of PRD should include partial response to at least one treatment within the current episode; moreover, for long current episodes, only treatment failures within the last two years should be considered. Of note, the "minority" position was split across a continuum of different opinions ranging from those who wanted to maintain that both antidepressants should be in the same episode but within a shorter period of time (shorter than two years) to those who wanted to consider two antidepressants "life-time"; thus, our recommendation sits in the middle of these extremes.

### Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: Canadian expert consensus on definition and assessment [^115u2LGG]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

Having a consensus for the definition of TRD could improve and standardize care by indicating when a treatment resistance algorithm should start. No current definition provides sufficient detail for the accurate triaging and staging of patients in clinical settings or proper assessment for the selection of research participants. Therefore, since the late 1990s, researchers have proposed more detailed staging models intended to serve both clinical and research needs. The lack of a universally accepted staging model or a consensus definition for TRD creates ongoing barriers for patients to receive the appropriate care based on the severity, chronicity, and treatment response.

The goal of this study is to reach an agreement on the concept, definition, staging model, and assessment of TRD. Creating an optimal definition for TRD will help improve research to address patient needs, better define this heterogeneous population, and allow clinicians to communicate using the same terminology. Operationally, this would allow more personalized care to match patients with the right treatment in a timely manner. Continued work on a more refined TRD definition and criteria can improve the comparability of research studies, enable international collaborations on the subject, and improve treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD).

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^117VTy5M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of approximately 12%. MDD imposes a substantial burden of illness and is the leading cause of disability internationally. The most common treatments for MDD are broadly classified as pharmacological or psychological, with a multitude of different treatments from each category available.

A significant proportion of patients with MDD do not respond to treatment(s) and are considered 'treatment resistant'. Although there is no universally accepted definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the most frequently used criterion is the failure to respond to two trials of pharmacological therapy of adequate dose and duration, in the current episode. Less commonly, failure of psychological therapies is also considered to contribute towards the definition of treatment resistance. The most widely used staging model of TRD is the Thase and Rush model. In this model, failure to respond to one adequate antidepressant trial from a major antidepressant class is considered Stage I TRD, and those who then do not respond to a second adequate antidepressant trial (from a different class than the antidepressant used in Stage I) are termed Stage II TRD. There are variations between measures, studies and groups in terms of requiring a second antidepressant to be from a different class, however. It has been suggested that permitting two 'failed' treatments from within a class, and permitting psychological treatments, should be incorporated in updated definitions of Stage II TRD.

### Approach to diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression [^11567J87]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a chronic and recurrent illness that affects 20% of adults during their lifetime and is one of the leading causes of suicide in the United States. A systematic measurement-based care approach is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) by promptly identifying individuals with depression and avoiding delays in treatment initiation. As comorbidities may be associated with poorer outcomes to commonly used antidepressants and increase risk of drug-drug interactions, their recognition and treatment is an essential component of management of TRD.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment. This article will review available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### MAOIs: issues in treatment adherence and rates of treatment failure [^114CQhNX]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend initiating newer antidepressants as first-line therapy for patients with depression, but response and remission rates remain low and multiple treatment trials are often needed. Adherence to medication affects response and remission rates, and nonadherence is common among patients with depression. While MAOIs have proven efficacy for depression, particularly for patients with treatment-resistant or atypical depression, this class of drugs is underprescribed due, in part, to concerns over dietary and drug restrictions that are required to avoid potential serious side effects. However, a newer MAOI formulation has an improved safety and tolerability profile and avoids or lessens the need for dietary restrictions, giving clinicians another option for treating patients who may be nonadherent or nonresponsive to their current antidepressant.

### Using adjunctive treatments when first-line antidepressants fail [^112bwbGJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a common challenge for clinicians, as the majority of patients with depression do not achieve remission after an initial antidepressant trial. Major strategies for managing treatment-resistant depression include switching to another antidepressant or augmenting the initial antidepressant with another medication. Switching may be appropriate for patients experiencing little or no symptom relief or intolerable side effects with the initial antidepressant. For patients who experience partial response from the first-line antidepressant, adjunctive therapies avoid the loss of this response and the wash-out and cross-titration that are required when switching antidepressants. Several effective antidepressant augmentation agents are available, including lithium, thyroid hormone, anti-anxiety medications, and atypical antipsychotics. The evidence for the efficacy and risks of these strategies is discussed.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. IV. neurostimulation therapies [^11691DrY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008–2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is renewed interest in refined approaches to brain stimulation, particularly for treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Neurostimulation Therapies" is one of 5 guidelines articles.

Results

Among the four forms of neurostimulation reviewed in this section, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has the most extensive evidence, spanning seven decades. Repetitive transcranial magnetic (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been approved to treat depressed adults in both Canada and the United States with a much smaller evidence base. There is also emerging evidence that deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for otherwise treatment resistant depression, but this is an investigational approach in 2009.

Limitations

Compared to other modalities for the treatment of MDD, the data based is limited by the relatively small numbers of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and small sample sizes.

Conclusions

There is most evidence to support ECT as a first-line treatment under specific circumstances and rTMS as a second-line treatment. Evidence to support VNS is less robust and DBS remains an investigational treatment.

### Depression: managing resistance and partial response… [^117UWGSc]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology Depression is among the most common psychiatric disorders in the United States. Major depressive disorder has a 12-month prevalence of 10% and a lifetime prevalence of 21%, with an average onset at 30 years of age. 1 Only about one-third of patients respond to an initial trial of a first-line antidepressant medication, and a significant proportion of patients will not respond despite multiple interventions. 2 Although it lacks a universal definition, treatment-resistant depression is most commonly defined as absence of remission using validated scoring tools despite trials of two or more antidepressant medications at adequate dose, duration, and adherence. 3, 4 This definition, however, does not account for partial response to treatment, which is defined as less than 50% reduction in depression-rating scores. When applied to treatment, these often overlapping criteria can make comparing and synthesizing studies difficult.
