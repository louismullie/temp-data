## Question

What is the role of endoscopy in celiac disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of endoscopy in celiac disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic foundation and when endoscopy with biopsy is required. Then, I should verify the no-biopsy exceptions, especially in pediatrics. Next, I will examine endoscopic technique and sampling strategy to maximize yield. After that, I need to review capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy, clarifying their roles and limitations. Then, I will assess endoscopy's role in monitoring and follow-up, including when to repeat biopsies. Finally, I should consider special populations and controversies, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation: in most adults and children, celiac disease diagnosis requires EGD with multiple duodenal biopsies to confirm villous atrophy and align histology with serology, and this remains the cornerstone across ACG, ESsCD, and AGA guidance, with biopsy performed while the patient is on a gluten-containing diet to preserve sensitivity [^113E41WA] [^113qQ1WH] [^1117f7bV] [^116MSc3o].

> Wait, let me verify the no-biopsy exception in pediatrics, because I initially thought it was broadly applicable to all children with very high serology. Hold on, I should verify the exact criteria. ESPGHAN 2020 allows a no-biopsy diagnosis in selected children only when there is a high-level tTG-IgA (typically ≥ 10× ULN) plus a positive EMA on a separate sample, with appropriate clinical context and shared decision-making, and importantly, this approach does not extend to adults, where biopsy confirmation remains standard despite emerging debate [^113E41WA] [^113qXNcX] [^116dJP8o].

> I need to ensure the sampling strategy is precise: multiple biopsies are necessary because villous atrophy is patchy. Guidelines recommend at least 1–2 from the duodenal bulb and at least 4 from the distal duodenum, totaling 6 or more, submitted in separate vials, as including the bulb increases diagnostic yield by roughly 9–13% and achieves high sensitivity when combined with distal sampling [^1124nodg] [^113UL3jB] [^11759NDp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about endoscopic appearance; I should double-check that normal-appearing mucosa does not exclude disease. Characteristic findings such as scalloping, fissuring, or a mosaic pattern can support suspicion, but their absence is common, so random biopsies of both normal and abnormal mucosa are essential to avoid false negatives [^114So9Ps] [^115TTPRP].

> Next, I should review capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy; let me think about their roles and limitations. Capsule endoscopy can visualize villous atrophy throughout the small bowel with sensitivity around 70–85% and specificity near 100% in untreated disease, but it cannot provide tissue for histology and carries a retention risk of about 0.9–4.6%, so it is not first-line for initial diagnosis and is reserved for patients unable or unwilling to undergo EGD or for equivocal cases after serology and standard endoscopy [^115U66wz] [^116sScRr] [^114JZxfy].

> I will now examine the role of endoscopy in monitoring and follow-up; I should confirm when repeat biopsy is indicated. Repeat EGD with biopsies is recommended for nonresponsive celiac disease to assess adherence and alternative diagnoses, and in adults after about 2 years of a gluten-free diet, mucosal healing can be assessed via biopsy after shared decision-making, recognizing that serology correlates imperfectly with histologic recovery and negative serology does not guarantee mucosal healing [^114P83Es] [^111RzP2g] [^112jf3cr] [^114Cad95].

> But wait, what if the patient has refractory celiac disease; I need to check the imaging and biopsy strategy. In type 2 refractory celiac disease, small-bowel imaging with capsule endoscopy and CT or MR enterography is advised to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunoileitis, and advanced duodenal biopsies with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor studies help distinguish RCD type 1 from type 2 and guide prognosis and therapy [^11581EaN] [^111D5iLC] [^114hG6Fe].

> Let me consider special populations and controversies. I should confirm how to handle seronegative suspected disease and those already on a gluten-free diet. In seronegative enteropathy with villous atrophy and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity, a gluten-free diet trial with subsequent histologic improvement supports seronegative celiac disease, whereas in patients already avoiding gluten, a gluten challenge of about 1–3 months with adequate gluten intake improves diagnostic yield before biopsy and serology are repeated [^115qmbRu] [^116MSc3o].

> I should double-check that I am aligning with guideline hierarchies and practical pearls. Major societies converge on EGD with multiple duodenal biopsies as the diagnostic standard in adults, emphasize bulb sampling to optimize yield, restrict capsule endoscopy to select scenarios, and reserve repeat biopsy for nonresponsive disease or selected long-term follow-up, with pediatric no-biopsy pathways tightly circumscribed by strict serologic criteria and shared decision-making [^113E41WA] [^113UL3jB] [^116sScRr] [^113qXNcX].

> In summary, endoscopy with duodenal biopsy remains the diagnostic cornerstone for most patients with suspected celiac disease, with technique and sampling strategy materially affecting diagnostic yield. Capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy serve as adjuncts for patients who cannot undergo EGD or in the evaluation of complications, while monitoring of nonresponsive disease and selected long-term assessments rely on targeted repeat endoscopy because serology alone is insufficient to confirm mucosal healing [^113E41WA] [^11581EaN] [^112jf3cr].

---

Endoscopy is essential in celiac disease for **confirming diagnosis** with duodenal biopsies [^113E41WA] and for **evaluating nonresponsive or refractory cases** to detect complications and guide management [^111RzP2g] [^111YfmGR]. Routine endoscopy is not needed for asymptomatic patients on a gluten-free diet, but is indicated when symptoms persist or complications are suspected [^114P83Es] [^1123iKy9]. Capsule endoscopy is useful when EGD is incomplete or contraindicated, but cannot replace biopsy for diagnosis [^116sScRr] [^112woMuG]. Endoscopy also supports the **differential diagnosis** of other malabsorptive or inflammatory enteropathies [^113qQ1WH].

---

## Diagnostic role of endoscopy

### Confirmation of diagnosis

- **Gold standard**: EGD with multiple duodenal biopsies is required to confirm celiac disease in adults and children with positive serology or high clinical suspicion [^113E41WA] [^113qQ1WH].

- **Biopsy protocol**: Obtain at least 4–6 biopsies, including 1–2 from the bulb and 4 from the distal duodenum, to maximize diagnostic yield [^1124nodg] [^113UL3jB].

- **Histopathology**: Characteristic findings include villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) [^112vzQGx].

---

### Limitations and challenges

- **Patchy disease**: Villous atrophy can be patchy; normal endoscopic appearance does not exclude celiac disease, so random biopsies are necessary [^114So9Ps] [^112cHutz].

- **Seronegative cases**: In highly suspected seronegative patients, endoscopy with biopsy is essential to confirm diagnosis [^116MnGTm] [^113ijxun].

- **Pediatric considerations**: A no-biopsy approach is accepted in selected children with very high tTG-IgA and positive EMA, but endoscopy remains standard in most cases [^115nWXyd].

---

## Therapeutic role of endoscopy

### Monitoring disease progression and response to therapy

Follow-up biopsy is considered after **2 years** on a gluten-free diet in adults to assess mucosal healing, particularly in nonresponsive or complicated cases [^114P83Es] [^111RzP2g]. Serology correlates poorly with mucosal healing; **histology remains the gold standard** for assessing recovery [^112jf3cr] [^114Cad95].

---

### Management of complications

Nonresponsive celiac disease warrants endoscopy with biopsies to assess for **ongoing villous atrophy**, **alternative diagnoses**, or **refractory celiac disease (RCD)** [^111RzP2g] [^111YfmGR]. Refractory celiac disease requires **repeat biopsies** to distinguish type I (normal IELs) from type II (clonal IELs), which has major prognostic implications [^111D5iLC] [^1137VSEm].

---

## Role of capsule endoscopy

Capsule endoscopy is useful when EGD is incomplete or contraindicated, offering high sensitivity and specificity for mucosal changes, but it **cannot replace biopsy** for diagnosis [^116sScRr] [^115U66wz]. It is valuable in refractory celiac disease to detect **ulcerative jejunoileitis**, **strictures**, or **lymphoma** that may be beyond the reach of standard endoscopes [^11581EaN] [^114hG6Fe].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Endoscopy helps differentiate celiac disease from other malabsorptive or inflammatory enteropathies, such as:

- **Microscopic colitis**: Often coexists with celiac disease [^114XkXZs].

- **Giardiasis**: Can mimic celiac disease [^111fg3Gs].

- **Autoimmune enteropathy**: Requires specific histologic and immunologic evaluation [^notfound].

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: Can be diagnosed via jejunal aspirate during endoscopy [^114XkXZs].

---

## Limitations and risks

- **Invasiveness**: EGD is invasive and may cause discomfort or complications (e.g. bleeding, perforation) [^116evMn4].

- **Sedation risks**: Sedation-related complications, though rare, can occur [^notfound].

- **Capsule retention**: Rare risk, especially in patients with strictures [^116evMn4].

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Endoscopy recommended?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of celiac disease | Yes | Confirm diagnosis with biopsies [^113E41WA] |
| Nonresponsive celiac disease | Yes | Assess for ongoing atrophy, RCD, or complications [^1123iKy9] |
| Refractory celiac disease | Yes | Subtype RCD, exclude lymphoma [^113cb468] |
| Asymptomatic patients on GFD | No (routine) | Serology suffices; biopsy only if complications suspected [^notfound] |
| Capsule endoscopy | Selective | Use when EGD incomplete or contraindicated [^116sScRr] |

---

Endoscopy is central to celiac disease care for **diagnosis**, **complication assessment**, and **therapy monitoring**, especially in nonresponsive or refractory cases. It is not routine for asymptomatic, well-controlled patients but is essential when symptoms persist or complications are suspected.

### Detecting celiac disease in your patients… [^113UW3Cv]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a gluten enteropathy occurring in both children and adults. The condition is characterized by a sensitivity to gluten that results in inflammation and atrophy of the mucosa of the small intestine. Clinical manifestations include malabsorption with symptoms of diarrhea, steatorrhea, and nutritional and vitamin deficiencies. Secondary immunologic illnesses, such as atopic dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia and aphthous ulcers, may be the primary presentation. 4 Those with elevated levels were tested for antiendomysial antibodies. The prevalence of elevated antiendomysial antibody levels in healthy blood donors in the United States was found to be 1:

250. This rate is similar to the prevalence in Europe, where subsequent small intestine biopsies have confirmed celiac disease in all patients testing positive for antiendomysial antibody. 5 The authors of the U. S.

study 4 conclude that data suggest that celiac disease may be greatly underdiagnosed and is relatively common in this country. 7 In patients with celiac disease, the immune system is abnormally activated by gluten, specifically the gliadin portion of wheat protein, and prolamines in rye, barley and oats. 8 Thus, celiac disease is a genetic, immunologically mediated, small intestine enteropathy in which mucosal villi are destroyed by cellular and humoral-mediated immunologic reactions to gliadin protein. Studies of patients with celiac disease using molecular techniques demonstrate a strong association with specific HLA class II genotypes. Approximately 95 percent of patients with celiac disease have a particular type of HLA DQ alpha and beta chain encoded by two genes, HLA-DQA1 0501 and HLA-DQB1 0201.

14 In a study 15 of 212 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were managed over a period of 25 years with a gluten-free diet, several benefits of dietary therapy were found, including the patients' need for medication was reduced or abolished, the enteropathy resolved and patients experienced a feeling of well-being after beginning the diet. The proof of the diagnosis is progressive improvement in the patient's symptoms when on an absolutely gluten-free diet. If the diagnosis remains in question, an endoscopic examination should be performed and several biopsy specimens should be taken from the lower duodenum and upper jejunum. It is helpful to have this tissue interpreted by a pathologist familiar with celiac disease.

Best Practice Advice 1 — confirmation of initial celiac disease diagnosis states that in patients suspected to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings; if the prior diagnostic workup was equivocal or discrepant, testing for the celiac disease–associated HLA haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 can be considered, and seronegative celiac disease can occur with the diagnosis established by a clinical and histologic response to the gluten-free diet in patients with consistent pathology and compatible HLA haplotypes.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, more specifically with respect to tissue sampling (celiac disease), ESGE 2021 guidelines recommend to take at least 6 biopsies from different locations in the duodenum, including 2 samples from the duodenal bulb, in patients with suspected celiac disease. Consider placing biopsies in the same container.

Celiac disease histologic monitoring — endoscopic biopsy timing and predictors of incomplete recovery are specified. "The intestinal biopsies from an EGD are an important tool in the follow-up of CD. Histological evaluation is in essence an evaluation of mucosal healing". When injury persists, "If damage equating to at least Marsh 3 changes are still present, another biopsy is required, after 12 months". Prognostic factors from an adult study indicate that "factors predicting incomplete recovery were malabsorption (55% vs 41%, P = .003), high EMA (46% vs 25%, P < .001), and severe mucosal damage (total atrophy 32% vs 19%, P < .001) at diagnosis", while "However, the correlation between symptoms, mucosal healing, and later outcome of CD is not clear".

### Is there a need to undertake conventional gastroscopy and biopsy when making the diagnosis of coeliac disease in adults? [^116dJP8o]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease is a common autoimmune condition characterized by small intestinal inflammation and mucosal damage triggered by an inappropriate immune response to ingested gluten. Gastroscopy and duodenal biopsy are currently the gold standard approach to diagnosing celiac disease in adults. However, the emergence of highly accurate serological tests for celiac disease in the last 2 decades led to a change in the pediatric guidelines to diagnose celiac disease without biopsy in selected patients. Adopting this no-biopsy approach to diagnose celiac disease in adults remains controversial, but the evidence supporting it is growing.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British society of gastroenterology [^112vzQGx]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Adequate (more than four) biopsies should be taken, from the distal duodenum and the duodenal bulb to maximise diagnosis. The threshold for abnormal IELs is ≥ 25/100 enterocytes, but for a definite diagnosis villous atrophy is required. However, lesser degrees of damage (≥ 25 IELs but no villous atrophy) combined with positive serology (IgA-EMA, TTG or IgG–DGP) may also represent CD ('probable CD'),

The treatment of CD is a lifelong and strict GFD. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, achieve mucosal healing, avoid complications of CD, and have a good QoL with a nutritionally complete GFD. This is best achieved when patients are motivated and receive expert information in a collaborative way, with resources including expert dietitians and interested medical care. Follow-up of CD is needed to ensure response to symptoms, prevention of consequences, and continued maintenance of motivation to remain gluten free.

Discussions upon the issue of repeating duodenal biopsies were intense in our group. There is no conclusive evidence of the benefit of universal follow-up biopsy, and we were unable to reach a consensus. Some would undertake follow-up biopsies in all patients with CD after 2–5 years on a GFD (table 3). There are others who reserve follow-up biopsies for those in whom there are persistent and recurrent symptoms or those for whom the follow-up biopsies are necessary to help confirm the diagnosis in the setting of continued diagnostic uncertainty.

There are novel techniques that may enhance the sensitivity of endoscopic examination, of which the immersion technique is probably the most feasible currently. An understanding of the precise value of various serologic strategies in the detection of CD is continuing to evolve, as are advances in therapies that may ultimately provide some mitigation of the impairment of the QoL that is inherent in a strict GFD.

### Capsule endoscopy in celiac disease: diagnosis and management [^111sfynt]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Celiac disease occurs in about 1% of the population. Although diarrhea is the classical presentation, the diagnosis of celiac disease is frequently not considered as part of the differential diagnosis of a variety of different symptoms. It is, therefore, imperative that physicians who perform capsule endoscopy, and those who review the images, are aware of the variety of mucosa appearances inpatients who have celiac disease. In addition, studies are needed to determine the role of capsule endoscopy in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease.

### Limited utilization of serologic testing in patients undergoing duodenal biopsy for celiac disease [^113Pmtkv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1% in various populations. The disease is caused by an autoimmune response to gluten which leads to progressive villous atrophy in the small bowel, resulting in malabsorption. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Systemic complications are common, and can include iron deficiency anemia and fatigue. Accurate recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease is important because implementation of a gluten-free diet can ameliorate many symptoms. If left untreated, celiac disease is associated with increased mortality in adult life from a range of causes, including autoimmune diseases and malignancy.

For patients with an appropriate clinical history, diagnostic tools for the workup of celiac disease can be divided into three categories; serologic assays to measure celiac-associated autoantibodies, genetic assays to identify HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8, and duodenal biopsy to document the presence of villous atrophy. Although many groups have published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease and the role of testing in this process, surveys have found that there can be significant variation in adherence to these guidelines in different practice settings. While the exact steps of the algorithms can vary slightly depending upon the specific population being tested, most approaches recommend using serologic assays either prior to duodenal biopsy or concurrently with biopsy in cases with a strong clinical suspicion.

The most commonly-used serologic assays measure autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG), deamidated gliadin (dGDN), and endomysial tissue (EMA). Antibodies against native gliadin are losing popularity because of inferior performance when compared to the newer dGDN assays. Although most assays measure IgA antibodies against these targets, IgG versions are also available for use in patients with IgA deficiency, a disorder commonly associated with celiac disease. The diagnostic characteristics of celiac serology tests have been well-described in many populations, and in general show analytical performance sufficient for use as a screening test. tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA assays have shown the best diagnostic performance in most studies, with pooled sensitivities of 89–90% and specificities of 98–99% in a recent systematic review of the literature. Recent studies have suggested that the use of serologic testing prior to endoscopy could potentially reduce the need for intestinal biopsy to diagnose celiac disease.

A multidisciplinary panel of 18 physicians and 3 non-physicians from eight countries (Sweden, UK, Argentina, Australia, Italy, Finland, Norway and the USA) reviewed the literature on diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease (CD). This paper presents the recommendations of the British Society of Gastroenterology. Areas of controversies were explored through phone meetings and web surveys. Nine working groups examined the following areas of CD diagnosis and management: classification of CD; genetics and immunology; diagnostics; serology and endoscopy; follow-up; gluten-free diet; refractory CD and malignancies; quality of life; novel treatments; patient support; and screening for CD.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^1123iKy9]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice 1–4 for patients with suspected nonresponsive celiac disease details diagnostic verification and evaluation steps: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, "the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings". In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, ongoing gluten ingestion "should be excluded" using "serologic testing, dietitian review, and detection of immunogenic peptides in stool or urine", and "esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies should be performed" to assess for villous atrophy; if villous atrophy persists or the initial diagnosis was not confirmed, clinicians should "consider other causes of villous atrophy, including common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, tropical sprue, and medication-induced enteropathy". For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, clinicians should "perform a systematic evaluation" for other causes including "functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth". For subtyping and lymphoma exclusion, clinicians should "use flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor rearrangement studies" and recognize that "Type 1 refractory celiac disease is characterized by a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte population and type 2 is defined by the presence of an aberrant, clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population"; "consultation with an expert hematopathologist is necessary to interpret these studies".

### Endoscopy in celiac disease [^114So9Ps]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The primary objective of this review is to highlight the evidence for the role of endoscopy in celiac disease.

Recent Findings

Evidence is presented that the endoscopic markers of celiac disease are specific although not sensitive for the disease. Villous atrophy, the hallmark of celiac disease, is patchy in the duodenum, and various techniques may identify areas of villous atrophy. These methods include magnification endoscopy and chromoendoscopy. The most recent innovation, video capsule endoscopy, may be of value in the diagnosis of celiac disease and in the assessment of patients with complicated celiac disease.

Summary

Endoscopy and duodenal biopsies are the mainstay for diagnosing celiac disease. Although characteristic endoscopic features may be useful, their absence does not exclude celiac disease. Random biopsy, even of normal-appearing mucosa is necessary for the diagnosis of celiac disease.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — monitoring and follow-up after diagnosis: Best Practice Advice 10 states, "Celiac serology has a guarded role in the detection of continued intestinal injury, in particular as to sensitivity, as negative serology in a treated patient does not guarantee that the intestinal mucosa has healed. Persistently positive serology usually indicates ongoing intestinal damage and gluten exposure. Follow-up serology should be performed 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, and yearly thereafter", and Best Practice Advice 11 adds, "Patients with persistent or relapsing symptoms, without other obvious explanations for these symptoms, should undergo endoscopic biopsies to determine healing even in the presence of negative TG2-IgA".

### Advances in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease [^111VRmaY]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Celiac disease is an immune mediated disorder characterized by the loss of tolerance to ingested gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the global population and is associated with an increased risk of cancer and death. Celiac disease remains underdiagnosed owing to its heterogeneous clinical presentation, which includes intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms in children and adults. People without symptoms who are in high risk groups, such as those with certain autoimmune conditions or first degree relatives with celiac disease, should be considered for screening. Whether the general population should be mass screened for celiac disease remains an area of active debate. Although a strict gluten-free diet is the current treatment for celiac disease, dozens of drug therapies in clinical development may radically shift the current paradigm of patient care. This review will cover the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of celiac disease, with a focus on recent advances in celiac related patient care and research.

### Celiac disease affects 1% of global population: who will manage all these patients? [^112rodJX]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease is a common gastrointestinal condition with an estimated global prevalence of up to 1%. Adequate long-term surveillance of patients is imperative to ensure strict adherence to treatment with a gluten-free diet and the ensuing clinical and histologic recovery. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by means of regular on-site attendance at specialist health care facilities, accompanied for most patients by follow-up endoscopic and laboratory tests. However, the rapidly increasing prevalence of celiac disease and the limited health care resources challenge the current centralized and nonindividualized follow-up strategies. The improved noninvasive surveillance tools and online health care services are further changing the landscape of celiac disease management. There is a clear need for more personalized and on-demand follow-up based on early treatment response and patient-related factors associated with long-term prognosis. Additional scientific evidence on the optimal implementation of follow-up for pediatric and adulthood celiac disease is nevertheless called for.

Celiac disease diagnosis — initial recommendations: We recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with multiple duodenal biopsies for confirmation of diagnosis in both children and adults with suspicion of celiac disease (CD) (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence; dissent 1). We suggest a combination of high-level tissue transglutaminase (TTG) IgA (≥ 10× upper limit of normal) with a positive endomysial antibody (EMA) in a second blood sample as reliable tests for diagnosis of CD in children. In symptomatic adults unwilling or unable to undergo upper GI endoscopy, the same criteria may be considered after the fact, as a diagnosis of likely CD (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence; dissent 0).

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1117GLbq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American College of Gastroenterology celiac disease guideline update — scope, definition, and key diagnostic and treatment principles are outlined for children and adults. Celiac disease (CD) is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis, and a no-biopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up, and most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD; these patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis. In the United States, CD affects nearly 1% of residents.

### Small bowel imaging in celiac disease [^113Tntqi]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a common inflammatory disease of the small intestine triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Diagnosis is made by serologic testing and upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsy in most individuals. Celiac patients may present with abdominal pain or nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints that result in radiologic imaging before diagnosis of celiac disease. Wireless video capsule endoscopy, device-assisted enteroscopy, and enterography allow careful examination of the entire small bowel and targeted sampling of suspicious lesions. This review focuses on the role of device-assisted enteroscopy and radiologic imaging, in particular enterography, in celiac disease.

Follow-up biopsy after gluten-free diet (GFD) — timing and pediatric guidance: In USA, the median time from the onset of GFD to achieve mucosal healing in adults was 3 years; accordingly, it is reasonable to consider a follow-up biopsy in adults after 2 years of starting a GFD to assess for mucosal healing. Mucosal healing was observed in 95% children within 2 years of starting a GFD. Currently, follow-up biopsy in asymptomatic children following a GFD is not recommended.

### Emerging technologies in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and celiac disease [^116WFh6D]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in our knowledge of celiac disease, the most current and authoritative recommendations conclude that diagnosis requires at least four biopsy specimens to be taken from the duodenal area. These recommendations are based on the perception that classic endoscopic markers are not adequate to target biopsy sampling to sites of villous damage in the duodenum. In the past few years, newly developed procedures and technologies have improved endoscopic recognition of the duodenum. These advances make possible the real-time recognition of the duodenal villous pattern during an upper endoscopy procedure, and thereby have the potential to optimize diagnostic accuracy. It is, therefore, reasonable to hypothesize that upper endoscopy might have a more incisive role in the diagnosis of celiac disease than merely providing a means of obtaining biopsy specimens for histological analysis. This Review highlights the new technologies in the field of upper endoscopy that could be helpful for the diagnosis of celiac disease, including the water-immersion technique, chromoendoscopy, high-resolution magnification endoscopy, optimal band imaging, optical coherence tomography and confocal endomicroscopy.

### Diagnosis… [^114tGj3S]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

ANEMIA Anemia is the most common laboratory manifestation of celiac disease 13, 14. One half of patients with newly diagnosed gluten-sensitive enteropathy are anemic. Iron is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, where celiac manifestations are most prominent; hence, iron malabsorption is common. In addition, occult blood loss related to intense small-bowel inflammation may occur in 50 percent of patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. 17 Less commonly, vitamin B 12 deficiency, folate deficiency, or both may be present. Diagnosis SEROLOGIC TESTS When the diagnosis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy is suspected, serologic tests can identify many affected patients.
19. IgA antiendomysial antibody has been shown to be 85 to 100 percent sensitive and 96 to 100 percent specific for celiac disease. IgA antiendomysial antibody is measured using direct immunofluorescence of monkey esophagus or umbilical cord tissue processed with suspect serum.

IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies are also useful in diagnosing celiac disease. The antibody directed against endomysium has recently been identified as identical to the antibody directed against transglutaminase. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed to measure IgA antitransglutaminase; this test will generally replace the more tedious direct fluorescent antibody test for IgA antiendomysial antibody. 20–22 In diagnosing celiac disease, antitransglutaminase antibody is considered to be approximately as sensitive and specific as antiendomysial antibody. 21, 23–25. 26 Endoscopy and biopsy should be strongly considered in patients with selective IgA deficiency. Declining autoantibody titers correlate with resolution of the gastrointestinal lesion and may be used to document clinical improvement.

In equivocal cases or when a patient has been on a gluten-free diet, a gluten challenge test may be used to provoke the gastrointestinal lesion and serologic response. DISTAL DUODENAL BIOPSY Distal duodenal biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease. Biopsy should be performed in most patients with suspected gluten-sensitive enteropathy. In determining the need for biopsy, family physicians should consult a gastroenterologist who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease. 1.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^112gFkx1]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea endoscopy — recommendations (initial evaluation and small-bowel workup) state that stool and laboratory tests should be the initial step for the evaluation of clinical scenarios suggestive of infectious diarrhea. In patients with chronic unexplained diarrhea, we suggest colonoscopy with random biopsies of the right and left side of the colon, and sigmoidoscopy is an alternative option, although this may miss right-sided organic disease. We recommend intubation of the terminal ileum during colonoscopy for patients undergoing evaluation of chronic diarrhea, and there are insufficient data to determine whether biopsy of an endoscopically normal-appearing terminal ileum should be routinely performed, but the yield of this is likely low. We recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with small-bowel biopsy in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected malabsorption and inconclusive evaluation after colonoscopy with biopsy and in patients with positive celiac serology. We recommend obtaining a minimum of 4 duodenal biopsy specimens for evaluation of suspected celiac disease. Enteroscopy is not recommended for the routine evaluation of chronic diarrhea but may be useful for evaluation of small-bowel disease when other investigations are nondiagnostic.

### What is the use of biopsy and antibodies in coeliac disease diagnosis? [^112m9BqB]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The advent of highly sensitive and specific serological markers has led to some protagonists proposing that coeliac disease can be diagnosed without the need for a biopsy. However, this is an area of controversy. Lack of consensus about diagnostic degrees of histological change, paucity of symptoms, antibody-negative disease and immunodeficiency can make diagnosis difficult even with a biopsy. Conversely, an argument can be put forward for a 'no biopsy' approach based on the large number of patients with typical symptoms and positive serology who experience a diagnostic delay. In addition, endoscopy is not without discomfort. This article discusses the use of antibodies and duodenal biopsy within this context. Finally, we propose a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm for clinicians to use when investigating patients for coeliac disease.

Celiac disease (CD) diagnosis — duodenal biopsy acquisition and site selection emphasize multiple specimens and inclusion of the duodenal bulb to optimize diagnostic yield. Multiple biopsies of duodenum should be performed if the diagnosis of CD is considered, and submitting ≥ 4 specimens increased new CD diagnoses among 13,352 patients (1.8% vs 0.7%, P < 0.0001). In children and adults with positive CD-specific serology, adding duodenal bulb biopsies increases yield (e.g., 9%–13% had villous atrophy in the bulb alone), and a targeted bulb biopsy from either the 9-o'clock or 12-o'clock position plus distal duodenum achieved a sensitivity of 96% for CD. We recommend multiple biopsies including 1 or 2 from duodenal bulb and at least 4 from distal duodenum for a total of at least 6, submitted in separate vials labeled as bulb and postbulbar duodenum. Despite these directions, only 39% of clinically suspected cases had ≥ 4 biopsies, and biopsy rates were lower among Black, older (≥ 70 years), and male patients.

### Small bowel capsule endoscopy in refractory celiac disease: a luxury or a necessity? [^112WkBft]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a rare complication of celiac disease (CD). In a recent systemic review, the prevalence of RCD was reported to be 0.31–0.38% in patients with CD. It occurs more commonly in females, older individuals (> 50 years), those diagnosed with CD later on in life, and patients with signs suggestive of malabsorption. Patients with RCD have traditionally been managed with steroids and/or immunosuppressants, in addition to maintaining a gluten-free diet (GFD). Duodenal histology is repeated at intervals to ensure no progression of RCD type I to type II occurs and to rule out aberrant intraepithelial lymphocytes. The prognosis of RCD type II is poor, with a 50% 5-year survival, owing to the development of malignancy, necessitating careful follow-up. However, the follow-up interval in these patients and how it should differ between subtypes of RCD remains unclear.

Since its introduction in 2000, small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) has enabled the study of several SB pathologies such as CD. Dedicated SB imaging can be helpful to exclude malignancies such as enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) or adenocarcinoma of the SB. However, sometimes pre-malignant or malignant conditions do not necessarily result in lesions of sufficient size to be picked up on imaging, making SBCE a better alternative for delineating these lesions. In addition, SBCE allows the disease extent in the SB to be estimated. The relationship between the disease extent and the severity of CD remains unclear. However, the literature suggests that healing of the mucosa in CD patients occurs in a distal-to-proximal manner.

The main aim of this study was to assess the role of SBCE at diagnosis and its impact on subsequent management and course of disease. Secondary aims were to stratify findings on SBCE according to RCD subtype and treatment administered.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^11765mFF]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — refractory celiac disease (RCD) biopsy and imaging follow-up notes that the optimal frequency of intestinal biopsy during follow-up is yet to be defined, but a repeat intestinal biopsy 3–6 months after starting therapy is advised to assess response, including mucosal recovery and resolution of tissue molecular and genetic abnormalities in the IEL, with evaluation by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist and molecular studies by a hematopathologist advisable. It seems reasonable to repeat intestinal biopsy within 12 months after second intestinal biopsy in patients with RCD and good clinical response, whereas in patients with lack of response to initial therapy a repeat intestinal biopsy is considered after at least 3–6 months of therapy with an alternative immunosuppressor or intervention. Small bowel imaging including capsule endoscopy, MR imaging or CT enterography, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography scan should be strongly considered on a case-by-case basis anytime during follow-up when suspicion for overt lymphoma arises, particularly with RCD2, and the role of small bowel imaging during routine follow-up of patients with good clinical response is currently unknown.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease-changing utility of serology and histologic measures: expert review [^116MSc3o]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this clinical practice update is to define key modalities in the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease (CD) in adults as well as in children and adolescents.

Methods

The recommendations outlined in this expert review are based on available published evidence, including cohort and case-control studies of the diagnostic process as well as controlled and descriptive studies of disease management. Best Practice Advice 1: Serology is a crucial component of the detection and diagnosis of CD, particularly tissue transglutaminase-immunoglobulin A (TG2-IgA), IgA testing, and less frequently, endomysial IgA testing. Best Practice Advice 2: Thorough histological analysis of duodenal biopsies with Marsh classification, counting of lymphocytes per high-power field, and morphometry is important for diagnosis as well as for differential diagnosis. Best Practice Advice 2a: TG2-IgA, at high levels (> ×10 upper normal limit) is a reliable and accurate test for diagnosing active CD. When such a strongly positive TG2-IgA is combined with a positive endomysial antibody in a second blood sample, the positive predictive value for CD is virtually 100%. In adults, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and duodenal biopsies may then be performed for purposes of differential diagnosis. Best Practice Advice 3: IgA deficiency is an infrequent but important explanation for why patients with CD may be negative on IgA isotype testing despite strong suspicion. Measuring total IgA levels, IgG deamidated gliadin antibody tests, and TG2-IgG testing in that circumstance is recommended. Best Practice Advice 4: IgG isotype testing for TG2 antibody is not specific in the absence of IgA deficiency. Best Practice Advice 5: In patients found to have CD first by intestinal biopsies, celiac-specific serology should be undertaken as a confirmatory test before initiation of a gluten-free diet (GFD). Best Practice Advice 6: In patients in whom CD is strongly suspected in the face of negative biopsies, TG2-IgA should still be performed and, if positive, repeat biopsies might be considered either at that time or sometime in the future. Best Practice Advice 7: Reduction or avoidance of gluten before diagnostic testing is discouraged, as it may reduce the sensitivity of both serology and biopsy testing. Best Practice Advice 8: When patients have already started on a GFD before diagnosis, we suggest that the patient go back on a normal diet with 3 slices of wheat bread daily preferably for 1 to 3 months before repeat determination of TG2-IgA. Best Practice Advice 9: Determination of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has a limited role in the diagnosis of CD. Its value is largely related to its negative predictive value to rule out CD in patients who are seronegative in the face of histologic changes, in patients who did not have serologic confirmation at the time of diagnosis, and in those patients with a historic diagnosis of CD; especially as very young children before the introduction of celiac-specific serology.

Management

Best Practice Advice 10: Celiac serology has a guarded role in the detection of continued intestinal injury, in particular as to sensitivity, as negative serology in a treated patient does not guarantee that the intestinal mucosa has healed. Persistently positive serology usually indicates ongoing intestinal damage and gluten exposure. Follow-up serology should be performed 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, and yearly thereafter. Best Practice Advice 11: Patients with persistent or relapsing symptoms, without other obvious explanations for those symptoms, should undergo endoscopic biopsies to determine healing even in the presence of negative TG2-IgA.

Celiac disease (CD) case finding and dyspepsia — active case finding is described as the favored strategy to increase detection of CD in patients with symptoms or associated conditions, and the frequency of CD in common clinical scenarios varies from modestly elevated, such as irritable bowel syndrome, to substantially elevated, such as unexplained iron deficiency anemia. In dyspepsia specifically, prevalence of biopsy-proven CD in patients with dyspepsia is 1%, which is similar to the general population, and systematic screening for CD is not recommended because the prevalence of the disease is not higher than that in the general population. For dyspepsia workup, endoscopy may be appropriate for patients who continue to have dyspepsia despite initial therapy, those who are 55 years and older, and/or those with alarm symptoms.

### Enteroscopy in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^113MUgjV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with 3 to 6 biopsies in the descending duodenum is the gold standard for the diagnosis of celiac disease. At the time of the first diagnosis of celiac disease, an extensive evaluation of the small bowel is not recommended. However, video capsule endoscopy, because of its good sensitivity and specificity in recognizing the Endoscopic features of celiac disease, can be considered a valid alternative to EGD in patients unable or unwilling to undergo EGD with biopsies. Capsule endoscopy is also a possible option in selected cases with strong suspicion of celiac disease but negative first-line tests. In evaluating patients with refractory or complicated celiac disease, in whom a complete evaluation of the small bowel is mandatory (at least in refractory celiac disease type II patients) because of the possible presence of complications beyond the reach of conventional endoscopes, both capsule endoscopy and balloon-assisted enteroscopy have been found to be helpful. In these patients, capsule endoscopy offers several advantages: it is well tolerated, it allows inspection of the entire small bowel, and it is able to recognize subtle mucosal changes. However, in this setting, capsule endoscopy should ideally be coupled with imaging techniques that provide important information about the thickness of the wall of the intestine and about extraluminal abnormalities. Although deep enteroscopy (such as balloon enteroscopy) is expensive, time-consuming, and potentially risky in these frail patients, they may have a key role, because they make it possible to take tissue samples from deep in the small intestine.

### Diagnosis and management of celiac disease: guidelines… [^114tGcDq]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In symptomatic patients consuming a gluten-containing diet, serologic testing includes measuring tissue transglutaminase IgA levels and total IgA levels to rule out an IgA deficiency.
- Because serologic testing can have low sensitivity, endoscopy is recommended if suspicion for celiac disease is high but serology is negative.
- If patients with possible celiac disease are already consuming a gluten-free diet, testing for HLA DQ2 or DQ8 should be considered because a negative result rules out celiac disease. From the AFP Editors Nearly 1% of Americans are affected by celiac disease, a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten in wheat, barley, and rye. Celiac disease has multisystemic effects characterized by specific antibodies and small bowel injury. There is no effective medical treatment; therefore, celiac disease requires a lifelong, strict adherence to a gluten-free diet.

Diagnosis In patients with unexplained diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, or bloating, testing for celiac disease with serology should be considered. Although screening asymptomatic patients for celiac disease is not recommended, testing is an option in patients with unexplained iron deficiency, weight loss, or recurrent pancreatitis; osteopenia; elevated transaminase levels; dermatitis herpetiformis; peripheral neuropathy; oral aphthous ulcers; growth failure; or thyroid disease. Testing of asymptomatic patients who have first-degree relative with celiac disease can be considered. SubscribeFrom $180

### Histologic evaluation in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease: practical challenges, current best practice recommendations and beyond [^11736RDf]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is an immunoallergic enteropathy affecting genetically susceptible individuals upon dietary exposure to gluten. In current clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical, serologic, and histologic factors with the possible exception of pediatric patients. Histopathologic evaluation of small intestinal tissue plays a critical role in the disease diagnosis and management, despite many practical challenges. Recently published best practice guidelines help to standardize biopsy sample procurement, tissue preparation, histology interpretation, and reporting, to optimize patient care. In addition, an increasing demand for monitoring the disease course, particularly demonstrating the efficacy of dietary and nondietary interventions for disease management, calls for the use of quantitative histology. With the advent of a gradual transition toward digital pathology in routine diagnostic practice, quantitative histopathologic evaluation in CD shows a promising future.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^113cb468]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this expert review is to summarize the diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. It will review evaluation of patients with celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms, differential diagnosis, nutritional support, potential therapeutic options, and surveillance for complications of this condition.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs (nonresponsive celiac disease), ongoing gluten ingestion should be excluded as a cause of these symptoms with serologic testing, dietitian review, and detection of immunogenic peptides in stool or urine. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies should be performed to look for villous atrophy. If villous atrophy persists or the initial diagnosis of celiac disease was not confirmed, consider other causes of villous atrophy, including common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, tropical sprue, and medication-induced enteropathy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: For patients with nonresponsive celiac disease, after exclusion of gluten ingestion, perform a systematic evaluation for other potential causes of symptoms, including functional bowel disorders, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose or fructose intolerance, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Use flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor rearrangement studies to distinguish between subtypes of refractory celiac disease and to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. Type 1 refractory celiac disease is characterized by a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte population and type 2 is defined by the presence of an aberrant, clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population. Consultation with an expert hematopathologist is necessary to interpret these studies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Perform small bowel imaging with capsule endoscopy and computed tomography or magnetic resonance enterography to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunoileitis at initial diagnosis of type 2 refractory celiac disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Complete a detailed nutritional assessment with investigation of micronutrient and macronutrient deficiencies in patients diagnosed with refractory celiac disease. Check albumin as an independent prognostic factor. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Correct deficiencies in macro- and micronutrients using oral supplements and/or enteral support. Consider parenteral nutrition for patients with severe malnutrition due to malabsorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Corticosteroids, most commonly open-capsule budesonide or, if unavailable, prednisone, are the medication of choice and should be used as first-line therapy in either type 1 or type 2 refractory celiac disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Patients with refractory celiac disease require regular follow-up by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterologists and dietitians, to assess clinical and histologic response to therapy. Identify local experts with expertise in celiac disease to assist with management. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with refractory celiac disease without response to steroids may benefit from referral to a center with expertise for management or evaluation for inclusion in clinical trials.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1111vWMx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.

Discussion

This is the largest, study to demonstrate the role of SBCE in the diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with RCD. It is the first study that portrays monitoring and the use of successive SBCEs in addition to duodenal histology during the disease course of patients with RCD. We also stratified differences in the features of CD in the SB according to symptoms, CD serology, histology, type of RCD, and type of treatment administered.

A few studies have reported on the use of SBCE in patients with RCD. The main focus in these studies was the exclusion of pre-malignant and malignant complications and reporting of CD features. Most of these studies were small and therefore have had limited impact on the management of patients with RCD.

Previous studies have reported on the improvement in the extent of disease in the SB on SBCE in patients with uncomplicated CD following initiation of a GFD. There was an improvement in the extent of disease in 79% of patients following 6 months of GFD in a study by Murray et al. A more recent study by Lidums et al showed an improvement in macroscopic villous atrophy in 12 patients with CD after 12 months of GFD. We showed improvement in the extent of disease in a smaller group of patients with RCD following treatment with steroids and/or immunosuppressants in a previous study. We have confirmed the same findings in this larger study carried out in 2 European centers. Interestingly, the same improvement noted in percentage extent of disease between the first and second SBCEs was not sustained during the third and subsequent SBCEs. This raises several questions about the effectiveness of current regimens used to treat patients with RCD and the timing interval between SBCEs. Even though the importance of repeating duodenal histology and SBCE in patients with RCD is recognized, no follow-up protocol has been proposed in the literature. The poor prognosis of patients with RCD type II suggests that these patients should be followed-up more closely than those with RCD type I. More such studies are needed to provide evidence concerning the optimum time interval to follow-up these patients. We have also shown the lack of any long-term impact of steroids ± immunosuppressants beyond a few months of treatment, highlighting the possibility that these patients are being undertreated and further escalation of therapy is not being considered. Only a small number of patients (n = 5, 20.8%, and n = 3, 27.2%) underwent a treatment addition or change prior to undergoing a third and fourth SBCE, respectively. This might have contributed to the lack of improvement in the extent of disease on SBCE in these patients.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British society of gastroenterology [^117QVihN]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Ultimately, this review should not be regarded as fixed. Instead it represents our understanding of what is best in adult CD management according to current knowledge. It is likely, and indeed we hope, that there will be substantial progress in diagnosis, evaluation and management of CD to reduce the burden on the patient and society. We anticipate that future updated versions of these guidelines will be based on evolving published literature that may have an audit or research base relevant to adult CD. Data in this review were mostly retrieved through searches of PubMed. We acknowledge that there are other medical databases and we cannot rule out that had we searched more than one database we may have identified additional relevant studies that have now been left out of this review.

Areas for future research

The panel of experts recognise that the main challenge in the future is to allocate available resources effectively to reduce the burden of disease from CD.

Future research should focus on the following areas:
how to induce long-term remission without a GFD, that is, novel therapies and vaccine;
better understanding of the disease processes, including genetics and antigen presentation;
prevent and cure extra-intestinal manifestation and complications, including infections;
be able to assess tolerable amount of gluten for individual patients;
define the role of duodenal biopsy, serology and point of care testing at diagnosis and follow-up;
find a robust and valid blood marker for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease;
understand the pathogenesis of RCDI and II.

### Comparative accuracy of diagnostic tests for celiac disease… [^116evMn4]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Although endoscopy with duodenal biopsy is the definitive test for the diagnosis of celiac disease, there is evidence that accuracy is greater in academic centers than in community settings. Endoscopy is associated with a small risk of infection, and bleeding occurs in 1. 6 per 1, 000 patients. Video capsule endoscopy is an alternative to duodenal biopsy, and has very good sensitivity and excellent specificity. However, it is associated with a capsule retention rate of 0. 9% to
4. 6%. 3 The ACG recommends starting with tTG IgA testing in patients two years and older. 4 tTG IgA testing has excellent sensitivity and specificity, giving it a positive predictive value of 89. 4% and a negative predictive value of
99. 0%. IgA deficiency is more common in patients with celiac disease and should be excluded if tTG IgA testing is used.
2.

For children younger than two years, the ACG recommends using DGP IgA and IgG tests initially. 4 Limited evidence shows that DGP IgA and IgG are slightly less sensitive and specific in adults compared with tTG, but are more accurate in young children. Endomysial IgA antibody testing has a lower sensitivity than tTG IgA and equivalent specificity. It is included in several diagnostic algorithms but is not considered a first-line test in any patient population. HLA typing can play a role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected celiac disease. Among patients with celiac disease, 95% have the HLA-DQ2 heterodimer, and the other 5% have the HLA-DQ8 heterodimer. This means the absence of both of these HLA heterodimers essentially rules out the disease. editor's note: AFP SOR ratings are different from the AHRQ Strength of Evidence ratings.

### Opportunities for improving biopsy and non-biopsy-based diagnosis of celiac disease [^117LfkeF]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The accumulating data regarding a non-biopsy diagnosis of celiac disease has led to its adoption in certain scenarios, although debate on whether and when to use non-biopsy criteria in clinical practice is ongoing. Despite the growing popularity and evidence basis for a biopsy-free approach to diagnosis in the context of highly elevated serologies, there will continue to be a role for a biopsy in some groups. This review summarizes the current evidence supporting a non-biopsy approach and arguments supporting continued reliance on biopsy, and focuses on opportunities to improve both approaches.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: expert review [^116PypVC]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 2 — evaluation of nonresponsive celiac disease directs that in patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs (nonresponsive celiac disease), ongoing gluten ingestion should be excluded as a cause of these symptoms with serologic testing, dietitian review, and detection of immunogenic peptides in stool or urine, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies should be performed to look for villous atrophy; if villous atrophy persists or the initial diagnosis of celiac disease was not confirmed, consider other causes of villous atrophy including common variable immunodeficiency, autoimmune enteropathy, tropical sprue, and medication-induced enteropathy. Persistent gluten ingestion accounts for 40%–50% of patients with poorly or nonresponsive celiac disease, and negative serologies do not completely exclude intermittent or low-level gluten ingestion, and celiac antibody levels are often normal in patients with RCD. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and small bowel biopsies are essential in the evaluation, and although at least 1–2 biopsies from the duodenal bulb and at least 4 biopsies from the distal duodenum are recommended for initial diagnosis, the endoscopist should also consider obtaining up to 6 additional biopsies from the distal duodenum for flow cytometry (usually 2–3 biopsies to be placed in normal saline or RPMI medium), immunohistochemistry.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116Aitd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) and also non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all. Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up. Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing to confirm adherence with the GFD. In addition, evaluation for disorders associated with celiac disease that could cause persistent symptoms, such as microscopic colitis, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and complications of celiac disease, such as enteropathy-associated lymphoma or refractory celiac disease, should be entertained. Newer therapeutic modalities are being studied in clinical trials, but are not yet approved for use in practice. Given the incomplete response of many patients to a GFD-free diet as well as the difficulty of adherence to the GFD over the long term, development of new effective therapies for symptom control and reversal of inflammation and organ damage are needed. The prevalence of celiac disease is increasing worldwide and many patients with celiac disease remain undiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved strategies in the future for the optimal detection of patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of seronegative enteropathies: expert review [^111XmD9a]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Our aim was to provide a consensus statement for the best approaches for diagnosis and management of patients with suspected enteropathy, but negative results from serologic tests for celiac disease (seronegative enteropathy).

Methods

We collected findings from published cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies of diagnosis and case series and descriptive studies of management of patients believed to have celiac disease or other enteropathies unrelated to gluten, but negative results from serologic tests. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Review histologic findings with experienced pathologists who specialize in gastroenterology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Serologic tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis of celiac disease. For patients with suspected celiac disease but negative results from serologic tests, total IgA level should be measured; patients should also be tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase, IgA against deamidated gliadin peptide, and endomysial antibody (IgA). Patients with total IgA levels below the lower limit of detection and IgG against tissue transglutaminase or deamidated gliadin peptide, or endomysial antibody, should be considered to have celiac disease with selective IgA deficiency rather than seronegative celiac disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients' diets should be carefully reviewed and duodenal biopsies should be collected and analyzed at the time of serologic testing to determine exposure to gluten and accuracy of test results. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Thorough medication histories should be collected from patients, with attention to angiotensin II receptor blockers, such as olmesartan, along with travel histories to identify potential etiologies of villous atrophy. This will guide additional testing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Patients should be analyzed for disease-associated variants in human leukocyte antigen genes; results must be carefully interpreted. Negative results can be used to rule out celiac disease in seronegative patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Patients with suspected celiac disease who are seronegative but have villous atrophy and genetic risk factors for celiac disease must undergo endoscopic evaluation after 1–3 years on a gluten-free diet to evaluate improvements in villous atrophy. A diagnosis of seronegative celiac disease can then be confirmed based on clinical and histologic markers of improvement on the gluten-free diet. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Seronegative patients with an identified cause for enteropathy should be treated accordingly; a follow-up biopsy might or might not be necessary. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with persistent signs and symptoms who do not respond to a gluten-free diet, and for whom no etiology of enteropathy is ultimately identified, should be treated with budesonide.

Conclusions

These best practice guidelines will aid in diagnosis and management of patients with suspected celiac disease, but negative results from serologic tests.

### Small bowel capsule endoscopy in refractory celiac disease: a luxury or a necessity? [^115qxkaS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) has an established role in the management of refractory celiac disease (RCD) for the detection of complications. The aim of this study was to define the role of SBCE in the management of patients with RCD.

Method

Patients with histologically confirmed RCD who underwent successive SBCEs were recruited retrospectively from 2 tertiary centers.

Results

Sixty patients with RCD were included. The percentage extent of the affected small bowel (SB) mucosa improved on repeating a second SBCE in 26 patients (49.1%) (median 27.6% vs. 18.1%, P = 0.007). Patients with RCD type II had more extensive disease than those with RCD type I on first (41.4% vs. 19.2%, P = 0.004) and second (29.8% vs. 12.0%, P = 0.016) SBCE. Patients with RCD type I tended to show a greater improvement in percentage of abnormal SB involved on repeat SBCE compared to those with RCD type II (P = 0.049). Nine patients (15%) had RCD-related complications. Five patients developed ulcerative jejunoileitis, 3 patients developed enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma, and 1 patient developed cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Conclusions

SBCE can be a useful tool for monitoring the effects of treatment, primarily following its initiation. Patients with RCD type II have more extensive SB disease, equating to a more aggressive disease pattern.

Duodenum — routine biopsy for celiac disease in dyspepsia without additional risk features: In patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for dyspepsia as the sole indication and without other signs or symptoms associated with an increased risk of celiac disease, the AGA suggests not obtaining routine biopsies of the normal-appearing duodenum to detect celiac disease (Conditional recommendation; very low quality evidence).

### The role of endoscopy in the management of GERD [^114dkYC4]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric GERD endoscopy indications — Guidelines from the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition state that endoscopy is indicated in infants and children with GERD who fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy or as part of the initial management if symptoms of poor weight gain, unexplained anemia or fecal occult blood, recurrent pneumonia, or hematemesis exist. Erosive esophagitis is reported less often in infants and children with GERD than in adults with GERD, but approximately 25% of infants younger than 1 year of age undergoing upper endoscopy will have histologic evidence of esophageal inflammation. When EGD is performed in children with suspected GERD, tissue sampling of both normal and inflamed mucosa should be performed to exclude other conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis, gastritis, and celiac disease.
