## Question

How are arachnoid cysts managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how arachnoid cysts are managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and key differentials on imaging and pathology. Then, I should stratify by symptom status and natural history to decide on observation versus intervention. Next, I will correlate anatomy with symptoms, assess mass effect and cyst dynamics, and rule out alternative etiologies. After that, I need to plan preoperative imaging, select surgical approaches by location, and outline operative execution and intraoperative decision points. Finally, I will structure postoperative care, long-term follow-up, and special scenarios, including pediatric, spinal, hemorrhagic, and glioependymal cyst considerations, ensuring each step is backed by data and appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis framework to avoid premature anchoring. Classic arachnoid cysts follow CSF signal on all MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR) without enhancement or diffusion restriction; CT shows CSF density without enhancement, and CT cisternography can help document communication with subarachnoid spaces when needed [^111mcCQL]. Wait, let me verify the epidermoid/dermoid differentiation — yes, diffusion-weighted imaging shows restricted diffusion in epidermoid/dermoid cysts but not arachnoid cysts, which is a critical preoperative discriminator, particularly in the spine [^115iSUhK]. I should confirm histopathologic markers when tissue is obtained: arachnoid cysts are typically EMA-positive and GFAP-negative, whereas glioependymal cysts have an EMA-negative ependymal lining with GFAP-positive glial cells, a distinction that can alter management assumptions about fluid production and recurrence risk [^113FUEAm].

> Next, I should review symptom status and natural history before assigning risk. Hold on, I need to check prevalence and the typical course: in large adult series, arachnoid cyst prevalence is ~1.4%, and over 94% are asymptomatic; among those followed longitudinally for a mean 3.8 years, only 2.3% enlarged and 0.9% developed new or worsening symptoms, underscoring a conservative default for incidental, asymptomatic lesions [^117L7PCX]. Let me consider broader epidemiology and symptom attribution: population-based data in the elderly also suggest most arachnoid cysts are incidental and not associated with increased mortality or clear symptom clusters, reinforcing caution in attributing nonspecific complaints to an incidental cyst [^112UAjCN].

> I should double-check cyst dynamics and surveillance cadence. Baseline size, location, and symptom correlation should be documented, with interval MRI at 6–12 months to assess stability; if unchanged, intervals can be extended thoughtfully, provided the clinical exam remains stable and the patient is counseled on red flags such as new headaches, seizures, focal deficits, or visual/endocrine changes in sellar/suprasellar disease [^117L7PCX] [^111mcCQL]. But wait, what about traumatic complications? Middle fossa cysts carry a meaningful risk of subdural collections and hemorrhage even after minor trauma, so activity counseling, especially regarding contact sports, is prudent to mitigate the 4.6–6.5% hemorrhagic complication rates observed in temporal cysts and the risk of acute symptomatic expansion after seemingly trivial head impacts [^1127gwK8] [^111cpzD8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the decision point must be explicit. If the cyst is asymptomatic and stable on imaging, observation with clinical and imaging follow-up is the standard of care; if symptomatic, enlarging, or complicated by hydrocephalus, focal deficits, or hemorrhage, neurosurgical intervention should be considered after careful attribution of symptoms to the cyst and exclusion of alternative etiologies [^117L7PCX] [^111mcCQL].

> Now, I will outline conservative management when observation is chosen. I need to ensure a structured plan: annual clinical examinations, MRI at 6–12 months then lengthening intervals if stable, clear counseling on warning signs, and tailored activity advice given the small but real risk of hemorrhagic complications in certain locations; the low growth and symptom conversion rates over several years support this approach [^117L7PCX] [^1127gwK8]. Let me reconsider symptomatic hygromas that accompany cysts — they can often be managed expectantly with good outcomes, and symptomatic hygroma alone is not an absolute surgical indication, which tempers the impulse to intervene early [^112THC84].

> Before I plan any intervention, I need to confirm that symptoms are anatomically and physiologically attributable to the cyst. Suprasellar cysts commonly present with visual field deficits, endocrine disturbances, and hydrocephalus from chiasmal and third ventricular compression; middle fossa cysts more often relate to headaches, seizures, or hemiparesis; posterior fossa lesions can obstruct the fourth ventricle causing ataxia and cranial neuropathies; this clinico-radiographic concordance is essential to justify surgery [^111mcCQL] [^116WJAYJ]. I should verify mass effect with objective metrics: Evans index and fronto-occipital horn ratio gauge hydrocephalus burden, and in suprasellar disease the severity of hydrocephalus correlates with preoperative cyst volume; cine MRI can reveal a slit-valve phenomenon that suggests active enlargement and may predict benefit from fenestration [^113bSWeU] [^115Vqfrz].

> I need to check for competing diagnoses since misattribution can lead to unnecessary procedures. Comprehensive neurologic evaluation should consider primary headache disorders, idiopathic epilepsy, or other structural causes; indeed, some prospective work shows subjective improvement after surgery without objective neuropsychological or balance gains compared with controls, so I should be cautious and base decisions on clear mass-effect physiology and localizing symptoms rather than non-specific complaints alone [^113aovnB]. Let me verify that sellar and suprasellar cysts are more likely to be truly symptomatic than middle fossa cysts, which aligns with observational data and supports a lower threshold for intervention in suprasellar cases when visual or endocrine compromise exists [^117L7PCX].

> Next, I should review preoperative imaging and planning to minimize surprises. High-resolution MRI with CISS/FIESTA sequences delineates thin cyst walls and relationships to neurovascular structures; phase-contrast or cine MRI can assess CSF flow dynamics and detect slit valves; CT cisternography helps determine communication with the subarachnoid space in select cases; in deep or distorted anatomy, neuronavigation and, where available, intraoperative low-field MR cysternography can improve targeting, safety, and may even predict long-term outcomes [^111mcCQL] [^115E2CzK] [^111tbHgU]. For spinal disease, a full-spine MRI survey ensures other loculations are not overlooked before selecting levels for decompression or fenestration [^114VjR7L].

> I will now examine surgical approach selection by location, but hold on — I should verify that endoscopy versus microsurgery choices are evidence-aligned and anatomy-driven. For suprasellar and posterior fossa/quadrigeminal cistern cysts, endoscopic fenestration to establish durable communication with ventricles and cisterns is often preferred; for middle fossa/Sylvian fissure cysts, outcomes can be similar, though some series suggest slightly better results with microsurgical keyhole fenestration in select temporal lesions; shunting is generally reserved for failures of fenestration or complex multiloculation [^115E2CzK] [^111tbHgU] [^111jCHTw]. In the spine, intradural cysts typically undergo laminectomy with excision or fenestration; extradural cysts require removal with ligation of the communicating pedicle and dural closure to address the pathophysiologic conduit [^114VjR7L] [^113S3wsu].

> Let me detail operative execution for fenestration while I keep asking, "Did we really establish a durable pathway?" The principle is to create one or more large, safe openings from the cyst into normal CSF spaces (cisterns, ventricles, or subarachnoid space) to equalize pressure and prevent reaccumulation; neuronavigation optimizes trajectory, intraoperative endoscopic visualization confirms anatomy, and iMR or endoscopic flow visualization can verify effective decompression before closure [^111tbHgU] [^1173XLC3]. I should confirm that multiple sizable stomas are favored when safely achievable because small fenestrations risk reclosure, particularly in coaxial endoscopic corridors that can limit opening size [^111tbHgU].

> I need to check second-line strategies and their tradeoffs. If fenestration fails or anatomy limits effective communication, cystoperitoneal shunting with a programmable valve is reasonable, acknowledging risks of shunt dependence, malfunction, infection, and overdrainage; conversely, resection may be selected for discrete spinal cyst walls to reduce recurrence risk, balancing manipulation near neural structures [^114yupK1] [^114VjR7L] [^113S3wsu]. Hold on, let me verify complication profiles — endoscopic series generally report low permanent morbidity but transient CSF leaks and cranial neuropathies can occur, reinforcing meticulous closure and postoperative surveillance [^1173XLC3].

> Before I leave the OR, I should verify pathophysiologic clues that can inform prognosis. Intracystic pressure measurements, when obtained, around or above 130 mm H2O correlate with higher preoperative symptom burden and may predict symptomatic improvement after decompression, even though absolute values can lie within "normal" ICP ranges, suggesting altered compliance and impedance contribute to symptoms beyond simple pressure elevation [^112Xtqzu]. I need to ensure careful hemostasis because arachnoid cyst membranes can harbor fragile vessels and patients with middle fossa cysts have a recognized risk for subdural collections post-decompression, mandating gentle technique and attention to CSF dynamics and dural closure quality [^1127gwK8].

> Postoperative management needs structured checkpoints. I should confirm immediate neurologic monitoring and vigilance for CSF leakage in the first 48 hours; at 2–6 weeks, clinical reassessment and MRI document decompression and check for complications like subdural hygroma or hematoma, most of which can be observed if asymptomatic, reserving drainage for progressive or symptomatic collections [^112THC84]. Pain control, early mobilization, and timely suture removal are standard, but I need to keep a low threshold to reimage for recurrent symptoms suggesting fenestration closure or shunt malfunction [^112THC84].

> Long-term follow-up should be explicit so I don't lose track of late recurrences. Let me verify a reasonable schedule: MRI at 3–6 months, annually for two years if stable, then every 2–3 years with clinic evaluations to correlate imaging with symptoms; success typically includes substantial cyst volume reduction with symptom improvement, and contemporary series report overall clinical improvement in roughly 70–90% after effective decompression, with the caveat that headaches and seizures can be less predictable than focal deficits or hydrocephalus relief [^113bSWeU] [^114j8cRR]. If symptoms recur and imaging suggests reaccumulation, I should reconsider repeat fenestration versus conversion to shunting, individualized by anatomy and prior failure mode [^115E2CzK].

> Special scenarios need forethought. Hmm, wait a minute — hemorrhagic complications deserve anticipatory guidance: chronic subdural hematoma or intracystic hemorrhage is most common with middle fossa cysts, and minor trauma can precipitate acute decompensation; a low threshold for urgent imaging and surgical evacuation with cyst decompression is appropriate when mass effect is present [^1127gwK8] [^111cpzD8]. Subdural hygromas associated with arachnoid cysts often resolve without surgery, so observation with serial examinations and imaging is justified unless progressive or symptomatic, which prevents unnecessary interventions [^112THC84].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances, and I should verify revision risks. Infants and young children may present with macrocrania and hydrocephalus more often; neuroendoscopic approaches minimize blood loss and length of stay, yet very early surgery in posterior fossa cysts may carry higher revision rates, so timing and durability should be weighed carefully in the context of growth and symptom trajectories [^114yupK1] [^111bs1FD]. For suprasellar pediatric and mixed-age cohorts, endoscopic ventriculocystocisternostomy yields durable reductions in cyst volume and hydrocephalus indices, but recurrences can occur, requiring re-fenestration or shunting in a minority, which I must discuss preoperatively with families [^112Wgzd2] [^113bSWeU].

> Spinal arachnoid cysts need location-specific tactics. I should confirm that symptomatic intradural cysts with cord compression respond well to laminectomy and cyst excision or fenestration at levels of maximal compression, improving gait and weakness though neuropathic pain may persist; extradural lesions require resection with pedicle ligation and dural defect closure to eliminate the CSF communication and prevent recurrence, and preoperative differentiation from epidermoid/dermoid with diffusion MRI can guide the surgical plan [^114VjR7L] [^113S3wsu] [^115iSUhK].

> But wait, what if the "arachnoid cyst" is actually a glioependymal cyst masquerading on imaging? Radiologically they can be indistinguishable; pathology showing an EMA-negative ependymal lining with GFAP-positive glia implies a different biology, including potential fluid production via aquaporin channels, which might explain progression without a ball-valve mechanism and could influence expectations after fenestration versus shunting, so I should consider this in recurrent or atypical cases when tissue is available [^111e94Wi] [^113FUEAm]. I need to ensure my differential remains broad in supratentorial intraparenchymal cysts where glioependymal pathology is overrepresented, as management strategy and recurrence risk may differ from classic extra-axial arachnoid cysts [^111e94Wi].

> To synthesize an algorithm without oversimplifying: identify a CSF-like, nonenhancing, nonrestricting cyst and exclude mimics on DWI and, when available, pathology; if asymptomatic and stable, observe with structured follow-up; if symptomatic with clinico-radiographic concordance or complicated by hydrocephalus, mass effect, or hemorrhage, plan endoscopic or microsurgical fenestration to establish durable CSF communication based on location, reserving shunting for failures or complex anatomy; verify decompression intraoperatively, monitor for CSF leaks and subdural collections postoperatively, and pursue long-term surveillance with a low threshold for reintervention if fenestrations close or symptoms recur [^111mcCQL] [^117L7PCX] [^115E2CzK] [^111tbHgU] [^113bSWeU].

Management of arachnoid cysts is **guided by symptoms, cyst size and location** [^111zCkJv] [^111mcCQL]. Asymptomatic cysts [^112UAjCN] are managed with **observation and periodic MRI** [^114j8cRR], as most remain stable [^117L7PCX]. Symptomatic cysts (headache, seizures, hydrocephalus, focal deficits) **require intervention**: endoscopic fenestration is preferred for suprasellar, quadrigeminal, and posterior fossa cysts [^111tbHgU] [^112Wgzd2]; microsurgical fenestration for middle fossa [^111jCHTw] or complex cysts; and cystoperitoneal shunting for recurrent or inoperable cases [^115ZGDR3]. Spinal cysts causing myelopathy [^113S3wsu] are treated by **laminectomy with cyst excision or fenestration** [^114VjR7L] [^115EkWyY]. Postoperative complications include subdural hematoma [^115ZGDR3], CSF leak, and infection [^1173XLC3]; recurrence rates vary by technique, and **endoscopic fenestration has lower recurrence than shunting** [^111tbHgU] [^115E2CzK] [^114j8cRR].

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^114j8cRR]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Adult non-neoplastic intracranial cysts are a heterogeneous group of disorders that include a variety of distinct pathologies. Intracranial cysts that follow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have historically been described as arachnoid cysts. The incidence of arachnoid cysts is estimated to be 1.4%, yet over 94% of these patients are asymptomatic. Thus, most patients are diagnosed incidentally on neuroimaging. The standard of care for asymptomatic patients is observation and close follow-up with imaging. However, if neurological signs and symptoms, such as headache, seizures, hydrocephalus, or focal neurological deficits, are present, neurosurgical intervention is warranted. Microscopic fenestration to adjacent CSF spaces, endoscopic fenestration, stereotactic aspiration, and cystoperitoneal shunting are all surgical treatment options, with endoscopic fenestration being the most common. Reported patient outcomes postoperatively are generally strong, with reported symptom improvement between 72% and 90.5% across three cohort studies of intracranial arachnoid cysts.

Given favorable postoperative outcomes for patients with decompression of intracranial cysts, the etiology of these cysts is poorly studied. Cysts have long been thought to be congenital, but they can also develop later in adulthood. While in large retrospective imaging studies on intracranial cysts, most do not grow or become symptomatic, there is clear clinical evidence of growing intracranial cysts that lead to the development of mass effect and neurological symptoms.

### Spinal cord compression caused by idiopathic intradural arachnoid cysts of the spine: Review of the literature and illustrated case [^114VjR7L]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Intradural spinal arachnoid cysts with cord compression are rare. When they become symptomatic, they cause variable symptoms such as gait disturbance, paraparesis or tetraparesis, and neuropathic pain. These significantly decrease patients' quality of life. The extension of such cysts averages 3.7 vertebral bodies. Diagnosis is both clinical and radiological, utilizing MRI, CT myelography, or a combination of both.

The best treatment option is the complete removal of the cyst. However, even when paresis regresses, there is no good recovery from neuropathic pain. A laminectomy approach can cause postoperative complications, especially when the cysts expand across more than one level. Alternatively, cyst fenestration can be performed, including the levels of maximal spinal cord compression. This approach results in clinical outcomes similar to cyst resection, enabling the patient to walk again. Nevertheless, neuropathic pain may persist and require medication.

A clinical case is presented, and the literature is reviewed. In the present case, we report a patient with intradural arachnoid cysts extending from T6 to L2, causing severe gait ataxia, neuropathic pain, and hypaesthesia. The spinal cord was compressed at T8 and T12. Surgical treatment with partial cyst resection in the compressed levels, using an interlaminar approach, brought similar outcomes to complete resection. The patient was able to walk without assistance, which was not possible before surgery. The cysts' extension is impressive, as is the minimal operative procedure.

### Navigated neuroendoscopy combined with intraoperative magnetic resonance cysternography for treatment of arachnoid cysts [^115E2CzK]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are congenital lesions that develop from the splitting of the arachnoid membrane. Some cysts become symptomatic, manifesting with headaches, seizures, hydrocephalus (HCP), hemiparesis, visual loss, and hormonal and developmental disturbances. Presentation depends on the area of development and the patient's age. Treatment modalities include endoscopic or microscopic cystocysternostomy or cystoventriculostomy, depending on cyst localization or shunt implantation. A systematic review of the literature shows the superiority of cyst fenestration procedures over shunting; the latter is currently recommended only in cases of symptomatic cysts.

The choice of minimally invasive microsurgical versus endoscopic techniques for cyst fenestration seems to depend mainly on the surgeon's experience. The treatment results for patients with both methods are similar for suprasellar, quadrigeminal, and posterior cranial fossa cysts. Slightly superior results are obtained for Sylvian and cortical hemispheric cysts when treated microsurgically. Neuroendoscopy is advocated by other authors as the treatment of choice for middle fossa cysts.

The application of image-guided navigation has increased the accuracy of targeting areas for cyst fenestration when normal anatomical landmarks are not identifiable, thus increasing the safety and effectiveness of the operations. There is no consensus regarding the size and number of cysternostomies to be performed. Intraoperative endoscopic exploration remains the main tool employed in these surgeries.

### Navigated neuroendoscopy combined with intraoperative magnetic resonance cysternography for treatment of arachnoid cysts [^111tbHgU]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Low credibility.

Our study reproduces the results of others treating patients with suprasellar and quadrigeminal cysts. The lower success rate of endoscopic treatment of middle fossa cysts described in the literature, and confirmed also in our study, can be explained by the relatively unspecific clinical presentation, as well as by the anatomical restraints limiting the possibility of obtaining an effective cystocysternostomy.

The main operative approach is to perform as many fenestrations as possible and make them as large as possible. Certainly, this goal cannot be achieved in every single case. Attempts to increase the number and size of the performed stomies may increase the risk of complications, given the topography of the area of interest. Additionally, endoscopic fenestrations are generally smaller than the microsurgical ones because of the coaxial working trajectory of the endoscope along the working channel.

The introduction of low-field iMR cysternography may enable a reliable prediction of long-term outcomes and eliminate the need for unnecessary surgical manipulations.

### Prevalence and natural history of arachnoid cysts in adults [^117L7PCX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are a frequent finding on intracranial imaging. However, the prevalence and natural history of these cysts in adults are not well defined. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of a consecutive series of adults who underwent brain MRI over a 12-year interval to identify those with arachnoid cysts. The MRI studies were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis.

For those patients with arachnoid cysts, we evaluated presenting symptoms, cyst size, and cyst location. Patients with more than 6 months of clinical and imaging follow-up were included in a natural history analysis.

A total of 48,417 patients underwent brain MRI over the study period. Arachnoid cysts were identified in 661 patients (1.4%). Men had a higher prevalence than women (p < 0.0001). Multiple arachnoid cysts occurred in 30 patients.

- **Common locations**: The most common locations were the middle fossa (34%), retrocerebellar (33%), and convexity (14%). Middle fossa cysts were predominantly left-sided (70%, p < 0.001).

- **Symptomatic cases**: Thirty-five patients were considered symptomatic, and 24 underwent surgical treatment. Sellar and suprasellar cysts were more likely to be considered symptomatic (p < 0.0001). Middle fossa cysts were less likely to be considered symptomatic (p = 0.01).

The criteria for natural history analysis were met in 203 patients with a total of 213 cysts. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 ± 2.8 years (for this subgroup), 5 cysts (2.3%) increased in size, and 2 cysts (0.9%) decreased in size. Only 2 patients developed new or worsening symptoms over the follow-up period.

### Microsurgical keyhole approach for middle fossa arachnoid cyst fenestration [^111jCHTw]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The optimal surgical treatment for symptomatic temporal arachnoid cysts is controversial. Therapeutic options include cyst shunting, endoscopic fenestration, and craniotomy for fenestration. We reviewed the results for patients treated primarily with craniotomy and fenestration at our institution to establish a baseline for comparing the efficacy of other treatment modalities.

A retrospective review of data for 50 children who underwent keyhole craniotomy for fenestration of temporal arachnoid cysts between 1994 and 2001 was performed after institutional review board approval. During that period, the first-line treatment for all symptomatic middle fossa arachnoid cysts was microcraniotomy for fenestration. The goal was microsurgical dissection to create communications between the cyst cavity and basal cisterns. Patient records were thoroughly reviewed, and variables related to presentation, cyst size and classification, treatment, cyst resolution, symptom resolution, follow-up periods, and cyst outcomes were recorded.

Fifty temporal arachnoid cysts in 50 treated patients were identified. The average age at the time of surgery was 68 ± 57.2 months, with an average follow-up period of 36 months. The series included 34 male and 16 female patients. Twenty-six cysts were on the left side.

- **Indications for surgery**: Intractable headaches (45%), increasing cyst size (21%), seizures (25%), and hemiparesis (8%).
- **Symptom improvement**: The symptoms most likely to improve were hemiparesis (100%) and abducens nerve palsies, followed by headaches (67%) and seizure disorders.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^114582R5]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic due to mass effect and require surgical treatment. Mechanisms underlying cyst formation and growth remain poorly understood. This study identified 16 patients who underwent surgical treatment for benign intracranial cysts. Cyst wall pathologic samples (n = 8) were characterized as arachnoid or glioependymal cysts using H&E and immunofluorescence staining. Five samples (62.5%) were found to be glioependymal while three (37.5%) were arachnoid cysts. Cyst fluid examined in 4 cases resembled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and showed no significant differences in composition between pathological subtypes. Single-cell sequencing and RNA expression profile comparisons between glioependymal and arachnoid cysts revealed distinct cellular profiles. Analyses of the innermost cell layer (ependymal cells versus arachnoid cells) suggested differing mechanisms of pathogenesis. Glioependymal cysts harbored upregulated expression of sodium transporters and aquaporin channels, which suggests possible CSF-like fluid production, whereas arachnoid cysts may be associated with mechanical fluid accumulation. Thus, intracranial cysts represent multiple unique pathologic entities with differing cell types and RNA expression profiles. Further study into mechanisms of glioependymal cyst formation may allow for targeted interventions to reduce fluid production and avoid surgery.

A summary of patient data, procedure, as well as clinical and radiological results is given in Table 1, which has been removed for clarity.

- **Safety**: There were no adverse incidences noted during any of the 21 operations of cystostomy. We did not observe any permanent neurological impairment in our patients. There was a transient CSF leak through the wound in two patients (patients 5 and 6), with one of these leaks resulting in subclinical meningitis (asymptomatic CSF pleocytosis) that was successfully treated pharmacologically. Additionally, there was one case of transient paresis of the oculomotor nerve and one case of abducens nerve paresis, both lasting several hours (patients 16 and 12). There was also one case of transient memory deficit (patient 17).

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^113FUEAm]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In some cases, benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic through mass effect on cranial nerves or functional parenchymal tissue. Despite this documented association, the mechanism by which intracranial cysts generate mass effect is unclear. Benign cysts that follow CSF signal intensity on MR imaging have classically been categorized as arachnoid cysts; however, it has become clear that there are multiple possible etiologies for benign intracranial cysts. This study highlights glioependymal cysts, also called neuroglial cysts, which are pathologically identified by a simple cuboidal inner wall of EMA-negative ependymal cells, as well as a surrounding layer of GFAP-positive glial cells. These immunofluorescence characteristics align with previous studies that report glioependymal cysts are EMA-negative and GFAP-positive, whereas arachnoid cysts are EMA-positive and GFAP-negative.

### Neoplasms and tumor-like lesions of the sellar region: Imaging findings with correlation to pathology and 2021 who classification [^111mcCQL]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (ACs) represent the most common off-midline extra-axial cysts and are usually located within the subarachnoid spaces, including the suprasellar cistern. Also known as meningeal cysts, they are CSF-filled lesions lined by a layer of flattened arachnoid cells. ACs are sometimes in communication with the subarachnoid cisterns.

Most ACs are primary and result from meningeal development anomalies where embryonic endomeninges fail to merge and remain separated. In contrast, inflammation, tumors, trauma, or hemorrhage may lead to secondary ACs. Although ACs are generally asymptomatic, some patients may experience a wide variety of symptoms related to the location and size of the lesion. Nevertheless, the most frequent clinical presentation is headache. Subdural hematoma may represent a rare complication of ACs after minor trauma.

On CT, uncomplicated ACs show CSF density and do not enhance. Intrathecal instillation of a contrast agent (CT cisternography) may be helpful in documenting communication with the subarachnoid space. ACs also follow the CSF signal on all MRI sequences and do not present diffusion restriction or contrast enhancement. Suprasellar ACs may compress the chiasm, pituitary stalk, and/or the third ventricle floor.

Sagittal (A) and coronal (B) T2-, sagittal (C), and coronal (D) contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images demonstrate the presence of an intrasellar cystic lesion (arrows), displacing the pituitary gland to the left (dotted arrow). Histological examination shows a delicate fibrous tissue forming.

### Intrasellar arachnoid cysts [^114kK37Y]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical, endocrinological, and radiological presentation of nine cases of surgically verified intrasellar arachnoid cysts and to discuss the physiopathological mechanisms of formation of these cysts, clinical data was retrospectively reviewed from among 1540 patients presenting with pituitary lesions, nine of whom were diagnosed with an intrasellar arachnoid cyst.

- **Results**: Presenting symptoms included headache (n = 2), visual symptoms (n = 3), menstrual irregularities (n = 2), rapid weight gain (n = 1), vertigo (n = 1), and confusion (n = 1). Two cysts were discovered incidentally. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intrasellar cystic lesion in all cases, with a significant suprasellar extension in six cases. The cyst matched the intensity of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two patients.

- **Intervention**: A transsphenoidal approach allowed for the transdural aspiration of fluid and the injection of a water-soluble contrast agent under mild pressure. In three patients, the contrast infiltrated along the pituitary stalk toward the subarachnoid spaces; in the remaining patients, it remained in the intrasellar compartment. Cyst membranes were removed as completely as possible with fenestration toward the subarachnoid spaces in communicating cysts. Despite tight packing of the sella and sphenoid sinus, CSF fistulae requiring reoperation developed in two patients.

The clinical picture of an intrasellar arachnoid cyst resembles that of a nonfunctional pituitary adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging scans typically show a cystic intrasellar lesion.

### Endoscopic cystoventriculostomy for treatment of paraxial arachnoid cysts [^115ZGDR3]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal therapy of arachnoid cysts is controversial. In symptomatic extraventricular arachnoid cysts, fenestration into the basal cisterns is the gold standard. If this is not feasible, shunt placement is frequently performed although another endoscopic option is available.

Between March 1997 and June 2006, 12 endoscopic cystoventriculostomies were performed for the treatment of arachnoid cysts in 11 patients (4 male and 7 female patients, mean age 52 years [range 14–71 years]). All patients were prospectively followed up.

In 11 cases, the arachnoid cysts were frontotemporoparietal, and fenestration was performed into the lateral ventricle. In 1 case, the cyst was located in the cerebellum and fenestrated into the fourth ventricle. Neuronavigational guidance was used in all but 1 case. Endoscopic cystoventriculostomy was performed in all cases without complications; no stents were placed. The mean surgical time was 71 minutes (range 30–110 minutes). The mean follow-up periods were 42.7 months (range 19–96 months) per surgical case and 48.8 months (range 19–127 months) per patient. Symptoms improved after 11 of the 12 procedures; 7 of the 11 patients became symptom-free, while the others had only mild residual symptoms. The patient who did not experience clinical improvement suffered from depression yet showed a significant decrease in cyst size on postoperative MR imaging. After 11 of 12 procedures, a decrease in cyst size was observed. In one case, a subdural hematoma developed, requiring surgical treatment.

### A form of dysplasia or a fortuitous association? A cerebral aneurysm inside an arachnoid cyst: case report [^113bLpp3]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Although arachnoid cysts and intracranial aneurysms are very common lesions, their association in the same patient is rare. We present a case of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm ruptured into an arachnoid cyst. We found only six cases with intracystic hemorrhage reported in the literature. The presence of an arachnoid cyst can mislead clinical presentation. The patient presented with a paradoxically small temporal fossa and thickening of the temporal and sphenoid bone. The authors suggest that this uncommon association (arachnoid cyst, atypical cranial vault, and "mirror-like" cerebral aneurysm) could represent a form of dysplasia.

A 46-year-old patient presented with a 3-week history of slight headaches, which had worsened in the last 3 days before presentation. Computed tomographic scans showed a cystic lesion located in the middle cranial fossa and sylvian fissure with suspected aneurysm dilation inside. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intracystic hemorrhage but not subarachnoid hemorrhage. Paradoxically, changes in the cranial vault around the cyst were noted. Digital subtraction angiography showed bilateral "mirror" middle cerebral artery aneurysms.

A large right pterional craniotomy was performed with full microsurgical removal of the arachnoid cyst walls and aneurysm clipping. The aneurysm was in the medial wall of the arachnoid cyst with its dome inside the cyst. The contralateral aneurysm was clipped 2 weeks later. The follow-up period was uneventful, and the patient returned to normal life.

### Endoscopic management of arachnoid cysts: An advancing technique [^114yupK1]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Neuroendoscopy is increasingly used in neurosurgery. The authors report their evolving experience in the management of arachnoid cysts using endoscopic techniques and, more recently, the use of these techniques in combination with neuronavigation systems. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of this approach and the factors influencing the final outcome of treatment.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed 39 cases in which patients were treated endoscopically for intracranial arachnoid cysts over a period of 8 years. The indications and techniques used were reviewed, and the surgical outcomes assessed. There was no death or significant morbidity associated with the procedure. Thirty-six patients had resolution or improvement of symptoms and only three required insertion of a shunt.

- **Conclusions**: The treatment of arachnoid cysts has been revolutionized by the introduction of endoscopic techniques. The authors conclude, on the basis of their experience, that in most cases the combination of neuroendoscopy and frameless navigation represents a safe and reliable modality for treating this benign intracranial entity with minimal surgical trauma. The specific approach should be based on the individual characteristics of each cyst and the surgeon's experience.

### Arachnoid cyst of the craniocervical junction: Case report [^116sGVCm]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

An arachnoid cyst at the craniocervical junction presenting with obstructive hydrocephalus due to blockage of the outflow of the fourth ventricle is described. This is a very rare anatomic site, with only five other cases reported in the literature.

- **Clinical presentation**: A 37-year-old woman presented with a 9-month history of severe neck pain, persistent vomiting, visual disturbances, and numbness in the nose, cheek, and lips. She had severe bilateral papilledema on ophthalmoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a midline cystic lesion extending down to C2.

- **Intervention**: The patient underwent posterior fossa craniectomy and excision of the arachnoid cyst. She made a full recovery and was asymptomatic at follow-up examination.

The symptomatology of these rare craniocervical arachnoid cysts and their development are discussed.

### Symptomatic spinal arachnoid cysts: report of two cases with review of the literature [^115cks8c]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Two unusual cases of intradural extramedullary noncommunicating arachnoid cysts are presented, accompanied by a review of the literature. The objective of the study is to assess the results of surgical excision in reversing symptoms and neurologic deficits.

Most patients with arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic. Noncommunicating intradural extramedullary arachnoid cysts are more rare than communicating ones and represent a very rare cause of spinal cord compression. Occasionally, these cysts can present with unusual symptoms, such as angina.

- **Materials and methods**: The first case involved a 75-year-old woman with progressive paraparesis. The second case involved a 40-year-old man with signs and symptoms resembling angina, along with mild spasticity in the lower limbs. In both cases, magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord compression as the etiology. Notably, the first patient is the second oldest reported case of idiopathic spinal arachnoid cyst, while the second case presented an unusual symptomatology not previously reported in the literature.

- **Results**: Both patients underwent surgical excision of the arachnoid cyst, which resulted in the resolution of symptoms and reversal of neurologic deficits.

- **Conclusions**: Our experience suggests that complete recovery from an arachnoid cyst is possible after surgical excision, even when symptoms are long-standing and occur in elderly patients.

### Differentiation between pediatric spinal arachnoid and epidermoid-dermoid cysts: Is diffusion-weighted MRI useful [^115iSUhK]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Appropriate differentiation between epidermoid-dermoid and arachnoid cysts is important for patient management. MRI has had limitations in differentiating these two types of cysts, especially in the region of the spinal cord.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI for differentiation between spinal arachnoid and epidermoid-dermoid cysts.

- **Materials and methods**: Four children underwent conventional and DW MRI. Turbo spin-echo imaging was used to obtain DW images.

- **Results**: On conventional MRI, low T1-weighted (T1-W) and high T2-weighted (T2-W) signals were present in all lesions. DW imaging showed restricted diffusion in two patients with epidermoid-dermoid cysts and no water restriction in two patients with arachnoid cysts. Three of four children had extramedullary lesions, and one patient had an intramedullary lesion. Three children had surgery, two with epidermoid-dermoid cysts and one with an arachnoid cyst. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. One child with a thoracic arachnoid cyst had stable clinical imaging findings during a follow-up of 21 months.

- **Conclusion**: On conventional MRI, epidermoid-dermoid and arachnoid cysts have similar signal characteristics. Initial experience with spine DW imaging shows promise in differentiating epidermoid-dermoid cysts from arachnoid cysts. Preoperative differentiation is important because it changes management and surgical approach.

### Haemorrhage into an arachnoid cyst: A serious complication of minor head trauma [^111cpzD8]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are infra-arachnoidal cerebrospinal fluid collections that are usually asymptomatic. However, they can become acutely symptomatic because of haemorrhage and cyst enlargement, which may result from minor head trauma. The range of symptoms is wide, and many are considered "soft" signs. Diagnosis is crucial, as cysts causing a mass effect require surgery.

A case is reported of a child presenting with localized headaches after minor head trauma. Computed tomography demonstrated an arachnoid cyst with evidence of haemorrhage, necessitating surgical intervention. Other cases of arachnoid cysts presenting to our hospital or reported in the literature are reviewed concerning presenting symptoms and signs. Localized headaches, behavioral or cognitive changes, and ataxia are more commonly associated with this disorder than nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, or seizures. This range of symptomatology following minor head trauma may warrant computed tomography when other criteria for this investigation are not met.

### Diagnosis and management of glutaric aciduria type I — revised recommendations [^112rTAbA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Subdural haemorrhage and arachnoid cysts

Diagnosis

Subdural haemorrhage may occur at any age in GA-I, but peaks during the age of maximal extent of macrocephaly, i.e. late infancy [Brismar and Ozand; Köhler and Hoffmann; Woelfle et al.]. Minor head traumas with disruption of elongated bridging veins have been suggested as underlying mechanisms. The exact frequency of subdural bleeding is unknown, since affected patients may remain asymptomatic. Subdural haemorrhage in GA-I may be mistaken for shaken baby syndrome and vice versa [Hartley et al; Morris et al.]. Bitemporal arachnoid cysts have been described in some affected patients and should result in a high suspicion for GA-I [Hald et al; Jamjoom et al; Lücherath et al; Martinez-Lage et al.], whereas unilateral arachnoid cysts are a rare occurrence in this disease.

- **Statement #14**: Children with subdural haemorrhage and/or bitemporal arachnoid cysts should be investigated for glutaric aciduria type I, particularly if occurring in combination with macrocephaly and/or a movement disorder (grade D).

- **Statement #15**: Glutaric aciduria type I should be excluded in children with suspected shaken baby syndrome using the recommendations for selective screening (see also statement #5, Fig. 1) (grade D).

Neurosurgery

Neurosurgical interventions have been performed in a small number of affected patients with arachnoid cysts and subdural haemorrhage [Hald et al; Lütcherath et al; Martinez-Lage et al; Woelfle et al.]. The majority of these patients had a poor neurological outcome, sometimes with significant worsening of the neurological condition.

### Suprasellar arachnoid cysts in adults: Clinical presentations, radiological features, and treatment outcomes [^113bSWeU]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

There is a known tendency for suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs) to occur in young children, while data on adult SACs has been rare in previous reports. This study aims to discuss their clinical presentations, radiological features, and treatment outcomes based on 23 adult patients who underwent endoscopic fenestration in our hospital between January 2003 and December 2018. Preoperative cyst volume ranged from 12.3 to 72.5 cm³, with a mean of 39.8 ± 19.8 cm³. Endocrine disorders occurred in 7 (30.4%) patients, and hydrocephalus was observed in 20 patients.

In the patients with hydrocephalus, the mean preoperative Evans' index (EI) and fronto-occipital horn ratio (FOHR) were 44.8% (range: 32.2%-63.4%) and 49.6% (range: 36.7%-59.8%), respectively. A bivariate correlation showed a significant positive association between preoperative cyst volume and preoperative EI or FOHR (Pearson correlation: r = 0.607, p = 0.005; r = 0.583, p = 0.007). The slit-valve phenomenon was observed in 13 (56.5%) patients, and pale/tenacious cyst walls were observed in 12 (52.2%) patients. Postoperatively, all patients achieved improvement in clinical symptoms and a decrease in cyst size. The mean decreases in cyst volume, EI, and FOHR were 64.7%, 7.89%, and 5.8%, respectively. A bivariate correlation indicated irrelevance between the postoperative cyst volume and postoperative EI or FOHR (Pearson correlation: r = 0.37, p = 0.11; r = 0.43, p = 0.054).

These results reveal a few differences in several aspects between adult patients and child patients. The severity of hydrocephalus is correlated with cyst size in adult patients.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^111e94Wi]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Glioependymal cysts, also known as neuroglial cysts, are a rare, unique entity with an imaging appearance indistinguishable from that of arachnoid cysts. The difference between these two lies in the presence of an ependymal and glial inner lining of cells within the wall of glioependymal cysts. In a 2018 systematic review, Robles et al. identified 26 pathologically confirmed glioependymal cysts in adults, each of which caused mass effect. Radiological findings were indistinguishable from those of arachnoid cysts, but glioependymal cysts were often found in supratentorial intraparenchymal regions. Furthermore, each of these cysts had an internal ependymal layer on pathological examination, which may suggest a mechanism of growth different from the hypothesized "ball-valve" mechanism of arachnoid cysts.

In this study, we investigated whether intracranial cysts that required surgery have a shared underlying pathological diagnosis. Furthermore, we used molecular techniques to investigate potential mechanisms for cyst growth and mass effect.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: a single center experiences [^116jY4Dj]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are extra parenchymal, intra-arachnoid fluid collections of unknown origin, similar in content to cerebrospinal fluid. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts are a rarer localization resulting from abnormalities of the Liliequist membrane or cystic dilatation of the interpeduncular cisterna. We aimed to contribute to the literature by presenting a series of suprasellar arachnoid cyst cases with endoscopic intervention and long-term results.

- **Methods**: This study analyzed radiographic data, clinical symptoms, surgical records, and videos of giant arachnoid cysts that underwent endoscopic surgery between 2013 and 2023. Cyst volumes and Evan's indexes were calculated both preoperatively and postoperatively.

- **Results**: The patient population consisted of 3 males (21.4%, 3/14 patients) and 11 females (78.5%, 11/14 patients). Their age at the time of surgery ranged from 1 year to 56 years (mean: 14.4 years). Of the total 14 patients, 4 (28.5%, 4/14 patients) were adults (age ≥ 18 years), and 10 (71.4%, 10/14 patients) were pediatric (age < 18 years). The most common presenting complaints were gait disturbance (21.4%, 3/14 patients), headache (21.4%, 3/14 patients), increased head circumference (14.2%, 2/14 patients), hormonal disorders (14.2%, 2/14 patients), seizures (14.2%, 2/14 patients), and forgetfulness (7.1%, 1/14 patients). Ventriculocystocisternostomy was performed in all patients. The most common perioperative complication was bleeding controlled by irrigation (28.5%, 4/14 patients). The mean follow-up period was 63.8 months (min: 12 months - max: 125 months).

### A case of sellar arachnoid cyst operated using the endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach [^115fvf9g]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

In recent years, sellar arachnoid cysts (ACs) have been increasingly treated using an endoscopic transnasal approach. It is important to connect the subarachnoid space with the AC to prevent recurrence; however, a high frequency of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has been reported with the endoscopic transnasal approach, and the suitability of the endoscopic transnasal approach for treating sellar ACs is questionable to begin with.

- **Clinical presentation**: A man in his 40s underwent surgery for a sellar AC compressing the optic chiasm. The normal pituitary gland was compressed dorsally by the cyst, and an endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach was adopted to reduce the risk of postoperative CSF leakage. A small incision was made in the right eyebrow, and a small craniotomy was performed. A rigid scope was used to approach the cyst and incise the arachnoid membrane of the prechiasmatic cistern and the anterior wall of the cyst. Postoperatively, the cyst shrank, and the preoperative visual field defects improved. The duration of the endoscopic manipulation was approximately 40 minutes.

The endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach eliminates the need to incise the dura mater of the anterior skull base and reduces the risk of CSF leakage compared with the transnasal approach. In addition, cumbersome dural reconstruction using fat and fascia is not required during the supraorbital keyhole approach, which reduces operation time.

The endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach may be more suitable than the transnasal approach for treating sellar ACs.

### Location, sidedness, and sex distribution of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a population-based sample [^117EGhQT]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a large and unselected patient population, with special emphasis on sidedness and sex distribution.

In total, 299 patients with 305 arachnoid cysts were studied. These patients were consecutively referred to our department during a 20-year period from a well-defined geographical area with a stable population.

- **Results**: There was a strong predilection (198 patients [66.2%]) for intracranial arachnoid cysts in the temporal fossa. Forty-two patients had cysts overlying the frontal convexity, 36 had cysts in the posterior fossa, and 23 patients had cysts in other, different locations. Of 269 cysts with clearly unilateral distribution, 163 were located on the left side and 106 on the right side. This difference resulted from the marked preponderance of temporal fossa cysts on the left side (left-to-right ratio 2.5:1; p < 0.0001 [adjusted < 0.0005]). For cysts in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), there was preponderance on the right side (p = 0.001 [adjusted = 0.005]). Significantly more males than females had cysts in the temporal fossa (p = 0.002 [adjusted = 0.004]), whereas in the CPA, a significant female preponderance was found (p = 0.016 [adjusted = 0.032]). For all other cyst locations, there was no difference between the two sexes.

- **Conclusions**: Arachnoid cysts have a strong predilection for the temporal fossa. There is a sex dependency for some intracranial locations of arachnoid cysts, with temporal cysts occurring more frequently in men, and CPA cysts found more frequently in women.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: a single center experiences [^112Wgzd2]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The study protocol was approved by the University Local Ethics Committee (Clinical trial number: 03.10.2023, 2023 − 1215). We have obtained consent from all patients to publish this article. From 2013 to 2023, this research involved a thorough review of clinical and surgical records and videos. We measured the volumes of the cysts before and after surgery using the 3D Slicer program, a sophisticated image analysis software. Additionally, we calculated the Evans Index both preoperatively and postoperatively, which involves dividing the maximal width of the frontal horn by the maximal transverse internal diameter, as outlined in previous studies.

- **Table 1: Pre-post operative cyst measurement data** of 14 suprasellar arachnoid cyst patients operated neuroendoscopically in our clinic (Superoinferior-anteroposterior-mediolateral).

- **Figure 1: Example of measurement 3D Slicer**. A. Postoperative SAC measurement with 3D Slicer. B. Preoperative SAC measurement with 3D Slicer.

- **Table 2: Characteristics of 14 suprasellar arachnoid cyst patients** operated neuroendoscopically in our clinic.

Statistical analyses for the study were conducted using SPSS software (version 26.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the basic features of the data and are expressed as means and percentages. Given that the data demonstrated a nonparametric distribution, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed for analysis. A p-value of 0.05 was established as the threshold for statistical significance.

### Symptomatic increased intracranial pressure due to arachnoid cysts [^115eyKft]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are typically benign lesions, but rarely, they may cause signs and symptoms relating to increased intracranial pressure. We report four pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts who received successful surgical treatment after failing to respond to conservative medical therapies. After undergoing a shunting procedure, each patient experienced improvement in symptoms, resolution of optic disc swelling, and reduction or elimination of medications necessary to manage the condition. These cases illustrate the potential for arachnoid cysts to outstrip compensatory mechanisms and cause signs and symptoms requiring definitive surgical intervention.

### Arachnoid web of the spine: A systematic literature review [^115f35bt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Low credibility.

An arachnoid web of the spine (AWS) is a rare and often challenging lesion to diagnose, given its subtle radiographic findings. When left untreated, this lesion can have devastating effects on a patient's neurological function. At the time of writing, only limited case reports and series have been published on this topic. In this study, the authors sought to better describe this lesion, performing a systematic literature review and including two cases from their institution's experience.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was performed in September 2018, querying Ovid MEDLINE (1946–2018), PubMed (1946–2018), Wiley Cochrane Library: Central Register of Controlled Trials (1898–2018), and Thompson Reuters Web of Science: Citation Index (1900–2018), in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria specified all studies and case reports of patients with an AWS in which any relevant surgery types were considered and applied. Studies on arachnoid cysts and nonhuman populations, and those that did not report patient treatments or outcomes, were excluded from the focus review.

- **Results**: A total of 19 records and two patients treated by the senior authors were included in the systematic review, providing a total of 43 patients with AWS. The mean age was 52 years (range 28–77 years), and the majority of patients were male (72%, 31/43). A syrinx was present in 67% (29/43) of the cases. All AWSs were located in the thoracic spine, and all but two (95%) were located dorsally (one ventrally and one circumferentially). Weakness was the most frequently reported symptom (67%, 29/43).

### How often do chronic extra-cerebral haematomas occur in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts [^1127gwK8]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural (CSDH) or intracystic haematomas may occur as a complication in patients with arachnoid cysts, even in children and young adults. The aim of this study was to investigate how often an arachnoid cyst is complicated by such haematomas, as this information may be of importance when considering decompressive cyst surgery.

- **Materials and methods**: This study includes a total of 241 consecutive adult and paediatric patients (157 males and 84 females) referred to our department for treatment of an arachnoid cyst during the period January 1987 to September 2004. Our department is the only neurosurgical department in a well-defined geographical region with a population of 930,000.

- **Results**: A chronic haematoma was found in a total of 11 patients (4.6%), all harboring a temporal cyst. For the temporal cysts, the haematoma frequency was 6.5%. Haematomas occurred equally frequently in individuals with small, middle-sized, and large temporal cysts, across the age groups studied, and in both genders.

- **Conclusion**: As also reflected in a literature review, intracranial chronic haematomas occur most frequently as a complication of middle fossa cysts. Possible mechanisms behind the formation of haematomas and the strong associations with temporal fossa cysts are discussed, with emphasis on the loose attachment of the membrane of the arachnoid cyst to the dura in the middle fossa and its possible role as an "extra wall" covering easy-bleeding vascular structures in the dura.

### Pediatric orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas associated with bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa. Case report and review of the literature [^112K5yno]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Cavernous hemangiomas of the orbit are benign vascular growths that commonly occur in adults and account for 6% of all intraorbital tumors. Multifocal intraorbital cavernous hemangiomas are quite rare. The reported incidence of arachnoid cysts accounts for only 1% of lesions that occupy intracranial space, and they are nearly always sporadic and single. The authors have not encountered any study reporting the coexistence of bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa and orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas.

In this report, they describe a 10-year-old boy with such a hemangioma that included the eyelid, conjunctiva, and retrobulbar space. His was the first case of a surgically treated pediatric orbital multifocal cavernous hemangioma associated with bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa. An association between arachnoid cysts, intracranial cavernous malformations, bilateral arachnoid cysts, and metabolic disorders has been reported. The authors report on the coexistence of orbital multifocal cavernous hemangiomas and bilateral arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa.

Based on these observations, they believe that all patients with bilateral temporal arachnoid cysts should be screened for genetic disorders. In addition, the possibility of orbital cavernous malformations should be kept in mind for the follow-up period, and patients should be evaluated for possible symptoms of this condition.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^111wJDSt]. Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology (2025). High credibility.

Methods

- **Patient population**: This study received approval from the institutional review board (#24–000620) at the University of California, Los Angeles. Electronic medical records were assessed from 2014 to 2024 to identify patients with intracranial cysts, resulting in a cohort of 153 patients. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pediatric patients under 18 years of age; (2) cysts with non-benign pathology, such as neoplastic or infectious cysts; and (3) specific congenital cyst pathologies like Rathke's cleft cyst and colloid cyst. Furthermore, patients were excluded if no pathological tissue was obtained from surgery. Using these criteria, 16 patients were ultimately included in the study. Electronic medical records were reviewed for clinical variables.

- **Pathological review**: A pathological review of surgically resected intracranial cysts indicated the presence of either arachnoid or glioependymal identities. Of the initial 153 patients, 137 were excluded based on various criteria, including age and cyst type. Among the 16 remaining patients, 8 had suitable cyst wall tissue available for pathological review. These samples underwent staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or immunofluorescence staining for anti-epithelial membrane antigen (anti-EMA) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP) to determine the identity of the cysts as either arachnoid or glioependymal. Glioependymal cysts were confirmed by the presence of an EMA-negative simple cuboidal ependymal inner wall.

### Suprasellar versus third ventricular cysts: Anatomic and surgical considerations [^114Pj9Gr]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are benign cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that occur in 2.6% of children and 1.4% of adults. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs) represent between 9% and 21% of pediatric arachnoid cysts. These are often confused with the less common third ventricular cysts (3VCs). Both can grow and cause obstructive hydrocephalus, requiring urgent treatment. The aim of surgical treatment was to re-establish cerebrospinal fluid circulation. In this article, we describe and contrast the imaging characteristics of SAC and 3VC and show stepwise endoscopic surgical approaches for each.

- **Clinical presentation**: We show examples of patients with SAC and 3VC who presented with symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus and who underwent endoscopic intraventricular resection of the cysts, leading to long-term resolution of the hydrocephalus and symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the anatomic differences and video demonstrations of the surgical approaches reveal important features that distinguish between the two cysts.

- **Conclusion**: Safe endoscopic treatment of SAC and 3VC requires a thorough understanding of how each distorts the anatomy of the third ventricle and suprasellar cistern and a stepwise surgical approach based on this anatomy.

### Prevalence and symptoms of intracranial arachnoid cysts: A population-based study [^112UAjCN]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a large population-based sample and assess their association with cognitive impairment, depression, epilepsy, headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, hip fractures, and mortality. This was a population-based cohort and nested case-control study comprising representative populations (n = 1235) aged 70 years and older. All participants underwent baseline neuropsychiatric examinations, including computed tomography (CT) of the brain, between 1986 and 2000. CT scans were examined for arachnoid cysts.

- **Data collection**: Headache, dizziness, history of head trauma, dementia, depression, epilepsy, and hip fracture were assessed using data from clinical examinations, interviews, and the Swedish hospital discharge register. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination, and depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Date of death was obtained from the National Swedish Death Registry.

The prevalence of arachnoid cysts was 2.3% (n = 29), with no significant difference between men and women. Probands with and without cysts showed the same frequency of headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were no differences regarding the prevalence of dementia, depression, epilepsy, or previous hip fracture. Arachnoid cysts were not associated with increased mortality. Arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding, with the same rate in men and women, and are likely asymptomatic.

### Does subjective improvement in adults with intracranial arachnoid cysts justify surgical treatment [^113aovnB]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the subjective improvement reported by patients undergoing surgery for intracranial arachnoid cysts justifies surgical intervention. The study aimed to evaluate outcomes using standardized interviews and assessments of neuropsychological function and balance, examining the relationship between cyst location, postoperative improvement, and cyst volume.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a prospective, population-based study. A total of 109 patients underwent neurological, neuropsychological, and physiotherapeutic examinations. Arachnoid cysts were deemed symptomatic in 75 patients, with 53 consenting to surgery. In 32 patients, differential diagnosis indicated symptoms were due to other conditions, unrelated to an arachnoid cyst. Neuropsychological testing included target reaction time, Grooved Pegboard, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning, Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure, and Stroop tests. Balance was assessed using the extended Falls Efficacy Scale, Romberg, and sharpened Romberg tests with open and closed eyes. Tests were repeated 5 months after surgery. Cyst volume was measured pre- and postoperatively using OsiriX software.

- **Results**: Patients who underwent surgery showed no significant differences in balance and neuropsychological tests compared to those who declined surgery or had unrelated symptoms. Patients with temporal arachnoid cysts performed within normal ranges on neuropsychological assessments. Seventy-seven percent of patients…

### Management of subdural hygromas associated with arachnoid cysts [^112THC84]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts may occasionally be associated with subdural hygromas. The management of these conditions is controversial.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed their experience with arachnoid cysts and identified 8 patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts and an associated subdural hygroma. The medical records and images for these patients were also examined.

- **Results**: In total, 8 patients presented with subdural hygroma and arachnoid cysts. Of these 8 patients, 6 presented with headaches and 4 had nausea and vomiting. Six patients had a history of trauma. One patient was treated surgically at the time of initial presentation, and 7 patients were managed without surgery. All patients experienced complete resolution of their presenting signs and symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Subdural hygroma may lead to symptomatic presentation for otherwise asymptomatic arachnoid cysts. The natural course of cyst-associated subdural hygromas, even when symptomatic, is generally benign, and symptom resolution can be expected in most cases. The authors suggest that symptomatic hygroma is not an absolute indication for surgical treatment and that expectant management can result in good outcomes in many cases.

### A case of sellar arachnoid cyst operated using the endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach [^116zJCoV]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The usefulness of the supraorbital keyhole approach for sellar arachnoid cysts (ACs) was reported. Sellar ACs can be safely operated on using the endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach, and the frequency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is expected to reduce compared with conventional endoscopic transnasal surgery.

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^112Fyuo6]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

Although many questions remain regarding the pathogenesis, natural history, and management of arachnoid cysts (AC) of the internal auditory canal (IAC), the data from this study contribute to our understanding and highlight promising future directions for research on this entity, as well as other uncommon lesions of the IAC. Future studies are needed to replicate findings of this study in other patient populations and potentially with surgical correlates, when clinically indicated. The development of software for MRI allowing automated segmentation and extraction of features of lesions of the IACs will facilitate analysis and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, the development and expansion of national registries in otolaryngology, neurosurgery, or neurology may allow for future studies involving larger samples. A long-term goal is the prospective identification and tracking of patients to better define the natural history of AC of the IAC and outcomes of patients undergoing different treatments, such as fenestration or surgical removal, and the role for multidisciplinary approaches.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: A single center experiences [^115kniVY]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Suprasellar arachnoid cysts constitute approximately 5–12% of intracranial arachnoid cysts, and it has been reported that 8–15% of growing and symptomatic arachnoid cysts are suprasellar arachnoid cysts. Furthermore, the frequency and incidence of suprasellar cysts is 1.4% in adults and 2.6% in children. Pierre-Kahn et al. reported that 20 pediatric patients had a male predominance in presentations with suprasellar arachnoid cysts. In our series, female dominance was observed (males: 21.4%, 3/14 patients; females: 78.5%, 11/14 patients).

Özek et al. reported that the most common clinical symptoms of intracranial hypertension were observed in children, followed by visual impairment and endocrine disorders. Erşahin et al. identified macrocrania and psychomotor retardation as the most common infant signs and findings. Ma et al. included 247 cases of arachnoid cysts treated with endoscopy in their study, with approximately 75.3% of the case series diagnosed in infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool. Adult patients represent 8.9% of all patients. Due to the incomplete closure of cranial sutures, psychomotor retardation and macrocrania were the most common clinical manifestations in infants and young children. The incidence of endocrine disorders increased markedly in preschool and school-age children. In adult patients, the most common clinical signs were intracranial hypertension and visual deterioration (72.7%), followed by endocrine disorders (27.3%). In our series, the pediatric age group was diagnosed at a higher rate (adults: 28.5%; pediatric: 71.4%).

### Hemorrhagic infarction following open fenestration of a large intracranial arachnoid cyst in a pediatric patient [^112wYztR]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are a rare condition, thought to be congenital in nature. Treatment of intracranial arachnoid cysts remains controversial due to their variable presentation. Treatment options include CSF shunting, endoscopic fenestration, or craniotomy and open fenestration for larger cysts. The complications of these procedures can include hydrocephalus, subdural hematomas, hygromas, and — more rarely — intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The authors found very few reports of hemorrhagic infarction as a complication of arachnoid cyst fenestration in the literature. They report a case of an 18-year-old female patient who suffered an ipsilateral hemorrhagic infarction after craniotomy for open fenestration of an arachnoid cyst.

### Excision of an anterior intradural arachnoid cyst of the cervical spine through central corpectomy approach [^116VvFC3]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Anterior cervical intradural arachnoid cyst is a rare entity, which has mostly been approached posteriorly. This commonly results in incomplete resection, which is associated with recurrence. We describe the anterior central corpectomy approach with complete neurologic recovery in a twenty-year-old with an anterior cervical intradural arachnoid cyst located in front of the third and fourth cervical vertebra. The patient presented with spastic quadriparesis.

### Endoscopic treatment of a fourth ventricle arachnoid cyst via the third ventricle: a case report [^1139TZHa]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts within the fourth ventricle have rarely been reported in the literature. Different procedures have been performed to restore normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or pressure, including shunting and partial or complete excision of the cyst by open microsurgery. Cerebrospinal fluid shunts give only partial improvement of symptoms and are prone to malfunctions. Microsurgical excision of the cyst seems to offer the best chance of success.

We report the case of a fourth ventricle arachnoid cyst successfully treated with a complete endoscopic cerebral procedure via the third ventricle.

Endoscopic fenestration of fourth ventricle arachnoid cysts may be considered an effective neurosurgical treatment.

### Simultaneous bone remodeling and surgical decompression of large Sylvian arachnoid cyst [^115cYric]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

The most common location for intracranial arachnoid cysts is the region of the Sylvian fissure, where they can be found in 49% of cases. Management of these cysts remains controversial. We present our surgical technique for treating large Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts, which involves cyst decompression and simultaneous calvarial remodeling.

After decreasing the cyst size, the frontal, temporal, and parietal bones are remodeled. The cyst itself is treated with a cystoperitoneal shunt. In the immediate postoperative period, correction of the deformity is observed. The cyst volume is reduced immediately after surgery, and adequate adaptation of the bone is achieved.

Our surgical procedure for simultaneous bone remodeling and cyst decompression is a fast, simple, and effective treatment option for patients with large Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts associated with significant cranial disfigurement. We consider cranial remodeling important in cases of large arachnoid cysts not only for cosmetic results but also for reducing remaining intracranial space filled with cerebrospinal fluid. This may serve as an important factor in reducing the risk of intracystic and subdural hemorrhage. It is a widely applicable procedure that does not require special tools or expensive equipment, yet it can help avoid multiple surgeries and the complications associated with them.

### Intracystic pressure in patients with temporal arachnoid cysts: A prospective study of preoperative complaints and postoperative outcome [^112Xtqzu]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (AC) can cause a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. Only a limited number of studies have investigated intracranial pressure in patients with AC. We sought to investigate the relationship between intracystic pressure, preoperative complaints, and postoperative symptom relief in adult patients operated on for a unilateral temporal AC.

- **Material and methods**: This was a prospective, population-based study involving 38 adult (> 18 years) patients (mean age 43 years; range 18–69) with a previously untreated unilateral temporal AC.

- **Results**: For all cyst types, mean pressure was 131 mm H2O. The main preoperative complaints were headache and dizziness/nausea. By median split, patients were divided into a low-pressure (130 mm H2O) group. Patients with high intracystic pressure had a significantly higher preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score (54.7) than those with low intracystic pressure (39.4). Both pressure groups had a significant fall in VAS score after surgical decompression of the cyst. Intracystic pressure correlated significantly with arterial pCO2 and mean arterial pressure.

- **Conclusion**: There was a significant correlation between intracystic pressure and the preoperative level of complaints. Mean intracystic pressure in adult patients with unilateral temporal AC seems to lie within the limits of normal intracranial pressure. We therefore hypothesize that factors other than absolute pressure, such as altered compliance and impedance of the brain, may be involved in the pathophysiology.

### Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts: Clinical, radiological, and surgical features [^113S3wsu]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Extradural arachnoid cysts in the spine are rare and seldom cause spinal cord compression. They are thought to arise from congenital defects in the dura mater, and they almost always communicate with the intrathecal subarachnoid space through a small defect in the dura. The mainstay of treatment in patients with neurological symptoms is surgical removal of the cyst, along with ligation of the communicating pedicle and closure of the dural defect. This paper reviews the literature and discusses the clinical and pathological features, mechanisms of pathogenesis, neuroimaging characteristics, and surgical management of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts. The surgical technique for removing these lesions is illustrated in a patient with a large thoracolumbar spinal extradural arachnoid cyst causing neurogenic claudication.

### Management of Tarlov cysts: An uncommon but potentially serious spinal column disease-review of the literature and experience with over 1000 referrals [^116UpEx5]. Neuroradiology (2024). Low credibility.

Murphy et al. categorized treatment success into the following categories: excellent outcome, good/satisfactory outcome, and treatment failures. An excellent outcome included complete pain relief, discontinuation of all pain medications, improvement or stabilization of cyst-related neurological signs and symptoms, no requirement for further treatment, satisfaction with results, and willingness to undergo another procedure if required. A good/satisfactory outcome included pain improvement on the Lumbar Spine Outcomes Questionnaire scale, discontinuation of narcotic analgesics, neurologic deficits commensurate with adequate function or no further progression, satisfaction with treatment results, and not seeking further treatment. Treatment failures included all outcomes other than excellent or good/satisfactory, even if some improvement was noted.

Treatment failure rates ranged from 14 to 25%[. Minor procedure-related transient side effects such as nausea, vomiting, low-grade fevers, cutaneous allergic reactions, and headaches were noted for patients undergoing these procedures. However, in an early report by Patel et al, three unusual cases of low-grade fevers and meningism believed to be aseptic meningitis occurred and were managed conservatively. The condition was also later referred to as chemical meningitis for a similar event in a surgical study for symptomatic Tarlov cysts. Although the authors had not performed myelography to assess communication of the cyst with the subarachnoid space, it is thought that the treated cysts were likely wide-necked cysts. At that time, a wide-necked cyst was an unknown contraindication to percutaneous fibrin sealant injections as there is an increased possibility of complications with such cases.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^114x7KiF]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Given the potential heterogeneity in benign cyst pathologic diagnoses, we reviewed our institution's historical surgical pathological diagnoses with modern diagnostic criteria. Only 8 of 16 patients receiving surgical intervention for a benign intracranial cyst had tissue collected for pathological review (Figure 1A, Table 2). Historically, pathological diagnosis was commonly described as "cyst wall" or "benign cyst". Therefore, our goal was to evaluate whether any of these cysts were, in fact, glioependymal in nature. A blinded board-certified neuropathologist (F.R.) reviewed all available pathological slides from a total of 8 patients (Figure 1A).

Glioependymal cysts were confirmed by the presence of an EMA-negative simple cuboidal ependymal inner wall and a surrounding layer of GFAP-positive glial cells (Figure 1B). Upon review, 5 cysts were determined to be glioependymal cysts (62.5%) and 3 were described as arachnoid cysts (37.5%). Of these pathologically classified cysts, there were no significant demographic differences (Table 2), but all supratentorial intraparenchymal cysts (4/4) were glioependymal, while arachnoid cysts were found in the suprasellar space and pineal region.

Of the 2 CPA cysts available for pathologic analysis, 1 was described as glioependymal, and the other was classified as arachnoid. Cyst fluid was aspirated prior to cyst resection and collected in 4 patients (Table 3). Each sample had a cell and ion profile similar to CSF. There were no significant differences in fluid obtained between cysts diagnosed as glioependymal or arachnoid.

### Flexible neuroendoscopy for endoscopic third ventriculostomy and fourth ventricular arachnoid cyst fenestration in an infant [^113tWqkc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Arachnoid cysts of the fourth ventricle are rarely reported. Management options include CSF diversion, cyst fenestration, or cyst excision. Fenestration can be done via an open microsurgical technique or endoscopically, with or without simultaneous third ventriculostomy; both rigid and flexible endoscopy have been used successfully. However, the application of this treatment modality in pediatric patients is not well described.

To their knowledge, the authors report the first successful treatment of a fourth ventricular arachnoid cyst with a single frontal burr hole entry point for third ventriculostomy and fourth ventricular arachnoid cyst fenestration performed using flexible neuroendoscopy. The patient was a 13-month-old boy presenting with progressive macrocephaly.

- **Technique review and special considerations**: The authors review their technique and discuss special considerations when using this approach. They include an annotated intraoperative video for demonstration to help instruct and guide management.

- **Conclusion**: The authors demonstrate with an example that a single frontal burr hole entry point for flexible endoscopic third ventriculostomy and navigation through a dilated cerebral aqueduct for fourth ventricular arachnoid cyst fenestration is a viable treatment for symptomatic fourth ventricular arachnoid cysts in children.

### Arachnoid cysts: Case series and review of the literature [^116WJAYJ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are commonly encountered fluid collections in the central nervous system. Recent advances in neuroimaging have translated into an increased detection of these cysts, resulting in more frequent diagnoses at earlier stages. Significant advances have also been made in the surgical management of these lesions. This study reports on a case series that illustrates the diverse forms of presentation and the treatment modalities commonly used for arachnoid cysts.

- **Methods**: Between January 2002 and December 2006, 20 patients with arachnoid cysts underwent surgery, performed by the senior author at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Seventy percent of the cysts were supratentorial, 5% infratentorial, and 25% spinal. All diagnoses were confirmed through neuroimaging, surgery, and histological examination. The study included 12 male (60%) and eight female (40%) patients, whose ages at the time of surgery ranged from 2 weeks to 39 years (mean age 10.9 years). Symptoms at presentation included headache (41%), weakness (23%), seizure (14%), hydrocephalus (9%), scoliosis (4%), cognitive decline (4%), and visual loss (4%). Twenty-five percent of the cysts were sylvian, 20% intraventricular, and 20% suprasellar. Supratentorial cysts were treated endoscopically in 73% of patients and with open resection in the remaining 27%. Complications included spasticity, hemiparesis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, hydrocephalus, and subdural hygroma. On follow-up evaluation, 60% of patients had stable cysts with improved symptoms, 13% had complete symptom resolution, and 13% had stable symptomatology.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: A single center experiences [^112BEYrc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The arachnoid cyst was first described in 1831 in Bright's Medical Case Reports, with further support provided by Krawchenko and Collins in 1979 upon postmortem examination. In 1935, Barlow published the first case of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst. Arachnoid cysts are congenital lesions caused by the rupture of the arachnoid membrane during development. The precise mechanism behind the formation of these cysts remains unknown. It is proposed that poor development of the cortical layers of the arachnoid membrane may occur during fetal migration. Some researchers suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infiltration leads to cyst expansion, while others hypothesize that vibrations through one-way valve mechanisms in arterial communication might be another possible cause. The intracystic fluid may form from cells secreted by the arachnoid directly into the cyst or by ectopic choroid-like structures. Martinez-Lage et al. proposed that intraventricular arachnoid cysts might originate from the replacement of arachnoid cells by vascular mesenchyme during choroid plexus development. Others have argued that arachnoid cells actively secrete fluid into the cyst wall.

While most arachnoid cysts remain stable throughout a patient's life, some may enlarge, leading to complications such as spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage. However, they usually become symptomatic and diagnosed early in childhood.

The most common intracranial arachnoid cysts identified include temporal cysts (30.2%), suprasellar (14.3%), quadrigeminal (12.7%), cerebellopontine (CPA) (11.1% each), and hemispheric cysts (7.9%). Rengachary and Watanabe detected the local…

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: A single center experiences [^1147TSBo]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (AC) are intra-arachnoid cerebrospinal fluid sacs located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane. They are typically congenital, arising from separations within the arachnoid membrane, rather than from the division or proliferation of the membrane. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SAC) are believed to result from abnormal Lilliquist's membrane or cystic dilatation of the interpeduncular cisterna. Intracranial arachnoid cysts account for around 1% of all intracranial lesions.

The apparent increase in incidence is likely due to improved detection capabilities of modern imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), rather than an actual increase in the occurrence of these cysts. Some SAC symptoms include macrocrania, obstructive hydrocephalus, and visual and endocrine dysfunctions, such as hormone deficiency and precocious puberty.

Treating arachnoid cysts typically involves resection, shunting, or fenestration of the cyst. With the advancement of neuroendoscopy, the use of purely endoscopic fenestration for arachnoid cysts has gained popularity. This technique, favored for its minimally invasive nature, allows for the precise and comfortable management of these cysts. Technological improvements in neuroendoscopy have facilitated these less invasive approaches, making the procedures more patient-friendly and potentially reducing recovery times.

This study offers the most extensive findings on suprasellar arachnoid cysts. It aims to enhance the literature with insights into minimally invasive interventions.

### Thoracic arachnoid cyst resection [^115EkWyY]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts in the spinal cord may be asymptomatic. In some cases, arachnoid cysts may exert a mass effect on the thoracic spinal cord and lead to pain and myelopathy symptoms. Arachnoid cysts may be difficult to visualize on an MRI scan because the thin-walled arachnoid may not be visible. Focal displacement of the thoracic spinal cord and effacement of the spinal cord with apparent widening of the cerebrospinal fluid space is seen.

This video demonstrates surgical techniques to remove a dorsal arachnoid cyst causing spinal cord compression. The surgery involves a thoracic laminectomy. The dura is opened sharply, with care taken not to open the arachnoid so that the cyst can be well visualized. The thickened arachnoid walls of the cyst are removed to alleviate the compression caused by the arachnoid cyst. The video can be found here: http://youtu.be/pgUrl9xvsD0.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^117MECSU]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In a recent systematic review of 26 glioependymal cysts, these lesions were mostly identified in intra-axial intraparenchymal and CPA locations, similar to what we found in our study. All surgical glioependymal cysts were operated on for neurological symptoms attributed to mass effect and were commonly found to have clear fluid, although descriptions of hemorrhage into the cyst exist. The neurologic outcomes were almost always an improvement in symptoms. Overall, our findings mirror previous case reports of glioependymal cysts, which have likely been limited by attempts at pathologically distinguishing these cysts from arachnoid cysts.

If glioependymal cysts make up a meaningful portion of symptomatic benign-appearing intracranial cysts, then understanding the mechanism of progression and development of mass effect is important. Classically, intracranial cysts have been theorized to progress through a "ball-valve" mechanism, as aquaporin expression has never been identified in arachnoid cysts. Fluid flow into arachnoid cysts was investigated by Tali et al. to determine whether intracranial cyst fluid had communication with surrounding CSF spaces. Through intrathecal contrast administration and MR cisternography, they found that 77% of cysts filled with contrast, suggesting a majority of these cysts had a connection to the CSF pathways of the brain. However, 5 patients in their cohort required surgical intervention; 3 of these cysts had no communication between the cyst lumen and surrounding CSF spaces on MR cisternography. These data bring into consideration an al.

### A case of sellar arachnoid cyst operated using the endoscopic supraorbital keyhole approach [^116CpFKL]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The supraorbital keyhole approach is a versatile surgical method applicable to a wide range of diseases, with its usefulness and safety well established. A significant disadvantage of this approach is the potential loss of intraoperative illumination and vision, reducing surgical optical control. However, using an endoscope can overcome this challenge, allowing for a wide and clear surgical field. The endoscope provides deeper illumination than traditional microscopic surgery, which is advantageous.

Unlike transnasal surgery, the supraorbital keyhole approach involves making a skin incision in the brow area. Nevertheless, reports indicate that a 4- to 5-cm incision within the brow, combined with careful soft tissue dissection, results in a pleasing aesthetic outcome. Furthermore, this approach does not require the complex bone removal of the anterior skull base or cumbersome dural reconstruction using fat, fascia, and a nasoseptal flap, as seen in endoscopic transnasal surgery. This simplification is expected to reduce operation time and decrease the risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.

If the frontal sinus is opened during the supraorbital keyhole approach, it can be securely closed without issue. The applicability of this approach for Rathke's cleft cysts has been reported, suggesting its usefulness for sellar arachnoid cysts as well. Although further research is necessary to evaluate complications and long-term results, the current findings are promising.

### Intracerebral arachnoid cyst treated with Ommaya reservoir implantation in a patient younger than two years [^116yEPfp]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are rare cystic-appearing intracranial masses. In even rarer cases, arachnoid cysts originate from brain parenchyma, which is defined as an intracerebral arachnoid cyst. Here, we present a patient younger than two years with massive intracranial arachnoid cysts, one of which was an intracerebral arachnoid cyst. The clinical symptoms included megacephaly and limb weakness. Ommaya reservoir implantation and repeated aspiration of the intracerebral cyst fluid were performed. The symptoms gradually improved, and the intracerebral arachnoid cyst gradually disappeared during 13 months of follow-up. This case highlights the potential of Ommaya reservoir implantation in the treatment of intracerebral arachnoid cysts, especially for young patients. We also reviewed the published literature concerning this rare condition, including the mechanisms for its pathogenesis and enlargement.

### Surgical treatment and outcome of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts in infants [^111bs1FD]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this cohort study was to describe and analyze the surgical treatment and outcome of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts (PFACs) in infants.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting with a PFAC at infancy or prenatally, between the years 2000 and 2019, and who were surgically treated before the age of 2 years, were included in this study. Patient data were retrospectively collected, including baseline characteristics and surgical variables. Factors related to revision surgery were analyzed through uni- and multivariate analysis.

- **Results**: Thirty-five patients, of whom 54.3% were male, were included. The cyst was diagnosed prenatally in 23 patients (65.7%). Surgery was typically recommended following a mean cyst follow-up of 3.4 ± 3.9 months, with a mean age at surgery of 6.1 ± 5.1 months. In 54.3% of patients (n = 19), surgery was performed before the age of 6 months. The PFAC was treated purely neuroendoscopically in 57.1% of patients (n = 20), while 28.6% of patients underwent open cyst procedures (n = 10); 5.7% (n = 2) were treated with a shunt, and 8.6% (n = 3) underwent a combined procedure. Additional surgery was required in 31.4% of patients (n = 11; mean 2.36 ± 2.11 surgeries per patient). At the last follow-up (61.40 ± 55.33 months), no mortality or permanent morbidity was seen; radiological improvement was apparent in 83.9% of the patients. Those patients treated before the age of 6 months (p = 0.09) and who presented before surgery with a stable cyst size that was maintained throughout preoperative monitoring (p = 0.08) showed a trend toward a higher revision rate.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: a single center experiences [^116XCnzg]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Naito et al. presented a 9-month-old patient with a giant suprasellar arachnoid cyst who underwent endoscopic treatment. This patient underwent endoscopic surgery for the second time because of the recurrence of the cyst within the next two months, although the cyst initially shrunk after the first treatment.

Rao et al. reported a nine-year-old male patient with a giant suprasellar arachnoid cyst measuring 51 × 52 × 52 mm on MRI and a history of precocious puberty in whom endoscopic cyst fenestration was performed. Ortega et al. presented a 19-year-old male patient diagnosed with a giant suprachiasmatic suprasellar arachnoid cyst since birth who was followed up and operated on numerous times. The first surgical intervention was endoscopic fenestration of the cyst. Later, after the failure of endoscopic fenestration, they reported that ventriculo- and cystoperitoneal shunt implantation was required.

We also performed a VP shunt procedure on one patient after the endoscopic treatment failed. This patient, a 56-year-old woman who had previously undergone endoscopic cyst fenestration at another medical center, presented to us with increasing headache, difficulty in walking, and urinary incontinence. We tried endoscopic surgery while creating a treatment plan. Cyst fenestration was successfully performed on the patient in whom we saw that the Foramen Monro was a narrow and thick arachnoid membrane. Cystostomies from the previous surgery were probably closed. VP shunt surgery was performed in the 4th postoperative month after the patient's complaints did not improve.

### Exploring predictors of surgery and comparing operative treatment approaches for pediatric intracranial arachnoid cysts: a case series of 83 patients [^111zCkJv]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Although intracranial arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding on pediatric brain imaging, only a subset of patients require surgery. For the minority who undergo surgery, the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches is debated. The authors explored predictors of surgery and compared operative techniques for pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen at a tertiary care center.

- **Methods**: The authors reviewed records of pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst. For each patient, data on baseline characteristics, method of intervention, and surgical outcomes for the initial surgery were extracted. Cyst size at diagnosis was calculated (anteroposterior × craniocaudal × mediolateral). Baseline variables were analyzed as predictors of surgery using logistic regression modeling, excluding those whose surgery was not related to cyst size. This includes cases of obstructive hydrocephalus due to cyst compression or rupture/hemorrhage. Surgical outcomes data were analyzed descriptively.

- **Results**: Among 83 pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen over a 25-year period (1989–2013), 27 (33%) underwent surgery; all had at least one cyst-attributed symptom or finding. In the multivariate model, age at presentation and cyst size at diagnosis were independent predictors of surgery. Cyst size had greater predictive value; specifically, the area under the curve for the receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.97).

### Arachnoid cyst slit valves: The mechanism for arachnoid cyst enlargement [^115Vqfrz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are common, accounting for approximately 1% of intracranial mass lesions. Most are congenital, clinically silent, and remain static in size. Occasionally, they increase in size and produce symptoms due to mass effect or obstruction. The mechanism of enlargement of arachnoid cysts is controversial. One-way slit valves are often hypothesized as the mechanism for enlargement.

The authors present four cases of suprasellar prepontine arachnoid cysts in which a slit valve was identified. The patients presented with hydrocephalus due to enlargement of the cyst. The valve was located in the arachnoid wall of the cyst directly over the basilar artery. The authors believe this slit valve was responsible for the net influx of CSF into the cyst and for its enlargement.

They also present one case of an arachnoid cyst in the middle cranial fossa that had a small circular opening but lacked a slit valve. This cyst did not enlarge, but surgery was required because of rupture and the development of a subdural hygroma.

- **One-way slit valves as a mechanism**: One-way slit valves exist and are a possible mechanism of enlargement of suprasellar prepontine arachnoid cysts. The valve was located directly over the basilar artery in each of these cases. Caudad-to-cephalad CSF flow during the cardiac cycle increased the opening of the valve, whereas cephalad-to-caudad CSF flow during the remainder of the cardiac cycle pushed the slit opening against the basilar artery and decreased the size of the opening. Arachnoid cysts that communicate CSF via circular, nonslit valves are probably more likely to remain stable.
