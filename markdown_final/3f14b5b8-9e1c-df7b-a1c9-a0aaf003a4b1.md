## Question

Glucosamine supplement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether glucosamine supplements are effective and safe for osteoarthritis, and how to interpret the mixed evidence to make a recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why glucosamine is used. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially large randomized controlled trials and network meta-analyses. Next, I will examine disease-modifying claims and structural outcomes. After that, I need to check safety and drug–supplement interactions. Finally, I will align conclusions with current guidelines and translate this into practical, patient-centered advice with dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Glucosamine is an amino sugar used as a dietary supplement for osteoarthritis, with proposed chondroprotective effects via glycosaminoglycan synthesis, though bioavailability after oral dosing is limited and mechanistic plausibility remains debated, which means I should not over-interpret theoretical benefits without clinical confirmation [^f01087bd] [^b4ea71ec].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. Large, methodologically rigorous trials and network meta-analyses consistently show no clinically meaningful benefit of glucosamine for pain or function in knee and hip osteoarthritis. The GAIT trial found no significant benefit overall, with only a subgroup signal in moderate-to-severe pain that warrants caution about false positives, and multiple BMJ network meta-analyses conclude that glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce pain or slow radiographic progression to a clinically relevant degree, with pooled pain differences around 0.3–0.5 cm on a 10 cm VAS, below the prespecified minimal clinically important difference of 0.9 cm [^7a6e13a6] [^71cd044a] [^e698803c] [^34184a08].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check disease-modifying claims. A 3-year RCT suggested glucosamine sulfate slowed joint space narrowing, but this has not been replicated consistently in larger, high-quality datasets, and subsequent meta-analyses and long-term studies show minimal or no structural benefit, so I should be cautious about calling it disease-modifying outside of a specific product and context that is not broadly generalizable [^36674ff2] [^71cd044a] [^e698803c].

> I need to check safety next. Across large trials and meta-analyses, glucosamine is generally well tolerated with adverse event rates similar to placebo, but I should confirm potential concerns: shellfish allergy, theoretical effects on glucose metabolism, and possible anticoagulant interactions have been described, so patients with diabetes, warfarin use, or shellfish allergy warrant individualized risk assessment and monitoring if they elect to trial glucosamine [^3ec43b77] [^941b1559].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The VA/DoD guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against glucosamine and advises clinicians not to prescribe it, the AAOS guideline gives a limited-strength recommendation with acknowledgment of inconsistent evidence, and the ACR strongly recommends against glucosamine for knee, hip, and hand osteoarthritis due to lack of efficacy, highlighting the controversy and the need to prioritize therapies with stronger evidence [^f53d2bea] [^5c2e726a] [^a373143f].

> But wait, what if a specific formulation changes the calculus? Some reviews suggest that a prescription crystalline glucosamine sulfate product (e.g. Dona/Rotta) may show modest symptom benefits, yet this finding is not consistently reproduced across independent trials and is not sufficient to overturn the broader negative or neutral conclusions from high-quality syntheses, so I should frame this as possible small effects in select products rather than a class effect [^3a04d203] [^7f6a49db] [^71cd044a].

> I will now examine practical considerations for patients who still wish to try glucosamine. Typical dosing is 1,500 mg/day, often divided into three 500 mg doses, and if used, a 6–12 week trial with predefined stop criteria is reasonable. I should counsel that benefits, if any, are likely small, onset is slow, and out-of-pocket costs are common, while monitoring for gastrointestinal effects, allergic reactions, and potential interactions with diabetes or anticoagulation is prudent [^941b1559] [^e9bcc9e1].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. The weight of high-quality evidence indicates glucosamine does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in pain, function, or structural progression for most patients with osteoarthritis, though it appears safe for short-term use in appropriately selected individuals. Therefore, it should not be first-line therapy, and core treatments such as exercise, weight management, and evidence-based analgesics should be prioritized, with glucosamine reserved for informed, preference-driven trials after discussing uncertainties and costs [^71cd044a] [^e698803c] [^f53d2bea] [^a373143f].

---

Glucosamine is **not clearly effective** for osteoarthritis: large, high-quality trials and meta-analyses show no clinically meaningful benefit for pain or function, though a modest effect cannot be excluded in some subgroups or with certain formulations [^7a6e13a6] [^71cd044a] [^e698803c]. It is **generally safe**, with mild GI effects and rare hypersensitivity; caution is advised in shellfish allergy, diabetes, and warfarin users. Major guidelines (AAOS, ACR, VA/DoD) **do not recommend routine use** due to inconsistent evidence, so it should not replace core therapies (exercise, weight loss, NSAIDs). If patients elect to try it, a 3-month trial of 1,500 mg/day is reasonable, with monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions.

## Clinical evidence for glucosamine supplementation

### Symptomatic relief

- **GAIT trial**: No significant benefit overall for glucosamine alone or with chondroitin vs placebo; a subgroup with moderate-to-severe pain showed a possible benefit, but this was exploratory and not definitive [^7a6e13a6].
- **Network meta-analyses**: Multiple high-quality analyses show no clinically relevant reduction in pain or improvement in function vs placebo across formulations and time points [^71cd044a] [^e698803c] [^34184a08].
- **Long-term trials**: Some studies suggest potential structural benefits (e.g. less joint space narrowing), but these findings are inconsistent and not corroborated by independent trials [^36674ff2] [^7e396796] [^e698803c].

---

### Disease modification

Evidence for **structural benefits** is limited and inconsistent; while a few studies suggest slower radiographic progression, larger, independent analyses do not confirm clinically meaningful disease modification [^36674ff2] [^7e396796] [^e698803c].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) are most frequent.
- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity; caution in patients with shellfish allergy due to sourcing, though most products are highly purified.
- **Drug interactions**: Potential interaction with warfarin (increased INR); monitor INR if used concurrently.
- **Metabolic effects**: Concerns about glucose metabolism exist theoretically, but clinical evidence is inconclusive; monitor in patients with diabetes.

## Comparison with other osteoarthritis treatments

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Glucosamine | Limited/inconsistent | Generally safe | Not recommended routinely |
| NSAIDs | Moderate efficacy | GI, CV risks | First-line pharmacologic therapy |
| Acetaminophen | Minimal efficacy | Safe at recommended doses | First-line for mild pain |
| Topical NSAIDs | Moderate efficacy | Local skin reactions | First-line for localized pain |
| Intra-articular corticosteroids | Short-term relief | Infection risk | Flare management |
| Hyaluronic acid | Controversial | Injection risks | Not routinely recommended |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **AAOS 2022**: Recommends against routine use; evidence is inconsistent/limited.
- **ACR 2019**: Strongly recommends against glucosamine for knee, hip, and hand OA due to lack of efficacy.
- **VA/DoD 2020**: Insufficient evidence to recommend for or against; use is not advised as standard care.

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Mild-to-moderate OA**: No consistent benefit; consider only if patient preference and cost are acceptable.
- **Severe OA**: Unlikely to provide meaningful benefit; prioritize guideline-directed therapies.
- **Patients with comorbidities**: Use caution in diabetes, shellfish allergy, and those on warfarin.

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

- **Counseling**: Discuss limited and inconsistent evidence, potential placebo effects, and out-of-pocket costs.
- **Trial approach**: If used, a 3-month trial at 1,500 mg/day is reasonable; reassess efficacy and adherence.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for GI effects, allergic reactions, and drug interactions, especially with warfarin.
- **Integration with standard care**: Emphasize core treatments (exercise, weight loss, NSAIDs) and avoid replacing them with glucosamine.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Glucosamine is **not clearly effective** for osteoarthritis, with high-quality evidence showing no clinically meaningful benefit; it is generally safe, but major guidelines **do not recommend routine use**. Clinicians should prioritize evidence-based therapies and, if patients elect to try glucosamine, guide a time-limited, monitored trial with counseling about uncertain benefits and potential costs.

### Current role of glucosamine in the treatment of osteoarthritis [^115a7c61]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the interest of using the various preparations of glucosamine for symptomatic and structural management of osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

A critical analysis of the literature based on an exhaustive search (Medline, PubMed and manual search within the bibliography of retrieved manuscripts) from 1980 to 2005.

Results

Despite multiple controlled clinical trials of the use of glucosamine in OA (mainly of the knee), controversy on efficacy related to symptomatic improvement continues. Differences in results originate from the differences in products, study design and study populations. Symptomatic efficacy described in multiple studies performed with glucosamine sulphate (GS) support continued consideration in the OA therapeutic armamentarium. The most compelling evidence of a potential for inhibiting the progression of OA is also obtain with GS.

Conclusions

GS has shown positive effects on symptomatic and structural outcomes of knee OA. These results should not be extrapolated to other glucosamine salts [hydrochloride or preparations (over-the-counter or food supplements)] in which no warranty exists about content, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tablets.

### Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate [^f01087bd]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, components of normal cartilage that are marketed as dietary supplements in the United States, have been evaluated for their potential role in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Due to claims of efficacy, increased prevalence of osteoarthritis, and a lack of other effective therapies, there has been substantial interest in using these dietary supplements as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis. Though pharmacokinetic and bioavailability data are limited, use of these supplements has been evaluated for management of osteoarthritis symptoms and modification of disease progression. Relevant clinical trial efficacy and safety data are reviewed and summarized.

The food supplement glucosamine has been claimed to modify progression of osteoarthritis and is being extensively marketed as a treatment for patients with the condition. In fact, the UK annual market for glucosamine is now estimated to be over 10 million Pounds. Here, we examine whether the supplement has a place in the management of osteoarthritis.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine sulphate as an analgesic in osteoarthritis of the knee [^d84c82a6]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the relative effectiveness of glucosamine sulphate and placebo in managing pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Methods

Eighty patients with OA of the knee were recruited from a rheumatology out-patient clinic and received either glucosamine sulphate 1500 mg daily for 6 months or dummy placebo. The primary outcome measure was patients' global assessment of pain in the affected knee.

Results

Area under the curve analysis for the primary outcome measure showed no difference between placebo and glucosamine [mean difference 0.15 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.78 to 9.07]. The placebo response was 33%. There was a statistically significant difference between groups in knee flexion (mean difference 13 degrees, 95% CI -23.13 to -1.97), but this difference was small and could have been due to measurement error.

Conclusions

As a symptom modifier in OA patients with a wide range of pain severities, glucosamine sulphate was no more effective than placebo.

### Effect of glucosamine sulfate on hip osteoarthritis: a randomized trial [^e3e18332]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of glucosamine sulfate as a symptom and disease modifier for osteoarthritis is still under debate.

Objective

To assess whether glucosamine sulfate has an effect on the symptoms and structural progression of hip osteoarthritis during 2 years of treatment.

Design

Randomized, controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care in the Netherlands.

Patients

222 patients with hip osteoarthritis who were recruited by their general practitioner. Patients were eligible if they met the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for hip osteoarthritis.

Intervention

2 years of treatment with 1500 mg of oral glucosamine sulfate or placebo once daily.

Measurements

Primary outcome measures were Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain and function subscales over 24 months and joint space narrowing after 24 months. The main secondary outcome measures were WOMAC pain, function, and stiffness after 3, 12, and 24 months.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar in demographic and clinical variables. Overall, WOMAC pain did not differ (mean difference [glucosamine sulfate minus placebo], -1.54 [95% CI, -5.43 to 2.36]), nor did WOMAC function (mean difference, -2.01 [CI, -5.38 to 1.36]). Joint space narrowing also did not differ after 24 months (mean difference, -0.029 [CI, -0.122 to 0.064]). Only 1 of the sensitivity analyses, based on extreme assumptions regarding missing assessments due to total hip replacement, provided results consistent with a glucosamine effect.

Limitations

Twenty patients had total hip replacement during the trial. Half of the patients had a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 1.

Conclusion

Glucosamine sulfate was no better than placebo in reducing symptoms and progression of hip osteoarthritis. International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN54513166.

### Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are effective in the management of osteoarthritis [^7744586e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2003). Low credibility.

The use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis has been a subject of controversy for several reasons. First, the medical community in general took offense at the title of Theodosakis' book, The Arthritis Cure. Second, the medical community is becoming divided into "traditional" and "alternative" camps with deep skepticism between them. Third, the whole nutraceutical industry is essentially unregulated, with manufacturers making outrageous claims on products that have never been tested at all, are often of poor quality, and occasionally lacking in any active ingredient. However, for the nutriceuticals evaluated here, there is abundant in vitro, in vivo, animal clinical, and human clinical evidence of both their efficacy and safety. They deserve a prominent place in the armamentarium of nonsurgical treatment of osteoarthritis.

### Glucosamine [^941b1559]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Glucosamine is one of the most popular dietary supplements sold in the United States. Most clinical trials have focused on its use in osteoarthritis of the knee. The reported adverse effects have been relatively well studied and are generally uncommon and minor. No significant supplement-drug interactions involving glucosamine have been reported. The National Institutes of Health-sponsored Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial, the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving the supplement, still has not confirmed whether glucosamine is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Despite conflicting results in studies, there is no clear evidence to recommend against its use. If physicians have patients who wish to try glucosamine, it would be reasonable to support a 60-day trial of glucosamine sulfate, especially in those at high risk of secondary effects from other accepted treatments. The decision to continue therapy can then be left to patients on an individual basis, while the physician monitors for possible adverse effects. Glucosamine should be used with caution in patients who have shellfish allergies or asthma, and in those taking diabetes medications or warfarin.

### A review of evidence-based medicine for glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate use in knee osteoarthritis [^5621336f]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The investigation of disease-modifying treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) has become an important aspect of orthopaedic care. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the evidence for the use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate for knee OA with the goal of elucidating their indications for clinical use. The published clinical studies of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate on OA are reviewed within the context of evidence-based medicine. Almost every included trial has found the safety of these compounds to be equal to placebo. In the literature satisfying our inclusion criteria, glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and chondroitin sulfate have individually shown inconsistent efficacy in decreasing OA pain and improving joint function. Many studies confirmed OA pain relief with glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate use. The excellent safety profile of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate therapy should be discussed with patients, and these supplements may serve a role as an initial treatment modality for many OA patients.

### Glucosamine long-term treatment and the progression of knee osteoarthritis: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^7e396796]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the structural and symptomatic efficacy and safety of glucosamine in knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Data Sources

Clinical trials of glucosamine were identified through electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, EMB review, the Cochrane Library) using the key words glucosamine, osteoarthritis, degenerative joint disease, degenerative arthritis, osteoarthrosis, gonarthrosis, knee, disease progression, and clinical trial. The bibliographic databases were searched from their respective inception dates to August 2004. We also hand-searched reference lists of relevant articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were included if they were double-blind, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated oral glucosamine long-term treatment in knee OA; lasting at least one year; and reporting as outcome measures the symptom severity and disease progression as assessed by joint space narrowing. Two authors interpreted data independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Data Synthesis

Glucosamine sulfate was more effective than placebo in delaying structural progression in knee OA. The risk of disease progression was reduced by 54% (pooled RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; p = 0.0011). The number-needed-to-treat was 9 (95% CI 6 to 20). The pooled effect sizes for pain reduction and improvement in physical function were 0.41 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.60; p < 0.0001) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.66; p < 0.0001), respectively, in favor of glucosamine sulfate. Glucosamine sulfate caused no more adverse effects than placebo.

Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that glucosamine sulfate may be effective and safe in delaying the progression and improving the symptoms of knee OA. Due to the sparse data on structural efficacy and safety, further studies are warranted.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^f53d2bea]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline—hip and knee osteoarthritis dietary supplements states that in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of dietary supplements for relief of pain and improved function, and that in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis, clinicians should not prescribe chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and/or any combination of the two, to treat joint pain or improve function; both are categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced.

### Glucosamine for knee osteoarthritis – what's new? [^77d89665]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Glucosamine is a natural substance that has been widely used for several years as a food supplement to treat people with osteoarthritis.1 One formulation of black triangle downglucosamine hydrochloride (Alateris - Ransom) has recently become the first (and is currently the only) glucosamine product to be licensed as a medicine in the UK for symptomatic relief of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. In 2002, we concluded that unlicensed "oral glucosamine sulphate 1,500 mg [daily] probably provides modest symptom relief in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and its efficacy appears similar to that of NSAIDs".1 Here we update our advice in the light of new evidence and assess the place of the licensed glucosamine hydrochloride tablets.

### Chondroitin for osteoarthritis [^d884503a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis, a common joint disorder, is one of the leading causes of disability. Chondroitin has emerged as a new treatment. Previous meta-analyses have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of chondroitin. This, in addition to the publication of more trials, necessitates a systematic review.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit and harm of oral chondroitin for treating osteoarthritis compared with placebo or a comparator oral medication including, but not limited to, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, opioids, and glucosamine or other "herbal" medications.

Search Methods

We searched seven databases up to November 2013, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials. We searched the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMEA) websites for adverse effects. Trial registers were not searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials lasting longer than two weeks, studying adults with osteoarthritis in any joint, and comparing chondroitin with placebo, an active control such as NSAIDs, or other "herbal" supplements such as glucosamine.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed all title assessments, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments.

Main Results

Forty-three randomized controlled trials including 4,962 participants treated with chondroitin and 4,148 participants given placebo or another control were included. The majority of trials were in knee OA, with few in hip and hand OA. Trial duration varied from 1 month to 3 years. Participants treated with chondroitin achieved statistically significantly and clinically meaningful better pain scores (0-100) in studies less than 6 months than those given placebo with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% confidence interval (CI), 15% to 6% lower; number needed to treat (NNT) = 5 (95% CI, 3 to 8; n = 8 trials) (level of evidence, low; risk of bias, high); but there was high heterogeneity between the trials (T(2) = 0.07; I(2) = 70%, which was not easily explained by differences in risk of bias or study sample size). In studies longer than 6 months, the absolute risk difference for pain was 9% lower (95% CI 18% lower to 0%); n = 6 trials; T(2) = 0.18; I(2) = 83% ), again with low level of evidence.For the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Minimal Clinically Important Improvement (WOMAC MCII Pain subscale) outcome, a reduction in knee pain by 20% was achieved by 53/100 in the chondroitin group versus 47/100 in the placebo group, an absolute risk difference of 6% (95% CI 1% to 11%), (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24; T(2) = 0.00; I(2) = 0%) (n = 2 trials, 1253 participants; level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low).Differences in Lequesne's index (composite of pain,function and disability) statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo in studies under six months, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI 12% to 5% lower; T(2)= 0.78; n = 7 trials) (level of evidence, moderate; risk of bias, unclear), also clinically meaningful. Loss of minimum joint space width in the chondroitin group was statistically significantly less than in the placebo group, with a relative risk difference of 4.7% less (95% CI 1.6% to 7.8% less; n = 2 trials) (level of evidence, high; risk of bias, low). Chondroitin was associated with statistically significantly lower odds of serious adverse events compared with placebo with Peto odds ratio of 0.40 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; n = 6 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin did not result in statistically significant numbers of adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo or another drug. Adverse events were reported in a limited fashion, with some studies providing data and others not.Comparisons of chondroitin taken alone or in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed a statistically significant reduction in pain (0-100) when compared with placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 10% lower (95% CI 14% to 5% lower); NNT = 4 (95% CI 3 to 6); T(2) = 0.33; I(2) = 91%; n = 17 trials) (level of evidence, low). For physical function, chondroitin in combination with glucosamine or another supplement showed no statistically significant difference from placebo or an active control, with an absolute risk difference of 1% lower (95% CI 6% lower to 3% higher with T(2) = 0.04; n = 5 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Differences in Lequesne's index statistically significantly favoured chondroitin as compared with placebo, with an absolute risk difference of 8% lower (95% CI, 12% to 4% lower; T(2) = 0.12; n = 10 trials) (level of evidence, moderate). Chondroitin in combination with glucosamine did not result in statistically significant differences in the numbers of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, or in the numbers of serious adverse events compared with placebo or with an active control.The beneficial effects of chondroitin in pain and Lequesne's index persisted when evidence was limited to studies with adequate blinding or studies that used appropriate intention to treat (ITT) analyses. These beneficial effects were uncertain when we limited data to studies with appropriate allocation concealment or a large study sample (> 200) or to studies without pharmaceutical funding.

Authors' Conclusions

A review of randomized trials of mostly low quality reveals that chondroitin (alone or in combination with glucosamine) was better than placebo in improving pain in participants with osteoarthritis in short-term studies. The benefit was small to moderate with an 8 point greater improvement in pain (range 0 to 100) and a 2 point greater improvement in Lequesne's index (range 0 to 24), both seeming clinically meaningful. These differences persisted in some sensitivity analyses and not others. Chondroitin had a lower risk of serious adverse events compared with control. More high-quality studies are needed to explore the role of chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The combination of some efficacy and low risk associated with chondroitin may explain its popularity among patients as an over-the-counter supplement.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^81e69e24]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis of the hip or knee is a chronic condition mostly treated with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but these drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events, especially with long term use.Disease modifying agents that not only reduce joint pain but also slow the progression of the condition would be desirable. Throughout the world for the past 10 years, the cartilage constituents chondroitin and glucosamine have been increasingly recommended in guidelines, prescribed by general practitioners and rheumatologists, and used by patients as over the counter medications to modify the clinical and radiological course of the condition.Global sales of glucosamine supplements reached almost $2bn (£1.3bn, €0.8bn) in 2008, which represents an increase of about 60% compared with 2003, with a forecasted continued growth through 2013 reaching $2.3bn.The oral administration of cartilage constituents in patients with osteoarthritis is thought to make up for the apparent cartilage loss in affected joints. Chondroitin is a highly hydrophilic, gel forming polysaccharide macromolecule. Its hydrocolloid properties convey much of the compressive resistance of cartilage. Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is a building block for the glycosaminoglycans that are part of the structure of cartilage. Ingested chondroitin and glucosamine are both partially absorbed in the intestine, and it has been suggested that some of the ingested amount reaches the joints.

Results from randomised trials about the effectiveness of chondroitin and glucosamine are conflicting.Trials that have reported large effects on joint pain were often hampered by poor study quality and small sample sizes,whereas large methodologically sound trials often found only small or no effects.

Bayesian approaches towards network meta-analyses allow a unified, coherent analysis of data recorded at multiple time points in randomised trials that compare either of these preparations with placebo or head to head.The approaches fully respect randomisation, account for the correlation of multiple observations within the same trial, and allow the estimation of the relative effectiveness of the different preparations and their combination. We performed a systematic review with network meta-analysis including data from large methodologically sound randomised trials at multiple follow-up times to determine the effect of these preparations on joint pain and on radiological progression of disease.

### Glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and the two in combination for painful knee osteoarthritis [^7a6e13a6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are used to treat osteoarthritis. The multicenter, double-blind, placebo- and celecoxib-controlled Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) evaluated their efficacy and safety as a treatment for knee pain from osteoarthritis.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1583 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis to receive 1500 mg of glucosamine daily, 1200 mg of chondroitin sulfate daily, both glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo for 24 weeks. Up to 4000 mg of acetaminophen daily was allowed as rescue analgesia. Assignment was stratified according to the severity of knee pain (mild [N=1229] vs. moderate to severe [N=354]). The primary outcome measure was a 20 percent decrease in knee pain from baseline to week 24.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 59 years, and 64 percent were women. Overall, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were not significantly better than placebo in reducing knee pain by 20 percent. As compared with the rate of response to placebo (60.1 percent), the rate of response to glucosamine was 3.9 percentage points higher (P=0.30), the rate of response to chondroitin sulfate was 5.3 percentage points higher (P=0.17), and the rate of response to combined treatment was 6.5 percentage points higher (P=0.09). The rate of response in the celecoxib control group was 10.0 percentage points higher than that in the placebo control group (P=0.008). For patients with moderate-to-severe pain at baseline, the rate of response was significantly higher with combined therapy than with placebo (79.2 percent vs. 54.3 percent, P=0.002). Adverse events were mild, infrequent, and evenly distributed among the groups.

Conclusions

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate alone or in combination did not reduce pain effectively in the overall group of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Exploratory analyses suggest that the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate may be effective in the subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00032890.).

### Use of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in the management of osteoarthritis [^b6822590]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

The goals of osteoarthritis therapy are to decrease pain and to maintain or improve joint function. The pharmacologic treatment of this condition has included the use of aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. More recently, numerous studies have investigated the potential role of chondroprotective agents in repairing articular cartilage and decelerating the degenerative process. The reports of limited clinical experience with two of these agents, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, as well as the accompanying publicity in the popular media, have generated controversy. Advocates of these alternative modalities cite reports of progressive and gradual decline of joint pain and tenderness, improved mobility, sustained improvement after drug withdrawal, and a lack of significant toxicity associated with short-term use of these agents. Critics point out that in the great majority of the relevant clinical trials, sample sizes were small and follow-up was short-term.

### Dietary supplements for osteoarthritis [^bc676117]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

A large number of dietary supplements are promoted to patients with osteoarthritis and as many as one third of those patients have used a supplement to treat their condition. Glucosamine-containing supplements are among the most commonly used products for osteoarthritis. Although the evidence is not entirely consistent, most research suggests that glucosamine sulfate can improve symptoms of pain related to osteoarthritis, as well as slow disease progression in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Chondroitin sulfate also appears to reduce osteoarthritis symptoms and is often combined with glucosamine, but there is no reliable evidence that the combination is more effective than either agent alone. S-adenosylmethionine may reduce pain but high costs and product quality issues limit its use. Several other supplements are promoted for treating osteoarthritis, such as methylsulfonylmethane, Harpagophytum procumbens (devil's claw), Curcuma longa (turmeric), and Zingiber officinale (ginger), but there is insufficient reliable evidence regarding long-term safety or effectiveness.

### Naturocetic (glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate) compounds as structure-modifying drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis [^05f7f9c1]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several entities have been investigated carefully for the symptomatic and structural management of osteoarthritis. This review reports recent findings suggesting that such compounds may delay the structural progression of osteoarthritis.

Recent Findings

The most compelling evidence of a potential for inhibiting the structural progression of osteoarthritis has been obtained with glucosamine sulfate, whereas preliminary results obtained in patients with osteoarthritis of the hands also suggest that chondroitin sulfate could be used in the same indication. At any rate, these two compounds have clearly demonstrated a symptomatic action, mainly in osteoarthritis of the lower limbs. Patients with the less severe radiographic osteoarthritis will experience, in the long run, the most dramatic disease progression in terms of joint space narrowing. Such patients may be particularly responsive to structure-modifying drugs.

Summary

Glucosamine sulfate has demonstrated its ability to reduce the progression of osteoarthritis in the lower limbs. The preliminary results obtained in the hands suggest that chondroitin sulfate could also be of interest in this indication. An important issue is that all the conclusive studies with such chemical entities resulted from the use of prescription medicines, not over-the-counter pills or food supplements.

Regarding medical management for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to agents with no evidence for benefit, AAOS 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of the following supplements in patients with knee OA, although they may be helpful in reducing pain and improving function in patients with mild-to-moderate knee OA:

- turmeric

- ginger extract

- glucosamine

- chondroitin

- vitamin D.

### Effects of glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation on knee osteoarthritis: an analysis with marginal structural models [^35f77ff3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin in relieving knee symptoms and slowing disease progression among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

The 4-year followup data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative data set were analyzed. We used a "new-user" design, for which only participants who were not using glucosamine/chondroitin at baseline were included in the analyses (n = 1,625). Cumulative exposure was calculated as the number of visits when participants reported use of glucosamine/chondroitin. Knee symptoms were measured with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and structural progression was determined by measuring the joint space width (JSW). To control for the time-varying confounders that might be influenced by previous treatments, we used marginal structural models to estimate the effects on OA of using glucosamine/chondroitin for 3 years, 2 years, and 1 year.

Results

During the study period, 18% of the participants initiated treatment with glucosamine/chondroitin. After adjustment for potential confounders with marginal structural models, we found no clinically significant differences between users at all assessments and never-users of glucosamine/chondroitin in WOMAC pain (β = 0.68 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.16 to 1.53]), WOMAC stiffness (β = 0.41 [95% CI 0 to 0.82]), and WOMAC function (β = 1.28 [95% CI -1.23 to 3.79]) or JSW (β = 0.11 [95% CI -0.21 to 0.44]).

Conclusion

Use of glucosamine/chondroitin did not appear to relieve symptoms or modify disease progression among patients with radiographically confirmed OA. Our findings are consistent with the results of meta-analyses of clinical trials and extend those results to a more general population with knee OA.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits – hip osteoarthritis: clinical practice guidelines linked to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health from the orthopaedic section of the American Physical Therapy Association [^dad88a38]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis—alternative and complementary medications show mixed or minimal benefit, with discouraging recommendations for chondroitin and glucosamine. Glucosamine and other similar supplements are commonly suggested for individuals with hip OA, yet randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of glucosamines have shown mixed results and most of the positive results are for short-term improvement in pain and in function. A recent meta-analysis of chondroitin for OA of the hip indicates the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent and the use of chondroitin in clinical practice should be discouraged, and the short or long-term use of glucosamines is not recommended at this time in patients with hip OA.

### Glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis [^c203815d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and it is often associated with significant disability and an impaired quality of life.

Objectives

To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in osteoarthritis (OA).

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Current Contents up to November 1999, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. We also wrote letters to content experts, and hand searched reference lists of identified RCTs and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

Relevant studies met the following criteria: 1) RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA, 2) Both placebo based and comparative studies were eligible, 3) Both single blinded and double-blinded studies were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data abstraction was performed independently by two investigators and the results were compared for degree of agreement. Gotzsche's method and a validated tool (Jadad 1995) were used to score the quality of the RCTs. Continuous outcome measures were pooled using standardized mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using Peto Odds Ratios.

Main Results

Collectively, the 16 identified RCTs provided evidence that glucosamine is both effective and safe in OA. In the 13 RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to placebo, glucosamine was found to be superior in all RCTs, except one. In the four RCTs in which glucosamine was compared to an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two, and equivalent in two.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Further research is necessary to confirm the long term effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine therapy in OA. Most of the trials reviewed only evaluated the Rotta preparation of glucosamine sulfate. It is not known whether different glucosamine preparations prepared by different manufacturers are equally effective in the therapy of OA.

### Osteoarthritis: diagnosis and treatment [^c9bf4a27]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative disorder of the articular cartilage associated with hypertrophic bone changes. Risk factors include genetics, female sex, past trauma, advancing age, and obesity. The diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain worsened by movement, which can lead to disability in activities of daily living. Plain radiography may help in the diagnosis, but laboratory testing usually does not. Pharmacologic treatment should begin with acetaminophen and step up to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Exercise is a useful adjunct to treatment and has been shown to reduce pain and disability. The supplements glucosamine and chondroitin can be used for moderate to severe osteoarthritis when taken in combination. Corticosteroid injections provide inexpensive, short-term (four to eight weeks) relief of osteoarthritic flare-ups of the knee, whereas hyaluronic acid injections are more expensive but can maintain symptom improvement for longer periods. Total joint replacement of the hip, knee, or shoulder is recommended for patients with chronic pain and disability despite maximal medical therapy.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^34184a08]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Our network meta-analysis of all 10 available large scale patient blind randomised trials in 3803 patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis showed no clinically relevant effect of chondroitin, glucosamine, or their combination on perceived joint pain. Despite abundant statistical power, none of the pooled estimates crossed the pre-specified boundary of a minimal clinically important difference of −0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale at any of the recorded time points. At some time points the 95% credible interval crossed this boundary (see fig 3), which could mean that we cannot exclude a relevant effect at such time points. The overall estimates, which combine effects over different time points, were precise, however, and the lower end of their credible intervals did not cross the pre-specified boundary. These estimates should be considered most valid in view of the negative test of interaction of treatment effects by time (P=0.93), which indicates that the observed variation over different time points is not over and above what would be expected by chance alone.

The upper limit of the 95% credible interval of the overall pooled estimate of glucosamine versus placebo and chondroitin versus placebo did not overlap the line of no effect, which suggests that a traditional P value for this comparison would be significant at the conventional 5% level. Statistical significance should not, however, be confused with clinical relevance. With the observed differences in pain intensity of 0.3 to 0.5 cm between supplements and placebo on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, the range and distribution of pain scores in patients receiving supplements and placebo are near identical,and it would be impossible, based on the reported pain intensity at the end of a trial, to determine whether a patient was allocated to a supplement or to placebo.

In stratified analyses, we found that estimates comparing supplements with placebo depended to some extent on the quality of the trials, the presence or absence of quality control measures for preparations, the joint studied, and the type of glucosamine salt used, but tests for interaction were all negative for these variables (P≥0.20 for interaction). On average, the estimated differences between supplements and placebo were 0.5 cm less pronounced in industry independent trials compared with industry sponsored trials, and estimated treatment effects in industry independent trials were minute to zero and by no means clinically relevant (see fig 2). The effects on minimal width of joint space were small, again clinically irrelevant, and—with credible intervals overlapping the line of no effect—non-significant at the conventional α level of 5%.

### Osteoarthritis of the knee [^80b78f05]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis of the knee affects about 10% of adults aged over 60 years, with risk increased in those with obesity, and joint damage or abnormalities. Progression of disease on x rays is commonplace, but x ray changes don't correlate well with clinical symptoms.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-surgical treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee? What are the effects of surgical treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 74 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, capsaicin, chondroitin, education to aid self-management, exercise and physiotherapy, glucosamine, insoles, intra-articular corticosteroids, intra-articular hyaluronan, joint bracing, knee replacement, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), opioid analgesics, osteotomy, simple analgesics, and taping.

### Comparative effectiveness of glucosamine, chondroitin, acetaminophen or celecoxib for the treatment of knee and / or hip osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis [^1527a66a]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacies of oral glucosamine, chondroitin, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin, acetaminophen and celecoxib on the treatment of knee and/or hip osteoarthritis.

Methods

We searched electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library and the reference lists of relevant articles published from inception to October 23, 2017. A Bayesian hierarchical random effects model was used to examine the overall effect size among mixed multiple interventions.

Results

We identified 61 randomised controlled trials of patients with knee and/or hip osteoarthritis. There was no obvious difference in the results between the traditional meta-analysis and the network meta-analysis. The network meta-analysis demonstrated that celecoxib was most likely the best option (SMD, -0.32 [95% CI, -0.38 to -0.25]) for pain, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. For physical function, all interventions were significantly superior to oral placebo except for acetaminophen. In terms of stiffness, glucosamine (SMD, -0.36 [95% CI, -0.67 to -0.06]) and celecoxib (SMD, -0.29 [95% CI, -0.51 to -0.08]) were significantly better compared to placebo. In view of safety, compared to placebo only, celecoxib and acetaminophen presented significant differences.

Conclusions

Given the effectiveness of these non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and symptomatic slow-acting drugs, oral celecoxib is more effective than placebo on relieving pain and improving physical function, followed by the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. Acetaminophen is likely the least efficacious intervention option. This information, accompanied by the tolerability and economic costs of the included treatments, would be conducive to making decisions for clinicians.

### Why are clinical trials of glucosamine no longer uniformly positive? [^7fb8ccb7]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In contrast to earlier industry-funded trials of for knee OA, recent studies have generated negative results. While there will be a tendency to assume that these studies were negative because of the absence of any conflicts of interest, a number of issues must be taken into consideration before drawing such conclusions. These issues include design issues and important differences in sample characteristics. Ultimately, it is clear that more work needs to be done to clarify issues surrounding the efficacy and utility of the various glucosamine compounds.

### Effectiveness of glucosamine for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis: results from an internet-based randomized double-blind controlled trial [^22452b20]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the safety and effectiveness results of a prototypical 12-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial of glucosamine among subjects with knee osteoarthritis who were recruited and followed entirely over the Internet.

Methods

The study comprised 205 subjects aged 45 years or older with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis who were recruited over the Internet; eligibility was authenticated through medical record review. Participants were assigned randomly to 1.5 g/d of glucosamine (n = 101) or placebo (n = 104), of whom 108 completed the intervention (93 in each arm). The primary outcome measure was the pain subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version). Additional outcome measures included the physical function and stiffness subscales and overall score of the questionnaire, and analgesic use.

Results

There was no difference between treatment and control groups in terms of change in pain score (2.0 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.5 +/- 3.8, P = 0.41), stiffness (0.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 0.8 +/- 1.5, P = 0.52), physical function (5.2 +/- 9.5 vs. 4.6 +/- 9.6, P = 0.49), overall score (7.8 +/- 13.1 vs. 7.8 +/- 13.5, P = 0.81), and analgesic use (133 +/- 553 vs. -88 +/- 755, P = 0.12). Stratification by osteoarthritis severity, glucosamine product, and use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, as well as exclusion of opiate users, did not alter the results. The number and type of adverse events reported was similar between the groups.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that although glucosamine appears to be safe, it is no more effective than placebo in treating the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^066393c1]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Literature search

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL (from inception to June 2010) using a combination of keywords and text words related to osteoarthritis; these were combined with generic and trade names of the various preparations plus a validated filter for controlled clinical trials.We also retrieved reports citing relevant articles via Science Citation Index (1981-2008). In addition, we manually searched conference proceedings and text books, screened reference lists of all obtained papers, and contacted content experts.

Study selection

We included randomised trials with an average of at least 100 patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis per arm.Trials compared chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or the combination of any two with placebo or head to head. A sample size of 2×100 patients will yield more than 80% power to detect a small to moderate effect size of −0.40 at a two sided P=0.05, which corresponds to a difference of 1 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale between the experimental and control intervention. Two of four reviewers (BT, EN, SR, ST) evaluated reports independently for eligibility. They excluded trial arms with sub-therapeutic doses (<800 mg/day of chondroitin and <1500 mg/day of glucosamine, in accordance with doses licensed in Europe). Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^448f553b]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study characteristics

The 10 included trials had randomly allocated a total of 3803 patients to either of the experimental interventions or placebo. Figure 1 shows the network of interventions. Five trials (1104 randomised patients) compared glucosamine sulphate with placebo.In another placebo controlled trial (205 patients), the investigators were forced to change from glucosamine sulphate to glucosamine hydrochloride after 80% of the patients had been treated with glucosamine sulphate because the manufacturer of glucosamine sulphate declined to supply matching placebos.Three trials (1229 patients) compared chondroitin sulphate with placebo,and one trial (1265 patients) compared glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulphate, and their combination with placebo.Tables 1 and 2 show the characteristics of trials.

In eight trials, experimental preparations had undergone quality control to ensure adequate concentrations of glucosamine or chondroitin, and in two trialsit was unclear. The average age of patients was 58-66 (median 62), and the percentage of women ranged from 27% to 86% (median 68%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from a minimum of six months to more than 10 years. All treatments were administered on consecutive days in all trials. Duration of follow-up varied substantially between trials, from one monthto 36 months,and the number of follow-up visits from oneto 12(table 1).

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^e698803c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not result in a relevant reduction of joint pain nor affect joint space narrowing compared with placebo. Some patients, however, are convinced that these preparations are beneficial,which might be because of the natural course of osteoarthritis, regression to the mean, or the placebo effect.We are confident that neither of the preparations is dangerous. Therefore, we see no harm in having patients continue these preparations as long as they perceive a benefit and cover the costs of treatment themselves.Coverage of costs by health authorities or health insurers for these preparations and novel prescriptions to patients who have not received other treatments should be discouraged.

### Alternative therapies for traditional disease states: osteoarthritis [^6bc463f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Americans spend more on natural remedies for osteoarthritis than for any other medical condition. In treating osteoarthritis, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, two of the molecular building blocks found in articular cartilage, are the most commonly used alternative supplements. In randomized trials of variable quality, these compounds show efficacy in reducing symptoms, but neither has been shown to arrest progression of the disease or regenerate damaged cartilage. Although few clinical trials on S-adenosylmethionine exist, preliminary evidence indicates that it relieves pain to a degree similar to that of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but with fewer side effects. Clinical trials of dimethyl sulfoxide offer conflicting results. Neither ginger nor cetyl myristoleate has proven clinical usefulness.

### Nonsurgical management of knee pain in adults [^b379bfe9]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The role of the family physician in managing knee pain is expanding as recent literature supports nonsurgical management for many patients. Effective treatment depends on the etiology of knee pain. Oral analgesics-most commonly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen-are used initially in combination with physical therapy to manage the most typical causes of chronic knee pain. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends against glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation for osteoarthritis. In patients who are not candidates for surgery, opioid analgesics should be used only if conservative pharmacotherapy is ineffective. Exercise-based therapy is the foundation for treating knee osteoarthritis and patellofemoral pain syndrome. Weight loss should be encouraged for all patients with osteoarthritis and a body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2. Aside from stabilizing traumatic knee ligament and tendon tears, the effectiveness of knee braces for chronic knee pain is uncertain, and the use of braces should not replace physical therapy. Foot orthoses can be helpful for anterior knee pain. Corticosteroid injections are effective for short-term pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. The benefit of hyaluronic acid injections is controversial, and recommendations vary; recent systematic reviews do not support a clinically significant benefit. Small studies suggest that regenerative injections can improve pain and function in patients with chronic knee tendinopathies and osteoarthritis.

Medication selection and clinical considerations in osteoarthritis—for some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice, whereas for others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve. Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control, and clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm; there are controversies in interpretation of the evidence, particularly with regard to the use of glucosamine and chondroitin, acupuncture, and intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.

### Association of pharmacological treatments with long-term pain control in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^449f4201]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Even though osteoarthritis is a chronic and progressive disease, pharmacological agents are mainly studied over short-term periods, resulting in unclear recommendations for long-term disease management.

Objective

To search, review, and analyze long-term (≥12 months) outcomes (symptoms, joint structure) from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medications for knee osteoarthritis.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until June 30, 2018 (MEDLINE alerts through August 31, 2018) for RCTs of patients with knee osteoarthritis that had treatment and follow-up lasting 1 year or longer.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data at baseline and at the longest available treatment and follow-up of 12 months' duration or longer (or the change from baseline) were extracted. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was performed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in knee pain. Secondary outcomes were physical function and joint structure (the latter was measured radiologically as joint space narrowing). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and mean differences with 95% credibility intervals (95% CrIs) were calculated. Findings were interpreted as associations when the 95% CrIs excluded the null value.

Results

Forty-seven RCTs (22 037 patients; mean age range, mostly 55-70 years; and a higher mean proportion of women than men, around 70%) included the following medication categories: analgesics; antioxidants; bone-acting agents such as bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intra-articular injection medications such as hyaluronic acid and corticosteroids; symptomatic slow-acting drugs in osteoarthritis such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate; and putative disease-modifying agents such as cindunistat and sprifermin. Thirty-one interventions were studied for pain, 13 for physical function, and 16 for joint structure. Trial duration ranged from 1 to 4 years. Associations with decreases in pain were found for the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (SMD, -0.18 [95% CrI, -0.35 to -0.01]) and the symptomatic slow-acting drug in osteoarthritis glucosamine sulfate (SMD, -0.29 [95% CrI, -0.49 to -0.09]), but there was large uncertainty for all estimates vs placebo. The association with pain improvement remained significant only for glucosamine sulfate when data were analyzed using the mean difference on a scale from 0 to 100 and when trials at high risk of bias were excluded. Associations with improvement in joint space narrowing were found for glucosamine sulfate (SMD, -0.42 [95% CrI, -0.65 to -0.19]), chondroitin sulfate (SMD, -0.20 [95% CrI, -0.31 to -0.07]), and strontium ranelate (SMD, -0.20 [95% CrI, -0.36 to -0.05]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies of patients with knee osteoarthritis and at least 12 months of follow-up, there was uncertainty around the estimates of effect size for change in pain for all comparisons with placebo. Larger RCTs are needed to resolve the uncertainty around efficacy of medications for knee osteoarthritis.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^5c2e726a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Oral/dietary supplements for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis may be helpful in reducing pain and improving function, but the evidence is inconsistent/limited and additional research clarifying the efficacy of each supplement is needed; listed options are Turmeric, Ginger extract, Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and Vitamin D, and the Strength of Recommendation is Limited (downgrade). For glucosamine, included studies showed either improvement or no change in patient outcomes versus control; for chondroitin, included studies showed either improvement or no change in patient outcomes; for turmeric extract, a high quality study showed it could be used over control to improve adverse events, function, and pain; for ginger extract, included studies showed it may be used to improve pain, but there was no significant difference in function versus control; and for vitamin D, included studies showed either improvement or no significant difference in patient outcomes versus control. The oral/dietary supplements recommendation has been downgraded two levels because of inconsistency and need for additional clarity of efficacy, and the United States Food and Drug Administration does not hold dietary supplements to the same standards as prescription medication, so variability can exist between producers of dietary supplements.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^71cd044a]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the effect of glucosamine, chondroitin, or the two in combination on joint pain and on radiological progression of disease in osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.

Design Network meta-analysis. Direct comparisons within trials were combined with indirect evidence from other trials by using a Bayesian model that allowed the synthesis of multiple time points.

Main outcome measure Pain intensity. Secondary outcome was change in minimal width of joint space. The minimal clinically important difference between preparations and placebo was prespecified at −0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale.

Data sources Electronic databases and conference proceedings from inception to June 2009, expert contact, relevant websites.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Large scale randomised controlled trials in more than 200 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip that compared glucosamine, chondroitin, or their combination with placebo or head to head.

Results 10 trials in 3803 patients were included. On a 10 cm visual analogue scale the overall difference in pain intensity compared with placebo was −0.4 cm (95% credible interval −0.7 to −0.1 cm) for glucosamine, −0.3 cm (−0.7 to 0.0 cm) for chondroitin, and −0.5 cm (−0.9 to 0.0 cm) for the combination. For none of the estimates did the 95% credible intervals cross the boundary of the minimal clinically important difference. Industry independent trials showed smaller effects than commercially funded trials (P=0.02 for interaction). The differences in changes in minimal width of joint space were all minute, with 95% credible intervals overlapping zero.

Conclusions C ompared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce joint pain or have an impact on narrowing of joint space. Health authorities and health insurers should not cover the costs of these preparations, and new prescriptions to patients who have not received treatment should be discouraged.

### Long-term effects of glucosamine sulphate on osteoarthritis progression: a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^36674ff2]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment of osteoarthritis is usually limited to short-term symptom control. We assessed the effects of the specific drug glucosamine sulphate on the long-term progression of osteoarthritis joint structure changes and symptoms.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial, in which 212 patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned 1500 mg sulphate oral glucosamine or placebo once daily for 3 years. Weightbearing, anteroposterior radiographs of each knee in full extension were taken at enrolment and after 1 and 3 years. Mean joint-space width of the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint was assessed by digital image analysis, whereas minimum joint-space width--ie, at the narrowest point--was measured by visual inspection with a magnifying lens. Symptoms were scored by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index.

Findings

The 106 patients on placebo had a progressive joint-space narrowing, with a mean joint-space loss after 3 years of -0.31 mm (95% CI -0.48 to -0.13). There was no significant joint-space loss in the 106 patients on glucosamine sulphate: -0.06 mm (-0.22 to 0.09). Similar results were reported with minimum joint-space narrowing. As assessed by WOMAC scores, symptoms worsened slightly in patients on placebo compared with the improvement observed after treatment with glucosamine sulphate. There were no differences in safety or reasons for early withdrawal between the treatment and placebo groups.

Interpretation

The long-term combined structure-modifying and symptom-modifying effects of gluosamine sulphate suggest that it could be a disease modifying agent in osteoarthritis.

### Update of ACR guidelines for osteoarthritis: role of the coxibs [^5d5d8afd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recently provided an update to the guidelines published in 1995 on the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and hip. Members of the Ad Hoc Committee on OA Guidelines followed an evidence-based medicine approach to revise the guidelines by reviewing an extensive literature search of the Cochrane and Medline databases and published abstracts, and discussing evidence with expert rheumatologists. The goal of the guidelines is to provide recommendations to control patients' OA pain, improve function and health-related quality of life, and avoid therapeutic toxicity. As in the original guidelines, nonpharmacologic interventions involving patient education and physical measures are recommended following initial diagnosis of OA. The pharmacologic algorithm was updated to include currently available therapeutic agents. Acetaminophen remains first-line therapy because of its cost, efficacy, and safety profiles. Cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) have been included as an alternative to nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at risk for upper gastrointestinal adverse events. Tramadol is an available alternative for patients who have a contraindication to coxibs or nonselective NSAIDs or for those who have not responded to previous oral therapy. Intra-articular injections or topical therapy may be used as monotherapy, or as an adjunct to oral analgesia. Surgical treatment of OA remains a last resort for patients who have failed to respond to nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment approaches, and have progressive limitation in their activities of daily living. Several therapies for the prevention or treatment of OA are currently under investigation, including nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine and chondroitin, disease-modifying OA drugs, and devices, such as acupuncture and electromagnetic therapy. It is anticipated that the guidelines for the management of OA will continue to evolve as new therapies become available.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^cb2f0045]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of glucosamine, chondroitin, or the two in combination on joint pain and on radiological progression of disease in osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. Design Network meta-analysis. Direct comparisons within trials were combined with indirect evidence from other trials by using a Bayesian model that allowed the synthesis of multiple time points.

Main Outcome Measure

Pain intensity. Secondary outcome was change in minimal width of joint space. The minimal clinically important difference between preparations and placebo was prespecified at -0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale.

Data Sources

Electronic databases and conference proceedings from inception to June 2009, expert contact, relevant websites. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Large scale randomised controlled trials in more than 200 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip that compared glucosamine, chondroitin, or their combination with placebo or head to head. Results 10 trials in 3803 patients were included. On a 10 cm visual analogue scale the overall difference in pain intensity compared with placebo was -0.4 cm (95% credible interval -0.7 to -0.1 cm) for glucosamine, -0.3 cm (-0.7 to 0.0 cm) for chondroitin, and -0.5 cm (-0.9 to 0.0 cm) for the combination. For none of the estimates did the 95% credible intervals cross the boundary of the minimal clinically important difference. Industry independent trials showed smaller effects than commercially funded trials (P=0.02 for interaction). The differences in changes in minimal width of joint space were all minute, with 95% credible intervals overlapping zero. Conclusions Compared with placebo, glucosamine, chondroitin, and their combination do not reduce joint pain or have an impact on narrowing of joint space. Health authorities and health insurers should not cover the costs of these preparations, and new prescriptions to patients who have not received treatment should be discouraged.

Figure 3 shows the results from stratified analyses. Estimates comparing supplements with placebo depended to some extent on the quality of the trials, the presence or absence of quality control measures for preparations, the type of study joint, and the type of glucosamine salt used, but tests for interaction were all negative for these variables (P≥0.20 for interaction). The estimated differences between supplements and placebo, however, were, on average, 0.5 cm (0.1 to 0.9 cm) less pronounced in industry independent trials compared with industry sponsored trials (P=0.02 for interaction).

Effects on radiological joint space

Six trials reported changes in width of joint space.The network meta-analysis of differences in changes in minimal joint space narrowing at the end of the treatment period showed minute effects for all preparations compared with placebo. The difference was −0.2 mm (−0.3 to 0.0 mm) in favour of glucosamine, −0.1 mm (−0.3 to 0.1 mm) in favour of chondroitin, and 0.0 mm (−0.2 to 0.2 mm) for the combination, which corresponded to effect sizes of −0.16 (−0.25 to 0.0), −0.08 (−0.25 to 0.08), and 0.00 (−0.16 to 0.16). Heterogeneity between trials was low (τ 2 =0.02), there was no evidence for inconsistency (inconsistency factor −0.1 mm, −0.6 to 0.4 mm; P=0.54), and the goodness of fit of the model to the data was excellent.

### Dietary supplements for treating osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^49536986]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements for patients with osteoarthritis.

Design

An intervention systematic review with random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched from inception to April 2017.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing oral supplements with placebo for hand, hip or knee osteoarthritis.

Results

Of 20 supplements investigated in 69 eligible studies, 7 (collagen hydrolysate, passion fruit peel extract, Curcuma longa extract, Boswellia serrata extract, curcumin, pycnogenol and L-carnitine) demonstrated large (effect size >0.80) and clinically important effects for pain reduction at short term. Another six (undenatured type II collagen, avocado soybean unsaponifiables, methylsulfonylmethane, diacerein, glucosamine and chondroitin) revealed statistically significant improvements on pain, but were of unclear clinical importance. Only green-lipped mussel extract and undenatured type II collagen had clinically important effects on pain at medium term. No supplements were identified with clinically important effects on pain reduction at long term. Similar results were found for physical function. Chondroitin demonstrated statistically significant, but not clinically important structural improvement (effect size -0.30, -0.42 to -0.17). There were no differences between supplements and placebo for safety outcomes, except for diacerein. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation suggested a wide range of quality evidence from very low to high.

Conclusions

The overall analysis including all trials showed that supplements provided moderate and clinically meaningful treatment effects on pain and function in patients with hand, hip or knee osteoarthritis at short term, although the quality of evidence was very low. Some supplements with a limited number of studies and participants suggested large treatment effects, while widely used supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin were either ineffective or showed small and arguably clinically unimportant treatment effects. Supplements had no clinically important effects on pain and function at medium-term and long-term follow-ups.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel low-dose water-dispersible turmeric extract in the management of knee osteoarthritis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^4e5057fd]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Knee osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent form of OA, is a degenerative joint disease of the knee that typically results from wear and tear and progressive loss of articular cartilage. According to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classification, knee OA is classified as unilateral or bilateral primary knee OA, unilateral or bilateral post-traumatic knee OA, and other unilateral or bilateral secondary knee OA.Clinically, it is characterized by progressive worsening of symptoms such as pain, inflammation, stiffness-related discomfort, and reduced mobility over the course of the disease. If left untreated, the disease can advance, potentially resulting in disability and impaired quality of life (QoL).According to the latest Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) report, approximately 7.6% of the global population was diagnosed with OA in 2020. Knee OA was a major contributor to this global burden, affecting 4307 individuals per 100,000 population. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the prevalence of knee OA will increase by 74.9% from 2020 to 2050, indicating a substantial increase in the disease burden that will pose a critical challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.

Given that knee pain is the central cause of disability in patients with OA and adversely affects their functional abilities and QoL, the primary goal of treatment is to alleviate the intensity of knee pain.Among the currently available management strategies including pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical interventions, pharmacological treatments (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], acetaminophen, naproxen, selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor, glucosamine, capsaicin, steroids, etc) are the most commonly used.Despite various advancements in the available management strategies over the past few decades, no cure exists for knee OA; treatments primarily aim to delay disease progression.In particular, due to the safety concerns associated with the long-term use of these pharmacological treatments, there is growing interest in exploring safer natural therapies. In the past decade, supplementation with nutraceuticals for the management of OA has gained attention owing to their promising role in alleviating pain, inflammation, oxidative stress, and joint discomfort while also promoting cartilage formation.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^179ae30c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses

Our network meta-analysis integrated evidence from direct and indirect comparisons while fully preserving randomisation. It enabled us to simultaneously analyse effect sizes reported at different follow-up times in a single model and to estimate the overall effect of preparations irrespective of the duration of follow-up while fully accounting for potential variation across time points and for the correlation of estimates within a trial. Consequently, estimates in our analysis were more precise than the pairwise meta-analyses or the network meta-analysis with only pain intensity at the end of follow-up (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

We performed an extensive literature search,which makes it unlikely that we missed any relevant trial. Trial selection and data extraction including quality assessment were done independently by two authors to minimise bias and transcription errors.Components used for quality assessment are validated and reported to be associated with bias.In line with our pre-specified inclusion criteria, the trials in our network were large and of satisfactory methodological quality.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^3a04d203]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Glucosamine, Prescription/Over-the-Counter

Glucosamine is an amino sugar naturally produced in the human body. It is required for the synthesis of glucoproteins, glyocolipids, and glucosaminoglycans found in the tendons, ligaments, cartilage, synovial fluid, mucous membranes, eye structures, blood vessels, and heart valves. It can also be derived from marine exoskeletons or produced synthetically. Glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride are delivered orally for many MSK conditions such as temporomandibular disorder, joint pain, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and back pain. Both are also commonly combined with each other or other products (e.g. chondroitin sulfate, N-acetyl glucosamine).

Controversy surrounds the reported effectiveness of glucosamine ; however, a Cochrane review recently confirmed that a particular glucosamine sulfate product (Dona, Rotta Pharmaceuticals), as opposed to other formulations, was effective in reducing osteoarthritic pain.

Conditional recommendations were made (62.5% weak; 37.5% strong, in favor) for the use of prescription patented Crystalized Glucosamine Sulfate (pCGS) at daily doses of 1,500 mg for pain and related symptoms. It is important to note that the controversy concerning the use of glucosamine sulfate and combination products containing glucosamine largely reflects the differing regulatory status, labeling, and availability of medications in separate countries and regions of the world. Hence, to date it appears that pCGS, as supplied by RottaPharm, is the only product with a well-documented pharmacological effect.

There is moderate overall quality and certainty that this product will produce a statistically significant effect in reducing pain (SMD = –0.27) compared with placebo. pCGS appears to be well-tolerated, as associated undesirable effects (e.g. mild gastrointestinal complaints) are small to trivial. Although pCGS shows similar effects to ibuprofen, it does take longer to obtain a response. Members mostly agreed that the cost would be negligible to even a moderate savings compared with other active ingredients for pain relief. Moreover, they concurred that it would likely justify out-of-pocket expenses and be both acceptable to stakeholders and feasible/suitable to implement, provided that any implemented supplement had the same purity levels as the pCGS ingredients, as in the RottaPharm product.

ACR/Arthritis Foundation osteoarthritis guideline—evidence review scope and limitations note a focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with systematic reviews of observational studies included when they added critical information such as adverse effects not seen in shorter-duration RCTs; important RCT limitations considered included possible publication bias, inadequate blinding, and inadequate provision of active comparators and appropriate sham alternatives, and short-duration RCTs cannot provide adequate prognostic information in OA where processes are slowly progressive over decades; the review focused on management options available in the US and on pharmacologic agents available in pharmaceutical-grade formulations, eliminating most nutraceuticals, was limited to the English-language literature, and examined www.clinicaltrials.gov for phase 2 and 3 trials that might become US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved by publication; a hierarchy of outcome measures assessing pain and function in OA was developed based on the published literature.

### Nutritional factors and osteoarthritis: recent developments [^b4ea71ec]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of nutrition and nutritional supplements in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is now a topic of considerable public, industry, and academic interest. This review focuses on how the evidence for a role of nutritional factors or nutritional supplements in the management of knee osteoarthritis has been changed by recent research.

Recent Findings

Recent studies include clinical trials of weight loss and exercise as interventions for osteoarthritis of the knee, the elucidation of mechanisms of oxidative stress on the chondrocyte genome, further study of vitamin C supplementation in an animal with spontaneous osteoarthritis, and further clinical and pharmacodynamic evaluations of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. Perplexing findings among these studies include the deleterious effects of vitamin C on osteoarthritis in the Hartley guinea pig, the low levels of glucosamine achieved in serum after an oral dose, recent negative clinical studies of glucosamine, and the heterogeneity of results among glucosamine trials.

Summary

With an intensification of research in this field come new clinical and basic science data, sometimes with surprising results. These confirm the considerable potential for a role of nutritional interventions for osteoarthritis, but they emphasize the need for systematic scientific evaluation of the claims made for such products.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^7a3e8b6f]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Effects on joint pain

All trials contributed to the network meta-analysis of pain related outcomes (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Figure 2presents pooled estimates across different time points. The variation across time points was not over and above what would be expected by chance (τ 2 =0.04 for variation across time points on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, P=0.93 for interaction between treatment effect and time). The overall difference in pain intensity versus placebo based on a summary of all time points was −0.4 cm (95% credible interval −0.7 to −0.1 cm) on a 10 cm visual analogue scale for glucosamine, −0.3 cm (−0.7 to 0.0 cm) for chondroitin, and −0.5 cm (−0.9 to 0.0 cm) for the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin. Corresponding effect sizes were −0.17 (−0.28 to −0.05) for glucosamine, −0.13 (−0.27 to 0.00) for chondroitin, and −0.19 (−0.37 to 0.00) for the combination. Heterogeneity between trials was low (τ 2 =0.04 for heterogeneity between trials on a 10 cm visual analogue scale), there was no evidence for inconsistency (inconsistency factor 0.2 cm, −0.7 to 1.1, P=0.63), and the goodness of fit of the model to the data was excellent (data available on request). Results from the primary network meta-analysis were concordant with a model including a linear term for time, conventional meta-analyses of direct comparisons, a network meta-analysis, which included only one time point for pain intensity at the end of follow-up, and an analysis with a different prior distribution for the heterogeneity between trials (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

### Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines from six professional societies: similarities and differences [^1f52ef2e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the high prevalence and burden of osteoarthritis (OA) worldwide, management of OA continues to primarily focus on symptom management due to the lack of approved pharmacologic agents that halt disease progression. Recent recommendations from 6 professional societies support the importance of education, self-management approaches, weight loss, and physical modalities in managing OA. These recent guidelines also highlight the paucity of effective and safe treatment options, with recommendations against ineffective therapies outnumbering those for effective ones. NSAIDs, oral and topical, remain the primary recommended pharmacologic management option for OA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^43ed20de]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis—dietary supplements and nutraceuticals evidence and recommendation—Many of these dietary supplements demonstrated a small benefit in pain and function in the short-term, but equivalence with placebo long-term; short follow-up times were insufficient to determine long-term adverse events, and evidence from an SR suggested the risk of adverse GI events was higher in the chondroitin group compared to placebo while other studies did not indicate a significant difference between groups for adverse events. This is a Reviewed, New-replaced recommendation; the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence, and the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of evidence was very low due to significant limitations including small study sizes and heterogeneity of dosing and follow-up times, with some studies industry-funded. Given the low potential for adverse events with most supplements and that many studies reported an improvement in pain and function, the Work Group determined the benefits slightly outweighed the harms, but the risk of adverse events or outcomes from potential drug-supplement interactions needs to be considered in individual patients; thus, the Work Group decided upon a “Neither for nor against” recommendation, noting that research is lacking in methodological rigor and protocol implementation, that more rigorous regulation is required, and that further research is needed into long-term side effect profiles for patients with knee and hip OA.

American College of Rheumatology/Arthritis Foundation guideline—oral/systemic pharmacologic agents for osteoarthritis: Bisphosphonates are strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA), and the preponderance of data shows no improvement in pain or functional outcomes. Glucosamine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA; the weight of the evidence indicates a lack of efficacy of glucosamine, though some patients exposed to glucosamine may show elevations in serum glucose levels. Chondroitin sulfate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA as are combination products that include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, but is conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA, with a single trial suggesting analgesic efficacy without evidence of harm in hand OA. Hydroxychloroquine is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, with well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in erosive hand OA demonstrating no efficacy. Methotrexate is strongly recommended against in patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA, and well-designed RCTs in erosive hand OA have demonstrated no efficacy.

Oral analgesics

Paracetamol was included as a treatment arm in three conference abstracts (unclear RoB) and one cross-over trial (high RoB), in various dosages and for different duration.Three trials intended paracetamol to be the control group. One trial (unclear RoB) included a placebo arm, and reports no between-group difference in pain or morning stiffness.Paracetamol was not superior to any of the active comparators.

Oral NSAIDs lead to moderate improvements in pain and function compared with no intervention,placeboand other active interventions (glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate,paracetamol).

Nutraceuticals

The effectiveness of chondroitin sulfate was studied in two papers. One trial (low RoB) focused on clinical outcomes after 6 months, reporting beneficial effects on pain and function compared with placebo.The other study (high RoB) assessed structural outcomes in two long-term trials (published in one paper), assessing chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin polysulphate.Only for chondroitin polysulphate, a preparation not commercially available, less erosive damage after 3 years was reported and not for chondroitin sulfate. The trials did not report higher risk of sAEs in the intervention groups.

Glucosamine is reported to have beneficial effects on pain and function after 6 weeks in an RCT (unclear RoB) published as conference abstract (no raw data provided).

Diacerhein was not better than placebo for pain relief or any of the other secondary outcomes in a study (unclear RoB) of Korean patients with hand OA, while more (mild) AEs were reported in the intervention group, especially discoloration of urine (88% vs 20%) and abdominal pain (31% vs 14%), but remarkably not diarrhoea (21% vs 20%).

### Potential effects of chondroitin sulfate on joint swelling: a GAIT report [^6431568d]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

The Glucosamine/chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT) was a randomized double-blind placebo and active comparator (celecoxib) controlled trial of 1583 persons with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee(1). Patients randomized to celecoxib had significant improvement in knee pain compared to those randomized to placebo. No statistically significant improvement in knee pain compared to placebo was seen among patients randomized to the dietary supplements, although a subset of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain at entry who were assigned to the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate did seem to experience some improvement. Additionally, patients taking chondroitin sulfate were noted to have a statistically significant improvement in knee joint swelling. An exploratory post hoc analysis of GAIT patients suggested the effect of chondroitin sulfate on joint swelling occurred more often in patients with milder pain and lower Kellgren-Lawrence Grade at entry.

### Non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis: comparison of ESCEO and OARSI 2019 guidelines [^2737ac9e]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous disease associated with substantial effects on quality of life, and its clinical management is difficult. Among the several available guidelines for the management of knee OA, those from OARSI and ESCEO were updated in 2019. Here, we examine the similarities and differences between these two guidelines and provide a narrative to help guide health-care providers through the complexities of non-surgical management of knee OA. OARSI and ESCEO both recommend education, structured exercise and weight loss as core treatments, topical NSAIDs as first-line treatments and oral NSAIDs and intra-articular injections for persistent pain. Low-dose, short-term acetaminophen, pharmaceutical grade glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are recommended by ESCEO whereas OARSI strongly recommends against their use (including all glucosamine and chondroitin formulations). Despite this difference, the two guidelines are consistent in the majority of their recommendations and provide useful treatment recommendations for individuals with OA and health-care providers.

### The efficacy and safety of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs for knee and hip osteoarthritis-a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^f63ea2f4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is common and burdensome for patients and health care systems. Our study purpose was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of DMOADs in adults with knee and hip osteoarthritis.

Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge without language, publication, or date restrictions from inception through November 2018 for randomized controlled trials assessing 12 classes of DMOADs with at least 12 months of follow-up. Therapeutic effects were evaluated with pairwise and network meta-analysis. Outcomes included pain, function, minimum joint space width or cartilage volume, radiographic progression, and total joint replacement. Analyses were also performed for drug safety.

Results

Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials with 11,890 patients were included. Glucosamine and chondroitin minimally improved both structure (minimum joint width or cartilage volume: network results: glucosamine: SMD 0.16; 95% CI [0.04, 0.28], chondroitin: SMD 0.21 [0.10, 0.32]) and symptoms (glucosamine: pain: - 0.15 [- 0.25, - 0.05]; function: - 0.17 [- 0.28, - 0.07], chondroitin: pain: - 0.06 [- 0.15, 0.03], and function: - 0.15 [- 0.26, - 0.03]). Strontium demonstrated improvement in structure (minimum joint width or cartilage volume: 0.20 [0.02, 0.38]), and vitamin D on symptoms (pain: - 0.15 [- 0.27, -0.03]; function: - 0.18 [- 0.31, - 0.06]). Although doxycycline also demonstrated a favorable efficacy ranking, its safety profile was poor (withdrawal: network relative risk 1.69 [1.03, 2.75]). The therapeutic effects of other medications were not ranked as highly.

Discussion

Glucosamine and chondroitin yielded statistically significant but clinically questionable long-term benefit on structure and symptoms, though both had favorable safety profiles. Strontium improved structure, and vitamin D improved symptoms. Although doxycycline had a favorable efficacy ranking, its safety profile was poor. None of the 12 classes of drugs appears to have long-term clinically significant benefit.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^2556199c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Outcome measures

The prespecified primary outcome was absolute pain intensity reported in any of nine time windows organised in increments of three months (up to 3 months, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 months, and 22 months or more). If more than one time point was reported in a window, we extracted data nearest to the longest follow-up time included in that window; for the window covering 22 months or more, we extracted the follow-up closest to 24 months. When an article provided data on more than one pain scale, we referred to a previously described hierarchy of pain related outcomes and extracted the outcome that was highest on this list.Global pain took precedence over pain on walking and pain subscores on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) arthritis index. If a trial report provided data on both—for example, global pain scores and WOMAC pain subscores—we recorded only data on global pain scores. Secondary outcomes were changes in the minimum radiographic joint space between baseline and the end of treatment, the number of individuals withdrawn or who dropped out because of an adverse event, and the number of patients experiencing any adverse event.

Quality assessment

Two of the four reviewers independently assessed concealment of allocation, blinding, and adequacy of analyses.Concealment of allocation was considered adequate if the investigators responsible for the selection of patients did not know before allocation which treatment was next in line (central randomisation, sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered assignment envelopes, coded drug packs, etc). Any procedures based on predictable generation of allocation sequences, and potentially transparent attempts to conceal allocation, such as non-opaque envelopes, were considered inadequate. We extracted the number of patients initially randomised and the number of patients analysed per group at each time point to distinguish between trials that had included all randomised patients in the analysis (intention to treat analysis) and trials that had not. Finally, we determined whether experimental preparations had undergone quality control—that is, if either a formally approved preparation was used or pharmacological laboratory analysis confirmed the content of the preparation. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data collection

Two of the four reviewers used a standardised form to extract in duplicate data on publication status, trial design, patients’ characteristics, treatment regimens, outcome modalities, and funding. Results of pain, joint space narrowing, and adverse events were extracted by one reviewer (ST) and cross checked by another (PJ). When necessary, means and measures of dispersion were approximated from figures in the reports.

### Glucosamine treatment for osteoarthritis-AAFP (...) [^7f6a49db]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer This review 1 shows that, compared with placebo, glucosamine sulfate produces a moderate, clinically significant reduction in pain and improvement in function for patients with osteoarthritis. However, study results were not consistent. Most studies in the review used preparations of glucosamine sulfate marketed in Europe by Rotta pharmaceutical company. Subgroup analysis showed that the Rotta preparation had benefit over placebo, whereas non-Rotta preparations did not. Glucosamine does not cause more side effects than placebo.

2000. 3 That review of 16 studies demonstrated that patients who took 1, 500 mg of glucosamine sulfate per day for six weeks had a 60 percent improvement from baseline in pain and a 33 percent improvement in function.

3 The update, 1 which included only the higher quality studies and eight new studies, showed less consistent and somewhat less favorable results regarding improvement in pain and function with use of glucosamine sulfate for two to three months.
1. The safety profile of glucosamine is superior to that of NSAIDs and similar to placebo. In one study, 6 88 percent of patients had no adverse effects; in the remaining patients, the majority of side effects were gastrointestinal and resolved on discontinuation of glucosamine. Concerns have been raised about whether glucosamine causes abnormal glucose metabolism, asthma, hypersensitivity, or arteriosclerosis; there is no evidence to support these concerns. Collectively, the 20 analyzed RCTs found glucosamine favored placebo with a 28 percent improvement in pain and a 21 percent improvement in function using the Lequesne index. In the four RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared with an NSAID, glucosamine was superior in two and equivalent in two. Two RCTs using the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was able to slow radiologic progression of osteoarthritis of the knee over a three-year period.

### Combined treatment with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate shows No superiority over placebo for reduction of joint pain and functional impairment in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a six-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^2a11ca19]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and glucosamine sulfate (GS) compared to placebo in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 164 patients with Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or grade 3 radiographic knee OA and moderate-to-severe knee pain (mean±SD global pain score 62.1±11.3 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS]). Patients were randomized to receive either combined treatment with CS (1,200 mg) plus GS (1,500 mg) or placebo in a single oral daily dose for 6 months. The mean change from baseline in the VAS global pain score was set as the primary end point. Secondary outcomes included the mean change in the investigator's global assessment of disease activity, total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), pain and function subscale scores on the WOMAC, responder rates based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 response criteria, and rescue medication use. Adverse events were also recorded. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board was instituted to ensure patient safety and data accuracy.

Results

Intriguingly, in the modified intent‐to‐treat (mITT) population, CS/GS combination therapy was inferior to placebo in the reduction of joint pain (mean ± SEM change in VAS global pain score over 6 months −11.8 ± 2.4 mm [19% reduction] in patients receiving CS plus GS versus −20.5 ± 2.4 mm [33% reduction] in patients receiving placebo; peak between‐group difference in global pain score at 6 months 8.7 mm [14.2%], P < 0.03), but no between‐group differences were seen in the per‐protocol completers. Both placebo treatment and CS/GS combination treatment improved to a similar extent the total WOMAC score as well as the pain and function WOMAC subscale scores, both in the mITT population and in the per-protocol completers. Neither the OMERACT-OARSI responder rate nor the frequency of rescue medication use differed between the treatment groups. Severe adverse events were uncommon and equally distributed.

Conclusion

The results of this trial demonstrate a lack of superiority of CS/GS combination therapy over placebo in terms of reducing joint pain and functional impairment in patients with symptomatic knee OA over 6 months. Further research might fully elucidate the suitability of CS/GS combination therapy in patients with OA.

### Glucosamine sulfate reduces osteoarthritis progression in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis: evidence from two 3-year studies [^b335b82e]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of glucosamine sulfate on long-term symptoms and structure progression in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

This study consisted of a preplanned combination of two three-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective, independent studies evaluating the effect of glucosamine sulfate on symptoms and structure modification in OA and post-hoc analysis of the results obtained in postmenopausal women with knee OA. Minimal joint space width was assessed at baseline and after 3 years from standing anteroposterior knee radiographs. Symptoms were scored by the algo-functional WOMAC index at baseline and after 3 years. All primary statistical analyses were performed in intention-to-treat, comparing joint space width and WOMAC changes between groups by ANOVA.

Results

Of 414 participants randomized in the two studies, 319 were postmenopausal women. At baseline, glucosamine sulfate and placebo groups were comparable for demographic and disease characteristics, both in the general population and in the postmenopausal women subset. After 3 years, postmenopausal participants in the glucosamine sulfate group showed no joint space narrowing [joint space change of +0.003 mm (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.11)], whereas participants in the placebo group experienced a narrowing of -0.33 mm (95% CI, -0.44 to -0.22; P < 0.0001 between the two groups). Percent changes after 3 years in the WOMAC index showed an improvement in the glucosamine sulfate group [-14.1% (95%, -22.2 to -5.9)] and a trend for worsening in the placebo group (5.4% (95% CI, -4.9 to 15.7) (P = 0.003 between the two groups).

Conclusion

This analysis, focusing on a large cohort of postmenopausal women, demonstrated for the first time that a pharmacological intervention for OA has a disease-modifying effect in this particular population, the most frequently affected by knee OA.

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of microvascular complications among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a prospective cohort study in UK biobank [^591b5028]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

In this large prospective study of patients with type 2 diabetes, we found that habitual use of glucosamine, a commonly used supplement for the treatment of osteoarthritis and joint pain, was associated with lower risks of composite microvascular complications and diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that glucosamine could be considered as part of a comprehensive management strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Integrating glucosamine into patient care may help reduce the risk of microvascular complications, thereby improving overall health outcomes. However, further research is needed to explore the biological mechanisms underlying these associations and to establish causality through randomized controlled trials. Additionally, examining the long-term effects of glucosamine in diverse populations will provide a robust evidence base for clinical guidelines and public health policies aimed at managing diabetes and its complications effectively.

### Glucosamine / chondroitin combined with exercise for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: a preliminary study [^65b51a8c]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This preliminary study sought to determine whether using 1500/1200mg of glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate (GH/CS) is effective, both separately and combined with exercise, compared to a placebo plus exercise program in improving physical function, pain, strength, balance, and mobility in older adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial lasted 12 months. Participants included 89 older adults (age>/=50 years) with knee OA randomized to either GH/CS or placebo group. Phase I was a 6-month trial comparing the effects of assignment to either GH/CS or placebo. Phase II added 6 months of exercise for both groups. The primary outcome measure was Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function, and secondary outcome measures included WOMAC pain, 6-min walk, balance, and knee strength.

Results

Of the 89 randomized participants, 72 (81%) completed the study. The median pill compliance was 94% and 95% in Phase I, and, in Phase II, 97% and 91% for the GH/CS and placebo groups, respectively. Median exercise compliance during Phase II was 77% for the GH/CS group and 78% for the placebo group. WOMAC function and pain did not differ significantly between the groups at 6- or 12-month follow-up. There were also no significant differences between the groups in 6-min walk or knee strength; however, balance was better in the placebo group with approximately a 10% difference compared to the GH/CS group.

Conclusions

The GH/CS group was not superior to the placebo group in function, pain, or mobility after both phases of the intervention (pill only and pill plus exercise).

### The effect of glucosamine supplementation on people experiencing regular knee pain [^8b854383]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of oral glucosamine supplementation on the functional ability and degree of pain felt by individuals who had regular knee pain, most likely due to previous articular cartilage damage, and possibly osteoarthritis.

Methods

Subjects were randomly supplemented with either glucosamine (G) (n=24) or placebo (P) (lactose) (n=22) for 12 weeks at a dose of 2,000 mg per day. Over this period, four testing sessions were conducted, with changes in knee pain and function assessed by clinical and functional tests, (joint line palpation, a 3 metre "duck walk" and a repeated, walking stair climb), two questionnaires (the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Knee Pain Scale (KPS)) and participant subjective evaluations.

Results

The clinical and functional test scores improved with time (main effects: p<0.05, p<0.01) but there were no significant differences between the two groups. The questionnaire results also recorded a significant main effect for time (p<0.05), but the glucosamine group was found to have significantly better KOOS quality of life scores at week eight and 12 (p<0.05), and lower KPS scores (p<0.05) at week eight than the placebo group. On self report evaluations of changes across the 12 week supplementation period, 88% (n=21) of the glucosamine group reported some degree of improvement in their knee pain versus only 17% (n=3) in the placebo group.

Conclusions

These results suggest that glucosamine supplementation can provide some degree of pain relief and improved function in persons who experience regular knee pain, which may be caused by prior cartilage injury and/or osteoarthritis. The trends in the results also suggest that, at a dosage of 2,000 mg per day, the majority of improvements are present after eight weeks.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^e9bcc9e1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline—dietary supplements for mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee emphasizes that the patient's medications should be evaluated for potential drug-supplement interactions prior to initiating any dietary supplement. Improvement in the predictability of the treatment effect for specific dietary supplements will either reduce an unnecessary out-of-pocket expense or provide patients with a relatively safe method for reducing pain and improving function in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee, and knowing which supplements have evidence-based support will reduce unnecessary out-of-pocket expenses while offering a safe method for reducing pain and improving function. Dietary supplements are typically an out-of-pocket expense not covered by medical insurance, so patients must individually consider the expense, and the guideline states it did not have the analysis to comment on the cost-benefit ratio of dietary supplements compared to other over the counter or prescription medications. Acceptability is limited by the limited evidence supporting dietary supplements and out-of-pocket expense, though for patients without a medication interaction, dietary supplements pose limited physical harm as it is typically difficult to consume a toxic quantity, and therefore it is believed to be an acceptable means to potentially achieve benefit in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. Feasibility is supported by wide availability, but the associated out-of-pocket expense is the primary barrier to access. Future research should include multiple investigations demonstrating reproducible results illustrating the effectiveness of dietary supplements and determine the appropriate dose, frequency, and duration of treatment with dietary supplements.

### Hip pain and mobility deficits-hip osteoarthritis: revision 2017 [^897c7df3]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis—alternative/complementary medication: The guideline notes “some evidence to support the short-term use of injectable viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid into the hip joint of patients with hip OA,” yet also that “a recent published meta-analysis suggests the benefit of hyaluronan for the treatment of hip OA, but so far it is only approved by the Federal Drug Administration for the knee. More controlled studies are needed to show its effectiveness.” An evidence update reports that Rozendaal et al “studied 222 patients… treated with glucosamine or placebo once daily for 2 years,” with “no differences… after 2 years in joint space on radiographs or in WOMAC physical function score,” while a meta-analysis by Wandel et al found “pain was not improved, nor did glucosamine have an effect on joint space narrowing.” It further states, “The efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronic acid in treating hip OA has still not been established in high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs),” and the 2017 summary concludes, “There is insufficient evidence to support the use of supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, hyaluronic acid (injectable), or similar substances for the treatment of hip OA.”

### Argument against use of food additives for osteoarthritis of the hip [^0adf1c41]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2000). Low credibility.

Food additives and other forms of alternative medicines have been embraced by the general public. Some of these compounds including glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have shown efficacy in relieving pain associated with osteoarthritis. However, evidence is limited concerning the chondroprotective ability of these agents. More controlled studies and basic research is necessary to evaluate these claims especially because these compounds are not under regulatory control.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^230fdee0]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

As with conventional meta-analyses, some will argue that we have not compared like with like. Our model, however, was based on relative treatment effects (differences between groups expressed as effect sizes), and variations in patients’ characteristics between trials are fully accounted for in the analysis by maintaining randomised comparisons within each trial. Network meta-analysis makes similar assumptions to standard meta-analysis of direct comparisons within trials but requires that these assumptions hold over the entire set of trials in the network—that is, for the indirect comparisons also. In addition, our model assumes that relative treatment effects comparing two interventions in different trials are from the same common distribution. The smaller the heterogeneity between trials, and the smaller the inconsistency between direct randomised comparisons and indirect comparisons, the more likely these assumptions hold. The heterogeneity between trials in our analysis was near zero and the upper credible interval for the τ 2 estimate was 0.24 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (the maximum τ of the underlying distribution of treatment effects compatible with the credible interval would be 0.5 cm). In addition, we investigated potential sources of variation in the network by including characteristics of trials as covariates in the analysis of the primary outcome. Taken together, results of these analyses make it likely that relative treatment effects originate from one common distribution and confirm one of our key assumptions. As with heterogeneity between trials, inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was also near zero (inconsistency factor 0.2 cm). Although we cannot rule out clinically relevant inconsistency (the upper credible interval for the inconsistency factor crossed the pre-specified threshold for a clinically relevant effect at 0.9 cm), we have no indication that clinical characteristics of included patients or other trial characteristics confounded the indirect comparisons. The use of different instruments to measure joint pain made it necessary to calculate effect sizes as a common measure of effectiveness to ensure comparability between outcomes assessed with different instruments. Poor correlation or differences in responsiveness of different instruments could be a potential threat to the validity of results.The scales used in the component trials of our network (10 cm visual analogue scale and WOMAC pain subscales), however, were highly correlated and have comparable responsiveness.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^9085c9f0]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Implications

We believe it unlikely that future trials will show a clinically relevant benefit of any of the evaluated preparations. Some will argue, however, that many patients included in the trials of our network were too ill in radiological terms to benefit and that their advanced radiological stage meant that the subtotal to total cartilage damage could not be influenced any more by the experimental preparations. Others will argue that many patients were not ill enough in clinical terms and that their small amount of experienced pain meant that they could not benefit from the analgesic effects of the preparations.To address these concerns, in addition to the trials by Clegg et al,Rozendaal et al,and McAlindon et al,some might consider the necessity for a fourth industry independent trial, which would exclusively include patients with an experienced pain intensity at baseline of at least 4 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale and moderate osteoarthritis, corresponding to a Kellgren and Lawrence score of 2.Inclusion of 150 to 200 patients in each comparison group would yield more than 90% power to detect a minimal clinically relevant difference of −0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale for any of these preparations compared with placebo at a conventional two sided α level of 5%. The trial should use coded drug packs with preparations and placebos of identical appearance and taste to conceal treatment allocation and ensure blinding of patients and care givers, carefully control and monitor analgesic cointerventions, and fully adhere to the principle of intention to treat by the inclusion of all patients in the analysis in the groups to which they were originally allocated. The evaluated preparations should have undergone thorough quality control to ensure appropriate concentrations of chondroitin and glucosamine sulphate. The industry independent randomised Long Term Evaluation of Glucosamine Sulphate Study (LEGS) will probably satisfy most of these criteria.It allocated 600 patients to one of four treatment arms— chondroitin sulphate, glucosamine sulphate, their combination, or matching placebo—and closed recruitment in October 2009. First results will become available at the earliest in November 2011 (M Fransen, personal communication).

### Association of habitual glucosamine use with risk of cardiovascular disease: prospective study in UK biobank [^bbdb7055]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Glucosamine is a non-vitamin, non-mineral supplement widely used to relieve osteoarthritis and joint pain.Glucosamine is closely regulated in most European countries, where it is only sold with a prescription. However, in other countries such as the United States and Australia, it is a popular dietary supplement and approximately 20% of adults consume it daily.

The effectiveness of glucosamine in patients with osteoarthritis and joint pain continues to be debated.Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that glucosamine could have a role in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD)and reducing mortality.A previous animal study reported that glucosamine extended life span by mimicking a low carbohydrate diet,and studies in humans have consistently shown the protective effect of a low carbohydrate diet on the development of CVD.Other animal studies have reported that the anti-inflammatory properties of glucosamine might have a preventive role in atherosclerosis development.

In this prospective cohort study, we examined the association between habitual glucosamine supplement use and risk of CVD events (CVD death, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke) in nearly half a million adults in the UK Biobank. We also analyzed potential effect modification by other known risk factors for CVD.

### Evidence-based opinions from multidisciplinary experts on use of naturopathic herbal remedies in pain management [^751c20aa]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results and Discussion

Joint and Muscle Pain

Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability and joint pain worldwide.As a complex and multifactorial degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis is primarily a disease of the articular cartilage that causes local inflammation and mechanical changes. Nutrition and dietary supplementation have been shown to have meaningful effects on the disease.

Curcumin is a popular treatment option for joint pain/muscle pain due to its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.These effects are well supported by clinical evidence including a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis, which, although based on a small number of RCTs, concluded that turmeric extract is effective in managing pain from osteoarthritis.Boswellia has been investigated in a few recent clinical trials that have reported conflicting results.A recent meta-analysisfound that boswellia and its extracts may be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis. Use of fish oils in osteoarthritis has been widely studied; however, a meta-analysis has noted the low-to-moderate quality of current supporting evidence.

Experts who attended the 2021 panel discussion reported that 5–30% of their patients were seeking non-medicated pain relief from osteoarthritic joint pain. A higher percentage of patients reportedly sought non-medicated solutions for joint and muscle pain in the Middle East (50–90%) compared with Singapore/Malaysia (10–20%) and Australia (5–10%).

In 2020 experts responded to a pre-meeting survey question on their top 3 naturopathic solutions used to treat joint pain. Curcumin and fish oil were both strongly recommended, with each receiving 7 votes, followed by magnesium and boswellia (2 votes each). Glucosamine, palmitoylethanolamide with nattokinase, and ginger root also received 1 vote each. During the meeting, the experts voted for curcumin (5 of 7 experts) and ginger root (1 of 7 experts) as their preferred naturopathic remedies for joint pain.

Echinacea (Echinacea Angustafolia and Echinacea Purpurea)

Echinacea angustafolia and purpurea, two species of purple cone flower, have been used to treat cold symptoms and upper respiratory infections. Two prominent studies, one investigating Echinacea purpurea published in December 2003 and one investigating Echinacea angustafolia published in July 2005, showed no benefit in treatment and prevention of colds.The only significant side effects were an allergic rash in children. These studies were mentioned in 39 and 55 news stories respectively. US annual sales of all echinacea products exceeded $200 million in 2000 and 2001. From 2003 to 2004, sales dropped modestly from $177 million to $153 million (down 14%). Sales between 2004 and 2005 reached a plateau and then dropped further in 2006 from $154 to $129 million (down 16%). These modest declines were not significant, suggesting no substantial immediate impact of the research on sales.

Saw Palmetto

The ripe fruit of the saw palmetto plant (serenoa repens) is used to treat urinary symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).The largest US study to date published in February 2006 reported that while well tolerated, saw palmetto was no better than placebo in improving symptoms of BPH.US annual sales of saw palmetto peaked in 2003 at $145 million. This study was mentioned 45 times in news stories around the time of publication. Annual sales dropped only slightly from $137 to $134 million between 2005 and 2006 (down 2.5%).

Glucosamine and Chondroitin

Supplemental glucosamine alone or taken in combination with chondroitin has gained popularity for treating symptoms of osteoarthritis. In February 2006, results from a large federally funded trialshowed that glucosamine alone or in combination with chondroitin did not improve symptoms of osteoarthritis more than placebo. However, a pre-planned secondary analysis suggested that the glucosamine/chondroitin combination was more beneficial than placebo in a subgroup with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis. There were no serious adverse events reported. This study was mentioned in 58 news stories around the time of publication. After publication of the study sales did not substantially change.

### Adjuvant therapies for management of hemorrhagic shock: a narrative review [^920d2b9a]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Use in humans

Dietary supplementation with Glucosamine has long been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis with great tolerance, even in the long-term. However, its clinical effect in this indication is still controversial, though some trials have shown an improvement in painful symptoms, and even in radiological symptoms. All of these clinical trials used daily doses of glucosamine, the most common being 1500 mg/day in three doses for adults, which is lower than the amounts used experimentally to achieve a therapeutic effect in HS. Nevertheless, clinical toxicity studies conducted in humans with high doses of glucosamine (30–300 mg/kg in 6 h) have shown that glucosamine is well tolerated; it does not destabilize carbohydrate metabolism at high doses. This paves the way for clinical trials with higher doses of glucosamine.

Another means of acting on O-GlcNAcylation levels are OGA inhibitors. By reducing the activity of the enzyme that removes the GlcNAc moiety from proteins, OGA inhibitors increase proteins O-GlcNAcylation levels. These molecules are used experimentally both in vitro and in vivo. The molecules most commonly used in preclinical studies have not been tested in humans. Recently, however, new molecules have been developed and tested in humans. One of the most promising compounds is MK-8719, an OGA inhibitor with very high specificity developed by Selnick et al. It is currently being studied for tauopathies and has entered a phase 1 trial in humans. Still in favor of the therapeutic potential of O-GlcNAcylation in tauopathies, another group has developed an OGA-inhibiting molecule (LY3372689) that is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 trial in humans because its safety profile was shown to be acceptable in phase 1 clinical studies. These data raise hopes for clinical trials in fields other than neurodegenerative pathologies, and especially in severe trauma and HS.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (Table 5)

Table 5 
Summary of histone deacetylase inhibitors testing in hemorrhagic shock models

Biological rationale

Histones are nuclear proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. Acetylation of the lysine residues on histones relaxes the chromatin, making the DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Conversely, hypoacetylation condenses chromatin and makes gene expression more difficult. This hypoacetylation of histone proteins is mediated by histone deacetylase in HS. Histone deacetylase inhibitors counteract this phenomenon and facilitate transcription dynamics, enabling the activation of mechanisms that promote cell survival. There are 18 histone deacetylase isoforms in humans with different actions in different tissues. Some inhibitors are class-specific, whereas others are nonspecific and act on several classes of histone deacetylase.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^3ec43b77]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Five trials reported on adverse events,all 10 reported withdrawals or drop-outs because of adverse events, and three reported serious adverse events.The odds ratios of adverse events compared with placebo were 0.94 (0.59 to 1.47) for glucosamine and 0.99 (0.49 to 2.00) for chondroitin; no data were available on adverse events overall for the combination. The odds ratios for withdrawals or drop-outs because of adverse events were 0.99 (0.61 to 1.50) for glucosamine, 0.92 (0.56 to 1.51) for chondroitin, and 0.90 (0.43 to 1.85) for the combination. Heterogeneity between trials was low for both outcomes, with τ 2 of 0.02 and 0.03, respectively. We could estimate inconsistency only for drop-outs because of adverse events, with some evidence of inconsistency (ratio of relative risks 0.54, 0.19 to 1.46, P=0.22 for inconsistency).

### Meta-analysis: chondroitin for osteoarthritis of the knee or hip [^ec2dde77]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses described moderate to large benefits of chondroitin in patients with osteoarthritis. However, recent large-scale trials did not find evidence of an effect.

Purpose

To determine the effects of chondroitin on pain in patients with osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

The authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1970 to 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1980 to 2006), CINAHL (1970 to 2006), and conference proceedings; checked reference lists; and contacted authors. The last update of searches was performed on 30 November 2006.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they were randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled trials that compared chondroitin with placebo or with no treatment in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. There were no language restrictions.

Data Extraction

The authors extracted data in duplicate. Effect sizes were calculated from the differences in means of pain-related outcomes between treatment and control groups at the end of the trial, divided by the pooled SD. Trials were combined by using random-effects meta-analysis.

Data Synthesis

20 trials (3846 patients) contributed to the meta-analysis, which revealed a high degree of heterogeneity among the trials (I2 = 92%). Small trials, trials with unclear concealment of allocation, and trials that were not analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle showed larger effects in favor of chondroitin than did the remaining trials. When the authors restricted the analysis to the 3 trials with large sample sizes and an intention-to-treat analysis, 40% of patients were included. This resulted in an effect size of -0.03 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.07; I2 = 0%) and corresponded to a difference of 0.6 mm on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. A meta-analysis of 12 trials showed a pooled relative risk of 0.99 (CI, 0.76 to 1.31) for any adverse event.

Limitations

For 9 trials, the authors had to use approximations to calculate effect sizes. Trial quality was generally low, heterogeneity among the trials made initial interpretation of results difficult, and exploring sources of heterogeneity in meta-regression and stratified analyses may be unreliable.

Conclusions

Large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.

### A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of a topical cream containing glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and camphor for osteoarthritis of the knee [^c1365d8a]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the ability of a topical preparation of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate to reduce pain related to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Methods

Sixty-three patients were randomized to receive either a topical glucosamine and chondroitin preparation or placebo to be used as required over an 8 week period. Efficacy was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain as well as the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the SF-36 questionnaire.

Results

VAS scores indicated a greater mean reduction in pain for the glucosamine/chondroitin preparation group (mean change -3.4 cm, SD 2.6 cm) compared to the placebo group (mean change -1.6 cm, SD 2.7 cm) after 8 weeks. After 4 weeks the difference between active and placebo groups in their mean reduction from baseline was 1.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 2.4, p = 0.03) and after 8 weeks was 1.8 (95% CI for difference between groups, 0.6 to 2.9 cm; p = 0.002).

Conclusion

Topical application of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate is effective in relieving the pain from OA of the knee and improvement is evident within 4 weeks.

### Supplementary methods in the nonsurgical treatment of osteoarthritis [^412a5886]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article discusses current evidence in nutraceuticals and viscosupplementation uses in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment.

Methods

A search was carried out to identify systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, review articles, and original articles (PubMed and Cochrane Database) about nutraceuticals and viscosupplementation. The keywords used were nutraceuticals, glucosamine, chondroitin, diacerein, avocado, soybean unsaponifiables, nutraceuticals, and viscosupplementation, independently or combined with the terms "review" and "randomized."

Results

Glucosamine hydrochloride has no effect on pain management, although the sulfate formulation has a moderate effect. Diacerein leads to pain relief, with a superior carryover effect when compared with placebo. Avocado and soybean unsaponifiables may have positive effects on knee and hip OA, but long-term results could not be confirmed. Despite the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons' recommendation against the use of hyaluronic acid in OA, some systematic reviews found some benefits in the knee.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that nutraceuticals or viscosupplementation influences OA's natural progression. However, some of these agents seem to reduce pain and improve function.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of studies with Level I through Level IV evidence.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^4fe1d219]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We used an extension of multivariable Bayesian hierarchical random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons with minimally informative prior distributions.It fully preserves the comparison of randomised treatments within each trial while combining all available comparisons between treatments and accounts for multiple comparisons within a trial when there are more than two treatment arms.For the analysis of effect sizes of pain, the model included random effects at the level of trials and time points. It accounted for the correlation of outcome data reported at different time points within a trial and allowed the estimation of the variance of treatment effects between trials (τ 2). Effect sizes were calculated by dividing the differences in mean values between treatment groups in a time window by the median pooled standard deviation (SD) observed across all time points in a trial.If SDs were not provided, we calculated them from standard errors or confidence intervals as described elsewhere.An effect size of −0.20 SD units suggests an overlap in the distributions of reported pain scores in the experimental group with pain scores in placebo group in 85% and can be considered a small difference between experimental and control group.An effect size of −0.50 indicates an overlap in about 67% and can be considered a moderate difference, whereas −0.80 suggests an overlap in 53% and is considered a large difference.

To allow intuitive interpretation of pooled effects, we back transformed effect sizes to differences on a 10 cm visual analogue scale on the basis of a median pooled SD of 2.5 cm found in large scale osteoarthritis trials that assessed pain on a 10 cm visual analogue scale.We prespecified a minimal clinically important difference of 0.37 SD units, corresponding to 0.9 cm on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. This was based on the median minimal clinically important difference found in recent studies in patients with osteoarthritis.As the analysis of changes of minimum radiographic joint space did not include multiple time points, the model used for this outcome included only a random effect at the level of trials. To achieve comparability of the magnitude of effects on joint space and on pain and distinguish between small, moderate, and large treatment effects, we expressed differences in the width of the joint space as effect sizes, dividing the pooled estimates in millimetres by the median pooled SD of 1.2 mm found in included trials.

Relation to other studies

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses on glucosamine and chondroitin have been published.The three most recent ones were by Vlad et alon glucosamine, Reichenbach et alon chondroitin, and Lee et alon radiographic outcomes of both preparations. Vlad and colleagues analysed 15 trials comparing glucosamine with placebo.They found a pooled effect size of −0.35 (95% confidence interval −0.56 to −0.14) in favour of glucosamine, but there was substantial heterogeneity. Trials with adequate concealment of allocation, industry independent trials, and trials evaluating glucosamine hydrochloride showed less beneficial effects and less pronounced heterogeneity between trials than the remainder. The authors concluded that glucosamine hydrochloride is ineffective but could not exclude the possibility of a clinically relevant effect of glucosamine sulphate. Reichenbach and colleagues found large heterogeneity among 20 chondroitin trials, which could be explained by a lack of concealment of allocation, failure to perform an intention to treat analysis, and small sample sizes.The initial pooled effect size of −0.75 (−0.99 to −0.50) in favour of chondroitin sulphate diminished to zero when the analysis was restricted to methodologically sound trials of adequate sample size. Both groups had analysed only one time point per trial, which was criticised.Lee and colleagues included six trials evaluating the effects of chondroitin or glucosamine on narrowing of joint space (four were included in our analysis and we excluded two because of small sample size).They found significant small to moderate protective effects. They did not, however, include the GAIT trial.We included methodologically superior large scale patient blinded trials in more than 200 patients in our network meta-analysis and used a statistical model that allowed the simultaneous analysis and summary of treatment effects observed at multiple time points. Addressing earlier concerns about time dependency of effects,quality control of preparations,and differences between different formulations of glucosamine,we conclude that there is no evidence for time dependent effects, that the lack of a clinically relevant effect of these preparations is not related to a lack of quality control, and that the lack of a clinically relevant effect is also apparent for glucosamine sulphate. With the summary of multiple time points and the combination of direct comparisons within trials between preparations with indirect evidence from other trials, these conclusions are based on considerably more high quality evidence than the previous restricted analyses of trials considered least biased by Vlad et al and Reichenbach et al.

Finally, we performed pairwise meta-analyses with random effects at the level of trials and time points, as well as a simpler network meta-analysis including only one treatment effect per trial (absolute pain intensity at the longest follow-up available). Convergence of Markov chains was deemed to be achieved if plots of the Gelman-Rubin statistics indicated that widths of pooled runs and individual runs stabilised around the same value and their ratio around one.Accordingly, all analyses are based on 150 000 iterations, of which the first 50 000 were discarded as burn-in period. We used Stata (Stata Statistical Software: release 10; StataCorp LP 2005, College Station, TX) and WinBUGS (version 1.4; MRC Biostatistics Unit 2007, Cambridge, UK) for all analyses.

### Effect of E-PR-01 on activity-induced acute knee joint discomfort in healthy individuals: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study [^95a37b67]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Joint pain is traditionally considered as disease of old age however in recent times more young adults are said to suffer from such discomfort. The major reason for joint pain is obesity, repetitive movements and inflammatory conditions. In individuals with high physical activity levels, the chondrocytes gradually start declining reactivity to growth factors leading to altered structure and decreased functional ability in collagen to accommodate stress.Generally such individuals resort to fast-acting pain relief medications, which often have unpleasant side effects. Several safer alternatives, such as nutraceuticals, are available in the market to improve joint health, including collagen supplements, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, methylsulfonylmethane, vitamin D, and likewise. These supplements help reduce joint discomfort by reducing inflammation or protecting the cartilage in the joints. However, their onset of action is slow, and the research into these supplements has produced mixed results in terms of effect size due to several methodological issues.Numerous clinical studies have supported the efficacy of herbal or plant-based ingredients in managing joint discomfort.However, most of them have been studied for their effect on chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, while very few, like Curcumin, Capsaicin, and Ginger, have been studied for their role in acute pain conditions.This situation has created a need for an evidence-based fast-acting alternative for managing joint discomfort and thereby improving physical activity. Enovate Biolife has formulated a proprietary blend containing extracts of Vitex negundo leaves and Zingiber officinale rhizome to fill the gap of a safe and fast-acting pain-relieving alternative that any group of individuals can use without fearing the side effects. It has been hypothesized that this blend will have potent pain relieving effect as compared to the individual ingredients as different phytochemical tend to provide synergistic effect.

Pharmacological interventions

Table 3 presents an overview of the characteristics and RoB of the 33 trials of the most relevant pharmacological interventions to inform the 2018 update of the EULAR management recommendations for hand OA. Trials not listed in table 3 studied topical capsaicin (n=1), topical salicylates (n=2), paracetamol (n=4), glucosamine (n=1), diacerhein (n=1), different herbal formulations (n=3), anti-interleukin-1 (n=1), clodronate (n=1), several types of periarticular injections (n=3), intra-articular hyaluronic acid (n=9), other intra-articular therapies (n=2), folate/cobalamin supplementation (n=1), apremilast (n=1), galactosaminoglycuronglycan sulfate (n=1), and pregabalin and duloxetine (n=1). A description can be found in online supplementary tables (3.2.2, 3.2.4, 3.2.6, 3.2.10, 3.2.12, 3.2.15, 3.2.17, 3.2.22).

Table 3 
Characteristics of studies of main pharmacological interventions (n=33 studies)

The longest trial lasted up to 3 years, though most trials had a duration of 3 weeks. Most studies focused on clinical outcomes, while structure modification was the primary outcome of two trials.The majority were RCTs (n=30), and few were set-up as CCTs (n=1) or cross-over trials (n=2). Seven trials specifically included participants with signs of 'inflammatory OA', all investigating anti-inflammatory agents (ie, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids and anti-TNF).Compared with non-pharmacological interventions, less studies were small (n≤60; 15 trials, 45%). Twelve studies (36%) were at low RoB. Reason to judge studies to be at high or unclear RoB was most often due to problems with randomisation or blinding, and for six studies only a conference abstract was available thus RoB remained unclear. The detailed RoB assessment is presented in online supplementary (3.2.1–3.2.23).

### Dietary ingredients requiring further research before evidence-based recommendations can Be made for their use as an approach to mitigating pain [^b52b7120]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The US military is exposed to extreme demands of physical training and combat missions and, as a result, may develop musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. Such injuries are a leading cause of pain, medical encounters, lost duty time, and disability. The challenges associated with pain are not only recognized by the military but are also a major public health concern in the United States. Due to the complex nature of pain, our understanding of and approaches to pain management may be variable and may or may not be aligned with the patient’s or practitioner’s perspectives. In addition, advice on what approaches to invest in may or may not be evidence-based.

Pain management options primarily consist of medications (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), injections, physical therapy, acupuncture, and other modalities. Dietary ingredients are currently marketed for a wide range of pain conditions, including joint pain, osteoarthritis, chronic gout, and gastrointestinal disorders. In fact, research shows that about 70–74% of the general adult population and 55–76% of Service members use dietary supplements. Despite their popularity, evidence surrounding their safety and efficacy is still unclear. Further, although evidence-based research is meant to inform appropriate and safe decisions about supplement use, decisions to use such supplements are often driven by information that is not evidence-based (e.g. advice from peers, family members, and other sources).

### Outcome measures in placebo-controlled trials of osteoarthritis: responsiveness to treatment effects in the REPORT database [^d043a7fd]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment response in randomized clinical trials (RCT) of osteoarthritis (OA) has been assessed by multiple primary and secondary outcomes, including pain, function, patient and clinician global measures of status and response to treatment, and various composite and responder measures. Identifying outcome measures with greater responsiveness to treatment is important to increase the assay sensitivity of RCTs.

Objective

To assess and compare the responsiveness of different outcome measures used in placebo-controlled RCTs of OA.

Search Strategy

The Resource for Evaluating Procedures and Outcomes of Randomized Trials database includes placebo-controlled clinical trials of pharmacologic treatments (oral, topical, or transdermal) for OA identified from a systematic literature search of RCTs published or publicly available before August 5, 2009, which was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane collaboration, publicly-available websites, and reference lists of retrieved publications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data collected included: (1) pain assessed with single-item ratings and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale; (2) patient and clinician global measures of status, improvement, and treatment response; (3) function assessed by the WOMAC function subscale; (4) stiffness assessed by the WOMAC stiffness subscale; and (5) the WOMAC and Lequesne Algofunctional Index composite outcomes. Measures were grouped according to the total number of response categories (i.e., <10 categories or ≥10 categories). The treatment effect (difference in mean change from baseline between the placebo and active therapy arms) and standardized effect size (SES) were estimated for each measure in a meta-analysis using a random effects model.

Results

There were 125 RCTs with data to compute the treatment effect for at least one measure; the majority evaluated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by opioids, glucosamine and/or chondroitin, and acetaminophen. In general, the patient-reported pain outcome measures had comparable responsiveness to treatment as shown by the estimates of treatment effects and SES. Treatment effects and SESs were generally higher for patient-reported global measures compared with clinician-rated global measures but generally similar for the WOMAC and Lequesne composite measures.

Conclusions

Comparing different outcome measures using meta-analysis and selecting those that have the greatest ability to identify efficacious treatments may increase the efficiency of clinical trials of treatments for OA. Improvements in the quality of the reporting of clinical trial results are needed to facilitate meta-analyses to evaluate the responsiveness of outcome measures and to also address other issues related to assay sensitivity.

### Effects of glucosamine, chondroitin, or placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee: network meta-analysis [^7b0f0a4a]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Whenever possible, we used results of intention to treat analysis including all randomised patients.Pooled effect sizes were estimated from the median of the posterior distribution. A negative effect size indicates a benefit of the experimental intervention. Corresponding 95% credible intervals were estimated from the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the posterior distribution.In the presence of minimally informative priors, credible intervals can be interpreted in a similar way to conventional confidence intervals. To determine whether the variation of treatment effects over time was over and above what would be expected by chance, we calculated a P value for heterogeneity across time points of follow-up.The P value was derived from the proportion of observations of the posterior distribution of the variance observed across time points within trials smaller than or equal to the variance within trials typically found in large osteoarthritis trials (0.01 for an effect size scale, 0.0625 for a 10 cm visual analogue scale).

To explore possible time trends, we included a linear term for time as a covariate in the analyses. We then included characteristics of the trials as covariates in the network meta-analysis to estimate effects according to concealment of allocation; intention to treat analysis; high methodological quality defined as adequate concealment of allocation, adequate blinding of patients, and the presence of an intention to treat analysis; source of funding (industry independent v other); type of glucosamine used (sulphate v hydrochlorides); quality control of preparations; and type of joint affected (knee v hip). P values for interaction between trial characteristics and treatment effect were derived from the posterior distribution of covariates and can be interpreted in the same way as a traditional P value for interaction.

Heterogeneity between trials was estimated from the median variance between trials (τ²) observed in the posterior distribution with the following prior distributions: a gamma distribution for heterogeneity between trials (1/τ² ∼ gamma(0.001,0.001)I(0,2000)), and a uniform distribution for heterogeneity between time points (τ ∼ unif(0,50)). In a sensitivity analysis we also used a uniform prior for the heterogeneity between trials. The consistency of the network was determined by use of inconsistency factors: the estimated difference between the effect size from direct comparisons within randomised trials and the effect size from indirect comparisons between randomised trials with one intervention in common.Estimates of variation and consistency are based on back transformations to differences on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Goodness of ﬁt was assessed with Q-Q plots.
