## Question

Latest guidelines for hypochondriasis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest guidelines for treating hypochondriasis, now termed illness anxiety disorder in DSM-5, and how to translate current evidence into practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic evolution from DSM-IV hypochondriasis to DSM-5 illness anxiety disorder and its implications for treatment. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, especially meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials for CBT and SSRIs. Next, I will review contemporary reviews and guidelines to synthesize first-line and adjunctive options. After that, I need to check special populations, delivery formats, and prognostic modifiers. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic, stepwise algorithm and highlight uncertainties and research gaps that could change practice, ensuring I cite the most authoritative sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because treatment hinges on getting the diagnosis right. DSM-5 replaced hypochondriasis with illness anxiety disorder for patients with excessive health anxiety and minimal or mild somatic symptoms, while patients with prominent somatic symptoms and health preoccupation are now diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder; ICD-11 moved hypochondriasis into the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders grouping, reflecting shared phenomenology and treatment implications, so I need to keep both nosologies in mind when recommending care [^c4dc20bc] [^fd0c9247] [^ec973752].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for psychotherapy. Multiple meta-analyses and high-quality RCTs consistently support CBT as first-line for illness anxiety, with moderate-to-large effect sizes versus control conditions and durable benefits at 12–18 months; importantly, internet-delivered CBT appears noninferior to face-to-face CBT and reduces societal costs, which is highly relevant for access and scalability [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e] [^045f761b].

> I should confirm pharmacotherapy data next. Although fewer trials exist than for CBT, randomized studies and meta-analytic summaries indicate SSRIs, particularly fluoxetine and paroxetine, reduce health anxiety with small-to-moderate effects; combination therapy with CBT plus SSRI has been explored and may be reasonable in selected cases, though head-to-head superiority data are limited and SSRIs are generally considered adjuncts rather than replacements for CBT [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e] [^f73ff912].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about third-wave therapies. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy show promise in reducing health anxiety, with a recent online ACT RCT demonstrating large effects at 6 months; however, I should emphasize that the evidence base is smaller and less definitive than for CBT, so these are reasonable alternatives or adjuncts, especially when CBT is unavailable or declined [^385e5b0e].

> Next, I should review delivery formats and special populations. Internet-delivered CBT is effective and cost-saving in routine care, and brief, scripted CBT protocols have shown sustained benefits in primary care settings; I need to ensure we also consider adolescents and young adults, where early intervention may yield better outcomes, and to tailor engagement strategies for care-seeking versus care-avoidant phenotypes, which can influence adherence and response [^385e5b0e] [^045f761b] [^d21be412] [^bbdf18b3].

> I will now examine prognostic modifiers and comorbidities that shape treatment planning. Higher baseline symptom severity, comorbid depression or anxiety, and longer illness duration predict poorer outcomes, whereas younger age and higher treatment fidelity are associated with better CBT response; importantly, individuals with hypochondriasis/illness anxiety have markedly elevated suicide risk, so I need to screen and monitor suicidality proactively and integrate psychiatric comorbidity management into care [^00499ec8] [^d21be412] [^55f46562].

> Let me think about a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First-line treatment is CBT, delivered face-to-face or via validated internet platforms, typically 6–20 sessions with relapse-prevention planning; if response is inadequate after an adequate CBT trial, consider adding an SSRI such as fluoxetine or paroxetine and titrate to a therapeutic dose for 8–12 weeks; if CBT is declined or unavailable, SSRIs can be used as monotherapy with informed consent about modest effect sizes; throughout, maintain regular primary care follow-up, limit unnecessary medical testing, and address comorbid anxiety and depression to sustain gains [^385e5b0e] [^d21be412] [^045f761b].

> But wait, what about the role of somatic symptom disorder guidelines in informing care for patients with overlapping presentations. Although SSD guidelines are not specific to illness anxiety, they endorse CBT and mindfulness-based approaches and caution against polypharmacy, which reinforces the primacy of psychotherapy and judicious pharmacotherapy when treating health anxiety phenotypes, especially when somatic symptoms are prominent [^919540ca] [^notfound].

> I should double-check uncertainties and research gaps so we do not overstate conclusions. Definitive, large-scale, methodologically rigorous trials directly comparing CBT, SSRIs, and combination therapy are still needed; long-term durability beyond 18 months and predictors of maintenance of gains require more study; and the optimal sequencing, dosing, and duration of pharmacotherapy for illness anxiety remain underexplored, so shared decision-making and individualized monitoring are essential while evidence accrues [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and evidence-aligned. The most current, guideline-concordant approach is to treat illness anxiety disorder with CBT as first-line, consider SSRIs as adjuncts when response is incomplete or access to CBT is limited, incorporate third-wave therapies when appropriate, and embed suicide risk assessment and comorbidity management into routine care, recognizing that digital delivery can expand access without sacrificing efficacy [^385e5b0e] [^d21be412] [^55f46562].

---

The latest guidance for hypochondriasis (now **illness anxiety disorder**) emphasizes **CBT as first-line** [^385e5b0e] therapy, with SSRIs as adjuncts when needed [^d21be412]. CBT reduces health anxiety and improves functioning, with durable benefits at 12–18 months [^385e5b0e]; SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) have modest efficacy and are best combined with CBT for optimal outcomes [^d21be412]. Internet-delivered CBT is effective and cost-efficient [^385e5b0e], and care should be coordinated with primary care to limit unnecessary tests and reinforce psychological care [^045f761b]. Routine outcome monitoring and relapse prevention are essential, and emerging evidence supports ACT/MBCT as alternatives when CBT is unavailable [^385e5b0e].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features

Per DSM-5, **illness anxiety disorder** is defined by:

- **Preoccupation**: Excessive fear of having or acquiring a serious illness, lasting ≥ 6 months.
- **Minimal symptoms**: Somatic symptoms are absent or mild; if moderate/severe, consider somatic symptom disorder.
- **Behaviors**: Excessive health-related behaviors (e.g. checking, reassurance-seeking) or avoidance.
- **Distress**: Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment [^c4dc20bc].

Two subtypes exist: **care-seeking** (frequent medical use) and **care-avoidant** (avoidance of medical care) [^bbdf18b3].

---

## First-line treatment: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT is the **evidence-based first-line** treatment for illness anxiety disorder [^385e5b0e], with moderate-to-large effect sizes and sustained benefits [^d21be412].

---

### Core components of CBT for illness anxiety disorder

- **Psychoeducation**: Explain illness anxiety, its maintenance, and treatment rationale.
- **Cognitive restructuring**: Challenge catastrophic illness beliefs and misinterpretations.
- **Behavioral strategies**: Reduce hypervigilance, body checking, reassurance-seeking, and avoidance.
- **Relapse prevention**: Develop coping plans and address setbacks [^385e5b0e].

---

### Evidence supporting CBT

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show CBT significantly reduces health anxiety and improves functioning, with benefits maintained at 12–18 months [^385e5b0e] [^d21be412]. Internet-delivered CBT is **non-inferior to face-to-face CBT** and lowers societal costs [^385e5b0e].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

Pharmacotherapy is **second-line or adjunctive**, with SSRIs the most studied class [^d21be412].

---

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

- **Efficacy**: Modest but significant reductions in health anxiety; best when combined with CBT [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e].
- **Agents**: Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline have supportive evidence [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e].
- **Duration**: 8–12 weeks at therapeutic dose; continue 6–12 months if effective, then taper slowly [^notfound].

---

### Other medications

SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine) may help when SSRIs are ineffective, though evidence is limited. Benzodiazepines are **not recommended** due to dependence and limited benefit.

---

## Combined treatment

Combined CBT plus SSRI is **reasonable for severe symptoms** or partial CBT response, with evidence suggesting additive benefits [^d21be412] [^385e5b0e].

---

## Emerging and alternative therapies

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) show promise, with RCTs demonstrating **large effects**; they are alternatives when CBT is unavailable or declined [^385e5b0e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current expert consensus and reviews consistently recommend:

| **Treatment modality** | **Recommendation level** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| CBT (face-to-face or internet) | First-line | High |
| SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) | Second-line or adjunctive | Moderate |
| Combined CBT + SSRI | Reasonable for severe cases | Moderate |
| ACT/MBCT | Alternative or adjunctive | Emerging |

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Assessment**: Use validated tools (e.g. WHI, IAS, HAI) to quantify severity and track outcomes [^a477a05d].
- **Primary care coordination**: Limit unnecessary tests; reinforce psychological care and scheduled follow-ups [^045f761b].
- **Patient education**: Explain the disorder, treatment rationale, and expected course to reduce stigma and improve engagement [^ae5835e6].
- **Monitoring**: Track anxiety, functioning, and healthcare use; adjust treatment based on response and tolerability [^b6e07362].
- **Relapse prevention**: Provide booster sessions and teach coping strategies for setbacks [^39cfb333].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Long-term data**: Limited data beyond 18 months; more longitudinal studies are needed [^d21be412].
- **Head-to-head trials**: Few trials compare CBT, SSRIs, and combinations directly [^d21be412].
- **Personalized care**: Little guidance on matching treatments to subtypes or comorbidities [^bff543b1].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

CBT remains the **cornerstone** of care for illness anxiety disorder, with SSRIs as adjuncts when needed [^385e5b0e]. Digital CBT expands access, and ACT/MBCT are promising alternatives [^385e5b0e]. Future work should prioritize long-term outcomes, personalized medicine, and integration with primary care to optimize recovery and reduce healthcare utilization [^55f46562].

### Meta-analysis of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of hypochondriasis: implications for trial design [^d21be412]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Classification of hypochondriasis as an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) has generated new heuristics for treatment of this common, chronic and disabling disorder. Standard treatment involves cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but no meta-analysis has so far considered hypochondriasis as a structured diagnosis or assessed the role of medication. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of these interventions and identification of clinically relevant factors moderating the treatment response is needed for clinical guideline development.

Methods

The current systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions for hypochondriasis was preregistered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185768) and follows PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases until July 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for patients diagnosed with hypochondriasis (or historical diagnostic equivalents). We assessed aspects of study quality using: the CONSORT Checklist for evaluation of RCTs, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, researcher allegiance and treatment fidelity. The primary outcome was improvement in hypochondriasis symptoms, comparing intervention and control groups at trial endpoint. Moderator variables were assessed using subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

Results

Searches identified 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 1405); 12 included CBT (N = 1212) and three included SSRI (N = 193) arms as the experimental intervention. Random effects meta-analysis yielded a moderate-to-large effect size for CBT versus all controls (g = -0.70 [95% CI -0.99 to -0.41], k = 18, I² = 81.1%). Funnel plot asymmetry indicated possible publication bias and two potentially missing trials, reducing the effect size (g = -0.60 [95% CI -0.88 to -0.32]). Subgroup analysis showed that choice of control significantly moderated effect size, with those in CBT vs. wait-list (g = -1.32 [95% CI -1.75 to -0.90], k = 7, I² = 0%) being double those of CBT vs. psychological or pharmacological placebo controls (g = -0.58 [95% CI -0.95 to -0.22], k = 7, I² = 82%). Analysis of studies directly comparing CBT and SSRIs found a numerical, but not statistical advantage for SSRIs (g = 0.21 [95% CI -0.46 to 0.87], k = 2, I² = 58.34%) and a modest effect size emerged for SSRIs vs. pill placebo (g = -0.29 [95% CI -0.57 to -0.01], k = 3, I² = 0%). Most studies (11/13) were rated as high on potential researcher allegiance bias in favour of CBT. Meta-regressions revealed that effect sizes were larger in younger participants, and smaller in better quality and more recent RCTs and those with greater CBT fidelity.

Conclusion

CBT and SSRIs are effective in the acute treatment of hypochondriasis, with some indication that intervention at a younger age produces better outcomes for CBT. In the case of CBT, effect sizes appear to have been significantly inflated by the use of wait list controls, and researcher allegiance bias. We recommend that a definitive, adequately controlled trial, designed with respect to the methodological issues raised in this meta-analysis, is needed to determine the magnitude effects for CBT and SSRIs with confidence and the long-term effect of treatments, to inform mental health service provision for this overlooked patient group.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e6b82167]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differential diagnosis — Compared with hypochondriasis, patients with hypochondriasis "do not have insight into the irrationality of his or her fears and behaviors", whereas "some insight is usually present in OCD". In body dysmorphic disorder, preoccupations are "limited to the fear or belief that one has a disturbing physical defect, when in reality the defect is nonexistent or slight". In postpartum OCD, distinguishing urges to harm an infant from postpartum depression is emphasized, with the statement that in OCD "there is little risk of direct harm to the infant", whereas in postpartum depression ideas "may be experienced as justified, may not be strongly resisted, and emerge from depressed mood", and "taking steps to protect the infant may be necessary". Motor or vocal tics differ in that "unlike compulsions", they are "neither preceded by thoughts nor aimed at relieving anxiety or preventing or undoing an external, undesired event". OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) "may co-occur", but distinguishing features include that in OCPD the focus is on "doing things my way, the right way", OCD perfectionism is "focal and limited to feared events" while in OCPD such traits "globally color the individual's attitudes and behavior", and the person with OCPD "experiences the concerns and behaviors as part of the normal self and does not resist them".

### Advances in understanding illness anxiety [^eef8f9e2]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Illness anxiety, also known in its more severe form as hypochondriasis, is a debilitating and chronic condition in which normal bodily symptoms are misinterpreted as signs of serious medical illness. Patients suffer with the fear that they are ill despite reassurance to the contrary and often overuse medical services in the process. This article critically evaluates the recent literature on illness anxiety and related, medically unexplained symptoms, highlighting new and interesting findings in the areas of prevalence, classification/diagnosis, management, and evidence-based treatment and new frontiers in understanding illness anxiety, such as brain imaging, neuroimmunology, and cyberchondria.

### Hypochondriasis: conceptualization, treatment, and relationship to obsessive-compulsive disorder [^ae5835e6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Once considered exclusively as a problem secondary to other mental dis-orders (ie, mood disorders), HC is now known to occur quite often as a pri-mary diagnosis. A frequent drain on medical resources, patients who have HC can be viewed as suffering essentially from an anxiety disorder in which intense fear is focused on the possibility that they might be seriously physically ill or that such illness is imminent. The processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of such health anxiety consist largely of beliefs, assumptions, and behavioral responses that, although internally consistent with the perception of health-related threat, are erroneous and highly maladaptive in that they prevent the correction of erroneous perceptions of threat. There is growing evidence that this conceptualization leads to effective reduction in HC symptoms through cognitive-behavioral and pharmacologic treatments. By far the main obstacle to successful treatment of HC is the patient's reluctance to view the problem as anything other than physical. The authors have found, however, that patients appreciate their care providers showing a genuine understanding of their concerns and taking the time to offer a logical, coherent explanation and rationale for the need for psychological and psychiatric services.

### The classification of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in the ICD-11 [^36e1b903]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To present the rationale for the new Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (OCRD) grouping in the Mental and Behavioural Disorders chapter of the Eleventh Revision of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), including the conceptualization and essential features of disorders in this grouping.

Methods

Review of the recommendations of the ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification for OCRD. These sought to maximize clinical utility, global applicability, and scientific validity.

Results

The rationale for the grouping is based on common clinical features of included disorders including repetitive unwanted thoughts and associated behaviours, and is supported by emerging evidence from imaging, neurochemical, and genetic studies. The proposed grouping includes obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, olfactory reference disorder, and hoarding disorder. Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders, including trichotillomania and excoriation disorder are also included. Tourette disorder, a neurological disorder in ICD-11, and personality disorder with anankastic features, a personality disorder in ICD-11, are recommended for cross-referencing.

Limitations

Alternative nosological conceptualizations have been described in the literature and have some merit and empirical basis. Further work is needed to determine whether the proposed ICD-11 OCRD grouping and diagnostic guidelines are mostly likely to achieve the goals of maximizing clinical utility and global applicability.

Conclusion

It is anticipated that creation of an OCRD grouping will contribute to accurate identification and appropriate treatment of affected patients as well as research efforts aimed at improving our understanding of the prevalence, assessment, and management of its constituent disorders.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^88fecc7c]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain — MMPI predictors of manipulation response: Among patients referred for spinal manipulative therapy (n = 90), there were no significant correlations between psychological measures and extent of relief immediately after treatment; several days after treatment the percentage of patients reporting improvement was lower and lack of improvement was associated with hypochondriasis, hysteria and functional LBP; the study provides Level III prognostic evidence that MMPI scores indicating hysteria, hypochondriasis or higher LBP scores are associated with recurrence of pain after manipulation and not associated with immediate response to SMT.

### Health anxiety: current perspectives and future directions [^46731614]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Health anxiety is a ubiquitous experience that arises when bodily sensations or changes are believed to be indicative of a serious disease. Severe expressions of health anxiety are most often classified as hypochondriasis in the current DSM-IV-TR; however, various alternative classification schemas have been proposed for the DSM-V. Regardless of classification, severe health anxiety has significant negative impacts on well-being, social and occupational functioning, and health care resource utilization. In this review, we focus on classification issues pertinent to severe health anxiety, summarize recent research regarding potential mechanisms underlying the condition, and summarize the state of the art with respect to assessment and treatment. Future research directions are noted and suggested throughout.

### Psychotherapies for hypochondriasis [^7b84a7a3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypochondriasis is associated with significant medical morbidity and high health resource use. Recent studies have examined the treatment of hypochondriasis using various forms of psychotherapy.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of any form of psychotherapy for the treatment of hypochondriasis.

Search Strategy

1. CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 7/8/2007, CENTRAL, Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cinahl, ISI Web of Knowledge, AMED and WorldCat Dissertations; Current Controlled Trials meta-register (mRCT), CenterWatch, NHS National Research Register and clinicaltrials.gov; 2. Communication with authors of relevant studies and other clinicians in the field; 3. Handsearching reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and electronic citation search in ISI Web of Knowledge for all included studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies, both published and unpublished, in any language, in which adults with hypochondriasis were treated with a psychological intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two authors using a standardised extraction sheet. Study quality was assessed independently by the two authors qualitatively and using a standardised scale. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software. Standardised or weighted mean differences were used to pool data for continuous outcomes and odds ratios were used to pool data for dichotomous outcomes, together with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Six studies were included, with a total of 440 participants. The interventions examined were cognitive therapy (CT), behavioural therapy (BT), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural stress management (BSM) and psychoeducation. All forms of psychotherapy except psychoeducation showed a significant improvement in hypochondriacal symptoms compared to waiting list control (SMD (random) [95% CI] = -0.86 [-1.25 to -0.46]). For some therapies, significant improvements were found in the secondary outcomes of general functioning (CBT), resource use (psychoeducation), anxiety (CT, BSM), depression (CT, BSM) and physical symptoms (CBT). These secondary outcome findings were based on smaller numbers of participants and there was significant heterogeneity between studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural stress management are effective in reducing symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, studies included in the review used small numbers of participants and do not allow estimation of effect size, comparison between different types of psychotherapy or whether people are "cured". Most long-term outcome data were uncontrolled. Further studies should make use of validated rating scales, assess treatment acceptability and effect on resource use, and determine the active ingredients and nonspecific factors that are important in psychotherapy for hypochondriasis.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^b8deba42]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

At present, EDS is not curable, but only 'treatable'. Patients presenting pain require multidisciplinary care, including pain medication, intensive physiotherapy, podiatry, psychology, occupational therapy and adequate bracing. Often a holistic or alternative approach (eg, osteopathy) is complimentary to normal treatment. Unfortunately, many treatment options are not reimbursed, even when they improve the quality of life of patients with EDS significantly.

At present, a good number of patients are not taken seriously or even accused of hypochondria, Munchausen or Munchausen-by-proxy. As such, psychiatric diagnoses sometimes precede the actual diagnosis. Furthermore, psychological follow-up is sometimes needed, considering the fact that the long road to the correct diagnosis, and correct treatment of the symptoms often contributes to anxiety and depression.

In conclusion, there is a long road ahead for the EDS Community. Many needs are unfulfilled, including access to care and treatment, educational therapy, professional educational programme and awareness. With a strong ERN along with patients, experts, healthcare centres and patient organisations as partners, these goals can be accomplished over time.

### Somatic symptom disorder [^936fc89e]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The disease somatic symptom disorder can be associated with neuropsychiatric disorder, hypochondriasis, age < 25 years, poorly localized abdominal pain, somatization disorder, depression and undifferentiated somatoform disorder.

---

### Somatoform disorders [^12aaf5bf]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The somatoform disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders that cause unexplained physical symptoms. They include somatization disorder (involving multisystem physical symptoms), undifferentiated somatoform disorder (fewer symptoms than somatization disorder), conversion disorder (voluntary motor or sensory function symptoms), pain disorder (pain with strong psychological involvement), hypochondriasis (fear of having a life-threatening illness or condition), body dysmorphic disorder (preoccupation with a real or imagined physical defect), and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified (used when criteria are not dearly met for one of the other somatoform disorders). These disorders should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with unexplained symptoms to prevent unnecessary interventions and testing. Treatment success can be enhanced by discussing the possibility of a somatoform disorder with the patient early in the evaluation process, limiting unnecessary diagnostic and medical treatments, focusing on the management of the disorder rather than its cure, using appropriate medications and psychotherapy for comorbidities, maintaining a psychoeducational and collaborative relationship with patients, and referring patients to mental health professionals when appropriate.

### Illness anxiety disorder: a review of the current research and future directions [^385e5b0e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The most widely supported evidence based psychological treatment for health anxiety and IAD is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT typically consists of strategies including psychoeducation; cognitive restructuring of catastrophic beliefs about health and bodily symptoms; behavioural strategies to reduce hypervigilance to body sensations and compulsive coping behaviours such as body checking, reassurance-seeking, and avoidance; and relapse prevention. Evidence from meta-analyses shows that CBT is a highly efficacious and cost-effective treatment for health anxiety, with a moderate to large pooled effect size on health anxiety [Hedge's g = 0.81, 95% CI [0.37, 1.26]; 76] compared to non-CBT controls, with improvements largely maintained over 12–18 months. Evidence also supports the delivery of CBT for health anxiety and IAD online, with large effect sizes when delivered in routine care. For example, a non-inferiority trial compared internet-delivered to face-to-face CBT (including health anxious sample with either IAD and SSD) and found no difference in outcome, but with internet-delivered therapy resulting in lower net societal costs.

Although less research has been conducted on other psychological therapies for health anxiety, some evidence also supports the use of third-wave therapies for health anxiety such as Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), although no studies have tested them in IAD specifically. MBCT treats health anxiety through applying mindfulness techniques to defuse from catastrophic health cognitions, reduce attentional bias towards physiological symptoms, and confront rather than experientially avoid feared body sensations, thus reducing unhelpful avoidance or safety-seeking behaviours. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) similarly aims to treat health anxiety by reducing experiential avoidance of distressing illness-related thoughts, feelings, and body sensations, promoting acceptance of these inner states, while clarifying values and encouraging behaviours that contribute to a meaningful life. A recent randomised controlled trial involving ACT delivered online showed large effect sizes in reducing health anxiety at six-month follow up compared to control (d = 0.80, 95% CI 0.38–1.23). Pharmacotherapy studies are lacking, but two studies into treatments for Hypochondriasis support the use of Fluoxetine in combination with CBT, or alone, and another earlier study found Paroxetine yielded similar effectiveness to CBT for hypochondriasis. No pharmacological studies have yet been conducted on the new IAD diagnosis.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with hypochondriasis [^55f46562]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Third, individuals with a diagnosis of hypochondriasis had a more than 4-fold higher risk of death by suicide compared with individuals from the general population. To our knowledge, the risk of suicide in this group had not been previously quantified. A systematic review concluded that suicide attempts may be less frequent among individuals with hypochondriasis than among individuals without, although the included studies had methodological limitations. Clinicians should be aware that individuals with hypochondriasis are at risk of death by suicide, particularly if they have a lifetime history of depression and anxiety.

Fourth, the risks of death from all causes and natural causes were higher among individuals who first received a diagnosis in inpatient settings compared with individuals who first received a diagnosis in outpatient settings, suggesting that patients with more severe or complex symptoms requiring hospitalization are more likely to die. The risk of death from unnatural causes was not significantly different between groups, potentially due to limited statistical power.

Fifth, systematic adjustment for lifetime psychiatric disorders attenuated the magnitude of the risks, but, overall, these remained statistically significant. Suicide risk was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for depressive and anxiety-related disorders. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the high proportion of exposed individuals with these lifetime comorbidities and the resulting power issues. In a post hoc analysis limiting comorbidities to those recorded before hypochondriasis, suicide risk was attenuated but remained statistically significant. Even if the finding of increased mortality were not entirely specific to hypochondriasis, it is clear that hypochondriasis is not associated with protection from death.

Taken together, these findings illustrate a paradox, whereby individuals with hypochondriasis have an increased risk of death despite their pervasive fears of illness and death. In this study, most deaths could be classified as potentially preventable. Dismissing these individuals' somatic symptoms as imaginary may have dire consequences. More should be done to reduce stigma and improve detection, diagnosis, and appropriate integrated (ie, psychiatric and somatic) care for these individuals. Evidence-based psychological treatments for hypochondriasis existand, in some countries, are even available as low-threshold, guided self-help via the internet, substantially increasing access to treatment. The hope is that increased detection and access to evidence-based treatment will reduce somatic morbidity, suicidality, and mortality in this group.

### Illness anxiety disorder: a review of the current research and future directions [^bff543b1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review highlights the recent literature on Illness Anxiety Disorder (health anxiety) and identifies current gaps and points for future directions. First, the long-lasting impact of health anxiety on the individual and society is well-documented in the literature. Individuals with health anxiety are debilitated by dysfunctional health beliefs, which, in turn, manifest into maladaptive coping behaviours. There are reliable dimensional measures of health anxiety and diagnostic instruments to assess IAD. CBT is an effective treatment option for this population, in both face-to-face and digital formats. However, further research is needed into third-wave treatments (i.e. MCBT and ACT) and pharmacotherapy in samples with IAD.

Second, there is some evidence of a relationship between illness experiences, intergenerational transmission of health anxiety, and childhood traumatic experiences as risk factors for health anxiety. However, it is unclear whether these factors cause health anxiety.

Third, although the limitations of DSM-IV Hypochondriasis were addressed in the DSM-5 with two new disorders, a debate continues about whether the two disorders should be combined or remain distinct. Early evidence suggests that differences between IAD and SSD are a matter of severity rather than of any distinctive qualitative characteristics, but replication research is needed across varying populations and groups. It is also debated whether IAD should be reclassified into the anxiety disorders category in the next iteration of the DSM, due to its shared characteristics and high comorbidity with other anxiety disorders. Future research should examine the predictive validity of IAD with and without comorbid anxiety in terms of course and treatment response. In addition, there has been little done to investigate the 'care-seeking' and 'care-avoidant' subtypes of IAD. Future research is necessary to advance knowledge of this condition, particularly if there are differences between these groups in terms of their nature and experience, and response to treatment.

Finally, recent evidence suggests health anxiety may start, at least for some, in childhood and adolescence. However, due to a lack of developmentally appropriate diagnostic criteria for young people, there is a need to investigate how health anxiety presents in children and young people and an urgent need to develop or adapt treatment options that are appropriate for this population.

Overall, the most significant gap in this field is the limited number of studies utilising the current diagnostic criteria for Illness Anxiety Disorder. Addressing this gap is crucial if we are to significantly advance knowledge, improve our understanding of the disorder, intervene early, and develop targeted, effective treatments for the disorder.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy for somatoform disorders [^03a7c60c]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with somatoform disorders often incur excessive health care charges and fail to respond to standard treatment. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the diagnostic criteria and demographic and clinical characteristics of each somatoform disorder and to examine the research assessing the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for each disorder. The review shows that CBT has received some empirical support for somatization, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. However, there are few data on the impact of treatment on health care use, especially when the cost of CBT is factored into the equation. Too few methodologically sound studies have been published on the treatment of conversion disorder or of pain disorder to make any conclusions.

### Course of hypochondriasis in an international primary care study [^06af0f03]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Hypochondriasis is frequently defined as a chronic condition distinct from anxiety and depressive disorders. Consecutive primary care attenders (n = 25,916) were screened using the General Health Questionnaire and a stratified random sample (n = 5447) completed a baseline diagnostic assessment. All patients with significant psychiatric symptoms and a random sample of remaining patients (n = 3201) were asked to complete a follow-up diagnostic assessment 12 months later. Of patients meeting an abridged definition of hypochondriasis at baseline, 18% continued to do so at follow-up and an additional 16% continued to report hypochondriacal worries. 45% of those with hypochondriasis at follow-up also met criteria for DSM-IV anxiety or depressive disorder. Follow-up anxiety or depressive disorder was significantly associated with both onset and persistence of hypochondriasis. Hypochondriasis is moderately stable over time. The clear distinction between hypochondriasis and anxiety/depressive disorders suggested by ICD-10 and DSM-IV may be difficult to accomplish in practice.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) practice guideline development — methods and evidence grading are described: This APA guideline was developed under the auspices of the Steering Committee on Practice Guidelines and included a comprehensive literature review, the development of evidence tables that summarized key study features, initial drafting of the guideline by a work group that included psychiatrists with clinical and research expertise in obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the production of multiple revised drafts with widespread review (11 organizations and 68 individuals submitted significant comments); it also notes approval by the APA Assembly and Board of Trustees and planned revisions at regular intervals. Relevant literature was identified through a MEDLINE literature search using PubMed for articles published between 1966 and December 2004 with specified OCD-related keywords, and this search yielded 13,182 references, of which 10,756 were in the English language and had abstracts; additional, less formal searches were conducted by APA staff and individual Work Group members, and the Cochrane databases were also searched for relevant meta-analyses. The summary of treatment recommendations is keyed according to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made (indicated by a bracketed Roman numeral), and each reference is followed by a bracketed letter that indicates the nature of the supporting evidence.

### A new, empirically established hypochondriasis diagnosis [^cb384dab]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The narrow ICD-10 and DSM-IV definition of hypochondriasis makes it rarely used yet does not prevent extensive diagnosis overlap. This study identified a distinct hypochondriasis symptom cluster and defined diagnostic criteria.

Method

Consecutive patients (N = 1,785) consulting primary care physicians for new illness were screened for somatization, anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse. A stratified subgroup of 701 patients were interviewed with the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and questions addressing common hypochondriasis symptoms. Symptom patterns were analyzed by latent class analysis.

Results

Patients fell into three classes based on six symptoms: preoccupation with the idea of harboring an illness or with bodily function, rumination about illness, suggestibility, unrealistic fear of infection, fascination with medical information, and fear of prescribed medication. All symptoms, particularly rumination, were frequent in one of the classes. Classification allowed definition of new diagnostic criteria for hypochondriasis and division of the cases into "mild" and "severe". The weighted prevalence of severe cases was 9.5% versus 5.8% for DSM-IV hypochondriasis. Compared with DSM-IV hypochondriasis, this approach produced less overlap with other somatoform disorders, similar overlap with nonsomatoform psychiatric disorders, and similar assessments by primary care physicians. Severe cases of the new hypochondriasis lasted 2 or more years in 54.3% of the subjects and 1 month or less in 27.2%.

Conclusions

These results suggest that rumination about illness plus at least one of five other symptoms form a distinct diagnostic entity performing better than the current DSM-IV hypochondriasis diagnosis. However, these criteria are preliminary, awaiting cross-validation in other subject groups.

### Illness anxiety disorder: a review of the current research and future directions [^bbdf18b3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The DSM-5 categorizes IAD into two subtypes: 'care-seeking' for individuals that frequently seek medical care, and 'care-avoidant' for individuals that frequently avoid medical care. Although researchers have proposed that individuals seek care as a form of reassurance and avoid care out of an overwhelming fear of having a serious disease, evidence about these behaviours remains scarce. To date, our team conducted the only study investigating the prevalence of IAD subtypes and found that 25% met criteria for the 'care-seeking' subtype, 14% met criteria for the 'care-avoidant' subtype, and interestingly, 61% reported fluctuating between seeking and avoiding care. This suggests that there may be a third subtype of IAD which needs further study.

Classification

There has been a long-standing debate about whether health anxiety would be better classified under "Anxiety Disorders" than under its current classification "Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders" due to its shared features and high comorbidity with anxiety disorders, namely Panic Disorder, Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. For example, health anxiety involves both hypervigilance to bodily sensations (a common characteristic in Panic Disorder) and excessive worry (a core feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Research using the DSM-IV Hypochondriasis criteria has shown higher levels of comorbidity with anxiety disorders than comorbid depressive or somatoform disorders. Similarly, substantial comorbidity was found between DSM-5 IAD and other anxiety disorders, particularly Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. To determine whether IAD should be better classified as an anxiety disorder, future research should investigate whether IAD symptom profiles, course, treatment response and comorbidities more closely align with anxiety disorders compared with other somatic symptom disorders.

### Illness anxiety disorder: a review of the current research and future directions [^c4dc20bc]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While many individuals experience transient health concerns throughout their lives, a subset of individuals experience enduring and distressing anxiety about health and illness. Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) is a new disorder introduced in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM-5; 1], replacing the DSM-IV Hypochondriasis diagnosis. IAD is characterised by an intense fear of having or acquiring a serious medical disease or illness, such as cancer, heart disease or other significant conditions. Individuals with IAD experience illness-related cognitions, such as intrusive thoughts and images, and engage in various maladaptive coping behaviours, such as seeking excessive medical reassurance, searching for health information online, and checking their body for signs of illness. The DSM-5 proposes two subtypes of IAD: the 'care-seeking' subtype for individuals who frequently seek medical care and the 'care-avoidant' subtype for individuals who avoid medical care. As IAD is a new disorder, historically, much of the research has focused on samples exhibiting DSM-IV Hypochondriasis (which focused on excessive preoccupation with having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance) or excessive and persistent 'health anxiety' using dimensional measures (which can encompass current and previous DSM diagnoses and subthreshold symptoms). In this review, we use the term IAD for research on the new DSM-5 diagnosis, and the term health anxiety for the broader literature which informs current understanding of IAD.

Issues with Diagnosis and Classification

Diagnostic Criteria

According to the DSM-5, IAD is only diagnosed when a person experiences either no or mild somatic symptoms. If they experience health anxiety with moderate to severe somatic symptoms, they may be diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) instead. For an IAD diagnosis, the individual will experience excessive worry about either having or developing a serious medical illness, which persists for six months or more. The individual will be highly vigilant about their personal health status, resulting in various maladaptive coping behaviours (i.e. checking their bodies for signs of illness, excessively searching the internet for health-related information, and making frequent visits to medical settings). Individuals with an SSD diagnosis will experience excessive and persistent thoughts related to the seriousness of their moderate-to severe somatic symptoms, and/or high levels of anxiety about their health or symptoms and dedicate significant time to researching and understanding their symptoms in depth. Their somatic symptoms must also last longer than 6 months but can change across their course. IAD and SSD were put forward to replace DSM-IV Hypochondriasis due to its limited clinical validity, and research suggests that IAD and SSD are more reliable than Hypochondriasis. However, having two separate diagnoses is not clinically useful, as research has found there are few differences in how individuals with health anxiety experience the disorders. Specifically, the differences that have been reported relate to symptom severity, whereby IAD characterizes individuals with a milder form of health anxiety and SSD represents individuals with a more severe form of health anxiety. Additionally, research has shown that both IAD and SSD respond similarly to psychological treatment. Furthermore, recent research done by our team showed that there were no differences on demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics (i.e. depression and generalized anxiety severity, quality of life related to mental health), the nature and course of health anxiety, or mental health comorbidity, between people who met IAD criteria with no/mild somatic symptoms versus those with moderate-to-severe somatic symptoms. These findings suggest that the distinction in somatic symptom severity between these disorders might be arbitrary. Further research is needed to understand whether restricting IAD to only those with minimal somatic symptoms is clinically useful.

### Predictors of treatment success of psychotherapy in functional disorders: a systematic review of the literature [^481b5d76]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Functional disorders (FDs) encompass a broad spectrum of persistent somatic symptoms with various aetio‐pathogenetic explaining models (Saunders et al.), characteristically observed in a range of psychosomatic disorders, including but not limited to fibromyalgia (FM), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypochondriasis and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (Burton et al.). FDs have an estimated point prevalence of around 9% among the adult European general population (Rometsch et al.), are associated with substantial healthcare utilization (Chaabouni et al.) and significant health‐related costs (Lagrand et al.). This is partly attributed to prevalent mental disorder comorbidities, where anxiety and depressive disorders are the most common (De Waal et al; Carle‐Toulemonde et al.). The diagnosis of FD may vary according to the standardized nosographic system used, which include, among the others, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (Association), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organization) and the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) (Fava et al; Fava et al.), in their various editions. Syndrome‐specific standardized diagnostic systems also allow to formulate diagnoses, for instance, the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR) are specific for FM while the Rome criteria are specific for IBS.

Pharmacological treatment used for FD, such as for instance antidepressants, showed low or no evidence of effectiveness or efficacy (Kleinstaeuber et al.). Given these limitations, non‐pharmacological approaches have become increasingly important. Among them, psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (Liu et al.) and short‐term psychodynamic psychotherapy (Abbass et al.), showed from moderate to large sustained benefits in patients with functional somatic symptoms. Less structured psychological interventions (e.g. relaxation therapy, hypnotherapy) have been proposed (Ford et al.), but showed limited utility. Multi‐component approaches seem promising (Drossman and Thompson; Häuser et al; Kustra‐Mulder et al; Mamo et al.).

### Recent advances in the understanding and treatment of health anxiety [^384b25da]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the diagnosis of health anxiety, its prevalence in different settings, public health significance, treatment, and outcome.

Recent Findings

Health anxiety is similar to hypochondriasis but is characterized by fear of, rather than conviction of, illness. Lifetime prevalence rates are 6% in the population and as high as 20% in hospital out-patients, leading to greater costs to health services through unnecessary medical contacts. Its prevalence may be increasing because of excessive internet browsing (cyberchondria). Drug treatment with antidepressants has some efficacy but is not well-liked, but psychological treatments, including cognitive behavior therapy, stress management, mindfulness training, and acceptance and commitment therapy, given either individually, in groups, or over the Internet, have all proved efficacious in both the short and longer term. Untreated health anxiety leads to premature mortality. Health anxiety has become an increasing clinical and public health issue at a time when people are being formally asked to take more responsibility in monitoring their own health. More attention by health services is needed.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^fea8f1dd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

DSM-IV-TR 300.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic criteria require either obsessions or compulsions, with obsessions involving intrusive, inappropriate thoughts, impulses, or images that are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems, attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize them, and recognition that they are a product of one's own mind; compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at preventing or reducing distress or a dreaded event but not realistically connected or clearly excessive. Additional criteria are that the person has recognized the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (note: this does not apply to children), symptoms cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with routine, functioning, or relationships, content is not restricted to another Axis I disorder, and the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition; specify With Poor Insight when for most of the time during the current episode the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.

### Treatment of hypochondriasis with CBT and / or SSRI… [^f73ff912]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of Hypochondriasis With CBT and/or SSRIClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Hypochondriasis is one of the most difficult psychiatric disorders to treat. People with hypochondriasis believe that real or imagined physical symptoms are signs of serious illnesses, despite medical reassurance and other evidence to the contrary. Symptoms of the disorder include a preoccupation with fear of an illness; a persistent fear of having a serious illness, despite medical reassurance; and misinterpretation of symptoms. Some individuals with hypochondriasis recognize that their fear of having a serious illness may be excessive, unreasonable, or unfounded. Episodes of hypochondriasis usually last from months to years, with equally long periods of remission. Cognitive behavioral therapy and the antidepressant drug fluoxetine have both been shown to be effective treatments for hypochondriasis. However, the relative efficacy of a combined approach has yet to be determined.

This study will compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, and a combination of the two for treating hypochondriasis. Participants in this double-blind study will first report to the study site for two sessions to determine eligibility for participation. Eligible individuals will then be randomly assigned to receive one of the following four treatments for 12 weeks: CBT only; FLX only; CBT plus FLX; or a placebo pill. All participants receiving medication will also receive supportive therapy. Treatment response will be assessed at Week 12, and participants who have shown improvement will continue in the study for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who have not responded to treatment will be removed from the study and will receive open treatment. Participants assigned to receive medication or placebo will take medication once daily for the full 24 weeks.

Participants assigned to CBT only or CBT plus FLX will receive CBT weekly for the first 8 weeks, then biweekly until Week 12, and then monthly until week 24. Outcomes will be assessed at study visits at Weeks 6, 12, 24, and 48, and over the phone at Week

### Psychogenic itch [^d7f6b5b9]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)replaces somatoform disorders with somatic symptoms and related disorders and makes significant changes to the criteria to eliminate overlap across the somatoform disorders, clarify their boundaries and better reflect the complex interface between mental and physical health. The DSM-5 defines a new group of "somatic symptom disorders" (SSD), which is characterized by "somatic symptoms that are either very distressing or result in significant disruption of functioning, as well as excessive and disproportionate thoughts, feelings and behaviors regarding those symptoms. To be diagnosed with SSD, the individual must be persistently symptomatic (typically at least for 6 months)".

The DSM-IV disorders of somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform disorder have been removed, and many, but not all, individuals previously diagnosed with one of these disorders could now be diagnosed with SSD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of somatization disorder required a specific number of complaints from among four symptom groups. The SSD criteria no longer have such a requirement; however, somatic symptoms must be significantly distressing or disruptive to daily life and must be accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.

### Somatic symptom disorder: a scoping review on the empirical evidence of a new diagnosis [^b60e9a8e]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) introduced "somatic symptom disorder" (SSD) as a new diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association). The DSM-5 diagnosis not only received a new name; its diagnostic criteria also differ radically from somatization disorder which it replaced: Following scientific evidence of over two decades (Kroenke; Voigt et al.), positive psychological criteria were formulated, i.e. excessive health concerns, and exclusion of potentially underlying medical disorders was no longer required. There are three diagnostic criteria (American Psychiatric Association,): The A-criterion requires one or more distressing or disabling somatic symptoms. The B-criterion requires disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one's symptoms (cognitive dimension), high levels of anxiety about health or symptoms (affective dimension), or excessive energy or time devoted to these symptoms or health concerns (behavioral dimension). The C-criterion specifies that somatic symptoms should persist for over 6 months. SSD also replaced DSM-IV's undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and the pain disorders. SSD specifiers with regard to severity, pain, and persistence were introduced (Dimsdale et al.). Patients with severe health anxiety and somatic symptoms are now assigned to SSD and those with solely health anxiety without somatic symptoms to "illness anxiety disorder" (IAD).

### Cognitive behavior therapy for hypochondriasis: a randomized controlled trial [^045f761b]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hypochondriasis is a chronic, distressing, and disabling condition that is prevalent in ambulatory medical practice. Until recently, no specific treatment has been clearly demonstrated to be effective.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for hypochondriasis.

Design

A randomized, usual care control group design, conducted between September 1997 and November 2001. The individual primary care physician was the unit of randomization, and all patients clustered within each physician's practice were assigned to the experimental treatment (individual CBT and a consultation letter to the primary care physician) or to the control condition. Subjects were assessed immediately before and 6 and 12 months after the completion of treatment.

Setting and Participants

Participants were 80 patients from primary care practices and 107 volunteers responding to public announcements, all of whom exceeded a predetermined cutoff score on a hypochondriasis self-report questionnaire on 2 successive occasions.

Intervention

A scripted, 6-session, individual CBT intervention was compared with medical care as usual. The CBT was accompanied by a consultation letter sent to the patient's primary care physician.

Main Outcome Measures

Hypochondriacal beliefs, fears, attitudes, and somatic symptoms; role function and impairment.

Results

A total of 102 individuals were assigned to CBT and 85 were assigned to medical care as usual. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were similar at baseline. Using an intent-to-treat analytic strategy, a consistent pattern of statistically and clinically significant treatment effects was found at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline covariates that included educational level, generalized psychiatric distress, and participant status (patient vs volunteer). At 12-month follow-up, CBT patients had significantly lower levels of hypochondriacal symptoms, beliefs, and attitudes (P < .001) and health-related anxiety (P = 0.009). They also had significantly less impairment of social role functioning (P = 0.05) and intermediate activities of daily living (P < .001). Hypochondriacal somatic symptoms were not improved significantly by treatment.

Conclusion

This brief, individual CBT intervention, developed specifically to alter hypochondriacal thinking and restructure hypochondriacal beliefs, appears to have significant beneficial long-term effects on the symptoms of hypochondriasis.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^57e38089]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic features from DSM-IV-TR describe the essential features as recurrent obsessions or compulsions that are time consuming — i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day — or cause marked distress or significant impairment, with obsessions defined as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and compulsions — also known as rituals — carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner that the patient feels driven to perform to prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^fd0c9247]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

A new category of 'anxiety or fear-related disorders', which contains all anxiety disorders, including two (separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism) that were previously classed with childhood disorders, has been introduced in the ICD-11. Since anxiety disorders have similar symptoms (i.e. sympathetic arousal and avoidance), the ICD-11 emphasizes the focus of apprehension (e.g. fear of negative evaluation by others in the case of social anxiety disorder) as the basis for diagnostic differentiation between anxiety disorders. Hierarchical exclusion rules, which often precluded explicit diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, particularly in individuals with mood disorders, have also been removed in the ICD-11.

OCD has been placed into its own grouping of 'obsessive–compulsive or related disorders'. This grouping also includes several new disorders such as hoarding disorder and body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders (broadened from the ICD-10 diagnosis of trichotillomania). Hypochondriasis has also been moved from the category of 'somatoform disorders' into that of 'obsessive–compulsive or related disorders'.

### The complex clinical response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression: a network perspective [^412fe805]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Another potential weakness of the current study is that the number of response categories of the HDRS items differ and the sensitivity to detect symptom-specific effects might be higher for items with more response categories. This was, however, not supported by our findings, as the strongest direct effects were found for the two affective symptoms (scored 0–4) and two specific arousal/somatic symptoms (scored 0–2) while only weak effects were found for, for example, hypochondriasis (scored 0–4).

In conclusion, our explorative study shows that network estimation techniques are valuable in demonstrating the complexity of the clinical response to treatment and in identifying pathways that potentially play a prominent role herein. For example, we showed that SSRIs primarily resulted in reductions in affective symptoms, which were related to reductions in mainly cognitive symptoms and some arousal/somatic symptoms. This might be an important step in disclosing the mechanisms of action of SSRIs, and may also have potential in the early detection of responders and non-responders in clinical practice.

### All-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with hypochondriasis [^5a2a62c6]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypochondriasis, also known as health anxiety disorder, is a prevalent psychiatric disordercharacterized by persistent preoccupation about having 1 or more serious and progressive physical disorders. The preoccupation is accompanied by hypervigilance and a catastrophic interpretation of bodily signs, resulting in repetitive and excessive checking and reassurance-seeking behavior or maladaptive avoidance. The symptoms are clearly disproportionate and cause significant distress and impairment. Hypochondriasis is thought to be severely underdiagnosed due to the condition not being properly recognized or taken seriously by health professionals as well as to the negative connotations associated with the diagnostic label. However, as a symptom, health anxiety is highly prevalent in health care settingsand is associated with a substantial use of health care resources. Hypochondriasis is widely regarded as a chronic disorder, with a low probability of remission without specialized treatment.

Individuals with hypochondriasis have high rates of medical consultations, typically leading to a chain of laboratory and other tests, which are often unnecessary from a medical perspective and conceptualized as counterproductive from a psychological viewpoint. Theoretically, this high degree of vigilance may lead to the early detection and timely management of serious health conditions, potentially reducing mortality. However, there are several reasons to believe that this may not be the case. First, some individuals with hypochondriasis experience such high levels of health anxiety that they actually avoid contact with medical services altogether, risking the oversight of potentially serious illnesses. Second, chronic anxiety and depression, which are characteristic of the disorder, are known to be associated with a range of adverse health consequences, such as cardiovascular disorders and premature mortality. A longitudinal Norwegian cohort study of 7052 individuals found that those with self-reported symptoms of health anxiety were 73% more likely to develop ischemic heart disease after a 12-year follow-up compared with individuals with low health anxiety scores. Finally, suicide has not been formally investigated among individuals with hypochondriasis, but it could contribute to increased mortality among this group. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with a clinical diagnosis of hypochondriasis.

### Predictors of treatment success of psychotherapy in functional disorders: a systematic review of the literature [^00499ec8]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictors of treatment success spanned various themes: sociodemographic variables, mental comorbidities, symptoms number/intensity, physical condition/functional impairments, emotional/cognitive/behavioural aspects, treatment‐related factors and FD diagnosis. Besides this wide range, pain intensity is a common predictor for treatment success of both FM and somatization. Depression and anxiety disorders were predictors for FM, IBS, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, MUS and dissociative seizures. Overall, higher pre‐treatment symptom severity predicted worse outcomes (Heins et al; Lackner et al; Nakao et al; Friesen et al.). This is in line with the recently published review by Löwe et al. showing that longer symptom duration, higher baseline symptom severity and lower physical, emotional or social functioning prior to treatment are associated with a poor treatment outcome. Further on, psychological predictors such as comorbid depressive or anxiety disorders, heightened symptom focus, catastrophizing interpretations, excessive worrying, somatosensory amplification and low symptom acceptance or self‐efficacy are associated with worse outcomes. Additionally, social determinants such as low educational level, lower socioeconomic status and limited access to adequate healthcare also contribute to unfavourable treatment outcomes (Löwe et al.). Such a difference of predictors mirrors the need of keeping a broad view, which follows the lessons of the biopsychosocial model (Engel) and which is more representative of complexity of real world clinical care paths. However, together with lack of standardized research methodology, it prevented meta‐analysing the present data.

Literature encompassing global research as well as studies outside the FD spectrum confirms that predictors of treatment outcomes in mental health results in a considerable heterogeneity in predictors of treatment outcomes, emphasizing that this variability is not unique to FD (Tanguay‐Sela et al; McDonald et al.).

Initial concepts to address challenges in identifying predictors are emerging. However, additional knowledge may derive by strategies already proposed for mental disorders, such as multivariable predictive models using randomized trials (Chowdhury and Turin) or machine learning (Lee et al; Sajjadian et al.), and could be more systematically used in research on FD (Melidis et al.). In addition, collaboration among researchers seem necessary to overcome barriers in establishing a common clinical and research background (e.g. EURONET‐SOMA — (Kohlmann et al.) ETUDE — (Rosmalen et al; Rosmalen et al.).

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^777cadce]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

American Psychological Association guideline — scope and related guidelines: Although the Panel was tasked with updating APA's (2017) clinical practice guideline for DSM-5 PTSD, the Panel chose to also examine important outcomes related to C-PTSD (i.e., affect dysregulation, dissociation), and towards that end the Panel included systematic reviews that included or focused on C-PTSD. Since the publication of APA's (2017) PTSD guideline, there have been several guideline development efforts addressing the current state of the science in treating adults with PTSD, including the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2018); the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD, 2023) updated guideline; the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (Bisson et al., 2019; Forbes et al., 2020), the Finnish Medical Association Duodecim (2020); and Phoenix Australia – Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health (2020; Phelps et al., 2022), with how the current guideline complements these prior efforts discussed on page 46.

### Differentiating hypochondriasis from panic disorder [^55b2b9e8]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Hypochondriasis and panic disorder are both characterized by prevalent health anxieties and illness beliefs. Therefore, the question as to whether they represent distinct nosological entities has been raised. This study examines how clinical characteristics can be used to differentiate both disorders, taking the possibility of mixed symptomatologies (comorbidity) into account. We compared 46 patients with hypochondriasis, 45 with panic disorder, and 21 with comorbid hypochondriasis plus panic disorder. While panic patients had more comorbidity with agoraphobia, hypochondriasis was more closely associated with somatization. Patients with panic disorder were less pathological than hypochondriacal patients on all subscales of the Whiteley Index (WI) and the Illness Attitude Scales (IAS) except for illness behavior. These differences were independent of somatization. Patients with hypochondriasis plus panic had higher levels of anxiety, more somatization, more general psychopathology and a trend towards increased health care utilization. Clinicians were able to distinguish between patient groups based upon the tendency of hypochondriacal patients to demand unnecessary medical treatments. These results confirm that hypochondriasis and panic disorder are distinguishable clinical conditions, characterized by generally more psychopathology and distress in hypochondriasis.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^b3002d94]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treatment — factors to consider at each treatment step include the patient's motivation and ability to comply, nature and severity of OCD symptoms, co-occurring psychiatric disorders and their treatment, presence/absence of suicide risk, co-occurring medical disorders and their treatment, and likely drug side effects; also consider whether the patient is a woman of childbearing age or is elderly, the patient's past treatment history, stressors, family or caregivers' involvement in symptoms, cultural issues, and the patient's preferences regarding treatment modality, acceptable risks, and expected benefits.

### The complex clinical response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression: a network perspective [^f563279b]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of clinical symptoms

Individual clinical symptoms were assessed by the separate items of the 17-item HDRS, both before treatment and at assessments after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. To ease the interpretation of the estimated symptom networks and in line with our previous study, the 17 symptoms were divided into five categories: two symptoms that may be categorized as affective (depressed mood and psychic anxiety), four that may be regarded as cognitive (feelings of guilt, suicidal thoughts, loss of interest in work/activities and retardation including concentration difficulties), seven that are related to arousal and bodily functions (agitation, somatic anxiety, general somatic symptoms including lack of energy, genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, and gastrointestinal symptoms), three related to sleep (early night, middle night, and early morning insomnia), and one concerning lack of insight. Items are scored from either 0 to 4 (all affective and cognitive symptoms, the arousal/somatic symptoms of somatic anxiety, and hypochondriasis) or 0 to 2 (most arousal/somatic symptoms, all sleep symptoms, and lack of insight).

### Critical analysis of the current treatment guidelines for complex ptsd in adults [^7919c1da]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

According to current treatment guidelines for Complex PTSD (cPTSD), psychotherapy for adults with cPTSD should start with a "stabilization phase". This phase, focusing on teaching self-regulation strategies, was designed to ensure that an individual would be better able to tolerate trauma-focused treatment. The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the research underlying these treatment guidelines for cPTSD, and to specifically address the question as to whether a phase-based approach is needed. As reviewed in this paper, the research supporting the need for phase-based treatment for individuals with cPTSD is methodologically limited. Further, there is no rigorous research to support the views that: (1) a phase-based approach is necessary for positive treatment outcomes for adults with cPTSD, (2) front-line trauma-focused treatments have unacceptable risks or that adults with cPTSD do not respond to them, and (3) adults with cPTSD profit significantly more from trauma-focused treatments when preceded by a stabilization phase. The current treatment guidelines for cPTSD may therefore be too conservative, risking that patients are denied or delayed in receiving conventional evidence-based treatments from which they might profit.

### Antidepressant side effects and their impact on treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder: an iSPOT-D report [^43c11dc1]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Adverse events

Adverse events were recorded and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). MedDRA is a multi-axial, five-tiered hierarchical terminology used by regulatory authorities and the biopharmaceutical industry for the coding and classification of adverse events. Adverse events were reported using their highest hierarchical grouping (i.e. system organ classes). Adverse events were determined as related to the study treatments (i.e. potential side effect to study treatment) by the investigator and in line with the study protocol. The terminology was developed and is endorsed by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.

Anxious depression definitions

Syndromal anxious depression

Syndromal anxious depression was defined as a DSM-IV MDD diagnosis and at least one concurrent MINI-Plus identified anxiety disorder, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobia.

HRSD 17 anxious depression

HRSD 17 anxious depression was defined as a DSM-IV MDD diagnosis and a HRSD 17 anxiety/somatization factor score of ≥ 7. The anxiety/somatisation factor was derived from a factor analyses of the HRSD 17 by Cleary and Guy and includes six items: hypochondriasis, insight, general and gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, and psychic and somatic anxiety.

Depression, anxiety, and stress scale

Anxiety was also assessed using the self-rated 42-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 42). DASS 42 item scores range from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time). The 14-item DASS 42 anxiety subscale, used in this study, includes 14 items measuring autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect.

Protocol treatment

Participants were randomized to receive escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine-XR with equal probability. All psychotropic medications (except sleep aids and anxiolytics) were discontinued and washed out prior to baseline assessments. Antidepressants were prescribed and doses were adjusted by the participant's treating physician according to routine clinical practice. Additional medication for associated symptoms (e.g. insomnia) or medication-induced side effects (e.g. nausea) were allowed as they reflect common practice. Any treatment for concurrent general medical conditions, except medications contraindicated with the study-assigned antidepressants, were allowed and recorded.

### ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified in children aged 4–18 years [^5b2bca49]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Future guideline updates

The methodological approach used in this guideline has been innovated in many core areas. The GDG would suggest that, as a minimum, an update is commissioned within 3 years to allow completion and publication of a new guideline within 5 years. However, the significant achievement to identify, extract, appraise, and synthesize the evidence base offers an opportunity to also innovate in future guideline efforts.

The GDG suggests that the option of a living review of the evidence and therefore a living guideline is considered. Given the relatively small number of new trials per year, such an approach would offer the chance for any significant changes in the overall certainty of evidence and, in turn, potential recommendations to be identified and actioned in a more timely fashion.

As such, an approach would have implications for resources, requiring the sponsoring societies to consider methods to commission this, as well as agreeing on specific operating procedures for such an innovation for both societies, due consideration and joint agreement prospectively would be required. In spite of such barriers, such an approach would be the most appropriate to truly achieve ongoing evidence‐based guidance within clinical practice.

### Dimensional and categorical approaches to hypochondriasis [^a477a05d]. Psychological Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The DSM-IV definition of hypochondriasis is contrasted with hypochondriacal dimensions as provided by the Whiteley Index (WI) and Illness Attitude Scales (IAS).

Methods

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on self-report data from 570 patients with mental and psychophysiological disorders. Of these, 319 were additionally diagnosed according to DSM-IV by structured interviews.

Results

The three 'classic' factors of the WI labelled disease phobia, somatic symptoms and disease conviction were confirmed. The IAS consisted of two dimensions indicating health anxiety and illness behaviour. The overall scores of both instruments were highly correlated (0.80). Optimal cut-off points for case identification yielded sensitivity/specificity rates of 71/80% (WI) and 72/79% (IAS). The IAS was superior to the WI when patients with hypochondriacal disorder were to be discriminated from non-hypochondriacal somatizers. Largest group differences were found for scales related to affective components (health anxieties), smallest for illness behaviours. Affective components of hypochondriasis explained more variance of diagnostic group membership than somatization symptoms. The subscales of disease phobia (WI) and health anxiety (IAS) were most sensitive to treatment-related changes.

Conclusions

The self-rating scales are valid for screening, case definition and dimensional assessment of hypochondriacal disorder, including the differentiation between hypochondriasis and somatization. The existence of distinguishable affective and cognitive components was confirmed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^12817a7b]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders seen by clinicians in both primary and secondary care. Since publication of the last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline in 2007, substantial advances have been made in understanding its complex pathophysiology, resulting in its re-classification as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, rather than a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Moreover, there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning the diagnosis, investigation and management of IBS. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based management of patients. One of the strengths of this guideline is that the recommendations for treatment are based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of trial-based and network meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of dietary, pharmacological and psychological therapies in treating IBS. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, summarising both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, this guideline identifies novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need for future research.

### Guidelines on the irritable bowel syndrome: mechanisms and practical management [^0dcb8871]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

IBS affects 5–11% of the population of most countries. Prevalence peaks in the third and fourth decades, with a female predominance.

Aim

To provide a guide for the assessment and management of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

Methods

Members of the Clinical Services Committee of The British Society of Gastroenterology were allocated particular areas to produce review documents. Literature searching included systematic searches using electronic databases such as Pubmed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases and extensive personal reference databases.

Results

Patients can usefully be classified by predominant bowel habit. Few investigations are needed except when diarrhoea is a prominent feature. Alarm features may warrant further investigation. Adverse psychological features and somatisation are often present. Ascertaining the patients' concerns and explaining symptoms in simple terms improves outcome. IBS is a heterogeneous condition with a range of treatments, each of which benefits a small proportion of patients. Treatment of associated anxiety and depression often improves bowel and other symptoms. Randomised placebo controlled trials show benefit as follows: cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic interpersonal therapy improve coping; hypnotherapy benefits global symptoms in otherwise refractory patients; antispasmodics and tricyclic antidepressants improve pain; ispaghula improves pain and bowel habit; 5-HT(3) antagonists improve global symptoms, diarrhoea, and pain but may rarely cause unexplained colitis; 5-HT(4) agonists improve global symptoms, constipation, and bloating; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve global symptoms.

Conclusions

Better ways of identifying which patients will respond to specific treatments are urgently needed.

### PTSD in primary care – an update on evidence-based management [^b9f3ad87]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in primary care but it is frequently not detected or treated adequately. There is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for PTSD in primary care, but clinicians should remain alert to PTSD among patients exposed to trauma, and among those with other psychiatric disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple somatic symptoms and chronic pain. A two-stage process of screening (involving the PC-PTSD), and, for those with a positive screen, a diagnostic evaluation (using the PTSD-Checklist), can detect most patients with PTSD with few false positives. Evidence-based recommendations are provided for treatment in primary care or referral to mental health.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e5c15b57]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer", yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less", and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split". Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders", and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable". "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks". Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief", and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3", in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses".

### Somatic symptom disorder: a diagnostic dilemma [^2dedc6ae]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a diagnosis that was introduced with publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013. It eliminated the diagnoses of somatisation disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis and pain disorder; most of the patients who previously received these diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with SSD. The main feature of this disorder is a patient's concern with physical symptoms for which no biological cause is found. It requires psychiatric assessment to exclude comorbid psychiatric disease. Failure to recognise this disorder may lead the unwary physician or surgeon to embark on investigations or diagnostic procedures which may result in iatrogenic complications. It also poses a significant financial burden on the healthcare service. Patients with non-specific abdominal pain have a poor symptomatic prognosis with continuing use of medical services. Proven treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness therapy and pharmacological treatment using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. The authors describe the case of a 31-year-old woman with an emotionally unstable personality disorder and comorbid disease presenting to the emergency department with a 3-week history of left-sided abdominal and leg pain. Despite a plethora of investigations, no organic cause for her pain was found. She was reviewed by the multidisciplinary team including surgeons, physicians, neurologists and psychiatrists. A diagnosis of somatoform symptom disorder was subsequently rendered. As patients with SSD will present to general practice and the emergency department rather than psychiatric settings, this case provides a cautionary reminder of furthering the need for appropriate recognition of this condition.

### Treating irritable bowel syndrome through an interdisciplinary approach [^56c54f4e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This review is based on the research and guidelines for IBS management. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases (Google Scholar, EBSCO, Springer, ScienceDirect) with a focus on the latest publications. In reference to the characteristics of IBS, including new findings regarding etiopathogenesis, an interdisciplinary treatment approach is proposed and the role of medical and psychological interventions is underlined. The review may be useful for matching the best strategy for IBS management.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^9a86e9b0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

There are also several positives for PA patients from the 2024 NICE guidelines

The guidelines' emphasis on a symptom-based approach to treatment is an urgent and necessary shift that could positively influence current practice. They also stress the importance of individualised care, suggesting that B 12 replacement dosage, frequency, and delivery method may need to be tailored to ensure treatment efficacy. However, many patients require treatment more frequently than current guidelines suggest. Survey data indicates that up to 50% of patients require more frequent injections to manage their symptoms effectively (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837). This is consistent with findings from Hooper et al. where 65% of patients received B 12 injections according to current guidelines (every 2–3 months). Further qualitative evidence from interviews also highlights that many PA patients considered the current guidelines too restrictive, with symptoms reoccurring well before the next planned injection.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^d8568e20]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology in order to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The basic task for the working group therefore was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature in order to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

Methods

Extensive reviews of the literature together with a thorough and detailed discussion of the various topics, by a working group including of experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

Results and Conclusions

Recommendations are given for the management of patients with acute stone colic and for active removal of stones from the ureter and kidney. Moreover, the principles for risk evaluation of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are given.

### The prevalence of personality disorders in hypochondriasis [^b415339e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although Axis I hypochondriasis is closely related to certain personality characteristics, the nature and extent of personality dysfunction in these patients still needs clarification. This study assessed the prevalence of personality disorders observed in hypochondriacal patients, described the types and comorbidity of personality disorders, and compared the psychological distress of patients with and without the most common comorbid personality disorder.

Method

One hundred fifteen patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for hypochondriasis completed self-administered assessments, including the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4+ (PDQ-4+), the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Whiteley Index, and the Somatic Symptom Inventory. These data were taken from a study conducted between September 1997 and November 2001.

Results

Eighty-eight patients (76.5%) had 1 or more personality disorders, whereas 27 patients (23.5%) had no personality disorders. Fifty-one patients (44.3%) had more than 3 personality disorders. The most common personality disorder in the hypochondriacal patients was obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD; 55.7%), followed by avoidant personality disorder (40.9%). The comorbidity of OCPD and avoidant personality disorder was 53.1% (34 of 64 patients with OCPD). The total PDQ-4+ score of the 64 patients with OCPD was significantly higher than that of the 51 patients without OCPD. On the SCL-90-R, the 64 patients with OCPD showed significantly higher scores on all of 3 global indices and 7 of 10 primary symptom dimensions (paranoid ideation, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, and psychoticism) on the SCL-90-R compared to the 51 patients without OCPD.

Conclusions

The high prevalence of personality disorders, particularly OCPD, among patients with hypochondriasis suggests that consideration of personality features is important in assessment and therapeutic interventions for hypochondriasis.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^466a7425]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

History

Descriptions of what was likely catatonia date back to antiquity. However, major interest in motor manifestations of psychiatric disorders began only in the mid-19th century. At that time, Griesinger drew a distinction between abnormal movements that were the product of agency and those that were unconscious processes. The term 'catatonia' was coined by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1874, who described an early phase of alternation between excitement and stupor, followed by a phase of qualitatively abnormal movements, though other 19th-century authors had described similar phenomena.

By the end of the 19th century, Kraepelin's diagnostic classifications of psychiatric disorders incorporated catatonia into an enlarged concept of dementia praecox where motor signs were the result of psychological processes, and therefore catatonia was subsumed under the diagnosis of schizophrenia by Eugen Bleuler. This differed from Kahlbaum, who had conceived of catatonia as an independent disorder with motor, behavioural and affective signs as primary manifestations of the disorder. Moreover, Kahlbaum emphasised the strong occurrence of affective symptoms in combination with motor and behavioural abnormalities.

Catatonia as a subtype of schizophrenia went on to be the conceptual model used by earlier editions of the ICD and DSM. However, two papers published in 1976 challenged this assumption, arguing that catatonia appears in a range of psychiatric and medical disorders, not exclusively (or even mainly) in schizophrenia. The current major diagnostic manuals (ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR) have since endorsed a broader concept of catatonia and permit diagnosis in the context of other mental and physical disorders, as well as providing an 'unspecified' category.

### Panic disorder and agoraphobia: an overview and commentary on DSM-5 changes [^26562e40]. Depression and Anxiety (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published DSM-5 contains a number of changes pertinent to panic disorder and agoraphobia. These changes include separation of panic disorder and agoraphobia into separate diagnoses, the addition of criteria and guidelines for distinguishing agoraphobia from specific phobia, the addition of a 6-month duration requirement for agoraphobia, the addition of panic attacks as a specifier to any DSM-5 diagnosis, changes to descriptors of panic attack types, as well as various changes to the descriptive text. It is crucial that clinicians and researchers working with individuals presenting with panic attacks and panic-like symptoms understand these changes. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a summary of the main changes, to critique the changes in the context of available empirical evidence, and to highlight clinical implications and potential impact on mental health service utilization. Several of the changes have the potential to improve access to evidence-based treatment; yet, although certain changes appear justified in that they were based on converging evidence from different empirical sources, other changes appear questionable, at least based on the information presented in the DSM-5 text and related publications. Ongoing research of DSM-5 panic disorder and agoraphobia as well as application of the new diagnostic criteria in clinical contexts is needed to further inform the strengths and limitations of DSM-5 conceptualizations of panic disorder and agoraphobia.

### A-MUPS score to differentiate patients with somatic symptom disorder from those with medical disease for complaints of non-acute pain [^cb27c742]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is conceptualized as a psychiatric disorder, which shows an excess degree of suffering beyond that resulting from the presence of somatic symptoms alone, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition. The diagnostic criteria consist of the following: one or more somatic symptoms that disrupt patients' daily life (criterion A); excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to their symptoms (criterion B); and a symptomatic state that typically persists for more than six months (criterion C).SSD encompasses somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder (SFD), pain disorder, and hypochondriasis (with somatic symptoms) of SFD as defined in DSM-IV, although excessive inclusion of patients is a concern, and can be diagnosed with or without the presence of medical disease (MD). In this study, because these various names may be confusing, we use the term SSD to encompass all the terms that are included in the concept of SSD.

SSD is common because somatization accounts for 10% of primary care patients, which is the same prevalence as depression and anxiety. However, because SSD is one of the most difficult diseases to diagnose, doctors may order unnecessary diagnostic procedures to avoid overlooking MD. Such excessive interventions can foster somatic fixations of patients, leading to functional impairment, higher disability days, and increased health care costs. In addition, the early detection of mental illness is critical even for patients with somatic disease because mental treatments are recommended as soon as possible so as to prevent chronic state. Thus, there is a need to develop a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach that may be applied at an early stage.

However, no gold standard diagnostic method has been established for SSD. Even the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 necessitate clinical experience when making assessments. Moreover, previous studies have used various terms for medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS), such as somatization, SFD, and functional somatic symptom, and these various definitions and methods might have led to inconsistent conclusions. Thus, SSD and its clinical features in particular have scarcely been studied.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) differential diagnosis clarifications note that depressive ruminations do not elicit compulsive rituals and usually concern self-criticism, failures, guilt, regret, or pessimism regarding the future; worries of generalized anxiety disorder focus on real life problems and usually do not lead to compulsive rituals and may present as a vague but troubling feeling of foreboding, whereas the obsessions of OCD always have clear content; the intrusive thoughts and images of posttraumatic stress disorder are replays of actual events, not anticipations of future events; and obsessions held with delusional conviction can be distinguished from schizophrenic and manic delusions by the absence of other signs and symptoms of these disorders, with delusional obsessions having typical OCD content rather than content related to persecution, grandiosity, passivity experiences, or ideas of reference.

of treatment. Setting and Participants Participants were 80 patients from primary care practices and 107 volunteers responding to public announcements, all of whom exceeded a predetermined cutoff score on a hypochondriasis self-report questionnaire on 2 successive occasions. Intervention A scripted, 6-session, individual CBT intervention was compared with. of the 2 groups were similar at baseline. Using an intent-to-treat analytic strategy, a consistent pattern of statistically and clinically significant treatment effects was found at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, adjusting for baseline covariates that included educational level, generalized psychiatric distress, and participant status. At 12-month follow-up. existing treatment literature suggests a role for a variety of psychosocial interventions, although none has been conclusively validated.

In the only large-scale, rigorous, randomized controlled trial to date, cognitive therapy and behavioral stress management were both more effective than a waiting list control condition. 13 We have proposed that hypochondriasis can be understood as a self-perpetuating. symptom attributions, restructure beliefs and expectations about health and disease, correct misunderstandings about the medical care process, modify maladaptive illness behaviors, and learn techniques of selective attention and distraction. We hypothesized that the CBT intervention would alleviate the symptoms of hypochondriasis more effectively than medical care as usual. A randomized, usual care control group design was used.

To avoid a "contamination" effect, the individual primary care physician was the unit of randomization, and all patients clustered within each physician's practice were assigned to the experimental treatment or to the control condition. Subjects were assessed. Fourth Edition criteria for hypochondriasis and half of whom had subthreshold hypochondriasis. The precise cutoff score of 150 was determined from previous studies3, 17–19 and was chosen because we believed that many subthreshold individuals were sufficiently. hypochondriacal to be in need of treatment and would be able to benefit from it. Signed informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Brigham and Women's Hospital Human Research Committee requirements.

Subjects meeting initial eligibility criteria and exceeding the screening cutoff completed the baseline research battery, which included a second administration of the screening. proceedings, or litigation. Cognitive behavior therapy was administered individually in six 90-minute sessions at weekly intervals. Each session was tightly scripted and devoted to 1 of 5 factors that cause patients to amplify somatic symptoms and misattribute them to serious disease: attention and bodily. contained the following 5 practical suggestions for medical management that were designed to augment the individual therapy: make improved coping with somatic symptoms rather than symptom elimination the goal of medical management; uncouple access to the physician from symptom status by scheduling regular appointments; provide only limited reassurance; explain the.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder SRI discontinuation is associated with widely varying reported rates of relapse or discontinuation for insufficient clinical response after double-blind switch to placebo, ranging from 89% within 7 weeks to 24% within 28 weeks. An open discontinuation study reported significantly higher 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year relapse rates for the patients whose SRI treatment was discontinued. Given these observations, discontinuation of pharmacotherapy should be carefully considered, and for most patients, continued treatment of some form is recommended.

### Antispasmodics for chronic abdominal pain: analysis of north American treatment options [^ef31a2b0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Mechanisms of action for antispasmodic agents available in North America

A 2014 American Gastroenterological Association guideline noted that antispasmodics could be used to treat IBS symptoms; a new guideline is currently under development. The American Gastroenterological Association provided a conditional recommendation for antispasmodics based on the low certainty of evidence (e.g. methodologic limitations and publication bias). In addition, data were based on continuous, rather than as-needed, use, and not all antispasmodics evaluated are currently available in the United States. The 2018 American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) monograph suggested that certain antispasmodic drugs (i.e. dicyclomine, hyoscine, cimetropium, drotaverine, otilonium, and pinaverium) may improve IBS symptoms, although this was a weak recommendation based on the very low quality of evidence. Importantly, data are limited for the antispasmodics currently available in the United States. Recently published ACG guidelines (2021) for the treatment of IBS, which used a GRADE approach, do not recommend the use of smooth muscle antispasmodics currently available in the United States for the treatment of IBS. Although antispasmodics are frequently prescribed for the treatment of FD, a 2017 joint ACG/Canadian Association of Gastroenterology dyspepsia guideline does not recommend their use for this condition. There are currently no formal guidelines or recommendations regarding the use of antispasmodics for treating CAPS.

Given the discrepancies in recent recommendations, the aim of this review was to examine the efficacy and safety of individual antispasmodics available in North America (i.e. alverine, dicyclomine, hyoscine, hyoscyamine, mebeverine, otilonium, pinaverium, and trimebutine; Table 1; Figure 1) for the treatment of chronic abdominal pain in patients with these pain-predominant disorders.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^2dc7d660]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location and size, and the patient's comorbidities and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations. Several institutions around the world have issued guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the evidence available and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insight.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analysed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis worldwide, and gives novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

This revision of the 2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for the evidence-based pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders provides an update on key steps in diagnosis and clinical management, including recognition, acute treatment, longer-term treatment, combination treatment, and further approaches for patients who have not responded to first-line interventions. A consensus meeting involving international experts in anxiety disorders reviewed the main subject areas and considered the strength of supporting evidence and its clinical implications. The guidelines are based on available evidence, were constructed after extensive feedback from participants, and are presented as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making in primary, secondary and tertiary medical care. They may also serve as a source of information for patients, their carers, and medicines management and formulary committees.

Best practice advice 3 — "Gastroenterologists should know the structure and core features of the most effective brain–gut psychotherapies". "Brain–gut psychotherapies are those that leverage the brain's ability to bring under voluntary control those symptom processes that seem, initially, to be driven completely by the gut". They "share several important features that distinguish them from traditional psychotherapy approaches — they are typically short-term and GI symptom–focused; and patients with comorbid chronic depression or anxiety are typically not good candidates". "These therapies offer the best results when delivered by a health psychologist or other medically trained mental health provider who is familiar with the physiological basis of symptoms and the goals of the medical team". "Brain–gut therapies are skills-based and focus specifically on the down-regulation of unpleasant GI sensations, decreasing avoidance behaviors associated with fear of having symptoms and building coping and resilience to stress or lifestyle changes imposed by a chronic condition", and "differ from more traditional forms of psychotherapy, which focus on providing support, normalizing psychopathology, and/or facilitating insight into the reason the patient is experiencing symptoms".

### Assessment of global guidelines for preventive chemotherapy against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis: a cost-effectiveness modelling study [^038016c2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

WHO guidelines recommend annual treatment for schistosomiasis or soil-transmitted helminthiasis when prevalence in school-aged children is at or above a threshold of 50% and 20%, respectively. Separate treatment guidelines are used for these two helminthiases, and integrated community-wide treatment is not recommended. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of changing prevalence thresholds and treatment guidelines under an integrated delivery framework.

Methods

We developed a dynamic, age-structured transmission and cost-effectiveness model that simulates integrated preventive chemotherapy programmes against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. We assessed a 5-year treatment programme with praziquantel (40 mg/kg per treatment) against schistosomiasis and albendazole (400 mg per treatment) against soil-transmitted helminthiasis at 75% coverage. We defined strategies as highly cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than the World Bank classification for a low-income country (gross domestic product of US$1045 per capita). We calculated the prevalence thresholds for cost-effective preventive chemotherapy of various strategies, and estimated treatment needs for sub-Saharan Africa.

Findings

Annual preventive chemotherapy against schistosomiasis was highly cost-effective in treatment of school-aged children at a prevalence threshold of 5% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.7–5.2; current guidelines recommend treatment at 50% prevalence) and for community-wide treatment at a prevalence of 15% (7.3–18.5; current recommendation is unclear, some community treatment recommended at 50% prevalence). Annual preventive chemotherapy against soil-transmitted helminthiasis was highly cost-effective in treatment of school-aged children at a prevalence of 20% (95% UI 5.4–30.5; current guidelines recommend treatment at 20% prevalence) and the entire community at 60% (35.3–85.1; no guidelines available). When both helminthiases were co-endemic, prevalence thresholds using integrated delivery were lower. Using this revised treatment framework, we estimated that treatment needs would be six times higher than WHO guidelines for praziquantel and two times higher for albendazole. An additional 21.3% (95% Bayesian credible interval 20.4–22.2) of the population changed from receiving non-integrated treatment under WHO guidelines to integrated treatment (both praziquantel and albendazole). Country-specific economic differences resulted in heterogeneity around these prevalence thresholds.

Interpretation

Annual preventive chemotherapy programmes against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis are likely to be highly cost-effective at prevalences lower than WHO recommendations. These findings support substantial treatment scale-up, community-wide coverage, integrated treatment in co-endemic settings that yield substantial cost synergies, and country-specific treatment guidelines.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^afd4a2c2]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) psychosocial and combined treatment research — further studies of psychosocial therapies are also necessary, including determining the relative efficacies of different cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment elements and the optimal schedule for administering CBT in the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of treatment, comparing the efficacies of different CBT formats, and studying other psychosocial therapies. For combining medications and psychosocial therapies, more studies are needed to determine optimal methods to achieve the fastest onset of therapeutic action, the greatest degree of response, and the least likelihood of relapse during active treatment and following treatment discontinuation, as well as to develop and test strategies for relapse prevention and identify the necessary length of psychotherapy and of pharmacotherapy before treatment can be safely discontinued.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): practical strategies for pharmacological and somatic treatment in adults [^bf87a68c]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

This narrative review gathers together a range of international experts to critically appraise the existing trial-based evidence relating to the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for obsessive compulsive disorder in adults. We discuss the diagnostic evaluation and clinical characteristics followed by treatment options suitable for the clinician working from primary through to specialist psychiatric care. Robust data supports the effectiveness of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and clomipramine in the short-term and the longer-term treatment and for relapse prevention. Owing to better tolerability, SSRIs are acknowledged as the first-line pharmacological treatment of choice. For those patients for whom first line treatments have been ineffective, evidence supports the use of adjunctive antipsychotic medication, and some evidence supports the use of high-dose SSRIs. Novel compounds are also the subject of active investigation. Neurosurgical treatments, including ablative lesion neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation, are reserved for severely symptomatic individuals who have not experienced sustained response to both pharmacological and cognitive behavior therapies.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^b6e07362]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Changing treatments and pursuing sequential treatment trials — First treatments rarely produce freedom from all obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms. When a good response is not achieved after 13–20 weeks of weekly outpatient CBT, 8 weeks of daily CBT, or 8–12 weeks of SRI treatment (including 4–6 weeks at the highest comfortably tolerated dose), the psychiatrist should decide with the patient when, whether, and how to alter the treatment [I]. This decision will depend on the degree of suffering and disability the patient wishes to accept, and it is important to consider that illness can bring secondary gains and that depressed mood can diminish hopefulness; the psychiatrist may have to address issues such as these when patients are not well motivated to pursue further treatments despite limited improvement [I].

### A practical approach to acromegaly management in Latin America [^7623cbcf]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based treatment guidelines have undoubtedly advanced medical practice and supported optimal management of acromegaly, but their application may be hampered by limited access to the latest treatment options.

Methods

In this retrospective, narrative review, the authors revisited existing treatment guidelines for acromegaly in Latin America. These were considered in conjunction with published evidence chosen at the authors' discretion.

Findings

In a socially and economically diverse region, such as Latin America, any regional practice guidelines need to appreciate that recommended treatment options, such as surgery by expert pituitary surgical teams and drug therapies, especially somatostatin analogs, are often not available due to limited resources. In these instances, physicians may be obliged to apply less effective therapeutic options.

Conclusions

The current article looks at the practical aspects of acromegaly management in Latin America and discusses this in the context of existing guidelines. Furthermore, we consider potential strategies to make better use of resources through combination and multimodal approaches to treatment.

### Qualitative review of clinical guidelines for medical and surgical management of urolithiasis: consensus and controversy 2020 [^bcbfd812]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Many major guidelines across the globe address the medical and surgical management of urolithiasis. We elected to compare and contrast the recommendations among the 5 most highly cited guidelines on stone disease to offer insights on where evidence has created a consensus and where there remains ongoing controversy and hence a need for the pursuit of studies that will provide a higher level of evidence.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the American Urological Association 2019 medical and 2016 surgical guidelines, the 2016 Canadian Urological Association guidelines, the 2020 European Association of Urology guidelines, the 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the 2019 Urological Association of Asia guidelines. Tables correlating guideline statements by topic were created, and a comparative analysis was conducted to ascertain consensus and discordance.

Results

Comparative analysis of recommendations from the American Urological Association guidelines to the Canadian Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and Urological Association of Asia revealed a high consensus surrounding the medical management of stones. In terms of the surgical management of stones, there is high consensus regarding the treatment of ureteral stones including medical expulsive therapy using alpha blockers, not prestenting for uncomplicated ureteroscopy and employment of either ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy as first line treatment. There is high consensus among the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Urological Association of Asia guidelines regarding renal stone treatment. The Canadian Urological Association does not have guidelines on the management of renal stones. Unlike the American Urological Association and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Urological Association and European Association of Urology make specific recommendations regarding selection of patients for shockwave lithotripsy procedures, including stone density, skin-to-stone distance, treatment rate, acoustic coupling and postshockwave lithotripsy use of medical expulsive therapy.

Conclusions

There are many areas of consensus and only minor areas of conflict among the most up-to-date American Urological Association, Canadian Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Urological Association of Asia guidelines on the medical and surgical management of stone disease. Conflicts among guidelines and areas of low evidence, such as followup imaging strategies and stone surveillance, the use of a ureteral access sheath in ureteroscopy and guidance on the use of miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy, are opportunities for novel, impactful high grade clinical studies.
