## Question

I have one patient how is 26 years and have quiet eye no keratic preceptate or synchiea but she has cataract and glcuoma, i did for her cataract surgery and she devloped synchia and anterior chamber inflammation post operative what do think about this case

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 26-year-old with cataract and glaucoma who developed postoperative posterior synechiae and anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery, including differential diagnosis, management, and prevention strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies for the new synechiae and inflammation. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and exclude infectious endophthalmitis. Next, I will review immediate management priorities, including anti-inflammatory therapy and IOP control. After that, I need to consider synechiae management and IOL-related issues. Finally, I should evaluate preoperative planning and perioperative strategies to prevent recurrence and outline long-term follow-up and counseling points, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the likely etiologies in this 26-year-old with presumed uveitic cataract and glaucoma who now has posterior synechiae and anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery; the most probable cause is a postoperative inflammatory exacerbation of underlying uveitis, which is well known to occur after cataract surgery in uveitic eyes and can lead to posterior synechiae formation, fibrin, and prolonged inflammation, especially if inflammation was not optimally controlled preoperatively [^111A6Wup] [^113xnty1] [^112vmdyM].

> Wait, let me verify the differential before concluding; I need to ensure we are not missing infectious endophthalmitis, TASS, retained lens material, or IOL malposition, because these can mimic or worsen inflammation and synechiae, and management diverges significantly if infection is present, so cultures and a careful slit-lamp exam for hypopyon, vitreous cells, and wound integrity are essential if there is any doubt [^117Ek4cW] [^112cSUBp] [^116ak1hv].

> I will now examine immediate management priorities; first, I should intensify topical corticosteroids to suppress inflammation and prevent further synechiae, using frequent prednisolone acetate 1% with a slow taper, and consider adjunctive NSAIDs, while monitoring IOP closely for steroid response and adding or adjusting glaucoma therapy as needed, because uncontrolled inflammation and IOP can synergistically damage the optic nerve in a young patient with preexisting glaucoma [^113xnty1] [^114uyCP2] [^111qaznc].

> Hold on, I should verify whether a steroid depot would help here; in uveitic eyes with significant postoperative inflammation, intravitreal or periocular triamcinolone can be considered, and low-dose intravitreal triamcinolone at the time of surgery has been associated with reduced postoperative inflammation and fewer synechiae, though IOP monitoring is critical due to steroid-induced hypertension risk [^111k3R66] [^113Z3qGK].

> Next, I should review synechiae management; short-acting mydriatic-cycloplegic agents can help break forming synechiae, whereas prolonged atropine can fix them in a dilated state, so I need to titrate cycloplegia carefully and consider early synechialysis if adhesions are organizing and impairing aqueous flow or vision, ideally within the first week to two weeks when fibrosis is less mature [^113xnty1] [^1118UgFF].

> Let me consider IOL-related contributors; I should confirm IOL position and orientation because malposition or optic-sulcus capture can perpetuate inflammation and synechiae, and if the IOL is contributing to iris chafe or pigment dispersion, repositioning or exchanging the lens may be necessary to halt the inflammatory cycle and protect the endothelium [^114uyCP2] [^1173ksnS].

> But wait, what if the inflammation is refractory despite aggressive topical therapy; I should double-check for retained lens material in the angle or sulcus using gonioscopy or imaging, because retained fragments can drive persistent inflammation and synechiae, and fragment removal or YAG laser to liberate trapped material may be required to control the inflammatory stimulus [^114uyCP2] [^116aj2JG].

> I need to ensure we address preoperative planning to prevent recurrence; inflammation should be quiescent for at least 3 months before elective cataract surgery in uveitic eyes, with perioperative steroid intensification and, in select cases, intravitreal or periocular steroid at the time of surgery, while minimizing iris manipulation and avoiding iris prolapse to reduce synechiae risk [^111A6Wup] [^116CYtZF] [^111zrRai].

> Hold on, I should verify IOL choices and surgical technique; placing the IOL entirely in the capsular bag is preferred, and in high-risk uveitic eyes, optic capture or other modified techniques may help prevent posterior synechiae, while a larger-diameter capsulorhexis and thorough removal of lens epithelial cells can reduce anterior capsule phimosis and late IOL complications that perpetuate inflammation [^1127r1Tr].

> Next, I should review long-term follow-up and counseling; uveitic eyes require closer postoperative monitoring for inflammation, IOP spikes, CME, and synechiae recurrence, and patients should be counseled that visual recovery may be slower and less robust than in non-uveitic eyes, with a higher likelihood of needing additional interventions such as YAG capsulotomy or glaucoma procedures over time [^112vmdyM] [^113SkZx6] [^113GsMez].

> Let me reconsider the glaucoma piece; persistent or recurrent inflammation can worsen trabecular outflow and promote PAS, so I should monitor gonioscopy over time, escalate anti-inflammatory therapy promptly with any flare, and adjust glaucoma treatment proactively to protect the optic nerve, recognizing that steroid-induced IOP elevation must be balanced against the need to control inflammation [^111qaznc] [^113xnty1].

> In summary, I should confirm the working diagnosis as postoperative uveitic exacerbation with posterior synechiae, exclude infection and retained material, intensify anti-inflammatory therapy with consideration of a steroid depot, carefully manage synechiae with targeted cycloplegia and early synechialysis when indicated, verify IOL position and address malposition, and implement a uveitis-aware perioperative protocol for any future surgery, all while maintaining close IOP surveillance and coordinating care with the uveitis specialist to optimize outcomes in this young patient [^111A6Wup] [^113xnty1] [^1127r1Tr] [^113GsMez].

---

This patient's postoperative synechiae and anterior chamber inflammation are most likely due to **pre-existing uveitis** [^111A6Wup] or **exaggerated postoperative inflammation** [^114uyCP2] in a young adult with cataract and glaucoma. Management should include **aggressive topical steroids** [^113xnty1], cycloplegia, and close IOP monitoring; if inflammation persists, consider periocular or intravitreal steroids [^111k3R66] or systemic therapy [^111A6Wup]. Synechiae can be managed with mydriatics and, if needed, **Nd:YAG laser synechiolysis** [^1118UgFF]. Early, frequent follow-up is essential to prevent **secondary glaucoma** [^113xnty1] and vision loss.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for postoperative synechiae and anterior chamber inflammation in a young adult with cataract and glaucoma includes:

- **Uveitis**: Pre-existing or postoperative inflammation can cause synechiae formation [^111A6Wup].

- **Exaggerated postoperative inflammation**: Younger patients may have a more pronounced inflammatory response [^114NeAZq].

- **Steroid-induced IOP elevation**: Postoperative steroids can raise IOP, worsening glaucoma [^116449Fq].

- **Infectious endophthalmitis**: Rare but serious; typically presents with pain, hypopyon, and vitritis [^116ak1hv].

- **Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS)**: Sterile inflammation from irrigating solutions or instrument contamination [^117Lw9zQ].

- **Retained lens material**: Can provoke persistent inflammation and synechiae [^114uyCP2].

Given the absence of pain, hypopyon, or vitritis, **infectious endophthalmitis is unlikely** [^116ak1hv]. TASS is also unlikely given the delayed presentation. The most likely causes are **pre-existing uveitis** or **exaggerated postoperative inflammation** [^111A6Wup] [^114uyCP2].

---

## Pathophysiology

Synechiae result from **adhesions between the iris and adjacent structures** (lens capsule or corneal endothelium) driven by inflammation. In uveitis, inflammatory mediators cause fibrin deposition and iris adhesion formation [^1118UgFF]. Cataract surgery can trigger inflammation, especially in younger patients or those with pre-existing inflammation, leading to synechiae [^111A6Wup].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Aggressive topical steroids (e.g. prednisolone acetate 1% every 1–2 hours initially) are first-line to control inflammation [^116Ff9h4].

- **Cycloplegic agents**: Short-acting mydriatics (e.g. cyclopentolate) help prevent and break synechiae; avoid long-acting agents like atropine, which can fix synechiae in a dilated state [^113xnty1].

- **NSAIDs**: Topical NSAIDs (e.g. ketorolac) can reduce inflammation and synechiae formation [^116TM5Ch].

- **Periocular or intravitreal steroids**: If topical therapy is insufficient, consider periocular (sub-Tenon's) or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide [^111k3R66].

- **Systemic steroids**: For severe or refractory inflammation, systemic steroids may be required [^112AE5to].

---

### Surgical management

If medical therapy fails, **Nd:YAG laser synechiolysis** can lyse synechiae and restore pupil mobility [^notfound]. Rarely, **surgical synechiolysis** is indicated for extensive or recurrent synechiae.

---

## Prognosis and complications

With appropriate management, **prognosis is generally favorable** [^112vmdyM]. Persistent inflammation can cause secondary glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, and vision loss [^113xnty1]. Close follow-up is essential to monitor for these complications [^113GsMez].

---

## Preventive measures

Preoperative control of inflammation for at least 3 months before surgery reduces postoperative complications [^111A6Wup]. Intraoperative use of **viscoelastic agents** and gentle iris manipulation minimizes trauma [^111zrRai]. Postoperative **aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy** and close monitoring are critical [^113xnty1].

---

## Recommended follow-up schedule

- **First postoperative day**: Evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and anterior segment status [^113GsMez].

- **First week**: Reassess inflammation, synechiae, and IOP [^111DXZPj].

- **First month**: Gradual taper of steroids if inflammation is controlled.

- **Long-term**: Regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence and complications [^113xnty1].

---

The patient's postoperative synechiae and inflammation most likely reflect **pre-existing uveitis** or **exaggerated postoperative inflammation**. Aggressive medical therapy, including topical steroids and cycloplegia, is first-line; escalate to periocular or intravitreal steroids if needed. Close follow-up is essential to detect and manage complications early.

Postoperative management in uveitis — the postoperative use of short-acting topical mydriatic agents may help to prevent postoperative synechiae formation, whereas fixed dilation with long-acting cycloplegic agents such as atropine may lead to formation of posterior synechiae in the dilated state; adjunctive corticosteroids at the time of surgery (IV, periocular, or intraocular) should be considered; patients with uveitis are at risk of postoperative inflammatory exacerbation, so eyes with uveitis generally require a greater frequency and duration of topical anti-inflammatory treatment and should be monitored closely for complications such as severe iridocyclitis, secondary glaucoma, posterior synechiae, secondary membranes, and cystoid macular edema (CME); postoperative inflammation and CME generally respond to anti-inflammatory treatments, and postoperative coordination of management of uveitis patients with a uveitis care provider is recommended.

Cataract — care management states that treatment is indicated when visual function no longer meets the patient's needs and cataract surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement; cataract removal is also indicated for clinically significant anisometropia, interference with diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology, lens-caused inflammation and secondary glaucoma, or when the lens induces primary angle closure or other lens-related glaucoma; surgery should not be performed when tolerable refractive correction meets the patient's needs and desires, when surgery is not expected to improve visual function and no other indication for lens removal exists, when the patient cannot safely undergo surgery because of coexisting medical or ocular conditions, when appropriate postoperative care cannot be arranged, or when the patient or patient's surrogate decision maker is unable to give informed consent for nonemergent surgery; indications for second eye surgery are the same as for the first eye, most cataract surgery in the US is performed by small-incision phacoemulsification with foldable IOL implantation on an outpatient basis, and there is substantial evidence that intracameral antibiotic administration reduces the risk of postop endophthalmitis while increasing evidence suggest topical antibiotics do not add to benefit of intracameral injections.

### Herpetic uveitis caused by herpes simplex virus after cataract surgery in a patient without prior viral keratitis or uveitis: a case report [^116ak1hv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Herpetic anterior uveitis is characterized by iris atrophy, acutely elevated IOP, scattered keratic precipitates, a dilated distorted pupil, and corneal involvement. Elevated IOP is the most common ocular complication in patients with herpetic anterior uveitis (75%), followed by keratitis (59%), posterior synechia (34%), cataract (32%), and glaucoma (15%). Although it is reported that patients with HSV anterior uveitis often show significant inflammation in the anterior chamber, persistent high IOP with minimal anterior uveitis has also been documented as a less common presentation of herpes simplex uveitis after cataract surgery. The present case was atypical, given the presence of significant fibrinous inflammation in the anterior chamber.

Acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis is defined as endophthalmitis occurring ≤ 30 days after cataract surgery. The mean duration between cataract surgery and the diagnosis of endophthalmitis in such cases is 8 days. Risk factors for endophthalmitis after cataract surgery include advanced age, immunocompromised status, the presence of a septic focus in and around the eye, a posterior capsular break, and wound leakage. Postoperative endophthalmitis is characterized by significant inflammation in the anterior chamber and dense vitreous opacity. In recent years, molecular diagnostic techniques for the intraocular fluid have been used for the auxiliary diagnosis of endophthalmitis and viral uveitis, which have high sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic techniques involve methods such as PCR and next-generation sequencing. Pathogen-directed PCR has been a powerful tool for the diagnosis of intraocular infections. For PCR, primer pairs specific for selected organisms are used to amplify DNA or RNA from those organisms. However, a primary limitation of pathogen-directed PCR is that only organisms preselected for screening can be detected. Next-generation sequencing is a newer method for evaluating infections, with which one can sequence DNA fragments from a biopsy of infected intraocular fluid.

In the present case, a diagnosis of attenuated endophthalmitis should be considered. However, it seemed unlikely that a final diagnosis of attenuated endophthalmitis due to bacterial and/or fungal infection was correct because of the negative results for both vitreous sample culture and the next-generation sequencing test of the aqueous humor; as well as the good prognosis attained without antibiotics or antifungal therapy. Postoperation non-infectious inflammation due to surgery attacks is common in patients after cataract surgery. In this case, the activation of HSV may aggravate postoperative inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous body, which resembling the clinical picture of endophthalmitis.

### Outcomes of combined iStent trabecular micro-bypass and cataract surgery for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in a Saudi population [^116G2tS5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety

In this study, 36 eyes underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with implantation of one iStent device. During the entire period of follow-up, no loss of light perception, sight-threatening disorders, choroidal detachment, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, or hypotony maculopathy or stent-related complications were observed, including peripheral anterior synechiae, loss of stent, stent obstruction, or haemorrhage. In addition, no eyes needed to receive another glaucoma surgery during the follow-up period. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) significantly improved from 0.77 ± 0.56 LogMAR at baseline to 0.19 ± 0.23 LogMAR at 12 months/last follow-up (p < 0.005).

Transient findings were observed during the early post-operative period that are expected following phacoemulsification alone, including corneal edema, inflammation, and discomfort which were all mild and were resolved without sequelae. Eight (22.2%) eyes displayed IOP spikes which were primarily attributed to the steroid postoperative regimen and were successfully treated with glaucoma medications with no sequelae. In 1 of the 8 eyes, transient high IOP was observed on the operative day and was attributed to the entrapment of the viscoelastic substance within the anterior chamber. This patient was treated with 3 topical medications and IOP decreased on the first postop day and was controlled through all follow-up sessions. At 12 months follow-up, IOP was 13 mmHg on 2 medications, while pre-operatively the IOP was 19 mmHg on 2 medications.

### Standalone trabeculotomy and viscodilation of schlemm's canal and collector channels in open-angle glaucoma using the OMNI surgical system: 24-month outcomes [^111kATjX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety Outcomes

The procedure was safe and well tolerated in all eyes. Transient postoperative hyphema was seen in 17 eyes (44.7%) and was in all cases 1 mm or less. Other adverse events included choroidal effusion (3 eyes, 7.9%), anterior synechiae (2 eyes, 5.3%), transient lens-cornea touch associated with shallow anterior chamber was seen in 1 eye (2.6%). All of these events resolved spontaneously without intervention and with no sequelae. No secondary procedures were required to address adverse events.

One eye required additional glaucoma surgery at 12 months (Preserflo microshunt) and one eye had selective laser trabeculoplasty at six months. Six of the eyes underwent cataract surgery between 15 and 24 months of follow-up. One of these may have been related to the instance of lens-cornea touch noted above; however, the other five were likely a consequence of normal age-related cataract progression. The mean age of these patients was 69.2 years versus 65.8 years for all phakic patients.

Glaucoma status remained stable throughout follow-up in all eyes, with mean cup-disc ratio (0.64 to 0.66 units) and mean visual field mean deviation (−3.3 to −3.4 dB) unchanged from baseline in the 26 eyes followed for 24 months.

### Clinical outcomes of LAN microhook-assisted goniotomy combined with phacoemulsification in mid-to-late primary angle-closure glaucoma with cataract [^116RpEeF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, these data support that a 90° nasal, non-excisional microhook goniotomy can suffice in many eyes. In a limited-arc, tissue-preserving strategy, the rationale is to minimize intraocular manipulation while recruiting an active outflow segment. Potential risk–benefit advantages (e.g. less exposure to bleeding, focal TM trauma, pigment dispersion, postoperative inflammation, and PAS recurrence) remain mechanistic/biologic plausibility pending adequately powered comparative trials.

Why a 90° arc can be sufficient (risk–benefit perspective). As noted above, aqueous outflow is segmental and the nasal quadrant is often favored anatomically and functionally. Goniotomy seeks to bypass the trabecular meshwork to access an active outflow segment; once SC and distal collectors are recruited, extending the arc beyond 90° may yield diminishing returns. In PACG eyes with synechial, inflamed angles, restricting the incision to a 90° nasal arc reduces intraocular manipulation and treated clock hours, which may theoretically lower exposure to bleeding, focal trabecular trauma, pigment dispersion, postoperative inflammation, and PAS recurrence, while maintaining clinically meaningful IOP lowering. These considerations align with our Month 6 outcomes; nevertheless, the study was not powered to compare safety across arc lengths, so any potential safety advantage remains mechanistic/biologic plausibility pending adequately powered comparative trials.

By qualitatively labeling severity and explicitly describing management and resolution, this study offers a more complete safety profile. Complications were predominantly mild to moderate and responded to conservative or office-based interventions. No irreversible vision-threatening outcomes occurred during the 6-month follow-up.

Follow-up was Limited to Month 6. In this cohort, IOP lowering and medication reduction were maintained through Month 6. Mechanistically, lens extraction deepens the anterior chamber and widens the angle, reducing appositional closure and the propensity for new synechiae; a 90° microhook goniotomy establishes a direct pathway to SC that may remain functionally patent, making persistence of benefit beyond Month 6 plausible. Conversely, chronic PACG may involve structural and functional alterations of the trabecular meshwork and distal outflow, and re-adhesion or synechial recurrence could attenuate effect over time, particularly after non-excisional goniotomy; these are hypotheses that require confirmation. Accordingly, we refrain from definitive claims beyond Month 6 and will evaluate time-to-failure (e.g. Kaplan-Meier for qualified/complete success), angle status, and any re-interventions with continued 12–24-month follow-up.

### Phacoemulsification with primary implantation of an intraocular lens in patients with uveitis [^112nPa4t]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cataract surgery in patients with uveitis is considered more challenging than surgery in patients with age-related cataract in general. Poor control of inflammation pre- and postoperatively increases the risk of complications. Abbouda et al showed that chronic postoperative inflammation and more than one relapse in 1 year was highly associated with macular edema. Other factors that may influence the outcome include etiology, anatomical localization, surgical approach and type of IOL. The importance of control of preoperative inflammation has been emphasized in several studies, and a good control of inflammation at least 3 months prior to the operation has been recommended. Table 6 summarizes previous reports on this topic.

Uveitis is a risk factor in the development of cataract; in this retrospective study, patients with uveitis were found to be significantly younger at surgery than patients without uveitis (P < 0.001), which is in accordance with other reports. In addition, we found that the most common etiologies were Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis and idiopathic anterior uveitis. A similar distribution has been shown in previous studies.

According to the data, preoperative glaucoma was seen in 20 (8.9%) control eyes and in 7 (12.1%) uveitic eyes. The incidence of uveitic glaucoma varies and has been described to occur in the range of 4%–19%, which agrees with the results of this study. However, the risk of developing glaucoma is dependent on factors such as uveitic etiology and duration, and in some uveitic groups, the incidence of glaucoma has been reported close to 100%. Few patients with uveitis had a history of CME compared to previous studies. As expected, posterior synechiae was only seen in eyes with uveitis, resulting in more frequent need of intraoperative mechanical pupil dilation. However, we did not find a significant difference in intraoperative complications between the two groups.

### Phacoemulsification with primary implantation of an intraocular lens in patients with uveitis [^115TDUBa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cataract in patients with uveitis is common primarily due to the inflammation itself and secondarily due to the treatment of inflammation with steroids. Cataract surgery is more challenging in these patients because of the intraoperative risk factors such as small pupils, posterior synechiae, increased risk of hemorrhage and other associated complications, for example, glaucoma, band keratopathy and cystoid macular edema (CME).–An optimal surgical strategy is still under debate, and primary implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) is not universally accepted. However, according to some studies, modern cataract surgery and optimal perioperative care might result in a satisfactory postoperative outcome in patients with uveitis who undergo primary IOL implantation. Etiologies of uveitis have an impact on prognosis, for example, posterior uveitis is associated with more chorioretinal complications and subsequently is responsible for a less favorable outcome. Till date, there is no consensus on pre-, intra- and postoperative management of patients with uveitis undergoing cataract surgery. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the results of modern cataract surgery in a cohort of patients with uveitis and compared it with the matched non-uveitic control data during a 5-year period. In addition, we identified the possible predictors of postoperative complications in patients with uveitis.

### Incidence of and risk factors for cataract in anterior uveitis [^112VDDoT]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To estimate the incidence/risk factors for cataract in noninfectious anterior uveitis.

Design

Retrospective multicenter cohort study (6 US tertiary uveitis sites, 1978–2010).

Methods

Data were harvested by trained expert reviewers, using protocol-driven review of experts' charts. We studied cataract incidence-newly reduced visual acuity worse than 20/40 attributed to cataract; or incident cataract surgery-in 3923 eyes of 2567 patients with anterior uveitis.

Results

Cataract developed in 507 eyes (54/1000 eye-years, 95% CI 49–59). Time-updated risk factors associated with cataract included older age (≥ 65 vs < 18 years: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 5.04, 95% CI 3.04–8.33), higher anterior chamber cell grade (P(trend) = 0.001), prior incisional glaucoma surgery (aHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.10–3.14), band keratopathy (aHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.47–3.37), posterior synechiae (aHR 3.71, 95% CI 2.83–4.87), and elevated intraocular pressure ≥ 30 vs 6–20 mm Hg (aHR 2.57, 95% CI 1.38–4.77). Primary acute (aHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30–1.15) and recurrent acute (aHR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55–0.98) had lower cataract risk than chronic anterior uveitis. Higher-dose prednisolone acetate 1%-equivalent use (≥ 2 drops/day) was associated with > 2-fold higher cataract risk in eyes with anterior chamber cell grades 0.5+ or lower but was not associated with higher cataract risk in the presence of anterior chamber cells of grade 1+ or higher.

Conclusions

Cataract complicates anterior uveitis in ∼5.4/100 eye-years. Several fixed and modifiable risk factors were identified, yielding a point system to guide cataract risk minimization. Topical corticosteroids only were associated with increased cataract risk when anterior chamber cells were absent or minimally present, suggesting their use to treat active inflammation (which itself is cataractogenic) does not cause a net increase in cataract incidence.

### Highlighting the limited efficacy of gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculectomy in fuchs uveitis syndrome: a case series [^112FqdeK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

FUS presents the most benign course among uveitis types, with minimal disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier, limited anterior chamber reaction, and only slight increases in laser flare meter readings, without significant impact on visual function. As there is no definitive cure, corticosteroids are generally not indicated except for short-term use during acute attacks, given their potential to induce glaucoma and cataract. Management focuses on balancing minimal steroid use with effective control of glaucoma and cataract, addressing their interactions as needed.

There is no consensus on the etiology of this type of secondary glaucoma. Possible causes include abnormal angle vascularization, angle hemorrhages following interventional anterior chamber procedures leading to PAS formation, excessive use of steroids, aqueous outflow obstruction due to inflammatory debris, trabecular meshwork scarring as a result of chronic inflammation. There is a widespread consensus regarding the triggering role of cataract surgery in glaucoma. Most researchers associate this with cataract surgery increasing angle hemorrhages and subsequently leading to the development of PAS. However, this is not very common, and in cases where PAS does not develop, the reason for the increase in IOP after cataract surgery might be fibrosis due to the increase in inflammation triggered by the surgery, which is seen in every uveitic condition. In this study, 3 patients had combined phaco-PPV at least 3 years before the glaucoma surgery. One patient didn't have significant cataract at the time of the GATT and no patient had PAS or fibrotic membranes in the angle region. During their follow-up, the use of steroids in the uveitis unit was maintained at an appropriate dose and potency without excess. Given that the effects of cataract surgery, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) formation, and steroid exposure were excluded, the etiology of glaucoma in these patients is presumed to involve trabecular meshwork (TM) obstruction caused by inflammatory debris. The success of GATT in conditions where the TM is obstructed by debris, such as pigment dispersion syndrome, bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAİT) syndrome, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, is at an impressive level. This raised the hypothesis that it might offer a potential solution in managing glaucoma, which is a morbidity factor of the disease. However, the results did not progress as expected, and all the patients' surgeries ended in failure. This suggests that FUS glaucoma should not be approached differently from classical uveitic glaucomas, both in terms of etiopathogenesis and surgical options. This outcome could be due to permanent scarring of the outflow structures rather than the trabecular meshwork being obstructed by inflammatory debris. The progressive increase in IOP observed in patients after GATT surgery suggested that the existing scarring process was exacerbated by inflammation.

Cataract surgery and uveitis — risk considerations and coordination: Patients with active inflammation, particularly those with anterior or intermediate uveitis, are at substantial risk for complications; in those with pre-existing iris damage or extensive posterior synechiae, a major potential problem is the development of adhesions between the iris and lens capsule postoperatively, and other potential problems include membrane formation, IOL deposits, zonular problems, and cystoid macular edema (CME). Coordination with the physicians treating the patient's uveitis and any systemic autoimmune disease prior to cataract surgery will provide appropriate prophylactic anti-inflammatory therapy and improve postsurgical outcomes.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^116CYtZF]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative management of uveitis — quiescence and corticosteroids: Ideally, inflammation should be inactive or controlled as much as possible before surgery, and many uveitis specialists advocate 3 months or more of quiescence before surgery as this reduces the risk of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME); even if a patient is on chronic anti-inflammatory therapy, additional topical and/or oral corticosteroids are often recommended before surgery to pre-empt severe postoperative exacerbations, and in one study, preoperative treatment with oral corticosteroids seemed to decrease the risk of postoperative CME. The medical regimen should be individualized based on the severity and sequelae of past episodes and prior control, and surgical procedures may need to be modified to manage pre-existing posterior synechiae, pupillary membranes, zonular compromise, and fibrotic scarring of the pupillary margin.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^117Ek4cW]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) — TASS is a sterile postoperative inflammatory reaction that typically presents within 12 to 48 hours following surgery and can mimic infectious endophthalmitis; common clinical findings are diffuse limbus-to-limbus corneal edema, severe anterior chamber cell and flare, fibrin, and hypopyon, and sequelae may include an atonic pupil, secondary glaucoma, and corneal decompensation. The inflammation associated with TASS usually responds to anti-inflammatory medications, but permanent intraocular damage can occur. If there is a suspicion of an infectious etiology, cultures of the aqueous humor and vitreous should be obtained to test for infectious etiologies, and antibiotic treatment should be initiated.

Cataract — indications for surgery specify that the primary indication is a decline in visual function such that it no longer meets a patient's visual needs and for which surgery provides a reasonable likelihood of improvement; other indications include clinically significant anisometropia in the presence of a cataract, a lens opacity that interferes with optimal diagnosis or management of posterior segment pathology, a lens that causes inflammation and related secondary glaucoma (phacolytic, lens particle, phacoantigenic), and a lens that induces primary angle closure or other forms of lens-related glaucoma.

### First real-world, multicenter, post-marketing, retrospective study of dexamethasone intraocular suspension for inflammation after cataract surgery [^115GDbMh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intraocular DXM has been evaluated in two Phase 3 trials in patients undergoing cataract surgery;, a randomized, double-masked placebo-control trial in patients undergoing phacoemulsification; and a randomized, open-label, active control trial comparing it with topical prednisolone acetate 1.0% ophthalmic suspension (QID for 3 weeks). A pooled analysis of the phase 3 trials found that intraocular DXM was not an independent risk factor for postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) increase, compared to conventional topical corticosteroid. Intraocular DXM was comparable to the topical medication in overall safety, the primary study outcome, and in ACC clearing, an exploratory effectiveness endpoint.

However, these trials by design excluded several clinical scenarios and could not address some management issues likely to be encountered in real-world practice. Although cataract and glaucoma often coexist, most patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension are excluded from clinical trials assessing novel postoperative anti-inflammatory treatments. Also, in pivotal trials of postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory treatments, concomitant use of other medications used to manage postoperative inflammation is typically limited to rescue treatment.

"Real-world" observational studies of heterogeneous patient populations in clinical settings can complement controlled clinical trials in evaluating effectiveness and safety of treatments. We report a large-scale observational study of patients who received intraocular DXM for treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery. This population included patients with glaucoma and other ocular comorbidities and was diverse with respect to surgical procedures and concomitant medications used.

### Surgical decisions in the setting of zonulopathy [^116Dgzwa]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

An 85-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, pseudoexfoliation (PXF) in both eyes, and tamsulosin use was referred for the evaluation of a dense cataract in the right eye and a subluxated intraocular lens (IOL) in the left eye. Unfortunately, his surgery in the left eye was complicated by diffuse zonulopathy. The referring surgeon placed a 3-piece IOL in the sulcus. However, the passively fixated 3-piece IOL moved inferiorly causing monocular diplopia for over a year. Because the patient was pleased with the IOL immediately postoperatively, a refixation procedure was performed in the form of sulcus placement with iris suture fixation in the left eye. Fortunately, the iris-fixated IOL in the left eye has remained well centered and stable without cystoid macular edema (CME) or chronic inflammation for over 8 months. The patient is on no ocular medications and has no family history of glaucoma. He now needs cataract surgery in the right eye and is extremely apprehensive because of his difficult course in the left eye. The corrected distance visual acuity is 20/70 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) measure 20 mm Hg in the right eye and 14 mm Hg in the left eye by Goldmann tonometry. Pachymetry is 536 µm in the right eye and 543 µm in the left eye. Pupils are round with minimal reactivity and without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular motility is normal in both eyes, and confrontation visual fields is full in both eyes. Gonioscopy reveals an angle open to the pigmented trabecular meshwork (PTM) in the right eye and the ciliary body in the left eye with 1+ PTM and without peripheral anterior synechia in both eyes. The retinal nerve fiber layer and macular optical coherence tomography are normal in both eyes. On slitlamp examination, pertinent findings include pseudoexfoliative changes at the pupillary margin with poor dilation of 3.5 mm in both eyes; the anterior chamber (AC) is shallow but adequate in the right eye and deep and quiet with rare pigmented cells in the left eye. There is a 5+ nuclear sclerotic cataract with pseudoexfoliative changes on the anterior capsule and no obvious phacodonesis in the right eye and a 3-piece posterior chamber IOL in the sulcus fixated to the iris with 10–0 polypropylene sutures at 6 and 12 o'clock without pseudophacodonesis in the left eye. Dilated fundus examination reveals a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.4 with healthy neuroretinal rims in both eyes, posterior vitreous detachments in both eyes, and no evidence of diabetic retinopathy in both eyes. All other findings are unremarkable. How would you counsel this patient regarding his risk factors for surgery in the right eye? What surgical maneuvers would you use to remove the cataract safely? How would you stabilize the IOL if the capsule bag becomes compromised due to zonulopathy?

### Kahook dual blade goniotomy combined with phacoemulsification in eyes with primary open angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma: comparative study [^116J1Tx3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of our study are consistent with previous reports regarding the effectiveness of KDB goniotomy surgery. Another critical consideration is safety profile. Studies on safety of this procedure demonstrated that it is a safe method. Hyphema and transient IOP elevations were reported as the most common complications. The use of steroids in the postoperative period is necessary to suppress inflammation and prevent the formation of peripheral anterior synechia. One study reported that topical corticosteroids increased the incidence of IOP elevations within 3 months after GATT. Therefore, a less potent steroid should be used to shorten the steroid tapering period after surgery or to reduce the risk of postoperative IOP elevation. In our study, IOP increase at 1 day postoperatively was 37% for the POAG group and 24% for the PXG group. All IOP elevations resolved within one week. Hyphema was present in 11% of the eyes with POAG and 9% of the eyes with PXG at 1 week postoperatively but all resolved within one month without the need for surgical intervention. Clinically insignificant cyclodialysis also occurred in 2 eyes with POAG and 1 eye with PXG in our study. No devastating complication that threatened vision was observed.

The limitations of our study include its retrospective nature, limited sample size, lack of long-term follow-up, and the absence of a control group to evaluate the effect of cataract surgery on the outcomes. In addition, the severity of glaucoma and cataract will affect postoperative results. KDB goniotomy surgery in advanced glaucoma is still a controversial issue. However, some reports have been reported in the literature with a limited number of patients. Severe glaucoma is often resistant to treatment. Differences in glaucoma severity may have affected surgical outcomes. In advanced cataracts, the postoperative inflammatory response may be excessive. Postoperative inflammation and peripheral anterior synechiae may affect surgical outcomes due to increased resistance to aqueous outflow. For this reason, there is a need for prospective studies in which patient characteristics are standardized before surgery, with wider participation, and to observe the dynamic changes that may occur in the long-term follow up. Complications of cataract surgery have not been reported. Exfoliative glaucoma is associated with an increased risk of zonular dialysis, capsular tears, and vitreous loss. Therefore, future studies on this subject should take this into account.

### Anterior segment reconstruction due to cosmetic iris implants placed in the anterior chamber [^114NHnSK]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

A 27-year-old woman had BrightOcular iris implants placed for cosmetic purposes that changed eye color from brown to blue bilaterally. Of note, BrightOcular implants are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States and have been associated with severe ocular complications. In keeping with their design, they were placed in the anterior chamber (AC) in both eyes of this patient; surgery was performed outside the United States. As has been described previously and tragically in other cases, she developed chronic inflammation, intolerable glare, angle-closure glaucoma, corneal edema, and cataracts in both eyes. For medically unmanageable elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), she underwent diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (CPC) in both eyes, and eventually, an Ahmed tube shunt (New World Medical, Inc.) was placed in the right eye. Although she was advised and urged to have the iris implants removed, despite her ocular issues, she refused removal until intolerable glare and reduced vision ensued. Ultimately, both iris implants were extracted 5 years after implantation by a U.S. surgeon; the procedures resulted in corneal decompensation and progressive cataract development. Subsequent penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was performed for the right eye, but it failed because of contact with the glaucoma tube shunt. She sought additional consultation and presented with the following findings: corrected distance visual acuity was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye, IOP of 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 mm Hg in the left eye, pupils were nonreactive and fixed, and extraocular muscles and central visual field were normal. Pachymetry was 868 μm in the right eye and 653 μm in the left eye. Anterior segment examination in the right eye revealed a failed corneal graft with 3+ edema, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) for 360 degrees, shallow AC, Ahmed tube shunt at the 11 o'clock position and remnant iris adherent to the graft-host junction for 270 degrees, 3+ posterior subcapsular cataract, and 2+ cortical cataract (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034–202208000–00024/figure1/v/2022–08–01T210317Z/r/image-tiff). The sclera revealed multiple circular and circumferential atrophic blue spots consistent with high-energy transscleral CPC (Figure 2JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034–202208000–00024/figure2/v/2022–08–01T210317Z/r/image-tiff). In the left eye, she had remnant fixed dilated iris for 270 degrees, missing iris superiorly for 3 clock hours, an adequate AC, and 2+ cortical cataract (Figure 3JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034–202208000–00024/figure3/v/2022–08–01T210317Z/r/image-tiff). Posterior segment examination revealed a 0.5 cup-to-disc ratio in both eyes with normal vessels, macula, vitreous, and retinal periphery, bilaterally. Given this constellation of findings, how would you proceed?

### Glaucoma summary benchmarks – 2024 [^111DXZPj]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — postoperative follow-up and complication counseling: Follow-up evaluation on the first postoperative day and at least once during the first 1 to 2 weeks to evaluate visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and status of the anterior segment. In the absence of complications, perform additional postoperative visits during a 3-month period to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment, and schedule more frequent follow-up visits, as necessary, for patients with postoperative complications (flat or shallow anterior chamber, early bleb failure, increased inflammation, or Tenon's cyst). Undertake additional treatments as necessary to improve aqueous flow into the bleb and lower IOP if evidence of bleb failure develops, including injection of antifibrotic agents, bleb massage, suture adjustment, release or lysis, or bleb needling; and manage postoperative complications as they develop, such as repair of bleb leak or reformation of a flat anterior chamber. Explain that filtration surgery places the eye at risk for endophthalmitis for the duration of the patient's life, and that if the patient has symptoms of pain and decreased vision and the signs of redness and discharge he or she should notify the ophthalmologist immediately.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^114uyCP2]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery — definitions, contributors, evaluation, and management are described: Prolonged inflammation, or iritis, is defined as inflammation that does not resolve within a few weeks of cataract surgery, in contrast to rebound inflammation, which resolves in the usual time frame but then recurs. Persistent iritis has been associated with herpetic eye disease, retained lens fragments, previous uveitis, and subacute infection with Propionibacterium acnes; gonioscopy may be necessary to see small lens fragments in the inferior angle, and ultrasound biomicroscopy, long-wavelength optical coherence tomography (OCT), or endoscopy may be needed to identify lens fragments trapped in the ciliary sulcus. Malposition or misplacement of intraocular lenses (IOLs) of specific design may lead to persistent intraocular inflammation, and the surgeon should ensure proper orientation of IOLs to prevent corneal complications; insufficient postoperative anti-inflammatory medication may also be a contributory cause. Diabetic patients and those requiring a pupil expansion device at surgery are at increased risk of persistent postoperative inflammation and are also at increased risk for developing cystoid macular edema (CME), up to 29.5% in one study, although long-term outcomes are still equivalent to patients without prolonged inflammation. Discontinuation of corticosteroid eye drops after cataract surgery may be followed by a recurrence of inflammation with increased cell and flare or CME; reinstituting anti-inflammatory eye drops will decrease the inflammation and may require a slower taper to prevent reappearance.

### Surgical outcomes of primary congenital glaucoma in children under one year from the nile delta [^115sDEm9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Out of 44 eyes which underwent primary surgery, severe complications were reported in three eyes while 30 eyes were free from any complications. Out of those eyes, 24 eyes underwent single glaucoma surgery. This figure emphasises the correlation between multiple glaucoma surgeries and the rate of postoperative complications. Generally, 34% of eyes in the current report required more than one surgical procedure to control the disease, and this figure is in accordance with published reports regarding management of PCG in Egypt. Regarding management, all sight-threatening complications were managed accordingly by the same author (MFF). Management of the case of consensual orbital cellulitis and endophthalmitis following Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation was in accordance with management of similar cases in literature, and it was discussed in detail in a previous article. With regard to the case of persistent hypotony secondary to formation of dense inflammatory cyclitic membrane, associated UBM signs included severe corneal edema, lost anterior chamber, dense peripheral anterior synechia, iridocorneal and lenticulo-corneal touch, posterior synechia, dense cataract and ciliary body detachment (Figure 3A). B-scan ultrasonography showed shallow cilio-choroidal detachment, and choroidal thickening with attached retina (Figure 3B). Reformation of anterior chamber using sodium hyaluronate with Periocular injection of Dexamethasone and Atropine were performed twice without success. The patient finally underwent surgical Synechiolysis, cataract extraction, anterior vitrectomy and surgical debulking of the cyclitic membrane using vitrector (Figure 3C). Postoperative, corneal edema and depth of anterior chamber improved. Unfortunately, persistent inflammation of anterior segment continued with development of phthisis bulbi.

### Safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of KPI-121 1% for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery [^113Pc5Ej]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Patients

These trials included two samples of patients who underwent routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery (eg, phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, not combined with any other surgery), had ≥ grade 2 anterior chamber cells (ie, ≥ 6 cells), and had potential postoperative Snellen distance visual acuity (VA) by pinhole method of at least 20/200 in the study eye. The first trial (hereafter referred to as Trial 1) was conducted at 24 sites (Table S1) within the US between May 2014 and December 2014 and the second trial (hereafter referred to as Trial 2) was conducted at 35 sites (Table S2) within the US between June 2016 and March 2017. Each trial was designed and monitored in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained by each trial site. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects at the time of their enrollment and prior to any screening evaluations for the trial.

Individuals of either sex or any race/ethnicity who were ≥ 18 years and were candidates for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery were eligible for participation in the trials. Patients who required concurrent ocular or non-ocular therapy with any type of medication (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, or decongestants) within 2 days prior to surgery and for the duration of the study were excluded from the trial as were patients with a history of glaucoma, intraocular pressure (IOP) > 21 mmHg at the screening or randomization visit(s), or were being treated for glaucoma in either eye. Also excluded were patients who: 1) had penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye within 3 months or within 2 weeks in the fellow eye; 2) had selective laser trabeculoplasty within 3 months prior to surgery or had corneal refractive surgery, glaucoma surgery, or corneal transplantation (full thickness, anterior, or posterior) within a year prior to enrollment or were unstable and/or required medication; 3) had active uveitis in either eye or a diagnosis of any type of infection, disease, and/or severe/serious condition that would interfere with study drug effectiveness or study compliance.

### Compared to trabeculectomy, Ex-pressSurgery significantly decreased the loss of corneal endothelial cell density in low-intraocular-pressure glaucoma: 3-year follow-up [^117QumzC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has some limitations to address. There are many causes for the decrease in corneal endothelial cells, including the effects of previous surgery or laser treatment, the severity of postoperative inflammation, peripheral anterior synechia formation, postoperative shallow anterior chamber, and postoperative treatment. It is difficult to quantify and compare all of this information, and this study did not perform a multifactorial analysis. We did not consider potential confounding factors that might influence long-term outcomes, such as systemic diseases, medication use, and smoking other than filtration surgery. For this reason, this study only evaluated a portion of the cause of the CED loss.

This study focused on EXP and Trab and was considered under the assumption that these two groups underwent the same conditions. In fact, there are some different conditions in the comparison between the two groups. For example, we included patients who had undergone cataract surgery, TLO, or SLT, and these surgeries affect the loss of the CED. Simultaneous cataract surgery did not affect CED loss significantly in this study. The number of patients with a history of TLO differed significantly between the two groups. Postoperative shallow anterior chamber is a factor in corneal endothelial cell loss. There were two cases in each group that occurred a shallow anterior chamber after surgery (p = 0.934). The mean of survival ratio of CED after 3 years was 74.3 ± 21.3% in Trab group and 81.5 ± 23.0% in EXP group. In this study, the CED with postoperative shallow anterior chamber decreases rapidly.

The patients' CED was measured only once. It is desirable to measure the CED several times and use the average value to avoid measurement error. In this study, the EM-3000 we used cannot automatically measure the coefficient of variation and hexagonality. We only evaluated the mean cell density. The number of patients in this investigation may also have been too small to evaluate the CED loss.

In conclusion, our results suggest that compared to trabeculectomy, Ex-Press surgery might be a factor preventing endothelial cell loss over a long period of term.

### Exploration on surgery of malignant glaucoma with prolonged absence of the anterior chamber: a retrospective consecutive case series [^114SZVfM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

General conditions

The study included five patients with five affected eyes, one male and four female patients, aged 29–69 years old. Initially, all patients were diagnosed with primary angle-closed glaucoma at other hospitals and had a history of anti-glaucoma surgery. They experienced absence of their anterior chamber for a duration from 5 months to 2 years. In one eye, phacoemulsification cataract excision + intraocular lens implantation was performed due to shallow anterior chamber of malignant glaucoma after trabeculectomy. However, stable anterior chamber had not been formed in the eye. During the out-patient department in Tongren Hospital, all eyes underwent examinations using UBM and B ultrasonic scan. The examinations revealed the disappearance of the anterior chamber, but the vitreous body and retina were normal. Upon admission to the hospital, slit-lamp examinations showed that all their anterior chambers had disappeared. In one eye, the iris was attached to the corneal endothelium, and lens was also attached to corneal endothelium in one eye, resulting in anterior and posterior synechia of the iris due to serious anterior segment inflammatory reactions. Two eyes exhibited iris neovascularization, which was caused by long-term high intraocular pressure leading to anterior segment ischemia and chronic inflammatory stimulation. Regarding patients' vision before surgery, four patients could see hand movement in front of their eyes, while one patient could count fingers in front of her eye. Regarding the pre-surgery intraocular pressure (IOP), three patients had well-controlled IOP within normal range (< 21 mmHg.), while the other two had elevated IOP, despite receiving local and systemic IOP-lowering medications. All five affected eyes received cycloplegia treatment, but still failed to form anterior chambers. One eye was implanted with an intraocular lens, while the remaining four had complicated cataracts. The patients received surgical treatment upon admission to the hospital. One patient underwent anterior pars plana vitrectomy (aPPV) + peripheral iridotomy (PI) + goniosynechialysis (GSL). The other four patients underwent phacoemulsification cataract excision + aPPV + PI + GSL. Among the latter group, three eyes were implanted with an intraocular lens, and one eye did not receive the implant (Table 1). All five eyes successfully achieved stable formation of the anterior chamber (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). None of the five patients reported eye discomforts such as redness, swelling, pain, photophobia, or tearing during the follow-up visits.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (initial evaluation) — postoperative follow-up and complication management are as follows: Follow-up evaluation on the first postoperative day and at least once during the first 1 to 2 weeks to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment. In the absence of complications, perform additional postoperative visits during a 3-month period to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment. Schedule more frequent follow-up visits, as necessary, for patients with postoperative complications (flat or shallow anterior chamber, early bleb failure, increased inflammation, or Tenon's cyst). Undertake additional treatments as necessary to improve aqueous flow into the bleb and lower IOP if evidence of bleb failure develops, including injection of antifibrotic agents, bleb massage, suture adjustment, release or lysis, or bleb needling. Manage postoperative complications as they develop, such as repair of bleb leak or reformation of a flat anterior chamber. Explain that filtration surgery places the eye at risk for endophthalmitis for the duration of the patient's life, and that if the patient has symptoms of pain and decreased vision and the signs of redness and discharge he or she should notify the ophthalmologist immediately.

### Surgical outcomes in childhood uveitic glaucoma [^111vXd3h]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate surgical outcomes and to describe a strategy for pediatric uveitic glaucoma.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

The clinical practice of a single surgeon identified 36 patients with juvenile uveitic glaucoma (diagnosed before 18 years of age) who underwent 1 or more intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering surgical procedures. The first eye operated on was included in the analysis. The main indication for success was IOP of less than 21 mm Hg with controlled inflammation, without further IOP-lowering surgery or devastating complication.

Results

Patients with uveitic glaucoma associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n = 20), idiopathic uveitis (n = 9), other (n = 6) were included. Mean age ± standard deviation at initial glaucoma surgery was 11.1 ± 4.4 years with a follow-up of 5.6 ± 4.8 years (range, 0.2 to 16.4 years). Goniotomy was the initial surgical procedure in 31 (86%) eyes. Fifteen eyes did not require further IOP-lowering surgery. Sixteen eyes had additional IOP-lowering surgery: second goniotomy (n = 9), glaucoma drainage device (n = 6), and trabeculectomy (n = 1). By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the first versus the first or second goniotomy were successful at 10 years in 48% (95% confidence interval, 28% to 65%) versus 69% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 84%). Goniotomy failure was noncorrelative with phakic status or presence of preoperative synechiae. Five eyes (14%) had initial glaucoma drainage device implantation because of closed angles. Visual acuity was similar between initial and final examinations (0.37 ± 0.48 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units [Snellen 20/47] vs 0.28 ± 0.34 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution units [Snellen 20/38]). IOP was reduced (33.0 ± 8.0 mm Hg vs 12.6 ± 4.5 mm Hg; P < .0001), as was number of glaucoma medications (3.2 ± 1.1 vs 1.2 ± 1.3; P < .0001). Eyes undergoing cataract removal after successful glaucoma surgery maintained IOP control. Glaucoma was controlled and vision was preserved in 33 (92%) eyes.

Conclusions

Refractory juvenile uveitic glaucoma was managed successfully by goniosurgery and glaucoma drainage device implantation. Cataract removal can be accomplished successfully, provided IOP and uveitis are well controlled before surgery.

### Four-year outcomes of two second-generation trabecular micro-bypass stents in patients with open-angle glaucoma on one medication [^113uwUfQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Alongside IOP-reducing performance, the safety profile of a given treatment intervention is paramount. In this study, all subjects were successfully implanted with 2 iStent inject stents, with no intraoperative complications. Over 4 years of follow-up, adverse events occurred in only 3 eyes, and no events were device-related. Only 1 eye underwent a secondary glaucoma surgery during follow-up. Visual acuity, C:D ratio, visual fields, and central corneal thickness remained stable over the 48 months of follow-up. There were no reports of hypotony, stent obstruction, or any of the complications seen with traditional filtering surgeries (eg, endophthalmitis, choroidal detachment or hemorrhage, bleb-related complications). There also were no cases of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) or inflammation (eg, uveitis, iritis). This benign safety profile is not surprising given that iStent inject (as well as iStent) stents are made of biocompatible titanium and have a well-established track record of non-inflammatory usage. The stents have been the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed clinical publications to-date, and have shown an excellent safety profile, while a single ex vivo histology study has shown fibrous material in tissue samples. There are limitations and strengths which may be highlighted in this open-label, single-arm study. The study's single-site design prevents consideration of site-specific effects. However, the involvement of multiple surgeons provides variability, and the consistent outcomes across surgeons validate the stent implantation technique and overall safety profile. Given that all surgeons were glaucoma specialists, the absence of intraoperative complications may not be observed by non-glaucoma-trained surgeons. As all eligible subjects needed further glaucoma treatment (in addition to their 1 preoperative medication), a sham surgical control group (consisting of merely injecting and removing viscoelastic) was not considered for ethical reasons. One of the proposed mechanisms for postsurgical IOP reduction is lavage of the outflow pathway by irrigation/aspiration itself, which is used during stent implantation as well as cataract surgery. Due to the lack of a control group, this potential confounder cannot be accounted for. However, given that this mechanism has not been conclusively established, it is still reasonable to consider patients' preoperative data as their own control. The patient population was 100% Caucasian and all eyes were phakic, precluding stratification by race or lens status. Multiple IOP measurements were not taken on consecutive days, making regression to the mean a possibility. However, the validity of the IOP data is strengthened by the completion of diurnal IOP measurements and 2-observer masked IOP assessments. The study's 100% accountability through 48 months also adds to the validity of the data.

### Late postoperative choroidal detachment following an uneventful cataract surgery in a patient on topical latanoprost [^116whVAp]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Topical latanoprost is a most effective and commonly used antiglaucoma medication. Use of prostaglandin analogues (PGA) in the early postoperative period is controversial due to its proinflammatory properties. We report a case of a 64-year-old man with primary open angle glaucoma, post-trabeculectomy 17 years prior, with good intraocular pressure (IOP) control on topical levobunolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005%. He underwent a clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery in his left eye and the PGA was stopped. He had an uneventful postoperative course and was prescribed eyeglasses at 4-week follow-up. Two weeks later, he presented to the emergency department with decreased vision in the left eye, flat anterior chamber, IOP of 00 mm Hg and 360° choroidal detachment. The continued use of topical latanoprost in the operated eye was implicated as the cause. This case illustrates the serious vision-threatening side effect of PGA when used in the early postoperative period.

### Cataract surgery outcomes in glaucomatous eyes: results from the veterans affairs ophthalmic surgery outcomes data project [^116QrFzJ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare visual acuity outcomes, vision-related quality of life, and complications related to cataract surgery in eyes with and without glaucoma.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

Cataract surgery outcomes in cases with and without glaucoma from the Veterans Affairs Ophthalmic Surgical Outcomes Data Project were compared.

Results

We identified 608 glaucoma cases and 4306 controls undergoing planned cataract surgery alone. After adjusting for age, pseudoexfoliation, small pupil, prior ocular surgery, and anterior chamber depth, we found that glaucoma cases were more likely to have posterior capsular tear with vitrectomy (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, P = 0.03) and sulcus intraocular lens placement (OR 1.65, P = 0.03) during cataract surgery. Glaucoma cases were more likely to have postoperative inflammation (OR 1.73, P < .0001), prolonged elevated intraocular pressure (OR 2.96, P = 0.0003), and additional surgery within 30 days (OR 1.92, P = 0.03). Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ) scores significantly improved after cataract surgery in both groups (P < .0001), but there were larger improvements in BCVA (P = 0.01) and VFQ composite scores (P < .0001) in the nonglaucoma vs the glaucoma group. A total of 3621 nonglaucoma cases (94.1%) had postoperative BCVA 20/40 or better, compared to 466 glaucoma cases (89.6%) (P = 0.0003).

Conclusions

Eyes with glaucoma are at increased risk for complications and have more modest visual outcomes after cataract surgery compared to eyes without glaucoma. Despite this, glaucoma patients still experience significant improvement in vision-related outcomes after cataract extraction. Further study is needed to explore potential factors that influence cataract surgery outcomes in glaucomatous eyes.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^116h6RCX]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma surgery management — Preoperative steps include "Perform gonioscopy preoperatively, especially when considering trabecular meshwork/Schlemm's canal-based MIGS", "Obtain informed consent from the patient or the patient's surrogate decision maker after discussing the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expected outcomes of surgery", and "Ensure that the preoperative evaluation accurately documents the findings and indications for surgery". Postoperatively, "Prescribe topical corticosteroids in the postoperative period", then "Perform a follow-up evaluation on the first postoperative day and at least once during the first 1 to 2 weeks to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment"; if uncomplicated, "perform additional postoperative visits during a 3-month period to evaluate visual acuity, IOP, and status of the anterior segment". For complications, "Schedule more frequent follow-up visits, as necessary, for patients with postoperative complications such as a flat or shallow anterior chamber or evidence of early bleb failure, increased inflammation, or Tenon's cyst (encapsulated bleb)", and "Undertake additional treatments as necessary to improve aqueous flow into the bleb and lower IOP if evidence of bleb failure develops, including injection of antifibrotic agents, bleb massage, suture adjustment, release or lysis, or bleb needling". Clinicians should "Manage postoperative complications as they develop, such as repair of bleb leak or reformation of a flat anterior chamber", and counsel that "filtration surgery places the eye at risk for endophthalmitis for the duration of the patient's life" and symptomatic patients "should notify the ophthalmologist immediately".

### Dexamethasone 0.4mg sustained-release intracanalicular insert in the management of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery: design, development and place in therapy [^112bY92U]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

While surgical techniques and equipment have advanced over the years, inflammation is still a common consequence of most ocular surgeries, including cataract surgery. If left untreated, post-operative inflammation can lead to elevated intraocular pressure, photophobia, ocular pain, and an increased probability of posterior capsule opacification, macular edema, secondary glaucoma and synechia formation. Appropriate management of post-operative inflammation is critical for achieving the best corrected visual acuity, anatomical surgical outcome, and patient satisfaction in the most expedient way.

Corticosteroids are widely used to manage inflammation in post-operative patients as well as in ophthalmic conditions such as allergic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular edema, macular edema, and uveitis due to their inherent anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties.–Numerous types of steroids have been utilized to control inflammation, including dexamethasone. Several studies have shown the beneficial effect of dexamethasone in reducing pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.–One study involving phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, demonstrated that dexamethasone administered four times daily during the first week and twice daily during the second, third, and fourth week, significantly reduced post-operative inflammation compared to a placebo.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^117HEB6c]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

High‑risk ocular characteristics — risk factors and counseling: Other eye characteristics may confer higher intraoperative and postoperative complication risk. High‑risk features include previous eye surgery, special cataract types, very large or very small eyes, deeply set eyes, small pupils, anterior or posterior synechia, scarred or cloudy corneas, zonular weakness or absence, prior ocular trauma, and systemic use of alpha‑1a antagonists; patients with these characteristics should be informed about expected course and outcomes of surgery and options if complications occur.

### First real-world, multicenter, post-marketing, retrospective study of dexamethasone intraocular suspension for inflammation after cataract surgery [^114NMSyy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate dexamethasone intraocular suspension 9% (intraocular DXM) in real-world clinical use to manage inflammation associated with cataract surgery.

Setting

Patients who underwent cataract surgery and received intraocular DXM at 22 outpatient eye surgery centers in the US.

Design

Retrospective, observational chart review.

Methods

Records of all patients who received intraocular DXM from March to December 2019 at participating centers were reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Outcomes included anterior chamber cell (ACC) grades, anterior chamber flare (ACF) grades, and visual acuity, as well as intraocular pressure (IOP) and adverse events (AEs) at postoperative days (PODs) 1, 8, 14, 30. Descriptive statistics were generated.

Results

The study population included 527 patients (641 eyes), with glaucoma history in 66 patients (80 eyes). Among eyes with recorded ACC grades, the percentage with grade 0 increased from 40% at POD 1 to 89.7% at POD 30, with similar results in eyes with glaucoma history. Among eyes with recorded ACF grades, the percentage with grade 0 increased from 78.4% at POD 1 to 97.1% at POD 30. At POD 30, 96.6% eyes with recorded results achieved target acuity. Mean IOP was 18.6 mmHg at POD 1 but declined to ≤ 15.2 mmHg thereafter. Investigators reported 22 AEs in 20 patients, all reported mild or moderate, the most common: IOP increase (7 events).

Conclusion

Patients undergoing cataract surgery and treated with intraocular DXM showed favorable inflammatory and visual outcomes, without unanticipated safety problems, consistent with results of previous controlled clinical trials.

### Postoperative inflammation in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^11456LGD]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

We report a 51-year old white woman with a history of relapsing episodes of multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed acute anterior uveitis 11 days after having uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Topical corticosteroids relieved the pain and inflammation within hours. A week after the episode of anterior uveitis, the patient had a severe systemic relapse of MS. Acute inflammation in MS patients during the postoperative period may be noninfectious and could be a prodrome for a relapse of MS.

### Long-term outcomes of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation combined with goniosynechialysis for primary angle-closure glaucoma with 360 ° peripheral anterior synechiae [^111bTMs1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperatively, all patients received topical dexamethasone eye drops (switched to prednisolone eye drops after 2 weeks), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops, and 0.5% pilocarpine eye drops for 4 weeks, with gradual tapering of the dosage.

For all patients, IOP, BCVA, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, and gonioscopy were recorded preoperatively and during postoperative follow-up. PAS were defined as adhesions of the iris tissue to the trabecular meshwork(TM), which were identified clinically as a persistently closed angle upon indentation gonioscopy, where the posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork was not visible in the anterior chamber angle. Starting from the third postoperative month, patients were routinely followed every 3 to 6 months.

All intraoperative and postoperative complications, along with any subsequent surgical interventions, were systematically documented throughout the follow-up period.

Surgical success and failure were defined as follows: the primary outcome criterion was IOP control at the final follow-up visit (≥ 12 months). Complete success was defined as an IOP of ≤ 21 mmHg without the use of glaucoma medications or additional surgical interventions (including trabeculectomy and glaucoma drainage device surgery, among major types). Qualified success was defined as an IOP of ≤ 21 mmHg with the use of up to two glaucoma medications. Failure was defined as uncontrolled IOP despite the use of more than two glaucoma medications, the need for a secondary IOP-lowering procedure, hypotony (IOP < 6 mmHg at two consecutive visits), or the occurrence of any sight-threatening complication.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^1127r1Tr]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Intraocular lens placement in uveitis — complications may include inflammatory deposits, surface membrane formation, and inflammatory capsular complications capable of causing intraocular lens (IOL) subluxation; leaving an eye aphakic may be considered in severely damaged uveitic eyes with extensive pupillary or ciliary membrane formation or signs of intractable inflammation, but in most cases placement of an IOL with the optic and haptics in the capsular bag is preferred; placement of the entire IOL in the sulcus or prolapse of the optic into the sulcus (haptics in the bag) allows the optic to block iridocapsular adhesions in high-risk eyes and this technique does not seem to increase postoperative inflammation; placement of the haptics in the bag and the optic in the sulcus may prevent posterior synechiae, a larger-diameter capsulorhexis may decrease postoperative anterior capsule synechiae, anterior chamber IOLs may stimulate more inflammation and may be problematic if angle anatomy is compromised, zonulopathy is common in uveitis and may require capsular tension rings (CTRs), uveitic zonulopathy can lead to capsular phimosis and late in-the-bag subluxation, and cleaning off anterior subcapsular lens epithelial cells (LECs) may be beneficial in preventing capsular phimosis.

### Angle-closure glaucoma secondary to inflammatory capsular block syndrome following routine cataract surgery [^115bGPYM]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old man had uneventful cataract surgery with implantation of a 1-piece plate-haptic intraocular lens in the capsular bag. Seven weeks later, he presented as an emergency with intense fibrinous uveitis and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Examination revealed an inflammatory capsular block syndrome (CBS) causing fibrinous anterior uveitis and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. The glaucoma resolved and the patient's vision improved following neodymium:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Inflammatory CBS should be considered in pseudophakic patients presenting with fibrinous anterior uveitis, increased IOP, and secondary angle closure.

### Fibrin membrane pupillary-block glaucoma after uneventful cataract surgery treated with intracameral tissue plasminogen activator: a case report [^114p8LR8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 62-year-old Japanese man with diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy for 20 years. He visited an ophthalmology unit in a general hospital to check for diabetic retinopathy. His visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 13 mmHg and 14 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. The anterior chambers were deep and clear in both eyes. Examination revealed cortical cataract and pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the both eyes. Uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in the left eye on March 10, 2011, when his blood glucose level was 98 mg/dl, and his HbA 1 c was 7.4%. On the next day, the visual acuity was 0.8, and IOP was 15 mmHg. The anterior chamber was deep with only mild inflammation (1+ cellular reaction). On postoperative day 5, the patient suffered sudden ocular pain in the operated eye and repeatedly vomited. The visual acuity in the left eye was 0.02, and IOP was 68 mmHg. The anterior chamber was shallow, but severe corneal edema prevented further detailed slit lamp examination. The patient was treated with instillation of topical glaucoma medication (0.5% timolol maleate) and systemic mannitol. IOP remained high in the 60 mmHg range despite intensive anti-glaucoma therapy. A physician suspected the presence of a thin membrane covering the pupil and thus attempted Nd:YAG laser membranotomy, which was unsuccessful due to corneal edema.

### Phacoemulsification after trabeculectomy in uveitis associated with vogt-koyanagi-harada disease: intermediate-term visual outcome, IOP control and trabeculectomy survival [^114o9R47]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

VKH is one of the most common uveitis entities in Saudi Arabia affecting mostly young adults. Glaucoma and cataract are among the most common complications in such entity. Several studies have reported a high frequency (23.1–51.6%) of cataract development and progression in uveitic glaucoma eyes after trabeculectomy which eventually required cataract surgery. Cataract surgery in trabeculectomized eyes with uveitis is challenging as a result of the high risk of postoperative inflammation and loss of IOP control. Nevertheless, decreased perioperative and long-term intraocular inflammation and improved microsurgical techniques have all resulted in better outcomes.

We have previously reported favorable outcome of phacoemulsification after trabeculectomy in uveitis. However, the outcome in a major uveitis entity such as VKH is not well known. Patients included in the current study are of young age group, due to the existence of chronic inflammation, prolonged use of steroids and the disease prevalence in younger age group. The VA improved in half the study group (almost 58%), mostly by 2 lines. Our results are less than those reported by Quek et al. (82%), and Ganesh et al. (80%). However, our group included patients with combined vision threatening complications of VKH, mainly glaucomatous disc damage and retinal pathologies associated with VKH including subretinal neovascular membranes and fibrosis and macular edema, accounting for poor vision in almost one third of eyes after phacoemulsification. The indication of cataract surgery was not only visually significant cataract, but also to allow better visualization of the posterior pole to monitor any uveitis activity, especially in patients with cataract and synechia. In a meta-analysis done by Mehta et al. patients with posterior uveitis such as VKH were found to have poorer visual results than those with other uveitis entities due to chorioretinal injury. However, such eyes may have visual improvement, even if not to 20/40 or better. Moreover, In the presence of cataract in uveitis with vision threatening complications, the goal of surgical intervention is not only visual rehabilitation, but also to have a better visualization of the retina and optic nerve and monitor progression.

### Incidence of postsurgical intraocular inflammation 6 months after implantation with a multifocal intraocular lens [^117Lw9zQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cataract, the leading cause of reversible blindness worldwide, can be treated by removing the cloudy natural crystalline lens and implanting an intraocular lens (IOL). This common surgical procedure to restore visual function is effective and typically safe and uneventful. However, postsurgical inflammation and other complications can occur in some cases, including toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) and endophthalmitis. Both TASS and endophthalmitis can lead to poor visual outcomes.

TASS is caused by a noninfectious substance entering the anterior segment of an eye during cataract surgery and may result from surgical instrument or IOL contamination. It is characterized by anterior chamber inflammation during the early postoperative period, causing toxic cellular and extracellular damage. Symptoms of TASS may include blurry vision, ocular pain, corneal edema, macular edema, visual deterioration, and eye redness.TASS is uncommon (incidence of 0.22% based on case series)but often occurs in a clustered outbreak at specific surgical sites. In patients with TASS, visual acuity was significantly worse after the development of inflammation than before.

### Increased postoperative anterior chamber inflammation secondary to heat-resistant endotoxins [^116R8VSr]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the cause of clusters of increased postoperative anterior chamber inflammation after uneventful cataract surgery, and to examine its relation to the presence of endotoxins in sterile consumables.

Setting

Tertiary eye center in north India.

Design

Single-center retrospective case series.

Methods

All cataract surgeries performed at the tertiary eye center over 12 weeks (October 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017) were noted. Any patient with a "severe reaction" postoperatively was monitored closely and the postoperative drug regimen was altered accordingly. "Severe reaction" was defined as any patient with more than 4+ cells and/or fibrin with or without hypopyon. The Hospital Infection Control committee was informed, and a root cause analysis was performed to determine the cause. All the consumables were recalled and replaced. The samples were sent for microbiological evaluations.

Results

Of the 781 cataract surgeries performed, 81 patients had a severe reaction. Most patients were men (71%) and the mean age of the patients was 63 years. Twelve patients had fibrin, 3 of whom presented with hypopyon. Because all samples were negative of any growth, endotoxin tests were performed. All the samples were found to be negative, except for the ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD), which showed positive endotoxin levels. The OVD was changed and the anterior chamber reactions ceased to occur.

Conclusion

A careful, stepwise approach is necessary when investigating clusters of increased postoperative anterior chamber reactions after uneventful surgery. A high degree of suspicion is important to rule out all possible reasons and in the absence of any identifiable cause, sterile consumables should be checked for endotoxins.

### Steroid response following dropless cataract surgery using subconjunctival triamcinolone [^116449Fq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Dropless cataract surgery has become preferred by many anterior segment surgeons and patients given that it offers good postoperative control of inflammation while reducing drop dependence and potentially leads to more consistent outcomes after cataract surgery. However, caution must be exercised in light of possible increased rates of steroid response and greater likelihood of prolonged steroid response following steroid depot injection. Going forward, quality prospective studies will be needed to evaluate whether steroid depot dosage or location affect risk for IOP elevation following dropless cataract surgery. Nonetheless, patient selection prior to surgery will continue to be critical, and we propose that patients suspicious for glaucoma or with a known diagnosis of glaucoma should be carefully identified and evaluated prior to dropless cataract surgery given their significant risk for IOP elevation and irreversible vision loss in response to steroids.

### Safety and efficacy of topical vs intracanalicular corticosteroids for the prevention of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery [^111Wp6D3]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

One limitation of the present study is its retrospective study design; as such, the patients included in the analysis were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded. On the other hand, the chart review was performed consecutively to minimize the risk for reporter bias. In addition, the study was insufficiently powered to reveal differences in the proportion of eyes experiencing rare events like endophthalmitis. Some patients were excluded because of prior diagnosis of glaucoma (Figure 1). These patients are at a higher risk for developing IOP elevation on topical drops both within the first 24 hours and within the first few weeks after cataract extraction. Future work that allows for the randomization of subjects to a treatment arm and larger cohorts might be sufficiently powered to analyze subgroups such as those with glaucoma. Another implication of our finding that the intracanalicular dexamethasone insert is able to achieve comparable safety and efficacy to those of topical steroid drops after cataract surgery is that this approach may be broadened to other types of ophthalmic surgeries that have traditionally used topical drops to prevent postoperative inflammation. These include corneal transplantation and vitreoretinal surgery and represent exciting other avenues of future study.

### Characteristics of uveitic glaucoma and evaluation of its surgical treatment [^114hssSG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of surgical outcomes

Surgical outcome and complications, as well as postoperative IOP and inflammation, were analyzed in detail in the patients who underwent glaucoma surgery, including trabeculectomy, trabeculotomy, and trabectome surgery, performed with or without cataract surgery. All patients were followed at Tohoku University for at least 1 year. Patients with 1) previous glaucoma surgery; 2) intraocular surgery within the previous 3 months; or 3) UG-related neovascularization were excluded. If both eyes underwent surgery, the eye that was treated first was examined. Postoperative examinations were performed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 2 months, every quarter of 2 years, and semiannually thereafter. Surgical failure was defined as IOP more than 21 mmHg in two consecutive visits, with or without eye drops prescribed for ocular hypotensive therapy, or by the need for additional glaucoma surgery or secondary procedures, such as needling. Postoperative inflammation was defined as cells or flaring graded 1+ from 2 weeks to 3 months after surgery. Postoperative complications included severe hyphema in the AC, bleb leakage, choroidal detachment, cataract progression requiring surgery, hypotonic maculopathy, and blebitis/endophthalmitis.

### Postoperative outcomes of intraocular lens implantation in the bag versus posterior optic capture in pediatric cataract surgery [^112SrNxY]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare complications in children up to 4 years old having cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation using 2 techniques: in-the-bag IOL with anterior vitrectomy or optic capture of IOL with no anterior vitrectomy.

Setting

Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.

Design

Prospective randomized control clinical trial.

Methods

The study included children having cataract surgery with IOL implantation. Patients were randomized to Group 1 (in-the-bag 3-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL [Acrysof MA60AC] with anterior vitrectomy) or Group 2 (optic capture of the same IOL without anterior vitrectomy). Intraoperative complications were documented. Postoperative visual axis obscuration (VAO), glaucoma, cell deposits on the IOL, and posterior synechiae were compared at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

The study comprised 61 children (61 eyes). The mean ages were 14.8 months ± 11.47 (SD) in Group 1 (n = 30) and 18.2 ± 11.47 months in Group 2 (n = 31). Overall, only 1 eye in Group 1 developed a VAO requiring membranectomy 4 months postoperatively, and 2 eyes in Group 1 developed glaucoma over 12 months (P = 0.49). Intraocular lens cell deposits and posterior synechiae were comparable between groups. The IOL could not be captured in 5 eyes (16.1%); no complications occurred in these eyes.

Conclusions

Optic capture of 3-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOLs could be achieved in most eyes. The VAO, glaucoma, and inflammation were comparable 12 months postoperatively. Thus, optic capture of an IOL is an alternative surgical technique that can be used to avoid vitrectomy, even in children younger than 4 years.

### Sutureless combined 25-gauge vitrectomy, phacoemulsification, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation for management of uveitic cataract associated with posterior segment disease [^113dkY58]. Retina (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report visual outcomes and complication rates associated with one-stage surgery for the management of uveitic cataract associated with posterior segment disease.

Methods

In this interventional case series, 19 eyes (19 patients) with posterior segment involvement due to chronic uveitis underwent sutureless scleral tunnel incision phacoemulsification combined with total vitrectomy using 25-gauge instruments and posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation. Membrane peeling and endolaser photocoagulation were performed when indicated. Outcome measures were visual acuity, inflammatory activity, macular edema, and complications of surgery.

Results

After a minimum 12-month follow-up, visual acuity was ≥ 20/100 in 12 eyes (63.2%); 6 eyes (31.6%) had visual acuity of ≥ 20/40. A decrease in postoperative inflammatory activity of 1 grade was observed in 8 eyes (42.1%). Sixteen eyes had cystoid macular edema before surgery; and 12 eyes had cystoid macular edema after surgery. Early postoperative complications included the following: transient corneal edema, 10 eyes (50.3%); fibrin reaction, 3 eyes (15.8%), and posterior synechiae, 9 eyes (47.3%). Glaucoma was the most common late postoperative complication (3 eyes [18.8%]). Nine eyes (47.4%) needed YAG laser capsulotomy during the first year.

Conclusion

Sutureless combined 25-gauge total vitrectomy, phacoemulsification, and PC-IOL implantation may be well tolerated with an acceptable complication rate for selected uveitic eyes with significant cataract and coexisting posterior segment disease for restoring useful vision.

### Etiology and treatment outcomes of persistent postoperative inflammation in primary resident-performed cataract surgeries at a large tertiary care public hospital [^112AE5to]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the risk factors, intraoperative and postoperative complications, therapeutic interventions, and visual outcomes for persistent postoperative inflammation in primary resident-performed cataract surgeries.

Setting

Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

Primary resident-performed cataract surgeries from January 2012 to June 2015 were analyzed for persistent postoperative inflammation, defined as persistent anterior chamber inflammatory reaction after a standard 1-month topical corticosteroid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) drops taper. Preoperative characteristics, operative complications, therapeutic modalities, and duration of therapy were analyzed. The primary outcome measures were duration of corticosteroid and NSAID therapy, treatment modalities, and postoperative visual outcomes at the 1-month postoperative visit.

Results

The study assessed 1290 primary resident-performed cataract surgeries. Persistent postoperative inflammation occurred in 82 eyes (6.6%). The presumed etiology was classified as idiopathic persistent postoperative inflammation, nonadherence to topical therapy, and complicated cataract surgery. Patients with persistent postoperative inflammation were more likely of African American descent, had hypertension, or used aspirin, anticoagulants, or prostaglandins (P = 0.019, P = 0.027, P = 0.028, P = 0.020, respectively). The complicated cataract subgroup required a longer duration of therapy (P = 0.021) and was the only subgroup to require injections or systemic corticosteroids. There was no significant difference in postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) when comparing patients with persistent postoperative inflammation with those without inflammation or between the subgroups.

Conclusions

The idiopathic and nonadherent subgroups were successfully treated with topical antiinflammatory therapy; the complicated subgroup required longer duration and multiple modalities of treatment. Visual outcomes were comparable to the general cataract population with no differences in postoperative CDVA.

### Phacoemulsification in patients with fuchs' heterochromic uveitis [^113rJpnc]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the results of phacoemulsification with capsular bag fixation of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), acrylic, or silicone intraocular lens (IOL) in patients with complicated cataract resulting from Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis (FHU).

Setting

Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Methods

This study evaluated 20 eyes of 19 patients with FHU and cataract who had uneventful phacoemulsification with endocapsular implantation of an IOL and completed a 1-year follow-up.

Results

Preoperatively, loss of the iris collarette and fine keratic precipitates were seen in all 20 eyes, iris heterochromia in 16, iris atrophy in 12, and iris nodules in 2. Fourteen eyes had mild or negligible preoperative anterior chamber inflammation. No eye had increased intraocular pressure. An acrylic IOL was implanted in 10 eyes, a silicone IOL in 4, and a PMMA IOL in 6. There were no significant differences in outcomes among the 3 IOL groups. Three patients had intraoperative hyphema that resolved spontaneously. Postoperatively, 16 eyes had mild anterior chamber reaction. Four patients had significant anterior chamber inflammation necessitating the use of frequent topical steroids. No case had secondary glaucoma or posterior synechias. The best corrected visual acuity was 6/5 in 6 eyes, 6/6 in 11, and 6/9 in 3.

Conclusions

Uneventful phacoemulsification with endocapsular IOL implantation visually rehabilitated patients with FHU. All 3 IOLs yielded similar results except for increased early postoperative inflammation and late dense anterior capsule opacification in the silicone group. Further studies comparing the outcome of different IOL materials are required to determine their effectiveness in patients with FHU.

### Case report of secondary pigment dispersion glaucoma, recurrent uveitis and cystoid macular oedema following inadvertent implantation of an intraocular lens into the ciliary sulcus following cataract surgery [^1173ksnS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights some very important learning points for any ophthalmologist involved in either the management of post-operative cataract surgery patients or managing patients presenting to eye casualty. The first point is to always consider the intraocular lens position in patients with persistent anterior segment inflammation following cataract surgery. Chronic post-operative uveitis (persistent inflammation more than 6 months after cataract surgery) has been quoted as occurring in 1 in 400 operations with a much higher incidence in those eyes that had an intraoperative complication. In our case the important signs of endothelial pigment deposition and inferior iris transillumination defects made us very suspicious that the intraocular lens may have been in the sulcus rather than in the capsular bag, and was therefore leading to iris chaffe and pigment shedding causing the persistent inflammation and high intraocular pressure. The complicating factor in our case was that the surgeon who performed the operation was adamant that the intraocular lens was placed inside the capsular bag during the operation. On EUA, however, the intraocular lens was confirmed to be in the sulcus. This therefore highlights the importance of careful placement of the intraocular lens at the time of surgery to make sure it is inserted into the capsular bag. The fact that the intraocular lens in this case was a one-piece polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lens designed to be placed inside the capsular bag and not in the sulcus subsequently led to the pigment shedding.

### Canaloplasty and trabeculotomy combined with phacoemulsification for glaucoma: 12-month results of the GEMINI study [^112iXepm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative, perioperative, and postoperative safety outcomes from the safety population (all enrolled and treated subjects; n = 149) are summarized in Table 4. As is common with angle-based procedures, layered hyphema was the most common adverse event, occurring in 9 eyes (6%), that resolved without further intervention or sequelae within four weeks of occurrence. Other AEs included IOP increased 10 mmHg or more above baseline at or after the Month 1 visit (n = 3, 2.0%), anterior uveitis (n = 2, 1.3%), peripheral anterior synechiae (n = 2, 1.3%), clinically significant cystoid macular edema (n = 1, 0.7%) and blepharitis (n = 3, 2.0%). It is noteworthy that no AE for recurrent hyphema and no secondary surgical interventions were reported. Loss of visual acuity was reported in 2 eyes (10 letters and 13 letters compared to baseline), both secondary to posterior capsular opacity. None of the AE were considered serious by the Investigators.

### Cataract surgery after proton-beam irradiation for uveal tumors [^115Vqa8q]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To study the risks associated with cataract surgery in patients with previous proton-beam irradiation (PBI), focusing on preoperative risk factors, intraoperative findings, and postoperative complications.

Setting

Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

Electronic medical records of patients who had PBI and cataract surgery between January 1, 2006, and October 1, 2016, were reviewed.

Results

The study comprised 29 eyes of 29 patients. Preoperative evaluation found dry eye (72.4%), posterior synechiae (24.1%), peripheral anterior synechiae (13.8%), anterior capsule fibrosis (10.3%), and iris atrophy (10.3%). Intraoperative findings included poor red reflex requiring trypan blue capsule staining (37.9%), synechiae requiring synechialysis (24.1%), evidence of previous inflammation prompting sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection (17.2%), and miosis (10.3%). Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification (PCO) by 1 year (48.3%), intraocular pressure spike of 23 mm Hg or greater at 1 day (24.1%), anterior chamber inflammation at 1 month (24.1%), and cystoid macular edema (CME) (17.2%). Proximity of the initial tumor to the posterior pole was associated with poor visual outcomes after cataract surgery. Compared with reference data, this cohort had higher rates of anterior chamber inflammation at 1 month, CME, fibrinous inflammation, PCO by 1 year, intraoperative requirement for trypan blue, and synechialysis.

Conclusions

Complications after cataract surgery performed after PBI were similar to those seen in patients with uveitis (prolonged inflammation, CME, fibrinous inflammation, early PCO). Steroid depot administration might be useful to prevent these complications, although further research is needed to determine an optimum regimen.

### Intraoperative intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection for prevention of postoperative inflammation and complications after phacoemulsification in patients with uveitic cataract [^111k3R66]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Preoperative control of uveitis for at least 3 months is a prerequisite to performing cataract surgery in patients with uveitis. Prompt and appropriate treatment is also necessary to reverse visual deterioration in case of postoperative inflammation. According to the data, some patients had an outbreak in anterior chamber inflammation in the immediate postoperative period, especially more severe inflammation in the control group, which was progressively controlled by timely multiple subconjunctival dexamethasone injection. All 3 eyes of recurrent panuveitis and 7 eyes developed CME occurred in the control group, which inflammation and visual acuity was improved at the final follow-up, due to intravitreal or posterior sub-Tenon's injection of TA and oral corticosteroids. Patients with panuveitis in the control group received comparable visual acuity to the IVTA group within postoperative 3 months. Regrettably, remedies brought additional pain and risk of adverse effects to patient, and postoperative inflammation lead to more patients suffering from iris posterior synechia and PCO in the control group. In addition, we found that intraoperative injection of TA seemed more necessary for these patients with refractory uveitis, including bilateral uveitis and panuveitis, which tend to severe postoperative reactions and recurrence with a high probability of oral corticosteroids application.

In our study, ocular hypertension occurred in 3 eyes (7.8%) in the IVTA group range from 22 to 30 mmHg, including one case caused by anterior chamber migration of triamcinolone crystals. The maximum of increased IOP eyes recorded in the control group was 40 mmHg, and of all 4 eyes with ocular hypertension occurred during postoperative 1 week, which could be attributed to the severe anterior chamber inflammation. There wasn't an increased incidence of ocular hypertension, as it was supposed to be about 20.9–43.3% caused by TA injection alone reported by previous studies without cataract surgery. Tanuj et al. showed intravitreal injection of 4 mg TA had anti-inflammatory efficacy clinically equivalent to oral corticosteroids postoperatively in uveitis patients with cataract surgery. However, ocular hypertension was seen in up to 25% of patients in the IVTA group. One of the possible reasons is that a dose of 3 mg injection of TA in our study reduced the incidence of elevated IOP. Another is that 3 months quiescent period without corticosteroids use reduced the possibility of steroid-induced ocular hypertension.

Postoperative Complications

During the enrollment period, five eyes showed relapse of active inflammation after cataract surgery in patients with uveitis. One eye had cystoid macular edema (CME). All of the relapse of uveitis and CME developed between two and three months after cataract surgery. Relapse of active inflammation was addressed by increasing the frequency of eye drops of 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate. The CME was addressed by sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide. The underlying cause of recurrent uveitis and CME was sarcoidosis in 3 eyes, 1 eye with NTM, and 1 eye with unknown etiology for the recurrence, and VKH in CME. No other complications such as posterior synechia, hypotony, posterior capsule opacity (PCO) development, and IOP elevation were observed.

### Cataract / anterior segment summary benchmark – 2024 [^113GsMez]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Cataract postoperative follow-up evaluation — Functionally monocular and high-risk patients should be seen within 24 hours of surgery, while routine patients should be seen within 48 hours of surgery. Frequency and timing of subsequent visits depend on incision characteristics, suture removal needs, and stabilization of refraction, visual function, and the eye's medical condition, with more frequent follow-up usually necessary for high risk patients. Components of each postoperative exam should include interval history (new symptoms, postoperative medications, and self-assessment of vision), measurement of visual function, measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, counseling/education, and provision of a management plan. The operating ophthalmologist has ultimate responsibility for preoperative assessment and postoperative care, has an ethical obligation that continues until postoperative rehabilitation is complete, should provide postoperative care within the ophthalmologist's unique competence, and patients should always have access to an ophthalmologist for appropriate care if serious problems arise.

### Delayed presentation of retained nuclear fragment following phacoemulsification cataract extraction [^116aj2JG]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

An 87-year-old woman presented 11 months after routine phacoemulsification cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in her left eye complaining of the abrupt onset of redness and decreased vision in that eye. Examination revealed a mild anterior chamber reaction and significant corneal edema. The eye was minimally responsive to topical steroid therapy, and initial serial slitlamp examinations with gonioscopy were unrevealing. After multiple head-positioning maneuvers were performed, a retained nuclear fragment was uncovered. The nuclear fragment was aspirated and liquefied by the phacoemulsification device in the anterior chamber. A retained nuclear fragment with an intact posterior capsule is a recognized cause of inflammation in the immediate postoperative presentation. Delayed presentation of symptoms is rare and presumably secondary to sequestration of the fragment behind the iris. We present a case and a review of the literature regarding sequestered retained nuclear fragments following what is initially thought to be uneventful cataract extraction.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^111qaznc]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — refractive and cataract procedures and intraocular pressure (IOP) considerations: Patients considering keratorefractive surgery should be informed about the possible impact laser vision correction has on reducing contrast sensitivity and decreasing the accuracy of IOP measurements; during LASIK, SMILE, and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, IOP briefly increases upon application of the suction ring and vacuum and this effect may cause additional damage in patients whose optic nerves already have advanced damage; therefore, these procedures may be relatively contraindicated in such individuals, especially after a trabeculectomy, but photorefractive keratectomy may be possible; postoperative interface fluid, topical corticosteroid use, and corticosteroid-induced IOP elevation can lead to IOP underestimation, and inflammation subsides as the IOP is reduced using glaucoma medications; patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy considering a multifocal intraocular lens should be informed of the risk of reduced contrast sensitivity, and it is important to establish preoperative and baseline documentation of ONH status and visual field to facilitate subsequent glaucoma management.

### Intraoperative intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection for prevention of postoperative inflammation and complications after phacoemulsification in patients with uveitic cataract [^113Z3qGK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study clearly shows that 3 mg TA intravitreal injection at the end of phacoemulsification can result in low-grade postoperative inflammation and fast vision rehabilitation, less incidence of complications (CME, iris synechia and PCO), and negligible adverse effects for 3 months, sparing the usage time of corticosteroids. So, we conclude that low-dose of 3 mg TA intravitreal injection is an effective, very safe and economic option for preventing postoperative inflammation and complications in the treatment of patients with anterior uveitis and panuveitis undergoing phacoemulsification.

### Post-cataract outcomes in patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant [^117VUtDt]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe visual acuity (VA) and inflammation following cataract surgery in eyes with noninfectious posterior uveitis (NIPU) that were being treated with a fluocinolone acetonide (FA) intravitreal implant compared with those that were not.

Design

Post hoc, subgroup analysis of data from a 3-year, dose-masked, randomized, multicenter trial evaluating the FA implant for the treatment of NIPU.

Participants and Controls

The subset of eyes that underwent cataract surgery during the 3-year trial. Eyes were either implanted with a 0.59- or a 2.1-mg FA implant, or, in the case of affected fellow eyes, received standard-of-care local treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

VA, anterior and posterior chamber inflammation at 1 and 3 months after surgery, and rate of uveitis recurrence and serious postoperative ocular adverse events.

Results

Of 278 patients enrolled in the main trial, 132/142 phakic implanted eyes and 39/186 phakic non-implanted eyes underwent cataract surgery. Mean improvement in VA was significantly greater in implanted than non-implanted eyes at 1 (P = 0.0047) and 3 months (P = 0.0015) postoperatively; significantly fewer anterior chamber cells were seen in implanted than non-implanted eyes at 1 (P = 0.0084) and 3 months (P = 0.0002). Severity of vitreous haze was less in implanted than non-implanted eyes at 3 months postoperatively (P = 0.0005). The postsurgical uveitis recurrence rate was lower in implanted than non-implanted eyes (26.5% vs 44.4%; P = 0.0433). Glaucoma was reported in 19.7% of implanted eyes and no non-implanted eyes (P = 0.0008) postoperatively.

Conclusion

In this post hoc subgroup analysis, eyes with NIPU treated with the FA intravitreal implant demonstrated better vision and less intraocular inflammation following cataract surgery than non-implanted eyes. Recurrent uveitic inflammation did not appear to be triggered by cataract surgery. Glaucoma occurred more frequently in implanted eyes.

### Predictors of time to recovery from cataract surgery among cataract patients at menelik II comprehensive specialized hospital: a retrospective follow up study [^115Becyy]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intraoperative characteristics

Small-incision cataract extraction (SICE) was the most common (73.42%) surgical procedure, and local anesthesia was predominantly (92.59%) used. The majority (91.50%) of lens insertions occurred in the posterior chamber. A greater proportion of surgeries were performed by ophthalmologists (54.47%) than by ophthalmology residents (45.53%). Intraoperative complications occurred in 8.71% of the patients, with capsular tears being the most commonly observed, accounting for 50% of those with complications. See Table 4 for details.

Table 4
Intraoperative characteristics of cataract patients treated with cataract surgery at menelik II comprehensive specialized hospital from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023(n = 459)

Note: Other intraoperative complications include posterior capsule rupture, iris tear, and uveal prolapse

Postoperative characteristics

Among the 459 patients, 53 (11.55%) experienced postoperative complications. The most common complications were inflammation 12 (22.64% of cases) and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) 11 (20.75% of cases). Other notable complications included posterior capsular opacification (PCO) in 8 patients (15.09% of cases) and infection in 7 patients (13.21% of cases). The less frequent complications were retinal detachment (6, 11.32%), secondary glaucoma (5, 9.43%) and others (cystoid macular edema and cataract lens fragments) (5, 9.43%). Overall, the majority of patients (406; 88.45%) did not experience any postoperative complications.

### Long term complications and vision loss in HLA-B27 uveitis [^1118UgFF]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Formation of posterior synechiae is a result of intraocular inflammation in the aqueous and is the most common complication in HLA-B27 uveitis. However, the rates of posterior synechiae vary widely in the literature with a range of 13.1–55%, which is likely due to the different cohort sizes and duration of follow-up. Our cohort's rate of almost 40% (0.0404/eye-year) is in the higher end of this range. Previous reports recognise chronic inflammation and recurrence of uveitis to be associated with posterior synechiae. Our findings contrast with Tay-Kearney et al. as our study did not observe increased cataract formation in the presence of posterior synechiae. Of significance, the development of posterior synechiae can result in seclusion papillae and subsequent iris bombé. In our study, peripheral iridotomy was required in 1.2% of eyes to relieve iris bombé. Subjects with uveitis have a high risk of failure with YAG peripheral iridotomy and surgical iridotomy is recommended. Intensive anti-inflammatory therapy in active uveitis, along with topical mydriatics, is essential for preventing and breaking the formation of posterior synechiae.

Cataract development was common within our study, developing in 22.1% with increased risk in older subjects, chronic inflammation and intermediate uveitis. Median age at time of cataract surgery was 63.9 years, with the majority (72.3%) being done at age ≤ 65years. In pre-presbyopic individuals, careful discussion around refractive targets and reading vision are required. Development of cataract in uveitis may be a complication of inflammation or occur secondary to steroid use. There is conflicting evidence on whether cataract formation risk is higher in HLA-B27-positive uveitis, but there was no significant difference in meta-analysis results. We did not identify any published study specific to outcomes of cataract surgery in HLA-B27 uveitis. However, a recent large study demonstrated uveitic eyes had smaller pupil size, increased additional procedures, more intraoperative complications, and poorer postoperative visual acuity up over a six month follow-up period, compared to non-uveitic eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Pre-operative risk factor assessment is essential for discussing prognosis with patients and minimising complication risks where possible.

### Predictors of time to recovery from cataract surgery among cataract patients at menelik II comprehensive specialized hospital: a retrospective follow up study [^116yRcSS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Independent variables

Independent variables included the following:

Sociodemographic variables

age, sex, and residence.

Preoperative factors

cataract type (e.g. age-related, traumatic, congenital), level of visual acuity, ocular comorbidities (e.g. age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy), and systemic comorbidities (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases).

Intraoperative factors

Cataract surgery type (e.g. phacoemulsification, manual small-incision cataract surgery), type of anesthesia (e.g. local, general), site of lenses inserted (IOL), intraoperative complications (e.g. intraocular lens dislocation, posterior capsule rupture, vitreous loss) and surgeon status.

Postoperative factors

postoperative complications (e.g. infection, inflammation, cystoid macular edema, secondary glaucoma, or retinal detachment).

Operational definition

Recovered

Recovery from cataract surgery was defined as the clinician-assessed restoration of vision (≥ 6/12), resolution of discomfort, and ocular healing. Resolution of discomfort referred to the absence or significant reduction of postoperative symptoms, including pain, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, photophobia, and itching, as reported by the patient and confirmed by the clinician during follow-up. Ocular healing was determined by the absence of inflammation or infection during postoperative evaluations. Recovery also included patient satisfaction with vision and the ability to resume daily activities.

Start time

the date when surgery was performed.

Follow-up period

From the date of surgery until either to a point where an event or censorship occurs.

The time to recovery

was defined as the duration in weeks from the date of cataract surgery until the patient achieved full recovery.

Event

the occurrence of full recovery.

Censored

A cataract patient who was treated with cataract surgery but whose outcome was out of follow-up (> 26 weeks), who was lost to follow-up, or who was transferred to other health facilities.

Loss to follow-up

refers to patients who visited the ophthalmic outpatient department (OPD) three times, were scheduled for a subsequent visit, but did not attend that visit, and whose final outcomes were not recorded.

Transferred-out

Patients who moved to another health facility with a confirmed written documentation of a transfer out.

### A case of uveitis-hyphema-glaucoma syndrome due to EX-PRESS glaucoma filtration device implantation [^112MtPBS]. Journal of Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of a 69-year-old patient who developed uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome (UGH) after an uneventful EX-PRESS mini shunt surgery for advanced primary open-angle glaucoma and to discuss management options and clinical implications. UGH syndrome is a rare, but serious complication usually described after cataract surgery. It is often described in anterior chamber intraocular lenses, sulcus lenses, and malpositioned or subluxed lenses resulting in chafing of the lens-iris interface. Clinical manifestations include increased intraocular pressure, anterior chamber inflammation, and recurrent hyphema.

Patient and Methods

We report a case of a 69-year-old African American man who developed UGH syndrome 8 years after uneventful implantation of a P-50 EX-PRESS miniature shunt. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated persistent inflammation without evidence of iris atrophy nor intraocular lens dislocation; however, gonioscopy demonstrated localized iris atrophy under the shunt with surrounding iris billowing and a layered hyphema.

Results

A localized laser iridoplasty around the shunt was performed leading to resolution of uveitis and hyphema. No other complications occurred during follow-up.

Conclusions

Given the increasing acceptance of glaucoma procedures involving implants, UGH syndrome may become more prevalent as new sources of intraocular devices may cause potential complications. Laser iridoplasty provides a minimally invasive approach to treating a localized source of chafing and reduce further surgical intervention.

### Premature expression of pseudoexfoliation syndrome with presenile cataract in a 28-year-old lady [^1119XgZQ]. Journal of Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We report a case of premature expression of pseudoexfoliation syndrome with presenile cataract in a 28-year-old lady with primary developmental glaucoma who had undergone glaucoma filtration surgery 26 years ago.

Methods/Results

We report a case of a 28-year-old Indian lady with progressive diminution of vision associated with photophobia in the left eye for 5 years and loss of vision in the right eye since childhood. She underwent glaucoma filtration surgery in the left eye at the age of 2 and was on 2 topical glaucoma medications when she presented to us. Refractive error was -17.00D with -3.50D @ 90-degree cylinder in the left eye. The right eye was phthisical. Left eye showed superior diffuse bleb, enlarged but clear cornea with superior Haab's striae, deep and quiet anterior chamber and patent surgical iridectomy at 1 o'clock position. There was diffuse iris atrophy with pseudoexfoliation at the pupillary ruff and over the anterior lens capsule. Lens showed grade 2 nuclear cataract. Intraocular pressure in the left eye was 23mmHg. Fundus examination showed 0.9 cupping with an inferior notch and diffuse pallor of the optic disc. Axial length of left eye was 31.44mm. On the basis of these findings, she was diagnosed with primary developmental glaucoma and high myopia, status after glaucoma filtration surgery with presenile cataract and pseudoexfoliation in the left eye. The topical antiglaucoma medications were augmented. After 1 month, intraocular pressure in the left eye was reduced to 14mmHg. She was advised to continue topical glaucoma medications and regular follow-up.

Conclusions

The present case is the first to describe the unusual presentation of pseudoexfoliation in a young individual along with presenile cataract. Simultaneous occurrence of pseudoexfoliation with cataract could be due to previous intraocular surgery, iris trauma, possible low-grade inflammation, and high myopia in a predisposed eye. The clinician should be aware that although a rare condition, pseudoexfoliation can occur in the young and may be associated with presenile cataract.

Case 3

A 46-year-old pseudophakic, vitrectomized male patient had been followed up with a diagnosis of FUS for 16 years. Following the diagnosis, he underwent phaco-PPV surgery 16 years ago due to cataract and vitreous opacities. His follow-up has been irregular for the last 10 years, and his adherence to topical antiglaucomatous treatments, which were started 10 years ago was very poor. At his last examination before GATT, his IOP was 18 mmHg under 3-molecule antiglaucomatous treatment, his BCVA was at the level of counting fingers from 2 m, and the optic disc appearance showed total glaucomatous excavation. During the last 10 years of follow-up, the patient's IOP regulation was stable under topical treatment, but due to long periods of non-attendance and poor adherence to follow-up, total glaucomatous excavation developed. GATT was planned with the recommendation to reduce or discontinue medication, and it was successfully performed over 360° in his left eye. (Fig. 3) On the first post-operative day, limited coagulum at the anterior chamber was observed and IOP was measured at 22 mmHg. Following the resorption of the limited viscoelastic material left in the anterior chamber after surgery, a hyphema at the level of 1/3 developed on the 3rd postoperative day. Anti-glaucomatous treatment was not started to avoid increasing the hyphema due to hypotony, and the hyphema completely resolved within 2 weeks. During the 2-week follow-up, IOP ranged between 20 and 30 mmHg. Despite starting anti-glaucomatous treatment afterwards, IOP values could not be reduced below 20 mmHg. Considering the postoperative IOP was higher than preoperative values, the possibility of steroid sensitivity was considered, and steroids were stopped in the 4th week without any flare-up in inflammation. During the 2-month follow-up after discontinuing steroids, IOP ranged between 25 and 32 mmHg under maximum antiglaucomatous treatment, and at the 3rd postoperative month, it was treated with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation. In the follow-up after cyclophotocoagulation, IOP values ranged between 10 and 15 mmHg. Vision was maintained at the level of counting fingers from 2 m, and the patient was able to maintain without medication as desired.

### Evaluating exaggerated, prolonged, or delayed postoperative intraocular inflammation [^112cSUBp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a diagnostic approach for the evaluation of patients with exaggerated, prolonged, or delayed postoperative intraocular inflammation.

Design

Perspective.

Methods

Selected articles on normal and abnormal postoperative intraocular inflammation were reviewed and interpreted in the context of the authors' clinical and research experience.

Results

In addition to infectious endophthalmitis, a number of noninfectious conditions characterized by exaggerated, prolonged, or delayed postoperative inflammation have been described. Heuristically, increased postsurgical inflammation may be categorized by time from surgery to first recognition using the following general guidelines: as immediate and occurring within 2 days after surgery; as early and occurring after 2 days, but within the first 2 weeks, after surgery; and as delayed and occurring more than 2 weeks after surgery.

Conclusions

Although infectious endophthalmitis always must be excluded as a cause of increased postoperative intraocular inflammation, potential noninfectious causes also exist. We review both infectious and noninfectious causes of increased postoperative inflammation and provide a diagnostic framework for evaluating such patients.

### Measuring anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery: a review of the literature focusing on the correlation with cystoid macular edema [^115UDPKJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed procedure in many developed countries. The technique is continuously evolving to meet the goals of patients and surgeons, having reached a level of refinement to be considered one of the most successful treatments in medicine. Despite the high level of safety of modern phacoemulsification, pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (CME) remains a frequent cause of unfavourable visual outcomes that may occur after uncomplicated surgery. By definition, CME is a thickening of the macula due to leakage and accumulation of fluid in the intracellular spaces, causing blurred or decreased vision. Systemic diseases (diabetes,–hypertension), intraoperative complications (posterior capsule rupturewith or without vitreous loss, iris trauma), and pre-existing ocular conditions (uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, history of vein occlusion, macular epiretinal membranes, previous retinal detachment, pseudoexofliation) increase the risk of pseudophakic CME development. Alongside these predisposing factors, angiographic signs of CME after cataract surgery are reported up to 70% in some studies. More specifically, the incidence of subclinical pseudophakic CME, diagnosed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), varies between 4 and 10.9%, while clinically significant CME, with transient or permanent visual impairment, ranges from 1% to 4% according to various studies.

The exact pathogenesis of CME after cataract surgery remains unclear. Surgical trauma causes blood-aqueous barrier disruption with leakage of pro-inflammatory molecules and cells in the anterior chamber (AC). Prostaglandins and other pro-inflammatory mediators, released by the anterior uvea, diffuse into the vitreous and increase the permeability of perifoveal capillaries, resulting in the intraretinal fluid accumulation with cystoid changes of the retinal layers.

To date, the risk of CME, based on the amount of post-surgical inflammation, remains uncertain, as only a few studies in the literature have attempted to correlate the degree of intraocular inflammation to the risk of CME development after cataract surgery. The majority of the studies focused on the anti-inflammatory effect of ophthalmic steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for preventing or treating of CME, principally measuring macular changes after surgery, more than accurately assessing the AC inflammatory response.

### Monitoring and management of the patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome: current perspectives [^115afU1a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative management

Despite excellent cataract surgery, some postoperative difficulties can occur in patients with PES because of abnormalities in ocular structures. Therefore, careful postoperative monitoring is important in these patients. In addition, difficulties encountered during surgery, increased operating time, and additional manipulations can increase the risk of postoperative complications.

Increased postoperative inflammation, which is attributed to the breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier that accompanies ischemic iris changes, is expected in PES. In the preoperative period, patients with PES exhibit an aqueous protein concentration at baseline levels several times higher than those measured in PES-free cataracts. In the preoperative period, baseline aqueous protein concentrations of patients with PES are several times higher than those without PES. Also, due to the prolonged and complicated surgery, iris manipulations, and possible vitreous loss, severe postoperative fibrinous uveitis is more common in these patients. It is also expected that intensive and prolonged inflammation with breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier may complicate the postoperative course of cases with PES and increase the risk of posterior synechia, capsular contraction, and cystoid macular edema. Fortunately, it has been shown that postoperative usage of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the amount of aqueous protein release and the percentage of patients showing increased macular thickness.

Another more common postoperative complication in PES is anterior-capsule contraction and phimosis, which occur especially in the presence of a smaller capsulorhexis and can lead to postoperative IOL decentration and dislocation (Figure 3). A neodymium:YAG laser can be used for the treatment of phimosis by making radial laser incisions through the circumferential anterior capsule bag, releasing the centripetal traction on the anterior capsule and zonules. In the presence of a dense phimotic anterior capsule–contraction band, radial incisions can be performed surgically. However, laser or surgical capsulotomy should be performed as soon as the capsular gap begins to shrink to prevent worsening of zonular damage.

### A rare case of membrane pupillary-block glaucoma in a phakic eye with uveitis [^116X1C1n]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Membrane pupillary-block glaucoma is a rare condition typically associated with fibrin formation due to postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery and vitrectomy.

Case Presentation

A 55-year-old man with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and anterior uveitis presented with decreased vision in his right eye. Examination revealed corneal epitheliopathy, anterior chamber cells, and cataract. Increased oral steroids resolved the ocular inflammation, but one month later, he developed severe ocular pain in the right eye. Examination revealed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of light perception, and intraocular pressure (IOP) was markedly elevated at 49 mmHg in the right eye. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) confirmed a shallow anterior chamber and a membrane across the pupil without adhesion to the lens, leading to the diagnosis of membrane pupillary-block glaucoma. AS-OCT was helpful in differentiating this condition from iris bombe. Surgical interventions, including membrane perforation, cataract extraction, and anterior vitrectomy, successfully relieved the pupillary block. Postoperatively, IOP decreased to 15 mmHg, and decimal BCVA improved to 0.4.

Conclusion

This is the first reported case of membrane pupillary-block glaucoma in a phakic eye with uveitis, though it is typically reported postoperatively. AS-OCT is an invaluable diagnostic tool, which may enable prompt surgical intervention and lead to favorable outcomes.

### Measurable outcomes of an ophthalmology and rheumatology coordinated care clinic [^116Ff9h4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pediatric noninfectious chronic anterior uveitis (CAU) is an intraocular disease characterized by inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye, or anterior uveitis (AU). Uveitis is also a comorbid feature of many other autoimmune diseases. Pediatric CAU frequently has few symptoms and can be difficult to detect until complications have occurred. Both CAU and its first‐line treatment, topical glucocorticoids, can cause serious complications, including cataracts and elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP), which may result in glaucoma and vision loss. Standard first‐line treatment includes topical glucocorticoids and dilating drops to limit synechiae development. It is important to diagnose and quickly treat uveitis to prevent permanent damage. Consensus‐based guidelines have been created for uveitis treatment with similar recommendations: patients resistant to initial treatment should receive systemic immunosuppressive agents, with methotrexate as the first‐line agent. In patients with inflammation resistant to methotrexate, subsequent options include tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, other biologic agents, and other conventional disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

### Poor visual outcome and associated factors among patients underwent cataract surgery at debre markos and felege hiwot comprehensive specialized hospitals, northwest Ethiopia, 2023 [^113XtWtE]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

According to this study, individuals who had preexisting central corneal opacity were 3.83 times more likely to experience poor visual outcomes following cataract surgery compared to those patients without central corneal opacity. This finding is consistent with similar studies conducted in Gondar, Ethiopia, Liberia, India and Malaysia. The reason for this increased risk could be that corneal opacity can obstruct the surgeon's view during cataract surgery, leading to longer surgery times and more intraoperative complications. Additionally, preexisting central corneal opacity can prevent the transmission of light to the retina after cataract surgery, resulting in suboptimal visual improvement.

In this study, individuals with preexisting glaucoma who underwent cataract surgery are 3.11 times more likely to experience poor visual outcomes than those without preexisting glaucoma. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted in Liberia, India, Malaysia, and Trinidad and Tobago in North America. The possible explanation for this association is that patients with glaucoma are more vulnerable to surgical-related complications such as posterior capsular tear, postoperative inflammation, and transient increase of intraocular pressure which can damage the optic nerve and result in less visual improvement after cataract surgery. Furthermore, the stage of preoperative glaucoma is an important factor to predict the final visual acuity after cataract surgery. Patients with advanced glaucoma tend to have less visual acuity improvement after cataract surgery as compared to those with moderate or early-stage glaucoma.

### Intraoperative performance and postoperative outcomes of cataract surgery in infant eyes with microphthalmos [^111LT8Ka]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the intraoperative performance and postoperative outcomes in microphthalmic eyes of infants younger than 1 year having bilateral cataract surgery.

Setting

Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.

Methods

This prospective observational study excluded eyes with ocular trauma, inflammation, posterior persistent fetal vasculature causing stretching of the ciliary processes or tractional retinal detachment, aniridia, or chorioretinal coloboma. Intraoperative observations included the rate of peripheral extension of the anterior capsule tear, intraoperative iris prolapse/trauma, and posterior capsule tear. All eyes were left aphakic. Postoperative observations included visual outcome, posterior synechias, visual axis obscuration (VAO), and glaucoma.

Results

The study evaluated 42 eyes of 21 infants. The mean age at surgery was 4.0 months ± 2.6 (SD) and the mean follow-up, 25.6 ± 11.3 months. Surgery was performed using the limbal approach in 30 eyes (71.4%) and by pars plicata lensectomy in 12 eyes (28.6%). In the limbal group, 3 eyes (10.0%) had an incomplete anterior capsulorhexis, 2 eyes (6.7%) had iris trauma, and 2 eyes (6.7%) had peripheral extension of the posterior capsulectomy edge. At the final follow-up, visual acuity remained stable in 4 eyes (9.5%) and was improved in 38 eyes (90.5%). The complications were posterior synechias in 15 eyes (35.7%), glaucoma in 13 eyes (30.9%), and VAO in 7 eyes (16.7%).

Conclusion

The results suggest that good visual outcomes can be obtained in microphthalmic patients with bilateral congenital cataract after early surgical intervention, with an acceptable rate of serious postoperative complications.

### Safety and efficacy of manual small incision cataract surgery for phacolytic glaucoma [^115VJXCG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the safety, visual outcome and complications of manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) in the treatment of patients with phacolytic glaucoma.

Methods

In a nonrandomised interventional case series, 33 consecutive patients with phacolytic glaucoma underwent cataract extraction by MSICS, with staining of the anterior capsule by trypan blue.

Results

The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 46.2 mmHg. No significant intraoperative complications such as posterior capsule rupture or expulsive hemorrhage occurred. In 31 patients (93.9%), an intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted in the posterior chamber. In two of 33 patients (6.1%), the posterior capsule was removed and the patient was left aphakic because of severe pre-existing zonulysis. The postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 or better in 29 cases (87.9%) and 20/40 or better in 26 patients (78.8%). The IOP was 22 mmHg or less in all 33 cases without the use of anti-glaucoma medications and the mean IOP was 15.1 mmHg (range, 7–22, SD ± 3.9). Postoperative corneal edema occurred in 11 cases (33.3%) and anterior chamber inflammation was present in nine cases (27.3%). Both conditions resolved with standard medical therapy.

Conclusion

Manual small incision cataract surgery with trypan blue staining of the anterior capsule is a safe and effective method of cataract extraction for patients with phacolytic glaucoma.

### Phacoemulsification in patients with uveitis: long-term outcomes [^112KRoqB]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Uveitis is a common eye disorder and causes anatomic and functional damage and complications in anterior and posterior segment structures due to underlying inflammatory processes. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of this structural damage become crucial. One of the most frequent complications that occur in patients with uveitis is cataract formation. Cataract may arise due to the inflammation itself or as a result of corticosteroid treatments.

Successful cataract management has been reported in several previous studies that have documented favorable anatomical and functional success rates with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. However, cataract surgery in eyes with uveitis poses a number of intraoperative and postoperative challenges, such as miotic pupil, synechiae, anterior segment bleeding, iris atrophy, excessive inflammation, high intraocular pressure (IOP), and cystoid macular edema (CME). The complication rate after phacoemulsification and IOL implantation can be reduced in the short term by careful preoperative medication, competent surgery, and close postoperative follow-up. However, the long-term effects of this surgical procedure may vary under different circumstances. Long term outcomes of phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in eyes with uveitis have shown great variations in previously reported studies, with variations arising due to differences in etiologic factors, phacoemulsification systems, surgical experience, and IOL type.

Cataract surgery may lead to serious complications in eyes with chronic inflammation. Previous studies have reported that eyes with uveitis often have unfavorable surgical results due to low tolerance to surgery and IOL implantation; however, the success rates of surgery have increased today as a result of recent developments in surgical techniques and IOL materials.

The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term outcomes of cataract surgery and the visual outcomes, complications, and contributing factors in patients with uveitis.

### Phacoemulsification in patients with uveitis: long-term outcomes [^112vmdyM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To assess the long-term outcomes of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in eyes with uveitis.

Methods

One hundred and five eyes of 81 patients, who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation between January 2009 and July 2016, were included in this study. The demographic data, preoperative clinical findings, postoperative outcomes, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. All collected data and risk factors with regard to visual prognosis were analyzed with the help of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 software program (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).

Results

During follow-up (mean: 35.2 ± 22.2 months), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved in 87.7% of all eyes and reached a level of 0.3 LogMAR or greater in 61.3% of eyes. Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification (50.9%), posterior synechiae (21.7%), cystoid macular edema (16%), epiretinal membrane (13.2%), glaucoma (11.3%), increased intraocular pressure (8.5%), and severe inflammation (6.6%). Uveitis recurred in 55.7% of all eyes. The risk for the development of cystoid macular edema was found to be associated with recurrence in the early postoperative period. Low visual acuity risk was 11.1-fold higher with macular scarring (p = 0.001) and 14-fold higher with optic atrophy (p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

With appropriate management during the pre- and postoperative periods, phacoemulsification and IOL implantation surgery can be safe and effective in eyes with uveitis. However, great caution must be taken to prevent complications both before and after the surgery.

### Outcome and prognostic factors of phacoemulsification cataract surgery in vogt-koyanagi-harada uveitis [^114bSxh9]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate visual outcome and prognostic factors following cataract surgery in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.

Design

Retrospective, interventional case series.

Methods

The history, clinical characteristics, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), full-field electroretinogram (ERG), intraocular inflammation, complications, and extraocular manifestations were analyzed retrospectively.

Results

One hundred and forty-eight male (214 eyes) and 138 female (194 eyes) VKH patients with complicated cataract were included. Surgery was performed on 352 eyes after complete control of intraocular inflammation for at least 3 months. In another set of 56 eyes, surgery was done 1 month after intraocular inflammation control. There was no difference in postoperative complications or BCVA between these 2 groups. The main complications after surgery were hyphema, ocular hypertension, and moderate anterior chamber reaction. Average preoperative visual acuity was 0.08. At last visit, BCVA was improved in 405 eyes (99.3%). The preoperative BCVA, treatment delay after disease onset, preoperative intraocular hypertension, and iris synechiae were associated with final visual outcome. Other parameters such as postoperative inflammation, IOL type, and presence of extraocular VKH features did not affect final BCVA. Poor visual acuity was caused by optic nerve atrophy, choroidoretinal neovascularization, and subretinal fibrosis. Poor postoperative BCVA was associated with an abnormal preoperative ERG profile.

Conclusions

Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in VKH patients can be safely and successfully performed in quiet eyes even after 1 month following the last signs of inflammation. Visual prognosis was associated with preoperative BCVA, treatment delay after disease onset, preoperative intraocular hypertension, iris synechiae, and presence of preoperative ERG abnormalities.

### A novel technique of penetrating keratoplasty to prevent intraocular contents extrusion for infectious keratitis [^113XPWo2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

82 eyes from 82 patients (53 male and 29 female) with refractory infectious keratitis underwent penetrating keratoplasty using our method. The mean follow-up period was 29 ± 16 months (range, 13 to 45 months). The mean age was 51 ± 12 years (range, 39 to 63 years). 61 cases were infected with fungi and 21 cases were infected with bacteria. 19 cases had corneal perforation and adherent leukoma to iris. Hypopyon was found in 24 cases. Anterior synechia or adherent leukoma was found in 15 cases, and pupil exudative membrane was found in 14 cases. Cataract was found in seven cases. The interval time between PK (penetrating keratoplasty) and infection was 2–7 weeks.

The mean diameter of the graft was 6.75 mm (range, 5.50 to 7.75 mm). Each procedure was completed without severe intraoperative complications, such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage, vitreous prolapse, lens extrusion, suture placement challenges, and iris–lens damage.

There was no recurrence of infectious keratitis. The anti-fungal and anti-bacterial drugs were used for 6 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively. Anatomical integrity was achieved in all eyes. No cases had choroidal and retinal detachment. Shallow anterior chamber was observed in 6 eyes (7.6%). Among these, there were 3 cases with posterior synechia, and another 3 cases with cataract development. Secondary glaucoma was confirmed in 14 eyes (17%), which was mostly caused by inflammation, but cured by topical anti-glaucoma medications.

Four eyes (6%) developed postoperative cataracts with variable degrees of severity. Graft rejection occurred in 13 eyes (17%) and the neovascularization was found in 6 eyes, but the rest grafts were still clear. The mean postoperative endothelial cell densities decreased from 2439 ± 138 cells/mm 2 to 1978 ± 225 cells/mm 2 at 1 month (loss of 19%) and 1829 ± 144 cells/mm 2 at 3 months (loss of 25%).

### Immunomodulatory treatment and surgical management of idiopathic uveitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis in children: a French survey practice [^111EJ8m4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic uveitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis are the first cause of uveitis in children. The uveitis is anterior, bilateral, chronic, insidious, initially asymptomatic but it can be associated with poor visual prognosis without appropriate treatment. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease in children. Its prevalence varies from 0.04 to 4/1000 in European countries. JIA is associated with chronic uveitis in 10–40% of cases, especially in oligoarticular forms, in young girls with positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA). In some cases, uveitis may occur before arthritis. Similar form exists without arthritis association called idiopathic uveitis. Chronic intraocular inflammation is responsible for complications such as cataract, glaucoma, band keratopathy, posterior synechiae or macular oedema, many of these leading to loss of vision. Although the prognosis of this pediatric chronic non-infectious uveitis has considerably improved in recent years, due to earlier recognition, development of immunosuppressive agents and biologicals, one third of these children will develop loss of visual acuity, and 5% of affected eyes will lose sight (visual acuity 20/200 or worse). Cataract and intraocular hypertension unresponsive to medical treatment frequently requires surgical management to prevent amblyopia and other sequelae. These surgeries are complex because of the high risk of postoperative complications because of underlying inflammation. Inflammation must be perfectly controlled to optimize surgical outcomes and avoid uveitis relapse. However, immunosuppressive therapies used during surgery may favour postoperative infection. There is no consensus about how to adapt treatment during the peri-operative period. Most authors recommend intensifying immunomodulatory treatments using topical or/and systemic corticosteroids. In France, some centres stop biologic agents or methotrexate in order to prevent infections. The primary objective of this study is to describe the therapeutic adaptations used for ocular surgery of idiopathic uveitis and uveitis associated with JIA in children treated with immunosuppressive drugs in several French University Hospitals. The secondary objective is to determine whether maintaining or discontinuing immunosuppressive therapies is associated with an increase risk of surgical site infection or an increased risk of inflammatory relapse.

### Intracameral dexamethasone injection in the treatment of cataract surgery induced inflammation: design, development, and place in therapy [^116TM5Ch]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vision impairment due to cataract inflicts 20 million individuals worldwide and represents nearly half the individuals with blindness. Since visual impairment from cataracts cannot be corrected by spectacle wear, contact lenses or medical treatment, cataract extraction is the only option for patients to clear optical media. Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed and most successful surgical procedures worldwide. As with any intraocular surgery, varying degrees of inflammation occur secondary to mechanical damage from the surgical tissue manipulation and a mild reaction to the foreign intraocular lens (IOL), which may result in significant postoperative inflammation. The consequences of postoperative inflammation are cystoid macular edema, increased intraocular pressure, posterior capsular opacification, and protein leakage from the breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier. Even in uncomplicated cataract surgeries, the inflammatory sequelae may occasionally lead to chronic uveitis and fibrin formation contributing to an undesirable surgical outcome.

In a recent study, 34% of patients reported eye pain during the first 24 hours following cataract surgery and 10% of patients reported discomfort for as long as 6 weeks after surgery. Postoperative visual symptoms attributed to inflammation include dryness, irritation, and pain, which may delay the postoperative recovery and affect patient satisfaction.–Hence, addressing the inflammation is an important part of the postoperative care.

As early as 1950, the beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy on inflammatory ocular disease was recognized. It has been well demonstrated that topical corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective drugs compared to placebo for decreasing anterior chamber inflammation and its sequelae. In 2012, a survey of surgeons to the 132 members of the Association of Veterans Affairs Ophthalmologists reported that 97% of respondents were prescribed corticosteroid drops and or NSAID drops after cataract surgery, supporting this regimen as a Standard of Care (SOC) in postoperative pharmaceutical treatment after cataract surgery.

### Innovative trifocal (quadrifocal) presbyopia-correcting IOLs: 1-year outcomes from an international multicenter study [^114JR9o2]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This prospective, single-arm, nonmasked, nonrandomized international study was conducted at 17 sites including Australia (4 sites), Chile (3 sites), Germany (2 sites), Italy (2 sites), Spain (2 sites), Belgium (1 site), Great Britain (1 site), France (1 site), and the Netherlands (1 site) from September 2015 to June 2017. Study visits included a preoperative screening visit; 2 operative visits (first- and second-eye surgeries; second-eye surgery was conducted 7 to 9 days after first-eye surgery); postimplantation visits conducted at 1 day and 8 to 10 days after each surgery; and postimplantation visits conducted 20 to 40, 120 to 180, and 330 to 420 days after the second-eye surgery. The study (identifier, NCT02529488) was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with good clinical practice (ISO 14155:2011). Institutional review board or ethics committee approval was obtained. Patients provided voluntary written informed consent before any screening or trial-related procedures.

Patients

Included in the study were patients aged 22 years or older with bilateral cataracts with planned cataract extraction by phacoemulsification. Additional inclusion criteria were preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) worse than 0.20 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in both eyes, potential postoperative CDVA equal to or better than 0.20 logMAR in both eyes, and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism less than 1.00 D in both eyes.

Key exclusion criteria were any clinically significant ocular abnormalities or diseases; degenerative eye disorders; glaucoma or ocular hypertension; rubella, congenital, traumatic, or complicated cataracts, or any conditions expected to cause intraocular inflammation; known color vision deficiencies; anterior chamber depth of 2.5 mm or less; history of or planned refractive surgeries; or previous corneal transplant. If any of the mentioned criteria were discovered during the first-eye surgery before the IOL came into contact with the eye, implantation was not performed, and the patient was discontinued from the study: any additional procedures during phacoemulsification and IOL implantation because of intraoperative complications or incision site or haptic placement not in accordance with the protocol. If these criteria were discovered during the second-eye surgery before the IOL came into contact with the eye, implantation of the second eye was not performed.

### Dexamethasone intracanalicular insert versus standard topical steroids for the prophylaxis of inflammation after cataract surgery [^116BQk9C]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of an intracanalicular dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DII) to a topical prednisolone acetate 1% taper for preventing breakthrough inflammation (iritis or cystoid macular edema [CME]) during the first postoperative month (POM1) after cataract surgery.

Design

Retrospective, nonrandomized comparative interventional study.

Methods

Patients received either DII or topical prednisolone acetate 1% eyedrops (control) during POM1. Exclusion criteria included history of iritis, glaucoma, intraoperative posterior capsular rupture or vitreous prolapse, immediate postoperative anterior chamber inflammation requiring treatment, or less than 1 month follow-up postoperatively. Outcomes included development of breakthrough inflammation after > 3 days postoperatively necessitating additional antiinflammatory drops, CME, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) at POM1.

Results

A total of 266 eyes of 174 patients were included in the DII group and 258 eyes of 167 patients in the control group. Demographics, comorbidities, and baseline IOP were comparable between groups. The breakthrough inflammation rate was significantly higher in the DII group compared to control (9.0% vs 3.1%; P < .01); CME rates were similar between groups (4.9% vs 4.3%; p = 0.75). There were no cases of increased IOP > 10 mm Hg at POM1 compared to baseline in either group.

Conclusions

After cataract surgery, DII demonstrated a higher rate of breakthrough inflammation than a standard topical steroid regimen with no significant differences in CME rate or IOP increase; however, overall, the rate of postoperative complications was low. DII can be a safe and effective alternative to topical corticosteroid therapy after cataract surgery.

### Outcomes of two-stage phacoemulsification and pars plana vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy with coexisting cataract: a comparative study [^112PLJTV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to compare the outcomes of a two-stage surgical approach in treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) coexisting with cataract.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled 97 eyes. Thirty eyes were assigned to sequential surgery: initial intravitreal pharmacotherapy administered concurrently with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, followed by pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) one week postoperatively. The remaining 67 eyes underwent combined surgery, which entailed initial intravitreal pharmacotherapy followed one week later by simultaneous PPV, phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. The primary outcomes measured included early postoperative anterior chamber (AC) inflammation (degree of inflammatory cells and fibrinous exudate), posterior synechiae of the iris, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and other intraoperative and postoperative complications.

Results

Post-vitrectomy day 1, in the sequential group, postoperative findings included AC cells ≥ 2+ in five eyes, fibrinous exudation in two eyes, and posterior synechiae of the iris in one eye. In the combined group, 28 eyes exhibited inflammatory cells ≥ 2+ postoperatively, nine eyes presented with fibrinous exudation, and seven eyes developed posterior synechiae of the iris. The difference in the incidence of AC cell grade ≥ 2+ between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Preoperative BCVA (LogMAR) in the sequential group was 1.88 ± 1.13, improving to 0.73 ± 0.77 at the final follow-up, showing statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05). In the combined group, preoperative BCVA (LogMAR) was 1.71 ± 1.08, improving to 0.74 ± 0.91 at the final follow-up, also showing significant improvement (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative BCVA (LogMAR) between the two groups (P > 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis identified sequential surgery as a significant protective factor against AC inflammation (OR 0.187, 95% CI 0.056–0.621, P = 0.006), indicating a substantially reduced risk of postoperative inflammatory reaction in the staged intervention cohort.

Conclusion

Both sequential and combined surgical approaches are viable for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy with concomitant cataract. These findings indicate that sequential surgery helps reduce early postoperative inflammatory reactions; however, no significant difference in long-term efficacy has been observed between the two surgical methods. Clinical decision-making should be personalized, taking into account the patient's specific condition and the surgeon's expertise.

### Early versus late traumatic cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation [^111ZphYu]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

PurposeTo determine the proper time for traumatic cataract surgery after open globe injuries. SettingFarabi Eye Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. DesignRandomized clinical trial. Patients and methodsIn a randomized clinical trial, 30 eyes with traumatic cataract after open globe injury with IOL implantation underwent early (in the first week after the trauma) and 30 eyes underwent late cataract surgery (from the first to second month after the trauma). We excluded patients who were under 12-year-old. All patients were visited at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. In each visit, patients were examined regarding visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior chamber inflammation, IOL position, and posterior synechiae. In addition, posterior segment evaluation and fundoscopy were performed. Intraoperative complication including posterior capsular rupture, anterior vitrectomy, and zonulysis as well as the site of IOL implantation were documented and post-operative complications including raised IOP, anterior chamber inflammation, visual axis opacity, posterior synechiae, subluxation of IOL, and IOL pigment deposition were listed. ResultsBest-corrected visual acuity 6 months after surgery was not different between the two groups. Also in early cataract surgery group, the rate of posterior capsular rupture was not significantly higher than the late surgery group (P = 0.069). On the other hand, zonulysis was significantly higher in the late procedure group (P = 0.039). Other complications including anterior vitrectomy, raised IOP, anterior chamber inflammation, visual axis opacity, posterior synechiae, subluxation of IOL, and IOL pigment deposition were not different in the two groups. ConclusionsEarly and late traumatic cataract surgery and IOL implantation after open globe injuries, have no significant difference regarding the post-surgical BCVA and prominent intraoperative and post-operative complications.

### Phacoemulsification combined with micropulse cyclodiode laser in glaucoma patients: efficacy and safety [^112jVaCL]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated that 42.8% of our patients who completed 12 months follow up had an improvement in their visual acuity by 1 line or more, 11.9% had unchanged vision and 26.1% (11 patients) had worsening in their vision. We explored the patients who had worsening in vision and found: 2 patients had further glaucoma filtrating surgeries, 2 patients had CMO, 1 patient had persistent inflammation, and 1 patient had posterior capsular opacification at 12 months follow up.

The incidence of CMO has been reported to be between 1% and 30% after non-complicated cataract surgery and 5% after only MP-TSCPC. Two patients developed CMO which was persistent at the 1 year follow up. One of these patients had a previously established branch retinal vein occlusion in the operated eye as a confounding factor, and the other had severe anterior chamber inflammation and presented with CMO 1 week postoperatively. We found that severe inflammation in the early days post-surgery may be an indication towards poor prognosis long term. Therefore, aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment should be considered early. Perez et al. reported neurotrophic keratitis in two patients after receiving MP-TSCPC. However, our study did not show any patients with this complication.

Our study demonstrates promising results, longer follow-up should be sought to assess the influence on IOP reduction beyond 12 months. A randomised trial could be considered comparing phacoemulsification alone versus phacoemulsification with MP-TSCPC in one type of glaucoma, such as OAG, to truly understand the many factors affecting IOP reduction.

Summary

What was known before

Cataract surgery is known to reduce the intra-ocular pressure by increasing the outflow facility.
Micropulse cyclodiode laser is also known to reduce the intra-ocular pressure.
The effect of cataract surgery combined with Micropulse cyclodiode laser has never been studies.

What this study adds

This is the first study to evaluate the effect of cataract surgery combined with micropulse cyclodiode laser in glaucoma patients.
We demonstrated that this was effective in reducing IOP and the need for anti-glaucoma drops at all timepoints.

### Surgical outcomes of contrast sensitivity and visual acuity in uveitis-associated cataract [^111vBhoA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients and Methods

This prospective study included 26 eyes of 19 patients with uveitis and 45 eyes of 26 controls at the Department of Ophthalmology, Kyushu University Hospital and Kyushu Medical Center from October 2016 to December 2018.

This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. This was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Clinical Research at the Kyushu University and Kyushu Medical Center and registered on University Medical Information Network (UMIN ID: 000041141). We obtained written informed consent from all the participants before performing any study procedures or examinations. Randomization was not performed because the participants were divided into two groups: non-uveitis as the negative control and uveitis. Participants were not blinded because they underwent the same cataract surgery in both the groups.

In this study, the number of target cases was set at 90 eyes: 45 eyes with uveitis and 45 non-uveitis eyes. We set targets according to the outcomes of previous reports. When we assumed improvement of visual acuity (logMAR) at 0.5 ± 0.35 in the uveitis groupand 0.3 ± 0.25 in the control group, we estimated the number of the necessary eyes according to significant difference between the uveitis and the control group in Student's t -test. However, it was difficult to enroll enough patients to reach the target numbers in the uveitis group because there were few patients with uveitis in whom cataract surgery alone was enough to improve their visual acuity.

Inclusion Criteria

Patients aged older than 50 years who were required to undergo cataract surgery with IOL implantation were included. Before surgery, it was a prerequisite for eligibility of patients with uveitis to have a quiescence of intraocular inflammation for more than 3 months in the absence of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. In cases with vitritis, cells may persist even in inactive stage and cannot be completely eliminated.

Exclusion Criteria

The exclusion criteria were as follows:
Medical history of any of the following conditions that were likely to affect surgical outcome:

Preoperative trauma, pre-existing macular pathologies, vitreous hemorrhage, diabetes mellitus, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, ocular surface disorders, glaucoma uncontrolled by medical therapy, and optic atrophy.
Corneal endothelial cell density less than 1000 cells/mm 2.
Long-term use of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
Presence of systemic and ocular complications that make it difficult to perform cataract surgery.
History of ocular surgery in the eligible eye.

### Cataract surgery… [^114NeAZq]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

During cataract surgery, the cloudy natural lens is removed from the posterior chamber, either by emulsification in place or by cutting it out. An IOL is usually implanted in its place, or less frequently in front of the chamber, to restore useful focus. Cataract surgery is generally performed by an ophthalmologist in an out-patient setting at a surgical centre or hospital. Local anaesthesia is normally used; the procedure is usually quick and causes little or no pain and minor discomfort. Recovery sufficient for most daily activities usually takes place in days, and full recovery takes about a month. Well over 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, and there is a low complication rate. Day care, high-volume, minimally invasive, small-incision phacoemulsification with quick post-operative recovery has become the standard of care in cataract surgery in the developed world.

Manual small incision cataract surgery, which is considerably more economical in time, capital equipment, and consumables, and provides comparable results, is popular in the developing world. Both procedures have a low risk of serious complications, and are the definitive treatment for vision impairment due to lens opacification. Early symptoms may include faded colours, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, sensitivity to glare from bright lights, and night blindness. Total blindness is the end result. The procedure is normally elective, but lens removal may be part of trauma surgery in cases where the eye is severely injured. The lens is usually replaced by an intraocular implant when this is reasonably practicable, as removal of the lens also removes the ability of the eye to focus at any distance.

Comparative trials of MSICS against phaco in dense cataracts have found no significant difference in outcomes, although MSICS had shorter operating times and significantly lower costs. MSICS has been prioritized as the method of choice in developing countries, because it provides high-quality outcomes with less surgically-induced astigmatism than standard ECCE, no suture-related problems, quick rehabilitation, and fewer post-operative visits.
- The degree of reduction of vision due largely to the cataract is evaluated. While the existence of other sight-threatening diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma, does not preclude cataract surgery, less improvement may be expected in their presence.
- In cases of uncontrolled glaucoma, a combined cataract-glaucoma procedure can be planned and performed.
- People with retinal detachment may be scheduled for a combined vitreo-retinal procedure, along with IOL implantation.
- People taking tamsulosin, a common drug for enlarged prostate, are prone to developing a surgical complication known as intraoperative floppy iris syndrome, which requires appropriate management to avoid posterior capsule rupture.
- Infants with congenital cataracts are more likely to have post-operative inflammation problems, and their eyes grow rapidly and unpredictably, making it challenging to select and fit a posterior chamber IOL in infants younger than seven months that will give satisfactory results later in childhood. A second surgery may be required later. Cataract surgery may be performed to correct vision problems on both eyes. If both eyes are suitable, people are usually advised to consider monovision. This procedure involves inserting an IOL providing near vision into one eye, while using one that provides distance vision for the other eye.

### Cataract surgery [^112Ka1uA]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

During cataract surgery, the cloudy natural lens is removed from the posterior chamber, either by emulsification in place or by cutting it out. An IOL is usually implanted in its place, or less frequently in front of the chamber, to restore useful focus. Cataract surgery is generally performed by an ophthalmologist in an out-patient setting at a surgical centre or hospital. Local anaesthesia is normally used; the procedure is usually quick and causes little or no pain and minor discomfort. Recovery sufficient for most daily activities usually takes place in days, and full recovery takes about a month. Well over 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, and there is a low complication rate. Day care, high-volume, minimally invasive, small-incision phacoemulsification with quick post-operative recovery has become the standard of care in cataract surgery in the developed world.

Manual small incision cataract surgery, which is considerably more economical in time, capital equipment, and consumables, and provides comparable results, is popular in the developing world. Both procedures have a low risk of serious complications, and are the definitive treatment for vision impairment due to lens opacification. Early symptoms may include faded colours, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, sensitivity to glare from bright lights, and night blindness. Total blindness is the end result. The procedure is normally elective, but lens removal may be part of trauma surgery in cases where the eye is severely injured. The lens is usually replaced by an intraocular implant when this is reasonably practicable, as removal of the lens also removes the ability of the eye to focus at any distance.

Comparative trials of MSICS against phaco in dense cataracts have found no significant difference in outcomes, although MSICS had shorter operating times and significantly lower costs. MSICS has been prioritized as the method of choice in developing countries, because it provides high-quality outcomes with less surgically-induced astigmatism than standard ECCE, no suture-related problems, quick rehabilitation, and fewer post-operative visits.
- The degree of reduction of vision due largely to the cataract is evaluated. While the existence of other sight-threatening diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration or glaucoma, does not preclude cataract surgery, less improvement may be expected in their presence.
- In cases of uncontrolled glaucoma, a combined cataract-glaucoma procedure can be planned and performed.
- People with retinal detachment may be scheduled for a combined vitreo-retinal procedure, along with IOL implantation.
- People taking tamsulosin, a common drug for enlarged prostate, are prone to developing a surgical complication known as intraoperative floppy iris syndrome, which requires appropriate management to avoid posterior capsule rupture.
- Infants with congenital cataracts are more likely to have post-operative inflammation problems, and their eyes grow rapidly and unpredictably, making it challenging to select and fit a posterior chamber IOL in infants younger than seven months that will give satisfactory results later in childhood. A second surgery may be required later. After phacoemulsification of the lens nucleus and cortical material is completed, an irrigation–aspiration system is used to remove the remaining peripheral lens material. The procedure is done under a surgical microscope.

### Cataract… [^112AXcvc]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of cataract, though considerable overlap occurs. People with nuclear sclerotic or brunescent cataracts often notice a reduction of vision. Nuclear cataracts typically cause greater impairment of distance vision than of near vision. Those with posterior subcapsular cataracts usually complain of glare as their major symptom. Oxidative stress associated with lipid peroxidation is an important pathogenic mechanism in cataract formation. Senile cataracts are associated with a decrease in antioxidant capacity in the lens. An increase in oxidative stress in the lens or a decrease in the ability to remove reactive oxygen species can lead to the lens becoming more opaque. Post-operative Nearly every person who undergoes a vitrectomy — without ever having had cataract surgery — will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation.

This may be because the native vitreous humor is different from the solutions used to replace the vitreous, such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native vitreous humour contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because conventional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid. Accordingly, for phakic patients requiring a vitrectomy it is becoming increasingly common for ophthalmologists to offer the vitrectomy combined with prophylactic cataract surgery to prevent cataract formation. Treatment Surgical The appropriateness of surgery depends on a person's particular functional and visual needs and other risk factors. Cataract removal can be performed at any stage and no longer requires ripening of the lens. Surgery is usually outpatient and usually performed using local anesthesia. About 9 of 10 patients can achieve a corrected vision of 20/40 or better after surgery.

Several recent evaluations found that cataract surgery can meet expectations only when significant functional impairment due to cataracts exists before surgery. Visual function estimates such as VF-14 have been found to give more realistic estimates than visual acuity testing alone. In some developed countries, a trend to overuse cataract surgery has been noted, which may lead to disappointing results.
- Anaesthetic – The eye is numbed with either a subtenon injection around the eye or topical anesthetic eye drops. The former also provides paralysis of the eye muscles.
- Corneal incision – Two cuts are made at the margin of the clear cornea to allow insertion of instruments into the eye.
- Irrigation and aspiration – The cortex, which is the soft outer layer of the cataract, is aspirated or sucked away. Fluid removed is continually replaced with a saline solution to prevent collapse of the structure of the anterior chamber.
- Lens insertion – A plastic, foldable lens is inserted into the capsular bag that formerly contained the natural lens. Some surgeons also inject an antibiotic into the eye to reduce the risk of infection. The final step is to inject salt water into the corneal wounds to cause the area to swell and seal the incision. Prognosis Postoperative care The postoperative recovery period is usually short. The patient is usually ambulatory on the day of surgery, but is advised to move cautiously and avoid straining or heavy lifting for about a month. The eye is usually patched on the day of surgery and use of an eye shield at night is often suggested for several days after surgery. In all types of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision.

### Secondary glaucoma… [^1135epae]. Wikipedia (2021). Medium credibility.

Principal causes of secondary glaucoma include optic nerve trauma or damage, eye disease, surgery, neovascularization, tumours and use of steroid and sulfa drugs. Risk factors for secondary glaucoma include uveitis, cataract surgery and also intraocular tumours. Common treatments are designed according to the type and the underlying causative condition, in addition to the consequent rise in IOP. These include drug therapy, the use of miotics, surgery or laser therapy. Paediatric congenital cataract associated glaucoma Based on the onset of secondary glaucoma in paediatric patients, it can be classified into early-stage and late-stage glaucoma cases. Early-stage secondary glaucoma, observed as angle-closure glaucoma, results from the blockage and inflammation of the peripheral anterior synechiae structure. However, early-stage secondary glaucoma rarely occurs with the readily available prescription of anti-inflammatory medications.

On the other hand, late-stage glaucoma is commonly associated with open-angle glaucoma but the mechanisms are currently unconfirmed. Yet, it is believed to be closely related to the onset of trabeculitis or vitreous toxicity. In paediatric congenital cataract patients under the age of two, cataract surgery is considered and frequently employed as the primary treatment. There are two types of therapeutic combination, primary and secondary lens implantation. In primary IOL, cataract surgery is performed alongside immediate implantation of IOL. However, in secondary IOL implantation, the patient is prescribed aphakic glasses or contact lenses till the implantation of IOL after a varied period of time between a few months or years. Primary IOL implantation is observed to significantly reduce and avoid the occurrence of secondary glaucoma in paediatric patients under the age of two.

Herpetic anterior uveitis associated glaucoma In patients diagnosed with herpetic anterior uveitis, elevated IOP and secondary glaucoma are often detected. This is due to two main reasons, the blockage of vitreous flow resulting from inflammation in the structures of the trabecular meshwork, and the sedimentation of inflamed cells. Specifically for viral anterior uveitis, patients with IOP levels above 30 mmHg are often suffer from secondary glaucoma caused by cytomegalovirus.
- **Aphakic and pseudophakic glaucoma**: Aphakic glaucoma is a common side-effect of cataract surgery which causes an increase in IOP.
- **Corticosteroid-induced glaucoma**: Corticosteroids is a risk factor for the development of secondary glaucoma, as there had been increased IOP observed as a drug side-effect. Secondary glaucoma indicated after congenital cataract surgery is found between 6 and 24% of the cases noted, whereas, secondary glaucoma caused by primary IOL implantation was observed as 9. 5%.

Additionally, for patients with aphakia and secondary IOL implantation, 15. 1% of the cases were determined. The incidence risk in primary IOL implantation in children with cataract in both eyes is lower than secondary IOL implantation and aphakic condition. However, this difference is not observed in the general population and populations with cataract in one eye. The observed pathophysiology of secondary glaucoma in uveitis is found to be linked to the increase and fluctuation of IOP. Inflammation of eye tissues contributes to the blockage of IOP produced in the ciliary body. This results in the accumulation of aqueous and thus elevated IOP, which is a common risk factor for the progression of secondary glaucoma. Paediatric congenital cataract surgery Paediatric congenital cataract surgery is also identified as a risk factor for the progression of secondary glaucoma. Cataract is an ocular disease, identified by the progressive clouding of the lens.

### Phacoemulsification… [^112n55Zm]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

The phacoemulsification system comprises three sub-systems: Ultrasound, aspiration, and irrigation. Removal of OVDs At the end of the procedure, OVDs that were injected to stabilize the anterior chamber, protect the cornea from damage, and distend the cataract's capsule during IOL implantation are removed from the eye to prevent post-operative viscoelastic glaucoma, a severe intra-ocular pressure increase. This is done via suction from the irrigation-aspiration instrument and replacement by buffered saline solution. Removal of OVDs from behind the implant reduces the risk and magnitude of postoperative pressure spikes or capsular distention. Complications Complications can develop during and after surgery. During surgery Posterior capsular rupture, a tear in the posterior capsule of the natural lens, is the most-common complication during cataract surgery.

Posterior capsule rupture can cause lens fragments to be retained, corneal oedema, and cystoid macular oedema; it is also associated with increased risk of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a rare complication. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome has an incidence of around 0. 5% to
2. 0%. Iris or ciliary body injury has an incidence of about 0. 6%-1. 2%. In the event of a posterior capsule rupture, fragments of the nucleus can find their way through the tear into the vitreous chamber; this is called posterior dislocation of nuclear fragments. Other complications include failure to aspirate all lens fragments, leaving some in the anterior chamber; and incisional burns caused by overheating of the phacoemulsification tip. After surgery Complications after cataract surgery are relatively uncommon. Posterior vitreous detachment may occur but does not directly threaten vision.

Some people develop a posterior capsular opacification, also called an after-cataract. This may compromise visual acuity, and can usually be safely and painlessly corrected using a laser. to create a clear central visual axis. Patients who have had cataract surgery are at an increased risk of developing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment — the most-common form of retinal detachment. Toxic anterior segment syndrome, a non-infectious inflammatory condition, may occur following cataract surgery. Endophthalmitis is a serious infection of the intraocular tissues, usually following intraocular surgery complications or penetrating trauma, and one of the most-severe. It is rare in cataract surgery due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Hypopyon occurs about 80% of the time. Glaucoma may occur and may be very difficult to control. It is usually associated with inflammation, especially when small fragments or chunks of the nucleus access the vitreous cavity.

Mechanical pupillary block can occur when contact between the edge of the pupil and an adjacent structure blocks the flow of aqueous through the pupil. This is more frequent as a complication of anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, but has been known to occasionally occur with posterior IOL implantation. Swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina, results in macular oedema and can occur a few days or weeks after surgery. Most such cases can be successfully treated. Uveitis–glaucoma–hyphema syndrome is a complication caused by the mechanical irritation of a mis-positioned IOL over the iris, ciliary body or iridocorneal angle.

### Manual small incision cataract surgery [^1118JXMR]. Wikipedia (2023). Medium credibility.

The precise geometry of the incision is important as it affects the self-sealing of the wound and the amount of astigmatism caused by distortion of the cornea during healing. A sclerocorneal or scleral tunnel incision is commonly used, which reduces induced astigmatism if suitably formed. A sclerocorneal tunnel, a three-phase incision, starts with a shallow incision perpendicular to the sclera, followed by an incision through the sclera and cornea approximately parallel to the outer surface, and then a beveled incision into the anterior chamber. The tunnel extends from the scleral incision approximately parallel to the outer surface, and slightly deeper than half the thickness of the sclera, and should extend at least a millimetre into the cornea. The inner edge should follow the curve of the corneal edge. As the incision heals, the meridian along which the wound is centered tends to progressively flatten, which may continue for up to 3 weeks until healing is complete.

The geometry of the incision may be chosen to permanently reduce pre-operative refractive error, or maintain original cornea shape. Various methods may be used: Management with irrigating vectis: Hydrodissection is performed until a part of the nucleus prolapses into the anterior chamber, or the surgeon hooks and lifts the nucleus edge, and rotates it until it prolapses into the anterior chamber. The nucleus is then removed through the tunnel using an irrigating vectis. Viscoelastic is injected above and below the nucleus to protect the endothelium. Removal of OVDs After the IOL is inserted, ophthalmic viscosurgical devices are aspirated or flushed out and replaced with BSS. Residues of OVDs can cause raised intraocular pressure by blocking the trabecular meshwork until they dissipate. IOP spikes can cause damage to the optic nerve and visual disturbances in patients with glaucoma. Postoperative endophthalmitis is also associated with OVD residue.

Wound sealing The surgeon checks the incision does not leak fluid because wound leakage increases the risk of microorganisms gaining access into the eye and predisposing it to endophthalmitis. An antibiotic/steroid combination eye drop is put in, and an eye shield may be applied, sometimes supplemented with an eye patch. A well constructed scleral tunnel should be self-sealing, but if it does not seal sufficiently, one or more sutures will be added. Complications Complications can develop during and after surgery. During surgery Posterior capsular rupture, a tear in the posterior capsule of the natural lens, is the most-common complication during cataract surgery. Posterior capsule rupture can cause lens fragments to be retained, corneal oedema, and cystoid macular oedema; it is also associated with increased risk of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. It may make it necessary to place the IOL outside the capsular bag.

After surgery Complications after cataract surgery are relatively uncommon. Posterior vitreous detachment may occur but does not directly threaten vision. Some people develop a posterior capsular opacification, also called an after-cataract. This may compromise visual acuity, and can usually be safely and painlessly corrected using a laser. to create a clear central visual axis.
