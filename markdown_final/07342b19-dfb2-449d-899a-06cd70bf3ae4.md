## Question

Can you explain ketamine's mechanism of action in detail?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a detailed explanation of ketamine's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ketamine's primary molecular targets and receptor pharmacology. Then, I should distinguish anesthetic versus antidepressant mechanisms and where they overlap. Next, I will evaluate enantiomer-specific pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, integrate additional receptor systems and neural circuit effects, consider dose–response and clinical implications, and finally acknowledge limitations and safety concerns to keep the synthesis balanced and evidence-based [^116WtDiL] [^1111i7Tu].

> Let me first confirm the foundational mechanism before moving forward. Ketamine is a non-selective, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that binds within the open channel at the phencyclidine site, producing uncompetitive blockade of cation flux, particularly Ca2+, which underlies much of its dissociative anesthetic effect and analgesia; this is well documented in the FDA label and mechanistic reviews, and I should not overcomplicate this primary point at the outset [^116WtDiL] [^111mbNAQ] [^113Yy4aF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single receptor explaining all clinical states. For anesthesia and dissociation, NMDA antagonism is central, but forebrain HCN1 channel inhibition contributes to hypnosis; conditional HCN1 deletion in excitatory neurons shifts the ketamine EC50 for loss-of-righting reflex upward, indicating a meaningful role beyond NMDA blockade, and clinically the dissociative state includes preserved airway reflexes, sympathoactivation, and minimal respiratory depression on label, which I should keep distinct from antidepressant mechanisms [^117LhHC3] [^116WtDiL].

> Now, for antidepressant actions, let me consider the disinhibition hypothesis carefully. Blockade of NMDA receptors on GABAergic interneurons reduces inhibitory tone, disinhibiting pyramidal neurons and causing an acute glutamate surge that drives AMPA receptor activation; preclinical data show AMPAR antagonists abrogate antidepressant-like effects of ketamine and its enantiomers, so I should treat AMPA throughput as necessary in most models, even if not sufficient by itself [^111a9Y1i] [^111imQXP].

> Next, I should review the synaptic protein synthesis pathway linking transient NMDAR blockade to durable plasticity. Ketamine's blockade of NMDA receptors at rest deactivates eEF2 kinase, reduces eEF2 phosphorylation, disinhibits rapid dendritic translation, and increases BDNF expression, providing a mechanistic bridge to structural and functional synaptic changes underlying sustained antidepressant effects beyond ketamine's short half-life; this is a key conceptual anchor I need to keep in the foreground when weighing durable benefit [^1111i7Tu] [^111imQXP].

> Wait, let me verify the role of metabolites before I overstate it; I initially almost said "essential" without qualification. Rodent data implicate hydroxynorketamine, especially (2R,6R)-HNK, as producing antidepressant-like effects via AMPAR activation without direct NMDAR antagonism and with reduced side-effect liability, but in humans the degree to which HNKs are required remains unresolved; pharmacokinetic work confirms robust formation of HNKs with enantiomer-specific differences, so I should frame metabolite contributions as strongly suggested preclinically and plausible clinically but not definitively causal across patients [^111a9Y1i] [^113Hci1v] [^1168mSE9].

> I need to ensure I account for other receptor systems without diluting the main signal. Ketamine shows modest inhibition of serotonin and dopamine reuptake that may modulate mood circuitry, blocks voltage-gated sodium channels with less potency than lidocaine but potentially contributing to analgesia, and engages GSK-3-dependent processes relevant to psychotomimetic effects in preclinical models; moreover, emerging evidence argues for synergistic NMDA–opioid receptor interactions as part of antidepressant pharmacology, and there is an NMDAR-independent Gαs translocation mechanism increasing cAMP and BDNF, but I should emphasize that these are adjunctive or parallel mechanisms rather than wholesale replacements for the NMDA–AMPA–BDNF pathway [^111jgskv] [^111rknke] [^111WeDMS] [^114H6nox] [^111aF36a].

> Let me now integrate systems-level circuit effects, and I should be cautious not to over-attribute causality. Preclinical and human data indicate rapid modulation of the lateral habenula and frontostriatal reward systems, consistent with reductions in negative affective biases and improved anhedonia; functional imaging during ketamine-induced altered states shows that distinct dissociative subtypes have opposing effects on right anterior insula activity, suggesting that certain experiential components may mediate acute affective brain state changes without proving they are necessary for antidepressant efficacy [^114o9Xu2] [^114AJJhD] [^114NgmUD].

> I will now examine enantiomer-specific pharmacology, and I should double-check potency claims. S-ketamine exhibits higher NMDA affinity and greater anesthetic/analgesic potency than R-ketamine, leading to the intranasal esketamine approval for TRD, yet growing preclinical and early clinical signals suggest R-ketamine may have more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effects with fewer psychotomimetic effects and lower abuse liability; however, direct head-to-head trials in depressed patients remain sparse, so I must avoid definitive clinical rank-ordering at this time [^116WtDiL] [^116mkVEa] [^1133THvF] [^116Ea5eA].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacokinetic differences that might underlie clinical divergence. Population PK modeling demonstrates multi-compartment kinetics with active metabolites and significant enantiomeric differences, including up to 50% lower clearance for R-enantiomers in arterial sampling studies, while the FDA label reminds me that norketamine is less potent but active at NMDA receptors; these PK distinctions likely shape exposure–response relationships and metabolite profiles relevant to efficacy and tolerability [^113Hci1v] [^112PgAkf] [^116WtDiL].

> Next, I should review dosing and response pragmatically. Subanesthetic IV ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg over ~40 minutes is a conventional starting point for depression, but meta-analytic and trial data suggest a positive dose–response within tested ranges, and response-guided titration can improve outcomes; still, I need to caution that higher doses increase dissociation and hemodynamic effects and that intranasal esketamine shows nuanced dose–response patterns across acute and maintenance phases [^111WsuMP] [^1119Bfd1] [^111aYPUi] [^116Yrf37].

> But wait, safety and misuse risk must be integrated into the mechanism-to-clinic bridge. Acute adverse effects include dissociation, transient blood pressure and heart rate increases, dizziness, and nausea, typically peaking within an hour and resolving within two hours, whereas longer-term risks involve abuse liability and, in vulnerable populations like neonates, concerns about neurotoxicity; current scoping data suggest lower abuse liability for R-ketamine in preclinical models, but clinical vigilance remains essential across enantiomers and formulations [^111W31vR] [^114P5rzN] [^114vAN6b] [^113g1VTF].

> Let me synthesize without oversimplifying. Ketamine's clinical profile emerges from a multi-target cascade initiated by NMDA receptor antagonism, amplified by AMPAR activation and rapid BDNF-dependent synaptic plasticity, with meaningful contributions from HCN1 channels for hypnosis, monoaminergic modulation, possible NMDA–opioid synergy, and active metabolites such as HNK; dissociative experiences appear mechanistically linked to acute brain state shifts but are not proven necessary for antidepressant efficacy, underscoring that NMDA antagonism is necessary but not sufficient to explain the full spectrum of effects [^1111i7Tu] [^114H6nox] [^114AJJhD].

> I should close by acknowledging uncertainties and research gaps. Precise molecular determinants of antidepressant response in humans remain unresolved, head-to-head enantiomer trials are limited, the relationship between specific altered states and sustained therapeutic benefit is still being worked out, and long-term safety and misuse risk — especially with repeated or maintenance dosing — require continued scrutiny and better stratification to personalize benefit–risk balances [^1168mSE9] [^116Ea5eA] [^111W31vR] [^114o9Xu2].

Ketamine's primary mechanism is **non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonism** at the PCP site [^116WtDiL], which reduces excitatory neurotransmission and central sensitization [^111mbNAQ], producing **dissociative anesthesia and analgesia**. It also **disinhibits pyramidal neurons** by blocking NMDA receptors on GABA interneurons [^111imQXP], triggering a glutamate surge that activates AMPA receptors, promotes BDNF release, and drives mTORC1-mediated synaptogenesis — mechanisms underlying its rapid antidepressant effects [^1111i7Tu]. Other actions include HCN1 channel inhibition [^117LhHC3], monoamine reuptake inhibition [^111jgskv], and opioid receptor modulation [^114H6nox], which contribute to analgesia and mood effects. Ketamine's metabolites, especially **hydroxynorketamine** [^113Hci1v], further enhance AMPA-mediated plasticity and antidepressant efficacy [^111a9Y1i]. Together, these mechanisms account for ketamine's unique clinical profile across anesthesia, analgesia, and psychiatry [^114o9Xu2].

---

## Primary mechanism: NMDA receptor antagonism

Ketamine is a **non-competitive antagonist** of the NMDA receptor [^111mbNAQ] that binds within the channel to block calcium influx and reduce excitatory neurotransmission [^116WtDiL]. This mechanism underlies its **dissociative anesthesia, analgesia, and neuroprotection** [^116WtDiL] by limiting excitotoxicity [^111mbNAQ].

---

## Secondary mechanisms: modulation of other neurotransmitter systems

Ketamine also **modulates multiple systems** beyond NMDA receptors, broadening its clinical effects:

- **AMPA receptor activation**: NMDA blockade on GABA interneurons disinhibits pyramidal neurons [^111imQXP], causing a glutamate surge that activates AMPA receptors and drives synaptic plasticity [^1111i7Tu].

- **Monoaminergic modulation**: Inhibits serotonin and dopamine reuptake, increasing monoamine levels and contributing to antidepressant and anxiolytic effects [^111jgskv].

- **Opioid receptor interaction**: Modulates opioid receptors [^114H6nox], enhancing analgesia and potentially influencing mood [^111jgskv].

- **HCN1 channel inhibition**: Inhibits HCN1 channels [^117LhHC3], contributing to hypnotic and anesthetic effects [^116Yrf37].

---

## Intracellular signaling pathways and synaptic plasticity

Ketamine's NMDA antagonism triggers **intracellular cascades** that enhance synaptic plasticity:

- **mTORC1 activation**: AMPA-driven signaling activates mTORC1 [^1111i7Tu], increasing synaptogenesis and spine density, supporting rapid antidepressant effects [^111imQXP].

- **BDNF release**: Increases BDNF [^1111i7Tu], promoting neuroplasticity and resilience [^111imQXP].

- **eEF2 kinase inhibition**: Reduces eEF2 phosphorylation [^1111i7Tu], enabling rapid dendritic protein synthesis and synaptic strengthening [^111imQXP].

---

## Metabolites and their contributions

Ketamine's metabolites — notably **hydroxynorketamine (HNK)** [^113Hci1v] — enhance AMPA-mediated plasticity and antidepressant effects without significant NMDA antagonism, suggesting a distinct, NMDA-independent pathway [^111a9Y1i].

---

## Clinical implications

These mechanisms translate into **distinct clinical effects**:

- **Anesthesia and analgesia**: NMDA antagonism provides dissociative anesthesia [^116WtDiL] and analgesia, with minimal respiratory depression.

- **Rapid antidepressant effects**: AMPA activation, mTORC1 signaling, and BDNF release drive rapid antidepressant responses, often within hours [^111imQXP] [^1111i7Tu].

- **Potential for abuse and side effects**: Psychotomimetic and dissociative effects reflect NMDA antagonism [^115tqqjx] and broader network disruption, necessitating careful monitoring [^114P5rzN].

---

While ketamine's primary action is **NMDA receptor antagonism** [^116WtDiL], its clinical profile is shaped by downstream AMPA activation [^111imQXP], mTORC1/BDNF-driven plasticity [^1111i7Tu], and modulation of monoaminergic, opioid [^114H6nox], and HCN1 systems [^117LhHC3], with metabolites like HNK further supporting antidepressant efficacy [^111a9Y1i].

## References

### Ketalar [^116WtDiL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Ketalar, a racemic mixture of ketamine, is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. The major circulating metabolite of ketamine, norketamine, demonstrates activity at the same receptor but with less affinity. Norketamine is about one-third as active as ketamine in reducing the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane in rats.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Nervous system**: Ketamine is a rapidly acting general anesthetic producing a dissociative anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia, normal pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, normal or slightly enhanced skeletal muscle tone, cardiovascular and respiratory stimulation, and occasionally a transient and minimal respiratory depression. The mechanism of action is primarily due to the antagonism of NMDA receptors in the central nervous system. Ketamine can produce nystagmus with pupillary dilation, salivation, lacrimation, and spontaneous limb movements with increased muscle tone through indirect sympathomimetic activity. It also produces analgesia. Ketamine-induced emergence delirium can be reduced with benzodiazepines.

	- **Cardiovascular system**: Ketamine increases blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. The cardiovascular effects of ketamine are indirect and believed to be mediated by inhibition of both central and peripheral catecholamine reuptake. Elevation of blood pressure reaches a maximum within a few minutes of injection and usually returns to pre-anesthetic values within 15 minutes.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^111a9Y1i]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Mechanistic considerations suggest that the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine are primarily mediated through the blockade of NMDA receptors located on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibitory interneurons. This action leads to a disinhibition of pyramidal cells and triggers an acute cortical glutamate surge. The subsequent activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors appears crucial in these antidepressant effects, as preclinical studies have demonstrated that pre-treatment with an AMPA receptor antagonist blocks the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomers in rodent models.

The metabolism of (R, S)-ketamine to hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is reported to be essential for ketamine's antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Notably, administration of the (R)-enantiomer (2R,6R)-HNK showed greater and longer-lasting antidepressant effects compared to (2S,6S)-HNK and MK-801, a stronger NMDA receptor antagonist. Importantly, (2R,6R)-HNK did not exhibit ketamine-related side effects or abuse potential in this model. The antidepressant effects of (2R,6R)-HNK did not rely on action on NMDA receptors but instead required AMPA receptor activation. Further research indicates an important role of presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2) autoreceptor inhibition in the antidepressant actions of (2R,6R)-HNK.

### Forebrain HCN1 channels contribute to hypnotic actions of ketamine [^117LhHC3]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Ketamine is a commonly used anesthetic, but the mechanistic basis for its clinically relevant actions remains to be determined. The authors previously showed that HCN1 channels are inhibited by ketamine and demonstrated that global HCN1 knockout mice are twofold less sensitive to the hypnotic actions of ketamine. Although that work identified HCN1 channels as a viable molecular target for ketamine, it did not determine the relevant neural substrate.

- **Methods**: To localize the brain region responsible for HCN1-mediated hypnotic actions of ketamine, the authors used a conditional knockout strategy to delete HCN1 channels selectively in excitatory cells of the mouse forebrain. A combination of molecular, immunohistochemical, and cellular electrophysiologic approaches was used to verify conditional HCN1 deletion; a loss-of-righting reflex assay served to ascertain effects of forebrain HCN1 channel ablation on the hypnotic actions of ketamine.

- **Results**: In conditional knockout mice, HCN1 channels were selectively deleted in the cortex and hippocampus, with expression retained in the cerebellum. In cortical pyramidal neurons from forebrain-selective HCN1 knockout mice, effects of ketamine on HCN1-dependent membrane properties were absent; notably, ketamine was unable to evoke membrane hyperpolarization or enhance synaptic inputs. Finally, the EC50 for ketamine-induced loss-of-righting reflex was shifted to significantly higher concentrations (by approximately 31%).

- **Conclusions**: These data indicate that forebrain principal cells represent a relevant neural substrate for HCN1-mediated hypnotic actions of ketamine.

### Synaptic mechanisms underlying rapid antidepressant action of ketamine [^1111i7Tu]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). High credibility.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that a single subpsychotomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, produces a rapid antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder, with effects lasting up to 2 weeks. Despite enthusiasm about this unexpected efficacy of ketamine, its widespread use as a fast-acting antidepressant in routine clinical settings is curtailed by its abuse potential as well as possible psychotomimetic effects. However, the ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with depression provides a unique opportunity for the investigation of mechanisms that mediate these clinically relevant behavioral effects.

From a mechanistic perspective, it is easy to imagine how activation of NMDA receptors may trigger cellular and behavioral responses; it is relatively more difficult, however, to envision how transient blockade of one of the key pathways for neuronal communication produces a persistent beneficial effect. The authors discuss recent work linking ketamine's mechanism of action to homeostatic synaptic plasticity processes activated after suppression of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. They focus on their recent work demonstrating that ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDA receptors at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and desuppression of rapid dendritic protein translation, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which then contributes to synaptic plasticity.

### Nonanesthetic effects of ketamine: A review article [^111jgskv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Ketamine is considered a dissociative anesthetic medication, commonly administered via a parenteral route. It primarily operates by blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and inhibits voltage-gated Na and K channels. Additionally, it affects the reuptake of serotonin and dopamine and impacts specific receptors, such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, kainate, and aminobutyric acid A receptors. Ketamine appears to employ particular mechanisms potentially involved in analgesic induction, including the enhancement of descending inhibition and anti-inflammatory effects. More recently, ketamine has shown potential in clinical practice for managing chronic pain, cognitive function, depression, acute brain injury, and immune system disorders.

### Low dose ketamine: a therapeutic and research tool to explore N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated plasticity in pain pathways [^111mbNAQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic that has been used in the clinic for many years. At low, sub-anaesthetic doses, it is a relatively selective and potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. It belongs to the class of uncompetitive antagonists and blocks the receptor by binding to a specific site within the NMDA receptor channel when it is open. Like other compounds of this class, ketamine can cause hallucinations or other untoward central effects, which limit its use in the clinic. Nevertheless, because of the evidence on the importance of NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity in chronic pain, low doses of ketamine have been explored in a wide range of pain conditions.

The majority of studies with ketamine have shown efficacy; however, it has not been possible to safely separate the pain relief from the side effects of the drug. Hence, clinical use of ketamine as a pain treatment is very limited. Nevertheless, ketamine has served as a useful tool to provide a compelling rationale for developing other NMDA antagonists. Some of the new compounds of this class, particularly those acting at the NR2B subtype of the NMDA receptor, have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies.

### The role of dissociation in ketamine's antidepressant effects [^111imQXP]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

An initial summary of ketamine's proposed mechanism of action is necessary prior to exploring larger issues of its dissociative versus antidepressant effects. One hypothesis is that of NMDAR disinhibition. This theory postulates that the antidepressant response to ketamine is initiated by the selective blockade of NMDARs on gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibitory interneurons. This, in turn, decreases interneuronal activity, leading to the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and enhanced glutamatergic firing ("glutamate burst"). These processes then produce α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) activation, enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, tropomyosin receptor kinase B receptor activation, and subsequent promotion of protein synthesis via activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 of NMDARs.

Another theory gaining increased support is that ketamine blocks synaptic NMDARs involved in spontaneous synaptic transmission, which deactivates calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase. This results in dephosphorylation of eukaryotic eEF2 and the subsequent de-suppression of BDNF protein synthesis in the hippocampus. This signaling pathway then potentiates synaptic AMPAR responses, resulting in antidepressant efficacy.

Other theories for ketamine's mechanism of action have been offered, but all propose changes in synaptic plasticity that lead to strengthening of excitatory synapses and share several characteristics and molecular mechanisms.

### Electroconvulsive therapy-induced persistent retrograde amnesia: Could it be minimised by ketamine or other pharmacological approaches [^114TqzCp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Certain pharmacological agents administered during electroconvulsive therapy may have the potential to prevent persistent retrograde amnesia induced during this procedure. This review examines mechanisms for electroconvulsive therapy-induced retrograde amnesia, and evaluates the suitability of the anaesthetic ketamine for preventing this amnestic outcome.

- **Methods**: A review of human studies, animal models, and theoretical models in light of memory dysfunction following electroconvulsive therapy was conducted. MEDLINE was searched from 1950 to April 2009 using the MeSH terms "electroconvulsive therapy", "memory", "memory short term", "memory disorders", "excitatory amino acid antagonists", and "ketamine". PREMEDLINE was searched using the terms "electroconvulsive therapy", "amnesia", and "ketamine". Additional keyword and reference list searches were performed. No language, date constraints, or article type constraints were used.

- **Results**: Disruption of long-term potentiation as a mechanism for electroconvulsive therapy-induced retrograde amnesia is well supported. Based on this putative mechanism, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist would appear suitable for preventing the retrograde amnesia. Available evidence in animals and humans supports the prediction that ketamine, an anaesthetic agent and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, could effectively prevent electroconvulsive therapy-induced persistent retrograde amnesia. While there are concerns about the use of ketamine with electroconvulsive therapy, such as possible psychotomimetic effects, the evidence points to its potential effectiveness.

### The cognitive neuroscience of ketamine in major depression [^114o9Xu2]. Brain (2025). High credibility.

Ketamine's potential as a rapid-acting antidepressant was first identified in 2000, despite its long-standing use as an anesthetic agent. Clinically, ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms, including the difficult-to-treat symptom of anhedonia, within hours, with the effects of a single dose lasting for days. Since then, research has focused on uncovering the mechanisms underlying its rapid antidepressant effects in both humans and animal models. While its molecular and cellular effects have been extensively characterized, its impact on cognitive and neuropsychological mechanisms — potential mediators of its clinical efficacy — remains an area of ongoing investigation.

Preclinical studies suggest that ketamine rapidly influences the lateral habenula (involved in punishment processing) and fronto-striatal (reward) systems, reverses negative affective biases in established memories, and promotes long-term stress resilience. Translating these findings to human models is crucial, and emerging evidence suggests that ketamine engages similar mechanisms in healthy volunteer and patient groups. However, its clinical application is constrained by acute side effects and an unknown long-term safety profile. Further research into ketamine's mechanisms of action will be essential to inform the development of novel, safer, and more accessible rapid-acting antidepressants.

### Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 attenuates psychotomimetic effects of ketamine [^111WeDMS]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors mediate fast neurotransmission and regulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Disruption of NMDA receptor-mediated signaling by noncompetitive antagonists, such as PCP or ketamine, evokes psychotomimetic behaviors, although the cellular mechanisms by which hypofunctional NMDA receptor signaling drives behavioral pathology are still unclear. Activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been implicated in the cellular neurotoxicity of NMDA receptor antagonists. Accordingly, in the present study we examined the ability of GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and 1-azakenpaullone, to reverse the behavioral aberrations induced by ketamine.

Male NMRI mice received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the GSK-3 inhibitors, SB216763 and 1-azakenpaullone, 5 minutes prior to ketamine administration. Locomotor activity, rotarod performance, prepulse inhibition, novel object recognition, and duration of loss of righting reflex were monitored. GSK-3 inhibitors attenuated ketamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity, motor incoordination, sensorimotor impairment, and cognitive deficits, but did not affect ketamine anesthesia. These data support an important role of GSK-3 in the expression of behavioral aberrations associated with NMDA receptor hypofunction, and suggest that GSK-3 inhibitors may ameliorate certain behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia.

### The effect of ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory [^111jcY9b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to NMDA receptor antagonism, ketamine modulates additional neurotransmitter systems in the brain, and may induce antidepressant effects, differentiating it from other NMDA receptor antagonists and adding uncertainty to the pharmacological origin of its effects. It is informative that NMDA receptor antagonists such as MK-801, AP5, and PCP have also been reported to impair the extinction and/or latent inhibition of fear memories. Furthermore, D-cycloserine, an NMDA receptor partial agonist, facilitates the extinction of conditioned fear. It therefore seems plausible that ketamine mediates its effects on the extinction of contextual fear memory via NMDA receptor antagonism, although further study of the impact of ketamine's off-site targets, including the pharmacological activity of its metabolites and its subtype selectivity, on inhibitory fear learning is necessary.

Ketamine in healthy volunteers can produce persistent delusions similar to those seen in schizophrenia. The authors suggest that delusions are formed and maintained due to aberrant direct and indirect (via altered attribution of salience to stimuli) disruptions in associative learning mechanisms by prediction errors generated by the difference between expectations ("priors") and experience. In support, they show that reactivating fear memories in the presence of ketamine enhances their subsequent expression, and that this effect is due in part to an enhancement of reconsolidation processes at retrieval. Our data is in keeping with this hypothesis such that ketamine…

### Ketamine as a therapeutic agent for depression and pain: mechanisms and evidence [^116Yrf37]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Ketamine is an anesthetic drug now used to treat chronic pain conditions and psychiatric disorders, especially depression. It acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and has additional effects on α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, opioid receptors, and monoaminergic receptors.

This article focuses on ketamine's role in treating depression and pain, two frequently comorbid and challenging conditions potentially sharing neurobiologic circuitry. Many clinical trials have utilized intravenous or intranasal ketamine for treating depression and pain. Intravenous ketamine is more bioavailable than intranasal ketamine, and both are effective for acute depressive episodes. Intravenous ketamine offers advantages for postoperative analgesia and is associated with a reduction in total opioid requirements.

Few studies have investigated the use of ketamine for chronic pain or concurrent depression and pain. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to examine the safety and efficacy of intravenous versus intranasal ketamine, identify ideal target populations, and determine optimal dosing to treat both depression and pain.

### Ketamine's acute effects on negative brain states are mediated through distinct altered states of consciousness in humans [^114AJJhD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Ketamine commonly and rapidly induces dissociative and other altered states of consciousness (ASCs) in humans. However, the neural mechanisms contributing to these experiences remain unknown. We used functional neuroimaging to engage key regions of the brain's affective circuits during acute ketamine-induced ASCs within a randomized, multi-modal, placebo-controlled design examining placebo, 0.05 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in nonclinical adult participants (NCT03475277). Licensed clinicians monitored infusions for safety. Linear mixed-effects models, analysis of variance, t-tests, and mediation models were used for statistical analyses.

Our design enabled us to test our pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints, which were met: effects of ketamine across dose conditions on (1) emotional task-evoked brain activity and (2) sub-components of dissociation and other ASCs. With this design, we also could disentangle which ketamine-induced affective brain states are dependent upon specific aspects of ASCs. Differently valenced ketamine-induced ASCs mediated opposing effects on right anterior insula activity. Participants experiencing relatively higher depersonalization induced by 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine showed relief from negative brain states (reduced task-evoked right anterior insula activity, 0.39 SD). In contrast, participants experiencing dissociative amnesia showed an exacerbation of insula activity (0.32 SD). These results in nonclinical participants may shed light on the mechanisms by which specific dissociative states predict response to ketamine in depression.

### Ketamine for the treatment of major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1119Bfd1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Higher doses were associated with improved antidepressant effects following a single session and during repeated administrations of ketamine, with insufficient data available to explore dose effects during the follow-up period. A high dose of racemic ketamine produced the largest reduction in depression severity symptoms after the initial dose (SMD = −0.73) and during repeated administrations (SMD = −0.61), supporting prior observations that adequate dosage is important for optimal efficacy. Early dose–response pilot studies found increased antidepressant response following a single session of racemic ketamine at higher doses, with greater proportions of participants reaching response and remission criteria as the dosage was increased according to a response-guided approach.

Similar findings were later obtained for participants with treatment-resistant depression, including those over sixty years. More recently, Milak and Rashid showed a positive correlation between intravenous racemic ketamine doses, ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg, and improvements in depression severity scores. A similar positive dose–response relationship has been observed following a single session of intranasal esketamine, although not consistently. Interestingly, repeated sessions of intranasal esketamine do not exhibit a clear association between dose and antidepressant response when dosing was assigned at a group level rather than based on individual response-guided titration. These findings suggest that adequate dosage, ideally response-guided on an individual basis, should be recommended in clinical settings.

### Ketamine-induced apoptosis in normal human urothelial cells: A direct, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-independent pathway characterized by mitochondrial stress [^116Nya8s]. The American Journal of Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which is used as a rapid-onset, short-duration anesthetic and analgesic in clinical and veterinary practice. In the clinical setting, ketamine is particularly used as an anesthetic in pediatric and asthmatic cases, and for palliative care. Recreational use of ketamine, which has been increasing since the 1980s, is based around its phencyclidine-like effects, whereby it induces hallucinations, stimulates out-of-body experiences, and increases empathy and insight.

The emergence of upper and lower urinary tract damage resulting from ketamine abuse was originally reported as case studies in 2007, where symptoms of urinary frequency/urgency, nocturia, hematuria, and suprapubic pain were accompanied by a thickened, contracted, and inflamed bladder.

The sloughing of the bladder epithelium (urothelium) observed by histology in ketamine cystitis patients suggests a direct toxicity against the urothelium, but no mechanism has yet been established. Ketamine has been classified as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, and in vitro studies with cortical neurons from rats and monkeys have identified the NMDAR as a mediator of ketamine-induced apoptosis. NMDAR subunits have been reported to be expressed in the urinary tract of rats, suggesting this as a potential mechanism in human urothelium. Our aim was to identify a mechanism for the direct toxicity of ketamine on normal (non-immortalized) human urothelial (NHU) cells to enhance understanding of the clinical pathology.

### Ketamine for depression, 1: Clinical summary of issues related to efficacy, adverse effects, and mechanism of action [^111WsuMP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). It is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms, even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3–12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit from serial dosing or higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by continuing ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals.

Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, much is known about its different biological effects. However, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although comprehensive data on ketamine are unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.

### Role of nitric oxide signaling in the antidepressant mechanism of action of ketamine: A randomized controlled trial [^112J8WKi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). High credibility.

Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with rapid antidepressant effects. Studies suggest that inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis plays a role in the mechanism of action of ketamine. This randomized, placebo-controlled study investigated whether co-administration of sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide donor, compared to placebo, would attenuate the antidepressant and dissociative effects of ketamine. Sixteen ketamine responders were randomized to a double-blind infusion of ketamine co-administered with placebo or sodium nitroprusside. Our findings show no difference between the two conditions, suggesting that the nitric oxide pathway may not play a primary role in ketamine's antidepressant or dissociative effects.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^111aF36a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

An increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which acts to upregulate neurotrophic factors and increase synaptogenesis, has been associated with the conventional antidepressant action. Gαs is a subunit of the G protein GS that stimulates the generation of cAMP by activating adenylyl cyclase. Localization of Gαs within lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane acts to regulate cellular signaling. Indeed, production of cAMP is diminished when Gαs is localized to these microdomains. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated increases in cAMP through translocation of Gαs from lipid raft domains into non-raft regions. This augments interaction between Gαs and adenylyl cyclase following administration of various classes of antidepressants.

Research has reported that (R, S)-ketamine administration to C6 glioma cells led to immediate translocation of Gαs from lipid raft domains to non-raft domains and an increase in cAMP, followed by an increase in BDNF expression after 24 hours. The (R, S)-ketamine-induced increase in cAMP was found to persist even after knocking out the NMDA receptor, indicating an NMDA receptor-independent mechanism. Further, the administration of the ketamine metabolite (2R,6R)-HNK also resulted in redistribution of Gαs from lipid rafts and increased cAMP production. These findings suggest that the translocation of Gαs from lipid rafts is a reliable hallmark of antidepressant action. However, further research is needed to examine to what degree this mechanism contributes.

### The diverse effects of ketamine, jack-of-all-trades: a narrative review [^111NiVqv]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Low credibility.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist first discovered in 1962, has become established in anaesthesia, providing dose-dependent anaesthetic, sedative, and analgesic effects. However, ketamine also acts on a wide range of other cellular targets, resulting in interesting and diverse effects on both physiological and pathological processes.

Potential beneficial properties of ketamine include cardiovascular stability for patients undergoing sedation or anaesthesia, analgesia in both acute and chronic pain, bronchodilation in severe refractory asthma, anti-inflammatory properties particularly in sepsis, tumour inhibition, and antidepressant properties with a marked ability to reverse suicidal ideation. The reluctance to adopt ketamine into routine practice is likely attributable, in part, to the stigma and negative reputation associated with its perceived side effects and potential for abuse.

This review explores the diverse properties and therapeutic potentials of ketamine being investigated across different fields while also identifying areas for ongoing and future research. Given the diverse range of potential benefits and promising early work, ketamine should be the focus of ongoing research in various specialty areas. This includes areas relevant to anaesthesia and perioperative medicine, such as acute and chronic pain management, ICU sedation, and even tumour suppression in those undergoing surgical resection of malignancies.

### Differential effect of ketamine and lidocaine on spontaneous and mechanical evoked pain in patients with nerve injury pain [^115VB9B3]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

The mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain are incompletely understood. Targeting specific molecular mechanisms in the pain signaling system may assist in understanding key features in neuropathic pain, such as allodynia. This study examined the effect of systemically administered ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, and lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on spontaneous pain, brush-evoked pain, and pinprick-evoked pain in patients with nerve injury pain.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients participated in two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover experiments. On four different days, they received a 30-minute intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.24 mg/kg), lidocaine (5 mg/kg), or saline. Ongoing pain, pain evoked by brush and repetitive pinprick stimuli, and acetone was measured before, during, and after infusion.

- **Results**: Ketamine significantly reduced ongoing pain and evoked pain to brush and pinprick, whereas lidocaine only reduced evoked pain to repetitive pinprick stimuli. In individual patients, there was no correlation between the pain-relieving effect of lidocaine and ketamine on ongoing or mechanically evoked pains.

- **Conclusions**: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-linked systems and sodium channels are involved in the generation and maintenance of pain in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It is likely that ongoing pain, as well as mechanical hyperalgesia in individual patients, is dependent on several separate molecular mechanisms.

### Ketamine as an anesthetic for patients with acute brain injury: A systematic review [^112uDbzi]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Low credibility.

Ketamine is the best-known non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist (NMDA). It was first discovered in 1956, and subsequent animal studies showed promising general anesthetic properties. In 1964, ketamine was introduced as an anesthetic for humans, and has thus been available for more than 50 years. Ketamine exists as two optical isomers: (S)-(+) and (R)-(−)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone. Currently, ketamine is available as S-ketamine, the more potent of the two optical isomers, and as a racemic mixture containing both (S+) and (R−) ketamine.

Along with the antagonistic effect on the NMDA receptor shown with in vitro studies, ketamine has been shown to interact with opioid, monoaminergic, cholinergic, nicotinic, and muscarinic receptors, assigning ketamine a broad range of effects and side effects.

Once bound to the NMDA receptor, ketamine induces a state of dissociation. Contrary to most anesthetic agents, ketamine does not induce dilation of the vascular bed and thus does not induce hypotension, nor does it have a negative chronotropic impact on the heart. This combination makes ketamine a potentially attractive drug when anesthetizing patients with hypotension, or patients in whom considerations regarding perfusion pressure during anesthesia are prioritized, as is the case with patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Theoretically, ketamine could be beneficial when treating patients with TBI. However, the drug was abandoned in the 1990s due to the suspicion that it might have adverse effects on the intracranial.

### Do NMDA receptor antagonist models of schizophrenia predict the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic drugs [^115tqqjx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as ketamine and phencyclidine, induce perceptual abnormalities, psychosis-like symptoms, and mood changes in healthy humans and patients with schizophrenia. The similarity between NMDA receptor antagonist-induced psychosis and schizophrenia has led to the widespread use of the drugs to provide models to aid the development of novel treatments for the disorder. This review investigates the predictive validity of NMDA receptor antagonist models based on a range of novel treatments that have now reached clinical trials. Furthermore, it considers the extent to which the different hypotheses that have been proposed to account for the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA receptor antagonists have been validated by the results of these trials. Finally, the review discusses some of the caveats associated with the use of the models and suggests how a greater use of translational markers might ensure progress in understanding the relationship between the models and schizophrenia.

### Ketamine and esketamine in clinical trials: FDA-approved and emerging indications, trial trends with putative mechanistic explanations [^116beAVd]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

The history of ketamine traces back to 1956 when phencyclidine (PCP, CI-395), trademarked as Sernyl, was first synthesized. PCP was used as a preoperative anesthetic; however, a high rate of side effects instigated the search for similar compounds with less pronounced post-surgical complications. The original form of ketamine (CI-581) was synthesized as a short half-life derivative of PCP in 1962, and in 1966 ketamine's first human trials demonstrated its efficacy as an analgesic and anesthetic agent that produced a post-surgical delirium with a much shorter duration. Along with its approval for anesthetic use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970, ketamine became popular for recreational use. Since then, researchers have explored its pharmacokinetics and mechanism of anesthetic and analgesic action for therapeutic purposes. One of the most significant discoveries was ketamine's NMDAR antagonism promoting pain relief and sedation, and ketamine was added to the WHO's essential medicines list in 1985.

The interest in using ketamine in psychiatry first emerged in the late 1950s and peaked in the late 1990s–2000s. The 2000s were also significant in the ketamine timeline due to the first application in sub-anesthetic doses in patients with major depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

### Ketamine as a novel antidepressant: From synapse to behavior [^115Y4EoJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Recent reports of a rapid antidepressant effect of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine, even in treatment-resistant populations, have spurred translational therapeutic and neuroscience research aimed at elucidating ketamine's mechanism of action. This article provides a concise overview of research findings that pertain to the effects of low-dose ketamine at the cellular, neurocircuitry, and behavioral levels and describes an integrated model of the action of ketamine in the treatment of depression.

### Active mechanisms of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy: A systematic review [^111HWKqj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and substance use disorders (SUD).

- **Methods**: A systematic review of clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of KAP and discussing mechanisms of action, identified on PubMed and PsycInfo.

- **Results**: Five randomized-controlled trials reported on the efficacy of KAP treatment and discussed active mechanisms. Four of the studies treated adults with SUD, and a single study treated adults with TRD. Overall, KAP had a significant positive effect on primary outcome measures compared to controls; however, the data is mixed. The study examining KAP for TRD found no benefit.

- **Limitations**: There is a lack of large, replicated clinical trials and no studies actively examining mechanisms of action.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence suggests that temporary neural changes caused by ketamine, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition and increase of synaptic neuroplasticity, affect treatment outcomes of KAP. Based on reports of preliminary findings, we speculate that adjunct psychotherapy, changes in perspective, and spirituality may also play a role.

### The effect of ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory [^116Y6ywX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Ketamine, principally an antagonist of N-methyl-ᴅ-aspartate receptors, induces schizophrenia-like symptoms in adult humans, warranting its use in the investigation of psychosis-related phenotypes in animal models. Genomic studies further implicate N-methyl-ᴅ-aspartate receptor-mediated processes in schizophrenia pathology, together with more broadly-defined synaptic plasticity and associative learning processes. Strong pathophysiological links have been demonstrated between fear learning and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

To further investigate the impact of ketamine on associative fear learning, we studied the effects of pre- and post-training ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory in rats. Administration of 25 mg/kg ketamine prior to fear conditioning did not affect consolidation when potentially confounding effects of state dependency were controlled for. Pre-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) impaired the extinction of the conditioned fear response, which was mirrored with the use of a lower dose (8 mg/kg). Post-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) had no effect on the consolidation or extinction of conditioned fear.

These observations implicate processes relating to the extinction of contextual fear memory in the manifestation of ketamine-induced phenotypes and are consistent with existing hypotheses surrounding abnormal associative learning in schizophrenia.

### Ketamine reduces aversion in rodent pain models by suppressing hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex [^113z61DE]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Pain has sensory and affective components, and a balanced interplay of these two components has evolved to form a vital protective function. For example, tissue injury elicits anatomically specific nociceptive transmission, which in turn triggers aversion — a normal affective response that allows us to avoid further physical harm. In chronic pain conditions, however, patients demonstrate sensory hypersensitivity as well as increased affective or emotional responses. Previous research in chronic pain has primarily focused on abnormal sensory transmissions and suggests that the intense affective experience results from sensory hypersensitivity.

In chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or persistent postoperative pain, patients develop magnified aversive responses out of proportion to the intensity of peripheral nociceptive inputs, in a widespread, anatomically nonspecific manner. This generalized, anatomically nonspecific enhancement of aversion leads to severe disability, suggesting a pathological imbalance between the affective and sensory components in chronic pain conditions. Thus, mechanisms that specifically regulate the affective component of pain may have important therapeutic implications.

### Redefining ketamine pharmacology for antidepressant action: Synergistic NMDA and opioid receptor interactions [^114H6nox]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Ketamine is a racemic compound and medication comprised of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine enantiomers and its metabolites. It has been used for decades as a dissociative anesthetic, analgesic, and recreational drug. More recently, ketamine, its enantiomers, and its metabolites have been used or are being investigated for the treatment of refractory depression, as well as for comorbid disorders such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and opioid use disorders. Despite its complex pharmacology, ketamine is referred to as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist.

In this review, the authors argue that ketamine's pharmacology should be redefined to include opioid receptors and the endogenous opioid system. They also highlight a potential mechanism of action of ketamine for depression that is attributed to bifunctional, synergistic interactions involving NMDA and opioid receptors.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^114HqzHt]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Although there are specialist centres around the world, and an increasing number of ketamine clinics in the United States offering ketamine infusions for depression, the use of repeated infusions may not be the most practical due to the resources required. Other routes of administration (oral, sublingual, intranasal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous) could prove to be simpler and more feasible alternatives for repeated administration, but few studies have evaluated these options.

- **(S)-ketamine**: As NMDA receptor antagonism was understood to play a key role in ketamine's antidepressant mechanism, (S)-ketamine was investigated as a novel antidepressant candidate by Janssen Research & Development due to its higher affinity for the NMDA receptor. In a first proof-of-concept trial, IV (S)-ketamine at doses of 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg led to rapid and robust antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Side effects included headache, nausea, and dissociation. It was suggested that since improvements in depressive symptoms were not significantly different between the two tested doses, a lower dose of (S)-ketamine may allow for better tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

### Are ketamine infusions a viable therapeutic option for refractory neonatal seizures [^113Yy4aF]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that works by binding to the phencyclidine-binding site, thereby blocking the influx of cations through the NMDA receptor channel. The use of ketamine to treat refractory status epilepticus in adults and older children is well documented. Maturational changes in neonatal NMDA and γ-aminobutyric acid receptor expression and function make NMDA receptor antagonists, like ketamine, attractive potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of refractory seizures in the newborn. However, descriptions of its use in this age group are limited to two case reports. Concerns regarding potential ketamine-mediated neurotoxicity in the immature brain require further investigation.

### Blockade of voltage-operated neuronal and skeletal muscle sodium channels by S(+)- and R(-)-ketamine [^111rknke]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Besides its general anesthetic effect, ketamine has local anesthetic-like actions. We studied the voltage- and use-dependent interaction of S(+)- and R(-)-ketamine with two different isoforms of voltage-operated sodium channels, with a special emphasis on the difference in affinity between resting and inactivated channel states. Rat brain IIa and human skeletal muscle sodium channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. S(+)- and R(-)-ketamine reversibly suppressed whole-cell sodium inward currents: the 50% inhibitory concentration values at -70 mV holding potential were 240 ± 60 µM and 333 ± 93 µM for the neuronal isoform, and 59 ± 10 µM and 181 ± 49 µM for the skeletal muscle isoform. S(+)-ketamine was significantly more potent than R(-)-ketamine in the skeletal muscle isoform only. Ketamine had a higher affinity to inactivated than to resting channels. However, the estimated difference in affinity between inactivated and resting channels was only 8- to 10-fold, and the time course of drug equilibration between inactivated and resting channels was too fast to cause use-dependent block at 10 Hz up to a concentration of 300 µM. These results suggest that ketamine is less effective than lidocaine-like local anesthetics in stabilizing the inactivated channel state.

- **Implications**: Blockade of sodium channels by ketamine shows voltage dependency, an important feature of local anesthetic action. However, ketamine is less effective than lidocaine-like local anesthetics in stabilizing the inactivated state.

### Physiological markers of rapid antidepressant effects of allopregnanolone [^112AGtAt]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

The rise of ketamine and brexanolone as rapid antidepressant treatments raises the question of common mechanisms. Both drugs act without the long onset time of traditional antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The drugs also share the interesting feature of benefits that persist beyond the initial drug lifetime.

Here, we briefly review literature on functional changes that may mark the triggering mechanism of rapid antidepressant actions. Because ketamine has a longer history of study as a rapid antidepressant, we use this literature as a template to guide hypotheses about common action. Brexanolone has the complication of being a formulation of a naturally occurring neurosteroid; thus, endogenous levels need to be considered when studying the impact of exogenous administration. We conclude that network disinhibition and increased high-frequency oscillations are candidates to mediate acute triggering effects of rapid antidepressants.

### Metabolomic signatures of intravenous racemic ketamine associated remission in treatment-resistant depression: A pilot hypothesis generating study [^114NQVdE]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

In this pilot study (N = 9), we highlight new insights gained on ketamine's mechanism of action, where we have mapped biochemical processes affected within 40 minutes of intravenous ketamine exposure. Targeting acylcarnitines, we demonstrated rapid utilization of short-chain acylcarnitines within 40 minutes of ketamine treatment, followed by restoration within 24 hours; this change in short-chain acylcarnitine with rapid-acting antidepressant treatment is consistent with previous work identifying a similar change but at 8 weeks with slower-acting SSRI treatment. Using a non-targeted metabolomics platform, we defined broader effects of ketamine on lipid metabolism and identified changes in triglycerides that correlate with ketamine response. This study provides novel insights into ketamine's action and highlights a possible role for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in ketamine's mechanism of action.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^1168mSE9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

There are significant limitations to widely prescribed antidepressant treatments. These include a substantial delay in the onset of therapeutic action, ranging from weeks to months, and approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) failing to demonstrate an adequate response. For individuals with depression, particularly those experiencing suicidal ideation, these delays and resistance to standard treatments can be extremely detrimental.

Increasing evidence has revealed that the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine, an uncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has the potential to overcome such limitations by demonstrating rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects, even in treatment-resistant patients. It has been proposed that ketamine's antidepressant effects are primarily mediated through NMDA receptor antagonism, resulting in disinhibition of pyramidal cells and an acute cortical glutamate surge, with downstream effects on synaptogenesis and neuroplastic pathways. However, the precise molecular and cellular processes underlying ketamine's antidepressant effects remain unclear, and evidence suggests that mechanisms other than NMDA receptor inhibition may play a more crucial role in its antidepressant effects, as well as those of its component enantiomers and metabolites.

In this review, we summarize findings on the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomers. We then discuss underlying therapeutic mechanisms and explore the possibility that ketamine's enantiomers and metabolites may produce complementary antidepressant effects.

### Ketamine for the treatment of major depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111aYPUi]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist commonly used as an anesthetic agent, has emerged as a new treatment for depression, with efficacy demonstrated in severe and treatment-resistant depression. Meta-analyses have provided valuable information regarding potential effect modifiers, including improved response in unipolar compared to bipolar depression, sustained benefit following repeated sessions of treatment, routes of administration, and indirect comparisons of efficacy for racemic and esketamine enantiomer formulations. However, for these meta-analyses, data for repeated treatment sessions were only available from phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine. This updated meta-analysis incorporates data from the first large phase 3 RCT of racemic ketamine, addressing a key gap in the literature.

Variable approaches to dosing have been used in studies at the time of writing, with some data suggesting this may be an important factor in treatment outcomes. Whereas earlier trials typically delivered a fixed dose relative to the patient's body weight, recent studies used a titrated dosing approach, which allows for dose increases in the event of non-response. An early meta-analysis of nine RCTs, consisting of only 201 participants, found greater reductions in depression severity scores in patients receiving a higher dose. The present study extends prior work by classifying studies according to the dose levels used.

Clinical considerations for a new treatment include the time onset of effects and efficacy attained at the end of treatment.

### Suicide has many faces, so does ketamine: A narrative review on ketamine's antisuicidal actions [^115EFSBT]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Suicidal behaviors present a challenge for the medical system and public health, partly due to the lack of evidence-based, effective, rapid tools for managing suicidal crises. In recent years, ketamine and its enantiomer, esketamine, have raised hopes regarding this issue. However, their efficacy in addressing suicidal behaviors and the mechanisms behind it remain topics of debate.

Subanesthetic doses of ketamine rapidly, albeit transiently, decrease suicidal ideation, with effects emerging within an hour and persisting up to a week. Evidence indicates various, and not necessarily exclusive, mechanisms for ketamine's antisuicidal action, including effects on neuroplasticity, inflammation, the reward system, and pain processing. While ketamine rapidly decreases suicidal ideation, whether it results in meaningful clinical outcomes beyond one week remains unclear. Multiple putative mechanisms drive ketamine's antisuicidal action. Future studies will need to demonstrate long-term outcomes of ketamine treatment and further elucidate its mechanisms of action.

### Ketamine pharmacokinetics [^112PgAkf]. Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Several models describing the pharmacokinetics of ketamine have been published, with differences in model structure and complexity. A systematic review of the literature was performed, along with a meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic data and construction of a pharmacokinetic model from raw data sets, to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate existing ketamine pharmacokinetic models and construct a general ketamine pharmacokinetic model.

- **Methods**: Extracted pharmacokinetic parameters from the literature (volume of distribution and clearance) were standardized to allow comparison among studies. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that conducted a mixed-effect analysis to calculate weighted mean parameter values, and a meta-regression analysis was used to determine the influence of covariates on parameter values. A pharmacokinetic population model was derived from a subset of raw data sets and compared with the meta-analytical analysis.

- **Results**: The meta-analysis was performed on 18 studies (11 conducted in healthy adults, 3 in adult patients, and 5 in pediatric patients). The weighted mean volume of distribution was 252 l/70 kg (95% CI, 200 to 304 l/70 kg). The weighted mean clearance was 79 l/h (at 70 kg; 95% CI, 69 to 90 l/h at 70 kg). There was no effect of covariates observed; simulations showed that models based on venous sampling exhibited substantially higher context-sensitive half-times compared to those based on arterial sampling. The pharmacokinetic model created from 14 raw data sets consisted of one central arterial compartment with two peripheral compartments linked to two.

### Efficacy of ketamine in relieving neuropathic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies [^115QgKZo]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Ketamine is a versatile drug that, apart from its original indication as an anesthetic agent since 1970, has been widely used since the 1990s at a low (subanesthetic) dose in the treatment of pain. For example, in the treatment of acute (nociceptive) postoperative pain, there is ample evidence that ketamine is an effective analgesic and is opioid sparing. In chronic pain, particularly in the management of neuropathic pain refractory to treatment with more conventional medication such as antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs, ketamine is frequently administered as a last resort option.

Theoretically, ketamine seems to be well-suited to produce long-term relief of neuropathic pain symptoms, especially those related to central sensitization. Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which plays an important role in the chronification and amplification of neuropathic pain. Ketamine reduces wind-up and temporal summation, which are surrogate measures of central sensitization. However, narrative and systematic reviews indicate that proof of the efficacy of ketamine in neuropathic pain is absent or limited.

It is not evident why ketamine efficacy is limited in human studies. We earlier suggested that the efficacy of ketamine in chronic pain is related to treatment duration (i.e. single dose vs. multiple doses or continuous infusion), whereas other factors such as dose or etiology of neuropathic symptoms were considered less important. Finding options that improve our ability to effectively treat neuropathic pain with ketamine remains a challenge.

### The role of dissociation in ketamine's antidepressant effects [^111W31vR]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

The focus of this manuscript, however, is subanesthetic-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) for the treatment of depressive symptoms. At this dose, systematic reviews have identified common side effects, including headache, dizziness, dissociation, elevated blood pressure, and blurred vision. The dissociative side effects reported by individuals with depression included feeling strange, weird, bizarre, spacey, woozy, floating, or loopy, reminiscent of the symptoms originally described by Domino. Most side effects peaked within an hour of ketamine administration and resolved completely by two hours post-infusion.

However, the specific relationship between ketamine's dissociative effects and its immediate and longer-lasting antidepressant effects remains unknown. For instance, it is possible that ketamine's dissociative symptoms are essential to the neurobiological mechanism of action required to produce antidepressant effects and, in fact, that ketamine's antidepressant effects may depend on the experience of these side effects. Interestingly, psychedelic effects are an intrinsic aspect of treatment for some other agents that have abuse potential, such as psilocybin; such treatments often use psychological support before, during, and after administration to guide participants through the experience.

This review will provide a brief overview of ketamine's mechanism of action and consider the relationship between dissociative symptoms and antidepressant response to ketamine, as well as the presence of dissociative symptoms in response to other NMDAR antagonists or modulators.

### Pharmacokinetics of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and dehydronorketamine: A model-based analysis [^113Hci1v]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). High credibility.

Recent studies show the activity of ketamine metabolites, such as hydroxynorketamine, in producing rapid relief of depression-related symptoms and analgesia. To improve our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of ketamine and metabolites norketamine, dehydronorketamine, and hydroxynorketamine, we developed a population pharmacokinetic model of ketamine and metabolites following i.v. administration of racemic ketamine and the S-isomer (esketamine). Pharmacokinetic data were derived from an RCT on the efficacy of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in reducing the psychotomimetic side effects of ketamine in human volunteers.

- **Methods**: Three increasing i.v. doses of esketamine and racemic ketamine were administered to 20 healthy volunteers, and arterial plasma samples were obtained for the measurement of ketamine and metabolites. Subjects were randomized to receive esketamine/SNP, esketamine/placebo, racemic ketamine/SNP, and racemic ketamine/placebo on four separate occasions. The time-plasma concentration data of ketamine and metabolites were analyzed using a population compartmental model approach.

- **Results**: The pharmacokinetics of ketamine and metabolites were adequately described by a seven-compartment model with two ketamine, norketamine, and hydroxynorketamine compartments, and one dehydronorketamine compartment with metabolic compartments in between ketamine and norketamine, and norketamine and dehydronorketamine main compartments. Significant differences were found between S- and R-ketamine enantiomer pharmacokinetics, with up to 50% lower clearances for the R-enantiomers.

Recent advances in acute pain mechanisms and management have implicated the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor-ion channel complex in the development of postoperative hyperalgesia and acute opioid tolerance. N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonists such as ketamine have been used increasingly in clinical studies to minimize acute postoperative pain and reduce opioid requirements. A mixture of ketamine and an opioid administered in the same solution and syringe would be a practical and useful technique for postoperative epidural analgesia, continuous IV infusion, or patient-controlled IV analgesia. We investigated the stability of a morphine sulfate and racemic ketamine solution in saline at pH 5.5–7.5 over a period of 4 days. Our study demonstrates that the ketamine-morphine mixture at a clinically relevant concentration seems to be stable at room temperature, over a wide range of pH values, for at least 4 days.

- **Implications**: Small-dose ketamine is used with increasing frequency in the acute postoperative setting as an adjunct to traditional opioid analgesics. We show that a racemic ketamine and morphine solution at a clinically relevant concentration seems to be stable at room temperature at a wide range of pH values for at least 4 days.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^1133THvF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The discovery of the rapid antidepressant effects of (R, S)-ketamine, including in treatment-resistant patients, has appropriately been hailed as 'the most important discovery in half a century' in depression research. Through the drug development and clinical trials process, the (S)-ketamine nasal spray, Spravato TM, has been approved in both the United States and Europe, although some concerns remain regarding efficacy and side effects. The first pilot study of (R)-ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) has demonstrated encouraging results, and considering preclinical findings, it appears (R)-ketamine may have a more favorable safety profile than (S)-ketamine. Accumulating preclinical evidence also suggests (R)-ketamine to have more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than both (R, S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. As studies of (R)-ketamine progress through Phase I and Phase II, results from direct comparison studies of the safety and efficacy of (R)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine in TRD will be crucial.

- **Outstanding questions**: Although NMDA receptor inhibition and subsequent AMPA receptor activation have a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine, further mechanistic work is building a more nuanced understanding of the distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine, its enantiomers, and metabolites, including BDNF-TrkB, mTORC1, and ERK signaling. Although there may be a role for monoaminergic and opioid receptor systems in the antidepressant effects or detrimental side effects of ketamine, further research is necessary.

### Ketamine's acute effects on negative brain states are mediated through distinct altered states of consciousness in humans [^114NgmUD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Ketamine commonly and rapidly induces dissociative and other altered states of consciousness (ASCs) in humans. However, the neural mechanisms that contribute to these experiences remain unknown. We used functional neuroimaging to engage key regions of the brain's affective circuits during acute ketamine-induced ASCs. This was within a randomized, multi-modal, placebo-controlled design, examining placebo, 0.05 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in nonclinical adult participants (NCT03475277). Licensed clinicians monitored infusions for safety.

Linear mixed effects models, analysis of variance, t-tests, and mediation models were used for statistical analyses. Our design enabled us to test our pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints, which were met:

- **Effects of ketamine across dose conditions**: On (1) emotional task-evoked brain activity and (2) sub-components of dissociation and other ASCs. With this design, we were also able to disentangle which ketamine-induced affective brain states are dependent upon specific aspects of ASCs.

Differently valenced ketamine-induced ASCs mediated opposing effects on right anterior insula activity. Participants experiencing relatively higher depersonalization induced by 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine showed relief from negative brain states, with reduced task-evoked right anterior insula activity of 0.39 SD. In contrast, participants experiencing dissociative amnesia showed an exacerbation of insula activity at 0.32 SD. These results in nonclinical participants may shed light on the mechanisms by which specific dissociative states predict the response to ketamine in depressed individuals.

### The antidepressant effect and safety of non-intranasal esketamine: A systematic review [^115HZaXr]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

The concept of NMDA receptor antagonism has been challenged, and various other molecular insights have been gained in the mechanistic pathways of ketamine and its enantiomers. This offers a perspective for alternatives like arketamine. Previously, it was assumed that the undesired psychic emergence reactions of ketamine were associated with arketamine. However, existing data on this point are still a subject of controversial discussion.

Better tolerability of esketamine than racemic ketamine was demonstrated in earlier studies in both rodents and humans. For this reason, esketamine is widely used in anesthesia. Conversely, other studies reported that sub-anesthetic doses of arketamine induced a state of relaxation and a feeling of well-being, while in the same individuals, a sub-anesthetic dose of esketamine induced psychotomimetic effects. A further matter is that these "undesired psychic emergence reactions" of ketamine may also help in the psychotherapeutic process. This points to a need to also compare the effects of arketamine and esketamine in patients with depression.

In theory, esketamine has the potential to have a superior antidepressant effect and safety profile compared to racemic ketamine, but the evidence is not sufficiently robust to confirm this hypothesis. Adequately powered comparative studies are needed, focusing on both the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of different types and formulations of ketamine. Time will tell whether non-intranasal esketamine may offer an effective and safe addition to our depression treatment arsenal.

### Sex differences in ketamine's therapeutic effects for mood disorders: A systematic review [^115CVru7]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

Replicated clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects with ketamine in treatment-resistant mood disorders. Considering sex (biological) and gender differences in therapeutic effects for any new intervention is important. However, the differential efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ketamine in males versus females remain underexplored. The objective of the present systematic review is to identify and qualitatively synthesize all published clinical studies relevant to the sex differential effects of ketamine for mood disorders.

A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo from inception until January 20, 2021, yielded 27 reports including 1715 patients (742 males and 973 females) that met the inclusion criteria. Results from the vast majority of studies (88.8%) do not support significant sex differences in antidepressant response, tolerability, or safety of ketamine. Nine (33.3%) of the reports included a bioanalytical component in the analysis, and only one reported on sex differences. Evidence from the present review does not support clinically or statistically significant sex differences in therapeutic effects with ketamine. Nevertheless, future studies should continue to consider sex and biological sex differences in study design and data analytic plans.

### The effect of ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory [^111bpumW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Ketamine, principally an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, induces schizophrenia-like symptoms in adult humans, warranting its use in the investigation of psychosis-related phenotypes in animal models. Genomic studies further implicate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated processes in schizophrenia pathology, together with more broadly-defined synaptic plasticity and associative learning processes. Strong pathophysiological links have been demonstrated between fear learning and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

To further investigate the impact of ketamine on associative fear learning, we studied the effects of pre- and post-training ketamine on the consolidation and extinction of contextual fear memory in rats. Administration of 25 mg/kg ketamine prior to fear conditioning did not affect consolidation when potentially confounding effects of state dependency were controlled for. Pre-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) impaired the extinction of the conditioned fear response, which was mirrored with the use of a lower dose (8 mg/kg). Post-training ketamine (25 mg/kg) had no effect on the consolidation or extinction of conditioned fear. These observations implicate processes relating to the extinction of contextual fear memory in the manifestation of ketamine-induced phenotypes and are consistent with existing hypotheses surrounding abnormal associative learning in schizophrenia.

### Ketamine for depression, 3: Does chirality matter [^116Ea5eA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Ketamine is a racemic mixture of the enantiomers R-ketamine and S-ketamine (esketamine). S-ketamine has greater analgesic and anesthetic effects than R-ketamine and is less likely to cause psychotomimetic and other adverse effects. There is therefore an emerging interest favoring the use of S-ketamine over racemic ketamine when the drug is used for analgesia or anesthesia. This article examines preclinical and clinical literature on the antidepressant properties of S-ketamine. Animal data suggest potential advantages for R-ketamine over S-ketamine. Case reports, case series, and some small randomized controlled trials suggest that single or repeated intravenous infusions (0.2–0.4 mg/kg) or intranasal administrations (28–84 mg) of S-ketamine have antidepressant action in patients with medication-refractory depression and that the observed benefits are similar in magnitude to the antidepressant benefits reported with racemic ketamine. However, there are no direct comparisons between S-ketamine and either R-ketamine or racemic ketamine in depressed patients; therefore, it is not possible to make an informed choice when considering the enantiomers and the racemate for the indication of depression.

### Ketamine and other NMDA antagonists: Early clinical trials and possible mechanisms in depression [^116df9kt]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression.

Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes.

Ketamine, across seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants, produced a rapid yet transient antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37–22.29) and 14.47 (2.67–78.49), respectively. This was accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT, in five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants, significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g = 0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects.

### The effect of intravenous, intranasal, and oral ketamine in mood disorders: A meta-analysis [^1174KRC9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Ketamine is established as a rapid and effective treatment in adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The availability of different formulations and routes of delivery invites the need for evaluating relative effect sizes.

- **Methods**: Effect size with respect to depression symptom reduction for each formulation and route of delivery was compared at discrete time points (i.e. 24 hours, 2–6 days, 7–20 days, 21–28 days) in adults with TRD. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect size across intravenous, intranasal, and oral routes of administration. Analysis was also conducted evaluating the effect size of racemic ketamine to esketamine.

- **Results**: The pooled effect size for intranasal ketamine/esketamine at 24 hours was g = 1.247 (n = 5, 95% CI: 0.591–1.903, p < 0.01). At 2–6 days, the pooled effect size for intravenous ketamine/esketamine was g = 0.949 (n = 14, 95% CI: -0.308–2.206, p = 0.139). At 7–20 days, intranasal ketamine had a pooled effect size of g = 1.018 (n = 4, 95% CI: 0.499–1.538, p < 0.01). At 21–28 days, oral ketamine had a pooled effect size of g = 0.633 (n = 2, 95% CI: 0.368–0.898, p < 0.01).

- **Limitations**: Additional comparative studies are needed regarding the efficacy of different formulations and routes of delivery.

- **Conclusions**: The short-term efficacy of intravenous and intranasal ketamine/esketamine for adults with TRD was established. Interpreting the efficacy of oral ketamine was limited by the need for studies with larger samples across independent sites. No conclusions regarding comparative efficacy were drawn.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^116mkVEa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The discovery of the rapid antidepressant effects of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine, an uncompetitive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist, is arguably the most important breakthrough in depression research in the last 50 years. Ketamine remains an off-label treatment for treatment-resistant depression, with factors limiting widespread use, including its dissociative effects and abuse potential.

Ketamine is a racemic mixture, composed of equal amounts of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. An (S)-ketamine nasal spray has been developed and approved for use in treatment-resistant depression in the United States and Europe; however, some concerns regarding efficacy and side effects remain.

Although (R)-ketamine is a less potent N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist than (S)-ketamine, increasing preclinical evidence suggests (R)-ketamine may have more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine, alongside fewer side effects. Furthermore, a recent pilot trial of (R)-ketamine has demonstrated rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant depression.

Research is ongoing to determine the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of ketamine and its component enantiomers in an effort to develop future rapid-acting antidepressants that lack undesirable effects. Here, we briefly review findings regarding the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomers before considering underlying mechanisms, including N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonism and γ-aminobutyric acid.

### Repurposing ketamine to treat cocaine use disorder: Integration of artificial intelligence-based prediction, expert evaluation, clinical corroboration and mechanism of action analyses [^115xqpPU]. Addiction (2023). High credibility.

Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health issue for which there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication. Drug repurposing looks for new cost-effective uses of approved drugs. This study presents an integrated strategy to identify repurposed FDA-approved drugs for CUD treatment.

- **Design**: Our drug repurposing strategy combines artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug prediction, expert panel review, clinical corroboration, and mechanism of action analysis being implemented in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN). Based on AI-based prediction and expert knowledge, ketamine was ranked as the top candidate for clinical corroboration via electronic health record (EHR) evaluation of CUD patient cohorts prescribed ketamine for anesthesia or depression compared with matched controls who received non-ketamine anesthesia or antidepressants/midazolam. Genetic and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to understand ketamine's potential mechanisms of action in the context of CUD.

- **Setting**: The study utilized TriNetX to access EHRs from more than 90 million patients worldwide. Genetic- and functional-level analyses used DisGeNet, Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases.

- **Participants**: A total of 7,742 CUD patients who received anesthesia (3,871 ketamine-exposed and 3,871 anesthetic-controlled) and 7,910 CUD patients with depression (3,955 ketamine-exposed and 3,955 antidepressant-controlled) were identified after propensity score-matching.

### Ketamine: a controversial drug for neonates [^114vAN6b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Ketamine is widely used for anesthesia and analgesia in neonates and children. It provides potent sedation, analgesia, and amnesia with a short duration of action, supporting hemodynamic and respiratory stability. Its primary therapeutic effects arise from noncompetitive antagonism of NMDA receptors, though it also alters receptor function at dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and opioidergic sites. Recent interest in ketamine stems from its potential to block excitotoxic cell death; however, concerns have been raised about anesthetic neurotoxicity in neonatal animal models. This article reviews the development of ketamine, its clinical profile, toxic effects on the immature brain, and future applications in neonates and children.

### Rethinking ketamine as a panacea: Adverse effects on oxygenation and postoperative outcomes [^113g1VTF]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Ketamine is receiving renewed interest in perioperative medicine as an anaesthetic adjunct and a treatment for chronic conditions, including depression. Ketamine's complex pharmacologic profile results in several desirable effects, such as anaesthesia and analgesia, but also multiple adverse effects affecting the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. In addition to defining patient-centred outcomes in future clinical studies on the perioperative uses of ketamine, careful monitoring for its numerous adverse effects will be paramount.

### Ketamine: A tale of two enantiomers [^111FYYUR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Ketamine as an antidepressant explores the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine in major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

(R, S)-ketamine: In the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of racemic ketamine in MDD, it was demonstrated that a single sub-anesthetic intravenous (IV) infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) resulted in rapid antidepressant effects within hours of administration. Several subsequent studies have confirmed these rapid-acting antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression. Findings have been reviewed in several meta-analyses, which report robust antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects lasting up to 1 week in treatment-resistant MDD and bipolar depression, with acute dissociative symptoms being the most common side effect.

Unfortunately, the antidepressant effect of a single dose of ketamine is not generally sustained beyond 1 week. In the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of repeated ketamine administration, it was shown that twice- or thrice-weekly administration of IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) was sufficient to maintain antidepressant efficacy over 15 days in individuals with TRD. Similar findings have also been reported in open-label repeated infusion studies. In contrast, a recent RCT investigating the effects of six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 45 minutes) or saline placebo over 3 weeks in severe TRD with current, chronic suicidal ideation failed to demonstrate a significant difference in depression severity or suicidality at the 3-week endpoint. However, this study was limited by a small sample size.

### The abuse liability of ketamine: A scoping review of preclinical and clinical studies [^114P5rzN]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

While ketamine has been used clinically over the past decades, it has only recently been shown to be a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, ketamine and related dissociative agents may also be misused recreationally, creating significant concerns for abuse liability when prescribed for depression. Although the abuse potential of ketamine is widely recognized, there is limited evidence on the differential abuse liability of ketamine enantiomers, (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine. The scoping review aims to summarize the extant literature on the abuse liability of (R, S)-ketamine and the enantiomers. A systematic search was conducted on the Embase, Medline, and APA PsycInfo databases from 1947 to July 29, 2021. Clinical and preclinical studies that assessed the abuse potential of (R, S)-ketamine, (S)-ketamine, and (R)-ketamine were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers.

A total of 65 eligible studies were identified; 55 were preclinical studies and 10 were clinical studies. Only 4 preclinical studies evaluated the abuse liability of ketamine enantiomers. Available preclinical evidence suggests that (R, S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine have a greater risk for abuse compared to (R)-ketamine. (R)-ketamine, at antidepressant-relevant doses in rodents, appears to be safe with minimal liability for abuse. Although the abuse potential of (R, S)-ketamine is well-established in animals, limited clinical studies indicate that single or repeated ketamine administrations in professionally controlled settings did not result in misuse.
