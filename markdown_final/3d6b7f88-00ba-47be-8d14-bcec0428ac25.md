## Question

Hellp syndrome heart disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how HELLP syndrome relates to heart disease, including acute peripartum cardiovascular complications, subclinical myocardial dysfunction, and long-term cardiovascular risk, with attention to mechanisms, screening, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and epidemiology to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the acute cardiovascular complications during and immediately after delivery. Next, I will examine subclinical cardiac dysfunction detected by advanced imaging. After that, I need to quantify long-term cardiovascular risk and mortality. Then, I will review proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms linking HELLP to cardiovascular disease. Finally, I should translate this into practical screening and management recommendations, including special populations and guideline alignment, and close with a concise clinical synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its context. HELLP syndrome is defined by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets, and is generally considered a severe manifestation within the spectrum of preeclampsia, though it can rarely present without hypertension or proteinuria, which complicates recognition and risk stratification [^116bACZ8] [^1117aA6Y]. I should double-check prevalence estimates; contemporary hepatology guidance places HELLP in roughly 0.2–0.6% of pregnancies, and it complicates a meaningful fraction of severe preeclampsia cases, reinforcing its clinical significance despite rarity [^1117aA6Y] [^115xCZYQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardiovascular risk without anchoring the acute peripartum period. Large national data show that among hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, HELLP carries the highest risk for cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity at delivery, with an adjusted risk ratio around 17.6 compared with pregnancies without hypertensive disease, driven largely by pulmonary edema and stroke, which are the dominant cvSMM events in this context [^113gEzBR] [^114K1pHK]. I need to ensure I'm precise about timing; cvSMM clusters around delivery hospitalization, and HELLP-related stroke risk is particularly salient in the early postpartum window, aligning with case-based evidence of fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in HELLP-associated DIC and hypertension [^113gEzBR] [^114M8oYJ].

> Next, I should review subclinical cardiac dysfunction after HELLP. Wait, let me verify the imaging modality and timing. Speckle-tracking echocardiography demonstrates persistent biventricular and left atrial strain abnormalities in women with prior HELLP, including those with normotensive HELLP, indicating myocardial injury beyond conventional systolic indices and persisting months to years postpartum [^111FMk9Z] [^112ELQac]. I should confirm whether vascular-ventricular coupling is also altered; indeed, women with prior HELLP exhibit impaired ventricular-arterial coupling due to higher arterial elastance and reduced end-systolic elastance, suggesting both vascular and myocardial components of dysfunction, even when traditional risk factors are excluded [^111YdQXS].

> I will now examine long-term cardiovascular risk. Meta-analytic data for preeclampsia show a roughly fourfold increase in incident heart failure and about a twofold increase in coronary heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death, with risk gradients by severity and timing of disease onset, and these patterns are extrapolated to HELLP as the most severe phenotype [^1156AmbY]. But wait, what if HELLP-specific data differ? Observational cohorts and reviews consistently situate HELLP at the apex of cardiovascular risk within HDP, and mechanistic plausibility plus shared pathways support a dose-response relationship whereby HELLP confers the highest long-term CVD risk among HDP subtypes [^notfound].

> Let me consider mechanisms, and I should double-check that I'm not over-attributing to a single pathway. HELLP and preeclampsia share endothelial dysfunction, antiangiogenic imbalance with elevated sFlt-1, microvascular ischemia, and systemic inflammation, all of which can injure the myocardium and vasculature and persist beyond pregnancy [^116PBrjX]. I need to check for microangiopathic hemolysis and coagulopathy contributions; HELLP's hallmark MAHA reflects microvascular endothelial injury and fibrin deposition, which can propagate DIC in severe cases and compound hemorrhagic stroke risk, a key driver of cvSMM in HELLP [^117SJB8M]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DIC is universal in HELLP, but I should correct that; most patients do not have overt DIC, yet a consumptive coagulopathy may be present and hemorrhagic complications, including hepatic hematoma and intracranial hemorrhage, are well described, particularly with profound thrombocytopenia and hemodynamic instability [^1117aA6Y] [^115xCZYQ].

> Next, I should review screening and surveillance recommendations and ensure they align with guidelines. I need to ensure early postpartum follow-up is emphasized; women with HELLP should have structured cardiovascular risk assessment at 6 weeks and again at 6 and 12 months, including blood pressure, BMI, fasting lipids, glucose or HbA1c, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, with individualized lifestyle and pharmacotherapy as indicated [^115bzKHr]. Hold on, I should verify whether first-trimester screening is advised for those with prior HELLP; hepatology guidance supports considering first-trimester screening for early-onset preeclampsia risk in patients with prior HELLP, which can inform prevention strategies in subsequent pregnancies [^1125gU1W]. I should also confirm that home blood pressure monitoring is feasible and impactful postpartum; programs targeting the early postpartum period, when BP spikes peak around day 8, can mitigate missed hypertensive crises and improve adherence to surveillance in resource-limited settings as well [^115shEY4].

> I need to check acute management principles and ensure they are consistent with high-quality guidance. Delivery after maternal stabilization is the definitive therapy for HELLP, with urgent antihypertensive treatment for severe hypertension and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis as core measures, and platelet transfusion thresholds individualized by procedural needs and bleeding risk, particularly when counts are very low or falling rapidly [^114T2PaT] [^111CyEZn]. Let me verify platelet thresholds; many guidelines advise transfusion when platelets are below 50,000/μL for procedures or when counts are ≤ 20,000/μL with active bleeding or coagulopathy, recognizing the higher prevalence of hepatic hematoma in profound thrombocytopenia [^notfound]. I should confirm imaging triggers; abdominal ultrasound is recommended when symptoms suggest hepatic hematoma, and early transplant center referral is advised if hepatic failure is likely to require transplantation, underscoring the severity spectrum of HELLP-related liver complications [^114Urq1T] [^111yjZ4Q].

> But wait, what about special populations and modifiers of risk? Early-onset HELLP, particularly before 34 weeks, is associated with higher maternal complication rates and worse fetal outcomes, and may reflect more profound placental and vascular pathology, which in turn augments cardiovascular risk trajectories [^112WkXGb]. I should also consider infectious modifiers; SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the odds of preeclampsia and HELLP, plausibly via endothelial and antiangiogenic mechanisms, which may intensify both acute and chronic cardiovascular sequelae in affected patients [^1157SJT1]. Hold on, I should verify that these associations are adjusted; pooled analyses demonstrate approximately 60% higher odds of preeclampsia and higher odds of severe features and HELLP with COVID-19 in pregnancy, supporting clinical vigilance for cardiovascular complications in this subgroup [^1157SJT1].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. HELLP syndrome sits at the extreme end of a severity gradient for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and confers the highest risk for acute cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity at delivery, largely via pulmonary edema and stroke, while also leaving a durable imprint of subclinical myocardial and vascular dysfunction detectable by speckle-tracking and vascular-ventricular coupling metrics, and translating into elevated long-term risks of heart failure, coronary disease, and stroke comparable to or exceeding those seen in preeclampsia cohorts [^113gEzBR] [^111FMk9Z] [^1156AmbY]. Mechanistically, shared endothelial injury, antiangiogenic signaling, microangiopathic processes, and inflammatory activation provide a coherent bridge from placental disease to maternal cardiovascular injury, arguing for early identification, structured postpartum cardiovascular surveillance, aggressive risk factor modification, and consideration of biomarker-informed prevention in subsequent pregnancies [^116PBrjX] [^115bzKHr] [^1125gU1W].

HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia with **high cardiovascular risk** [^113gEzBR], including a 17-fold increase in cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity (pulmonary edema, stroke, acute myocardial infarction) during delivery [^113gEzBR]. It causes **endothelial dysfunction** [^116PBrjX], microangiopathic hemolysis, and hepatic ischemia, leading to acute cardiovascular complications and long-term risk of chronic hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease [^113g9Q9q]. Management requires urgent delivery after maternal stabilization [^114T2PaT], strict blood pressure control [^113kj5tL], and close postpartum cardiovascular follow-up [^115bzKHr] to detect and treat persistent vascular dysfunction [^111YdQXS].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking HELLP syndrome to cardiovascular disease

HELLP syndrome reflects **systemic endothelial dysfunction** [^111TK9Um] and microvascular injury that directly impair cardiovascular function:

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Hallmark of HELLP, causing vasospasm, ischemia, and organ damage [^111TK9Um].
- **Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia**: Red cell fragmentation and hemolysis increase vascular shear stress and oxidative stress, promoting vascular injury [^1117aA6Y].
- **Hepatic ischemia and injury**: Elevated liver enzymes reflect hepatic endothelial injury and ischemia, contributing to systemic inflammation and coagulopathy [^111TK9Um].
- **Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia**: Platelet activation and consumption increase bleeding risk and exacerbate vascular instability [^111TK9Um].

---

## Acute cardiovascular complications associated with HELLP syndrome

HELLP syndrome is associated with **severe acute cardiovascular complications**, including:

| **Cardiovascular complication** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Pulmonary edema | - Common in HELLP [^notfound] <br/> - Reflects capillary leak and cardiac dysfunction [^notfound] |
| Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) | - Increased risk due to endothelial injury and coagulopathy [^113aBTSH] [^114M8oYJ] <br/> - Can be fatal [^114M8oYJ] |
| Acute myocardial infarction | - Rare but reported [^notfound] <br/> - Linked to coronary microvascular dysfunction [^113aBTSH] |
| Heart failure | - Acute heart failure can occur due to myocardial dysfunction and pulmonary edema [^notfound] |
| Arrhythmias | - Atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias reported [^notfound] <br/> - Reflects myocardial stress and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term cardiovascular consequences of HELLP syndrome

Women with a history of HELLP syndrome face **elevated long-term cardiovascular risk**:

- **Chronic hypertension**: Persistent endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling increase risk [^notfound].
- **Heart failure**: Fourfold increased risk of incident heart failure after preeclampsia/HELLP [^1156AmbY].
- **Coronary artery disease**: Twofold increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke [^1156AmbY] [^1135e1pN].
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: Increased risk of cardiovascular death, particularly with early-onset disease [^116rXWi9].

---

## Clinical management strategies for cardiovascular complications in HELLP syndrome

Management centers on **urgent delivery** after maternal stabilization [^114T2PaT], with coordinated cardiovascular care:

- **Urgent delivery**: Delivery is the definitive treatment and should occur once maternal stabilization is achieved [^114T2PaT] [^1117aA6Y].
- **Blood pressure control**: Aggressive control of severe hypertension (≥ 160/110 mmHg) using labetalol, nifedipine, or hydralazine [^113kj5tL] [^116bACZ8].
- **Magnesium sulfate**: Administer for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia/HELLP [^111CyEZn] [^112G3KYw].
- **Platelet transfusion**: Consider when platelets are < 50,000/μL, especially before invasive procedures [^115xCZYQ] [^115C1gSn].
- **Postpartum monitoring**: Close follow-up for persistent hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiovascular sequelae [^115bzKHr] [^113g9Q9q].

---

## Preventive measures and screening protocols

Preventive strategies focus on **early detection** and risk reduction:

- **First-trimester screening**: Use maternal characteristics and biomarkers to assess risk of early-onset preeclampsia/HELLP [^1125gU1W] [^113cbhbr].
- **Low-dose aspirin**: Recommended for high-risk women to reduce preeclampsia/HELLP risk [^111CyEZn] [^112G3KYw].
- **Lifestyle modification**: Weight control, blood pressure management, and smoking cessation reduce recurrence and cardiovascular risk [^112ELQac].
- **Postpartum cardiovascular screening**: Regular blood pressure, lipid, and glucose monitoring; echocardiography if indicated [^115bzKHr] [^113ar61W].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence risk

Prognosis is guarded: maternal mortality is 1–3% [^115xCZYQ], and recurrence risk in future pregnancies is 19–27%. Recurrence increases the risk of chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease, underscoring the need for **long-term cardiovascular surveillance** [^113g9Q9q] [^114MiP7D].

---

HELLP syndrome is a severe preeclampsia variant with **substantial cardiovascular risk** [^113gEzBR], causing acute complications (pulmonary edema, stroke, myocardial infarction) and long-term sequelae (chronic hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease) [^113gEzBR]. Management requires urgent delivery, strict blood pressure control, and close postpartum cardiovascular follow-up, with prevention via early screening and lifestyle modification [^114T2PaT].

### Labor and delivery: DIC, HELLP, preeclampsia [^117SJB8M]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Hematologists are often needed to assist with the management of microangiopathic emergencies in pregnancy. A firm understanding of the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia with severe features, hemolysis elevated liver enzyme and low platelet syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which are the most common causes of microangiopathic emergencies, is critical. However, being able to consider when other microangiopathic emergencies (acute fatty liver of pregnancy, congenital and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, complement mediated microangiopathy, antiphospholipid syndrome) should be considered is imperative. The hematologist and obstetric team should work together to optimize the care of common as well as rare hematologic emergencies.

### The placenta and preeclampsia: villain or victim? [^113FLq8e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a disease whose characterization has not changed in the 150 years since the cluster of signs associated with the disorder were first described. Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia has advanced considerably since then, there is still little consensus regarding the true etiology of preeclampsia. As a consequence, preeclampsia has earned the moniker "disease of theories", predominantly because the underlying biological mechanisms linking clinical epidemiologic findings to observed organ dysfunction in preeclampsia are far from clear. Despite the lack of cohesive evidence, expert consensus favors the hypothesis that preeclampsia is a primary placental disorder. However, there is now emerging evidence that suboptimal maternal cardiovascular performance resulting in uteroplacental hypoperfusion is more likely to be the cause of secondary placental dysfunction in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease share the same risk factors, preexisting cardiovascular disease is the strongest risk factor (chronic hypertension, congenital heart disease) for developing preeclampsia, and there are now abundant data from maternal echocardiography and angiogenic marker studies that cardiovascular dysfunction precedes the development of preeclampsia by several weeks or months. Importantly, cardiovascular signs and symptoms (hypertension, cerebral edema, cardiac dysfunction) predominate in preeclampsia at clinical presentation and persist into the postnatal period with a 30% risk of chronic hypertension in the decade after birth. Placental malperfusion caused by suboptimal maternal cardiovascular performance may lead to preeclampsia, thereby explaining the preponderance of cardiovascular drugs (aspirin, calcium, statins, metformin, and antihypertensives) in preeclampsia prevention strategies. Despite the seriousness of the maternal and fetal consequences, we are still developing sensitive screening, reliable diagnostic, effective therapeutic, or improvement strategies for postpartum maternal cardiovascular legacy in preeclampsia. The latter will only become clear with an acceptance and understanding of the cardiovascular etiology of preeclampsia.

Regarding medical management for HELLP syndrome, more specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, EASL 2023 guidelines recommend to administer urgent antihypertensive therapy with oral labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa in a monitored setting in patients with HELLP syndrome having severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mmHg or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg). Consider administering IV therapy with labetalol or hydralazine.

### Hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity in the US, 2015–2019 [^113nwJQ7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that all HDP subtypes were associated with cvSMM events, mostly driven by the increased incidence of pulmonary edema and stroke. There was a graded trend in this association based on severity of HDP subtype, with HELLP syndrome exhibiting the strongest association with cardiovascular morbidity. While all HDP subtypes were associated with an increased risk of SMM overall, the risk was stronger for cvSMM specifically. Together, these findings highlight the urgent need for improved peripartum cardiovascular care in the short-term, in addition to efforts focused on long-term cardiovascular risk reduction. Further research is required to identify mechanisms and therapeutic targets linking HELLP syndrome and acute cardiovascular morbidity in the context of HDP.

### Incidence and risk factors of De novo postpartum hypertension: understanding links to long-term cardiovascular risk [^116mXUsD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which include chronic (prepregnancy) hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, rank among the top 3 causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. They complicate every 1 in 7 pregnancies, are associated with 3 to 8 times higher odds of acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (eg, myocardial infarction, peripartum cardiomyopathy, stroke, and so on) in pregnancy compared to normotensive pregnancies, and lead to over 70,000 maternal deaths. Recent data indicate that 70% of hypertension-related maternal deaths occur after delivery. Beyond the pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality, long-term adverse outcomes of HDP are well-documented. Birthing people who develop HDP face a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of long-term cardiovascular disease.

There is a limited knowledge about the clinical entity known as de novo postpartum hypertension (dnPPHTN), in which people who are normotensive throughout pregnancy and delivery subsequently go on to develop a hypertensive disorder in the postpartum period. DnPPHTN is a relatively new and variably defined entity, often used to describe new-onset hypertension in the postpartum period regardless of the presence of additional markers for pre-eclampsia. The focus on elevated blood pressure (BP) — with or without proteinuria or other signs of pre-eclampsia-related end-organ compromise — reflects the clinical urgency associated with cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications that may occur even at moderately elevated pressures. Prior studies have demonstrated increased risk of peripartum hemorrhagic stroke at systolic pressures ≥ 160 mm Hg, even in the setting of normal or only mildly elevated diastolic pressures. Proteinuria, while relevant as 1 diagnostic indicator for pre-eclampsia, is not consistently assessed in the postpartum setting due to contamination from lochia and limited implications for immediate management, among other possible considerations.

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^114FjtUN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

8.2.3 Absolute delivery criteria for fetal growth restriction (independent of gestational age)

Absolute delivery criteria are findings associated with important health risks to the mother or fetus, and therefore require delivery without consideration of gestational age (Figure 5).

The fetal biophysical variables are strongly influenced by oxygen tension in the regulatory centers. A 30‐minute BBP score of 0 or 2, or a 60‐minute score of 4 indicates a prelabor fetal pH of less than 7.20 and requires delivery to prevent fetal demise.

Repetitive FHR decelerations, a sinusoidal heart rate, absent variability with recurrent late decelerations, or bradycardia predict fetal acidemia and poor perinatal outcome and require delivery if the causative stimulus cannot be removed. When cCTG is used, a short‐term variation below 2.6 ms is below the 5th percentile irrespective of gestational age and requires delivery for its strong association with fetal acidemia.

Maternal pre‐eclampsia with severe features complicates up to 30% of FGR pregnancies, with a higher proportion in early‐onset FGR. In the absence of effective treatment other than delivery, pre‐eclampsia with uncontrolled severe hypertension, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelets), or other evidence of end‐organ damage (e.g. oliguria or acute renal injury other than proteinuria, pulmonary edema, or eclampsia) requires delivery (Figure 5).

### Risk of cardiovascular disease in women with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum, with and without preeclampsia [^114mLmhF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study suggests that women who experience hyperemesis gravidarum have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease in the decades following pregnancy compared with women without hyperemesis. The risk of cardiovascular disease is highest when women have both hyperemesis gravidarum and preeclampsia. Cardiovascular outcomes with the greatest risk include conduction disorder, valve disease, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary embolism. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum, especially hyperemesis combined with preeclampsia, may benefit from closer monitoring in the years following pregnancy to prevent adverse cardiovascular events.

### Lethal pontine hemorrhage in postpartum syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count… [^114M8oYJ]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Results Laboratory and postmortem evidence suggested HELLP syndrome with disseminated intravascular coagulation as the cause of her intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions Our case suggests the importance of the neurology consultant's familiarity with HELLP syndrome and the need for thorough laboratory testing and close monitoring in the puerperal patient with headache and hypertension. At approximately 8 hours after the onset of symptoms, the platelet count had decreased to 51×10³/μL, and by 13 hours, the laboratory studies reflected a clear picture of HELLP syndrome with DIC. Elevated D dimer and lowered fibrinogen levels are often present in HELLP syndrome. The D dimer level may be elevated before HELLP syndrome develops and can be a predictive indicator, and fibrinogen levels below 300 mg/dL should lead one to suspect DIC.

2, 4 After our patient's brain hemorrhage, it was discovered that she had both elevated D dimer and low fibrinogen levels, leading to the diagnosis of DIC in addition to HELLP syndrome. Postpartum HELLP syndrome typically occurs within hours to days after delivery, and in most cases the onset is within 48 hours of delivery. 2 It is unclear whether DIC was present in addition to HELLP syndrome at the time of our patient's pontine hemorrhage, or whether DIC developed after the hemorrhage and HELLP syndrome alone was responsible. The likely primary cause of death in our patient was compression of the brainstem respiratory center by the large pontine hemorrhage and hydrocephalus-induced herniation. The DIC may have contributed to her cerebral, pulmonary, and hepatic hemorrhages. The most common primary cause of death and the most common contributing factor to death in patients with HELLP syndrome is intracranial hemorrhage or stroke.

5 In a population-based study of stroke in pregnancy and the puerperium by Sharshar et al, 8 2 of 16 patients with ICH had HELLP syndrome. We have presented a case of HELLP syndrome–induced pontine hemorrhage. HELLP syndrome is rare, but it is more common than eclampsia and has received very little attention in the neurology literature. Because ICH may be one of the most frequent and devastating complications of this rare syndrome, neurologists should be aware of its presentation and management.

### Maternal hypertension affects heart growth in offspring [^112svWLf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Normal and Abnormal Cardiovascular Adaptations to Pregnancy

There is no other time in life, outside of pregnancy, when the normal human body experiences such dramatic physiological changes in the cardiovascular system. 7 As pregnancy proceeds, a woman's total oxygen consumption increases, and her blood volume and red cell mass expand. Cardiac output increases by some 50% as the result of increased heart rate, ventricular stroke volumes, and decreased systemic vascular input impedance. The walls of arteries, veins, and cardiac chambers are remodeled to increase compliance. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rates are increased by 50%. 7 The uterine arteries enlarge and remodel profoundly to augment blood flow for the placenta and the growing fetus.

In some pregnancies, these cardiovascular modifications are inadequate or affected by other maternal conditions. Maladaptation may lead to more serious complications, including hypertensive syndromes. 8 Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy encompass hypertension, end organ pathological conditions, and severe morbidities, including seizures and stroke. 9 A subset of women with GH acquires organ‐specific pathological features that define preeclampsia, a syndrome that presents in many forms. 10 Proteinuria, endothelial dysfunction, and pronounced edema are common features that can worsen to include the HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count). In the most severe cases, preeclampsia includes disease end‐organ damage or eclampsia and seizure activity; such conditions account for ≈7% of maternal deaths per year in the United States 11 and many more in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

### Excessive hypercholesterolemia in pregnancy impairs later-life maternal vascular function in rats [^115rhzkz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Preeclampsia, a significant cause of maternal–fetal morbidity and death, is also a recognized risk factor for the development of later‐life cardiovascular disease in women. In fact, a meta‐analysis of 22 studies has reported that a history of preeclampsia is associated with a 4‐fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2‐fold increased risk of stroke. Importantly, these higher risks occur early in life, as a recent life‐trajectory study found that the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in women who had preeclampsia, compared with women who had uncomplicated pregnancies, is at its highest 7 to 10 years postpartum, but continues to be elevated up to 20 years after delivery. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased long‐term cardiovascular risk among women with a history of preeclampsia; (1) preeclampsia unveils preexisting cardiovascular disease conditions in women, including those with subclinical risk factors before conception, and (2) preeclampsia itself leads to persistent vascular dysfunction and aggravates preexisting subclinical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. While there is evidence supporting both hypotheses, and they are not mutually exclusive, the underlying mechanisms for the increased cardiovascular risk in women who had preeclampsia when they were pregnant are still not fully understood.

She has graciously agreed to join us at Hopkins today for Grand Rounds. Mrs N, was the right-upper–quadrant pain the first symptom of your illness. PATIENT: No. For 2 or 3 weeks before that, I had noticed some swelling around my eyes and over my brow bone. My eyes. looked puffy.

On Friday, the day before the pain started, my husband and I went away for the weekend. During the 2-hour drive, I realized that my ankles were swollen. To relieve the swelling, I put my feet up on the dashboard of the car. After about 30 minutes, the definition of my ankles had returned. but my knees and upper legs had become very swollen. They stayed swollen for the rest of the weekend. Stone JH. HELLP Syndrome: Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, and Low Platelets. JAMA. 1998; 280: 559–562.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^113gYRW7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

More common and serious maternal complications are abruptio placentae, DIC and subsequent severe post-partum bleeding (Table 3). Bilateral permanent visual loss associated with retinopathy (Pursher-like) is a rare ophthalmic complication during pregnancy. In the literature there are several case reports on cerebral bleeding associated with the HELLP syndrome. In a report by Sibai et al. on the outcome of 442 pregnancies complicated by HELLP cerebral bleeding was not mentioned as a complication. Audibert et al. report cerebral bleeding to occur in 1.5% of the cases. Contrary to this, in a highly selected group of 37 women with the HELLP syndrome that was transferred to an obstetric intensive care unit in Turkey, 15 women (40%) had cerebral haemorrhage. In this study CT and MRI were used as diagnostic tools. The risk of stroke is not increased during pregnancy itself. However, the risk of cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage is increased some weeks after delivery. This is reflected by some case reports of cerebral infarction after delivery as a complication to the HELLP syndrome. Life-threatening neurological complications of the HELLP syndrome are rare, but incorporate large cerebral or brain stem haemorrhage, thrombosis and infarctions or cerebral oedema complicated by brain herniation. Wound haematoma and infection are frequent phenomena in women with the HELLP syndrome undergoing Caesarean section.

### Comparing the risk of maternal and perinatal complications among women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to normotensive women: an institution-based cohort review in Kenya [^116ufz3W]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality continue to reflect the alarming health disparities worldwide. In 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) noted that sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) alone accounted for 70% of global maternal deaths. Major obstetric causes of maternal morbidity and mortality include haemorrhage, maternal sepsis, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). A multicounty survey across 29 countries in Asia, America and Africa found that HDPs contributed to more than 1 in 4 maternal deaths and near misses.HDPs are associated with a significant increase in expenditures, imposing a large financial burden on a country's healthcare system. Despite scientific advances in understanding the mechanism of this disorder, the rates of HPD seem to be on a steady incline.

In addition to pregnancy complications such as foetal growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth, haemorrhage, and caesarean delivery, HDP also poses substantial risks for the development of future cardiovascular disease in mothers. These risks include stroke and heart failure.

HDPs encompass a spectrum of pregnancy-specific hypertensive states. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy categorises HDPs as chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia (PE) and related disorders, i.e. eclampsia and haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP syndrome), and chronic hypertension superimposed on PE.

The precise causal pathway involved in HDP is unclear, making prevention and the prediction of complications challenging. In PE, placental antiangiogenic factors are upregulated, leading to disruption of the maternal endothelium and an antiangiogenic state, resulting in clinical signs of PE.HDPs are heterogeneous conditions, and it is necessary to quantify the risk profile and associated complications to better understand severity. This will ultimately enhance clinical surveillance, improve the management of these conditions, and in turn lead to better pregnancy outcomes.

While the adverse sequelae of HDPs are well-documented globally, data delineating their magnitude in low-resource contexts have received little systematic study. Delayed presentation and fragmented health services combined with constrained diagnostic capacity amplify the burden of HDP in SSA. Risk reduction strategies tailored to the region are therefore imperative.

This study aimed to analyse the risks of maternal and perinatal complications in HDP compared with normotensive women by examining data from a single-center patient cohort in the largest maternity hospital in Kenya.

### HELLP syndrome at… [^112WkXGb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review to evaluate the clinical presentation and maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies with early-onset HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were queried from inception through January 1, 2023 with the following terms: "HELLP syndrome", "HELLP", "hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets", "hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets syndrome", "pre-viable", "peri-viable", "previable", "periviable", "first trimester", "second trimester", "before 23 weeks", " < 23 weeks", " < 23 week gestation", and "before 23 weeks gestation". We also included an additional case from our institution.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Abstracts, unpublished studies, and review articles were excluded, yielding 46 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Methods

Two reviewers (N.S. I. and M.H.M.) performed the study selection and subsequent data extraction independently, after which the results were reviewed together. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and our study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021292692).

Results

A total of 55 patients had 58 pregnancies complicated by early-onset HELLP syndrome, including 3 with recurrent HELLP. The most common presenting signs/symptoms were abdominal pain (35/45; 78%), hypertension (32/49; 65%), nausea/vomiting (16/45; 36%), headache (13/45; 29%), and edema (8/45; 18%). Lactate dehydrogenase ≥ 600 IU/L was observed in 21 of 31 (68%) cases, whereas liver enzyme abnormalities and thrombocytopenia were reported in 48 of 51 (94%) and 50 of 54 (93%) cases, respectively. Maternal complications were encountered in 25 of 56 (45%) cases. The most common complications were hepatic (13/56; 23%), central nervous system-related (11/56; 20%), and respiratory (11/56; 20%). In 36 of 57 (63%) cases, pregnancy was terminated. Of the 21 continued pregnancies, early fetal death (at < 20 weeks' gestation) was reported in 10 (48%), stillbirth in 6 (28%), and neonatal demise in 2 (10%). Living neonates were reported in 3 of 21 (14%) cases, all delivered at 23 weeks. The perinatal mortality rate was 73% (8/11). One case (2%) reported maternal death. Antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in 14 of 29 (48%) cases.

Conclusion

Early-onset HELLP syndrome presents with symptoms similar to those observed in later gestation. Maternal complications are life-threatening, with the most common complications being hepatic, central nervous system-related, and respiratory. Fetal outcomes are poor.

### 10-year cardiovascular event risks for women who experienced hypertensive disorders in late pregnancy: the HyRAS study [^115dm2Jj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2010). Low credibility.

This concept is further supported by case-control studies by others and ourselves, demonstrating that women with a history of early preeclampsia have higher circulating concentrations of fasting insulin, lipid and coagulations factors post partum than controls matched for body mass index. These changes in vascular risk markers in women with a history of preeclampsia are part of the spectrum of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is hypothesised to be a key factor underlying cardiovascular disease and in particular coronary heart disease.

The mechanism of the link between preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease has not been clarified. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and cardiovascular disease may develop by common pathophysiologic pathways initiated by similar risk factors. Permanent vascular damage may occur during preeclampsia or gestational hypertension and subsequently contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease in later life, or cardiovascular disease is already present before pregnancy. However, determinants or risk indicators to be measured after pregnancy which would predict cardiovascular disease are lacking. Such risk indicators may identify women at risk at an early stage for them to benefit from intervention.

The concept described above is based on studies focusing on early, severe preeclampsia, which is a relatively rare disorder, while preeclampsia at (near) term is mostly mild and more common (75% of cases). Therefore, prospective evaluation of those women is required to identify cardiovascular risk indicators after hypertensive pregnancy complications at term, with the eventual aim to offer these women the opportunity for primary prevention at a relatively young age.

We propose a cohort study to establish whether women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia at term are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease in later life, and if these women are likely to benefit from tailored preventative interventions directed at modifiable cardiovascular risk indicators at a relative young age.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^111AQJSy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

HELLP, perinatal mortality and morbidity

Perinatal mortality and morbidity are considerably higher in the HELLP syndrome than that of the mothers, and are primarily dependent on the gestational age when the condition develops. The perinatal mortality rate related to the HELLP syndrome is between 7.4% and 34%. Neonates delivered before completed 32 weeks' gestation have the highest risk of perinatal death. According to Gul et al. the perinatal mortality was 34% before 32 weeks' gestation, and 8% after the 32nd gestational week. Prematurity, placental insufficiency, with or without intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abruptio placentae, are the leading causes of neonatal death. Hepatic rupture has a perinatal mortality that can reach 80%.

Neonatal thrombocytopenia occurs in between 15% and 38% of cases and is a significant risk factor for both intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and long-term neurological complications.

The neonatal outcome of the HELLP syndrome represents a controversy. Some authors report that infants born to mothers with a HELLP syndrome are more likely to be small for gestational age (SGA) and to have increased risk of perinatal asphyxia and RDS and that the respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity may be further aggravated by maternal HELLP occurring before 32 weeks' gestation. A retrospective study was published in 2003 by Roelofsen et al. on the outcome of infants born after pregnancies complicated by HELLP or ELLP syndrome. The gestational age was 29.9 in the HELLP group and 30.3 weeks in the ELLP group. 64% were born before 32 weeks' gestation. Cerebral haemorrhage occurred in 3 of the infants in the HELLP group (all had thrombocytopenia (9–42·10⁹/L), none in the ELLP group. After 18 months four infants belonging to the HELLP group had major handicaps, none in the ELLP group, making a total adverse outcome of 22.8%.

### Biomarkers and point of care screening approaches for the management of preeclampsia [^113cChgi]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current methods for detecting and treating preeclampsia

Based on the guidelines from various global organizations, preeclampsia is generally defined as a condition that occurs in pregnancy or the postpartum period, characterized primarily by new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension accompanied by evidence of end-organ injury. Specifically, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP)defines preeclampsia as gestational hypertension accompanied by proteinuria or other maternal end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation. This includes neurological complications, pulmonary edema, hematological complications, acute kidney injury (AKI), liver involvement, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)identifies preeclampsia as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with either proteinuria or other maternal organ dysfunction. This includes renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological complications, hematological complications, and uteroplacental dysfunction. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)no longer considers proteinuria a necessary sign for diagnosing preeclampsia. ACOG's guidelines focus on elevated blood pressure with either proteinuria or other complications such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual symptoms.

While definitions of preeclampsia historically focused primarily on the combination of high blood pressure and proteinuria, modern guidelines recognize a broader spectrum of symptoms and complications. These include, but are not limited to, organ dysfunction (such as renal, liver, or neurological complications), hematological issues such as HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets) syndrome, and uteroplacental dysfunction. This evolution in the definition allows for a more comprehensive and sensitive approach to diagnosing and managing preeclampsia, with the ultimate aim of improving outcomes for both pregnant people and their neonates.

Most interventions for PE primarily address advanced presentations, incorporating the use of antihypertensive drugs to control severe hypertension and prevent maternal morbidity, corticosteroids to prevent neonatal morbidity, and preterm delivery if evidence of HELLP syndrome or other end-organ dysfunction arises –. Several preventive strategies with mixed efficacy, among them the administration of aspirin prior to 16-weeks' gestation, have been suggested to potentially mitigate PE risk. However, the effectiveness of these strategies hinges on the availability of screening technologies capable of detecting PE biomarkers at the earliest gestational stages, thereby enabling timely intervention.

### Peripartum cardiomyopathy: current management and future perspectives [^112tyiQn]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

How to distinguish peripartum cardiomyopathy from other forms of pregnancy-induced heart failure

With regard to the broad range of cardiac phenotypes and time point of onset, a frequently posed question concerns how sure the diagnosis of PPCM is and if other possible forms of cardiomyopathies can be excluded.

Differences and overlaps with hypertensive complications in pregnancy

Hypertensive disorders (either new onset or superimposed on chronic hypertension) in pregnancy with the most severe forms preeclampsia and HELLP-syndrome affect up to 8% of pregnant women worldwide. Preeclampsia is a leading cause for premature delivery with high risk for maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in preeclampsia is frequently present mostly as diastolic dysfunction with raised filling pressures but normal systolic function and cardiac output. Systolic heart failure has been reported in pre-term preeclampsia often associated with proteinuria, oedema, and abnormalities of hepatic, haematological, and cerebral function. Preeclampsia and PPCM share several pathomechanisms including endothelial damage and increased serum levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1). Some cohorts of PPCM patients display a high prevalence of hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia during pregnancysuggesting that preeclampsia may predispose to PPCM. While timely delivery by an interdisciplinary team is recommended for both, severe preeclampsia and PPCM, postpartum management is quite different. For PPCM heart failure therapy for several months and years with close monitoring by a cardiologist is strongly recommended. In contrast, as symptoms resolve quickly after delivery in patients with preeclampsia, blood pressure control by antihypertensive medication is the only therapy suggested. Thus, since PPCM patients need full heart failure therapy for several months or years and since clear diagnostic discrimination between PPCM and severe gestational hypertensive complications is difficult, it would be important to monitor the postpartum course of both patient groups for optimal management.

Genetic forms of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathies

The higher incidence observed in patients with African ancestry and reports of about 16% of PPCM patients with positive familial history for heart failure suggest genetic aspects in PPCM. Indeed, subsets of PPCM patients are carriers of mutations associated with familial DCM forms. While PPCM has been defined as a non-familial and non-genetic form of heart failure, the reality shows that it is not easy to distinguish non-genetic PPCM from genetic forms of peripartum heart failure and therefore careful familial history should be taken in all PPCM patients. As genetic forms may a have a lower chance for recoverysuch information is important for risk stratification and management as well as for counselling affected families.

### Feasibility of postpartum blood pressure monitoring for hypertensive disorders in a low-resource setting [^115shEY4]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally, and Nigeria has the highest burden of maternal deaths worldwide. Approximately 10% of all pregnancies are affected by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) which include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet levels (HELLP) syndrome, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Approximately 32% of maternal deaths in Nigeria are due to HDP. Most deaths are preventable with timely implementation of evidence-based strategies.

Most maternal deaths also occur postpartum, a crucial transition phase for maternal care as it shifts from obstetricians to primary care providers and other specialists. This postpartum period, often referred to as the 4th trimester, is a critical time for monitoring and treating women at the highest risk of CV complications including cardiomyopathy, stroke, and eclampsia. Enhanced risk stratification, early detection, and comprehensive CV treatment during this postpartum period could reduce these complications. Postpartum women have significant fluctuations in blood pressure (BP) in the weeks following delivery, with peak systolic BP occurring at a median of 8 (IQR: 5–15) days postpartum, when patients are home and often unmonitored. These BP spikes are associated with hypertensive crises and increased risk of stroke and heart failure.

In 2018, the American College of Obstetricians' Presidential Taskforce on Redefining Postpartum Care released recommendations for postpartum care, including the management of HDP. These recommendations emphasized the importance of evaluating BP within specific timeframes after childbirth. Patients with severe hypertension should have their BP evaluated within 72 hours, while those with nonsevere hypertension should have it assessed no later than 7 to 10 days postpartum. Postpartum home BP-monitoring program is an effective strategy to adhere to this recommendation and have been increasingly implemented in high-income countries. However, in low- and middle-income countries like Nigeria, home BP monitoring among patients with HDP is limited. A 2021 nationwide study examining adherence to postpartum recommendations in 366 women with HDP in tertiary hospitals in Nigeria showed that only 37% of women had a BP check within 3 to 5 days, highlighting a significant gap in utilizing postpartum BP monitoring and treatment.

Pregnancy physiology and disease manifestations in RMD — Pregnancy changes may impact manifestations of RMD, including pregnancy-related increased intravascular volume that may worsen already abnormal cardiac or renal function, the expected 50% increase in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy that may worsen preexisting stable proteinuria, pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability increasing RMD-associated thrombosis risk, and calcium demand of fetal bone development and breastfeeding that may worsen maternal osteoporosis. Normal pregnancy symptoms may falsely mimic symptoms of active RMD, and pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes (preeclampsia) may be confused with lupus nephritis, scleroderma renal crisis, or vasculitis flare; HELLP syndrome or eclampsia may resemble severe disease flare.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^112UuRwv]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

2020 ISH Guideline

Sex and gender aspects

In 2020 the ISH issued a guideline report for the global management of hypertension. According to this guideline, hypertensive men 55 or older and women 65 years or older are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, in a simplified classification algorithm of the overall cardiovascular risk, it is stated that risk categories will vary according to age and sex. Regarding alcohol consumption, recommended daily consumption of alcohol is limited to 20 g and 15 g of alcohol for men and women, respectively. Beta blockers should be used in younger women with or planning pregnancy. Fibromuscular dysplasia should always be suspected in women with onset of hypertension below 30 years.

Pregnancy-related aspects

Regarding the management of hypertension during pregnancy, identifiable hypertension-related conditions are pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-existing hypertension with superimposed gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (i.e. hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome. 2020 ISH guidelines endorsed the traditional definition of preeclampsia (i.e. hypertension and proteinuria). Optimally, ambulatory BP monitoring should be used to evaluate white coat hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease during pregnancy. Women at high risk of preeclampsia should be identified and treated with 75–162 mg daily aspirin. Drug treatment initiation is reserved for persistent BP of more than 150/95 mmHg for all pregnant women; however, a threshold of 140/90 mmHg may be used in women with hypertension-mediated organ damage. Methyldopa, slow-release nifedipine, nicardipine, and labetalol are preferred to treat mild hypertension. However, methyldopa should be avoided during puerperium, due to the risk of inducing postpartum depression. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in later life.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^1121DXcu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Different definitions and classifications have up to now been used to diagnose the HELLP syndrome. This has limited the usefulness of many clinical reports. The Tennessee and Mississippi classifications are well suited to facilitate comparisons. Classifications used in future reports should be restricted to one of these.

Neither randomized trials nor Cochrane evaluations regarding delivery in women with the HELLP syndrome have been performed. In order to reduce the risk of potentially serious complications, there is consensus that early delivery is indicated when the HELLP syndrome develops after 34 weeks of pregnancy. Expectant management and the use of CS in the HELLP syndrome developed prior to 34 weeks of gestation are main controversial issues. There is no general agreement on timing of delivery and the best method of delivery. In deliveries in the time-span between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation, a standard CS course is usually recommended after stabilization of the maternal condition, followed by delivery 24 hours later. Although a maternal benefit has been demonstrated for patients with severe preeclampsia, this effect seems to be limited or lacking in patients with the HELLP syndrome. Repeated CS dosage and high-dose dexamethasone treatment can at present not be recommended. There is a definite need both in antepartum and post-partum HELLP patients for adequately sized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials regarding dosage of CS, as well as high-dose dexamethasone versus standard CS dosage. Better insight in the complex pathophysiology of the HELLP syndrome may lead to new treatment alternatives and improved clinical management. A well designed multicenter study testing the benefit of antithrombin to counteract DIC in the HELLP syndrome should be encouraged.

Background

The disease

Preeclampsia is defined as de novo development of hypertension (> 140/90 mmHg) in combination with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation in pregnant women. One of the most severe forms of this disease is called the HELLP syndrome, which is derived from the acronyms of the symptoms (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets).

Preeclampsia (also termed early-onset preeclampsia) and HELLP syndrome may be life-threatening for both mother and child. In the mother, these disorders predispose to premature cardiovascular disorders such as chronic hypertension, ischemic heart disease and stroke later in life. Studies in children, born after preeclamptic pregnancies and who were relatively small at birth, have shown an increased risk of stroke in adult life, an increased risk of coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome. Preeclampsia and especially HELLP syndrome are perceived by patients and their partners as a highly traumatic life event, both during and after pregnancy.

In the United States and Europe, the prevalence of clinically relevant preeclampsia is approximately 2% of all pregnancies, with HELLP syndrome complicating preeclampsia approximately in 10 to 20% of the cases. Maternal mortality rate in the Netherlands due to hypertensive disease during pregnancy amounts to 4.0 per 100,000 live births in 1993–2002.

Although several risk factors have been identified, it is difficult to develop effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders. Strategies applied nowadays are diverse and include antenatal surveillance, modification of lifestyle, dietary interventions and pharmacological therapy. In the last two decades, clinical guidelines for the management of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome have been adopted in most developed countries.

Clinical management of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome depends on the gestational age at onset, severity of symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, size and condition of the unborn infant, disease progression and response to symptomatic treatment.

Mild preeclampsia is usually managed expectantly, as opposed to the management of severe preeclampsia which is more pro-active consisting of the administration or magnesium sulphate, often combined with antihypertensives. When gestational age is less than 34 weeks and both maternal and fetal condition are satisfactory, it is usually recommended to prolong pregnancy for at least 48 hours to benefit optimally from the enhancing effect of corticosteroid administration on fetal lung maturation. Fetal surveillance is an important component of the management. Delivery is the only causal treatment and therefore, the management of choice from 37 weeks' gestation onward.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112G3KYw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — including superimposed preeclampsia — clinical features and prevention/treatment: Preeclampsia, a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome, is an HDP characterized by hypertension plus proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and it develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (termed superimposed preeclampsia). Severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia is the occurrence of convulsive seizures, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk, while pravastatin has been investigated only in small studies and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Maternal myocardial dysfunction after hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome: a speckle-tracking study [^116yKSjv]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE) and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases later in life. Subclinical cardiac alterations precede eminent CV diseases. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is an effective method to assess subclinical myocardial dysfunction. We performed a myocardial speckle tracking study to investigate the prevalence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in former PE patients (with and without HELLP syndrome) compared to normotensive women affected by HELLP syndrome.

Methods

In this cross-sectional retrospective study, women with a history of normotensive HELLP (n = 32), PE without HELLP (n = 59), and PE with HELLP (n = 101) underwent conventional and STE as part of the clinical CV work-up after their complicated pregnancies from 6months to 4years postpartum. We excluded women with comorbidities, including chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity.

Results

Women with a history of PE with HELLP syndrome were characterized by a higher prevalence of altered left ventricular circumferential and global longitudinal two-dimensional (2D) strain (74 and 20%, respectively), altered right ventricular longitudinal 2D strain (37%), and left atrial (LA) 2D strain (57%). Moreover, a higher proportion of alterations of biventricular and LA strains was also present in former PE without HELLP as well as in the normotensive HELLP group.

Conclusions

In the first years after a pregnancy complicated by HELLP syndrome, irrespective of whether there was concomitant PE, a higher rate of abnormal STE myocardial function is observed. Therefore, these women may benefit from CV risk management.

### Maternal myocardial dysfunction after hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome: a speckle-tracking study [^115LHK22]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pre-eclampsia (PE) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome characterize as a subtype of PE which complicates 0.2–0.8% of pregnancies. However, its definition remains still controversial: some investigators classify the syndrome as a special type of severe PE with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, others as a mere complication of PE. Previous reports have linked PE and HELLP syndrome with a persistent post-partum impairment in cardiac geometry and systo-diastolic function, making cardiac monitoring essential in this setting. The use of relatively new diagnostic techniques, such as speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), may have potential benefits in additional cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification rather than conventional tools to better delineate maternal cardiac performance status. STE provides an objective quantification of myocardial deformation evaluated in all spatial directions independently from both the angle of insonation and cardiac translational movements. It may reduce inter- and intraobserver variability in assessing regional left ventricular (LV) function improving health care cost-effectiveness through the early identification of subclinical diseases.

To date, a paucity of data exists about CV sequelae of HELLP syndrome. In particular, it is unknown whether the subclinical cardiac abnormalities documented after HELLP syndrome complicating PE, are also present in women who had a normotensive form of the same syndrome. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that women with a history of normotensive HELLP syndrome exhibit subclinical cardiac impairment similar to that of women after HELLP syndrome superimposed to PE, by means of STE.

Women with a history of preeclampsia (n = 60) or HELLP syndrome (n = 49) and matched healthy controls (n = 60) underwent transthoracic echocardiography at 6 months to 4 years after delivery. Aortic M-mode and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) parameters were measured. Aortic diameters were assessed at end-diastole at four levels: Valsalva sinuses, sinotubular junction, tubular tract, and aortic arch. Aortic compliance, distensibility, stiffness index, Peterson's elastic modulus, pulse-wave velocity, and M-mode strain were calculated using standard formulae. Aortic expansion velocity, early and late diastolic retraction velocities, and peak systolic tissue strain (TDI-ε) were determined. VAC was defined as the ratio between aortic elastance (Ea) and left ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees). All women were free from cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

Women with a history of HELLP syndrome showed larger aortas than those with previous preeclampsia or controls, probably related to a higher blood pressure. Aortic elastic properties, including Ea, were similar between HELLP and preeclampsia groups, even comparing cases with early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP. In contrast, Ees was more impaired in the HELLP group than in the other two. Consequently, about one-quarter of women who experienced HELLP syndrome had a pathological VAC, whereas only 5% of previously preeclamptic patients did. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between HELLP syndrome and VAC, whereas other parameters including aortic compliance, distensibility, stiffness index, and elastic modulus are linked only to gestational age at preeclampsia onset, ad also Ea and Ees did.

Conclusions

We found a significant overlap between the aortic elastic properties in women with a history of preeclampsia and those with a previous HELLP syndrome, suggesting a common pathophysiologic pathway. However, women who experienced HELLP syndrome showed a higher blood pressure than other cases and controls, probably determining larger aortas. In addition, VAC was more altered in the HELLP group than in the others because of a higher Ea and a lower Ees.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116bACZ8]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy — definitions and diagnostic thresholds are specified as follows: Normotension requires no hypertension before pregnancy with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. Chronic hypertension is defined by a hypertension diagnosis before pregnancy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and must be diagnosed before 20 wk of gestation. Gestational hypertension occurs with no hypertension before pregnancy; SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart; and is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation. Preeclampsia consists of gestational hypertension plus proteinuria or evidence of other organ dysfunction (thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or severe headache or visual symptoms), is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation, and may occur postpartum. Mild to moderate hypertension is SBP 140–159 mm Hg or DBP 90–109 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart. Severe hypertension is SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements 15 min apart. Superimposed preeclampsia is preeclampsia in a patient with a history of hypertension before pregnancy or before 20 wk of gestation and may occur postpartum. HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia with evidence of hemolysis and associated elevations in liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, may have atypical presentation without hypertension or proteinuria, and may occur postpartum. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia with generalized seizures and encephalopathy, may have atypical presentation without preceding hypertension, and may occur postpartum.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^114gh5RE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Periviable birth — maternal health considerations and cesarean risks: Preterm birth is frequently associated with fetal malpresentation, making the choice of cesarean delivery a common issue; earlier cesarean delivery is associated with a higher likelihood of a vertical uterine incision (classical hysterotomy), which has more frequent perioperative morbidities than low transverse cesarean delivery and leads to recommendations for repeat cesarean delivery, and periviable cesarean delivery is associated with increased risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy; beyond procedure-related risks, maternal morbidity and mortality may also arise from decisions not to intervene, such as expectant management after preterm premature rupture of membranes causing maternal infection or severe preeclampsia progressing to hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, underscoring the need to weigh risks in the context of parents' goals of care, potential for newborn survival with immediate delivery, likelihood of latency to improve newborn outcomes, and the possibility of severe adverse maternal outcomes with attempted pregnancy prolongation.

### Value of proteinuria in evaluating the severity of HELLP and its maternal and neonatal outcomes [^114gD5L8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The researchers have classified the cases of preeclampsia with hemolysis, or elevated liver enzymes, or thrombocytopenia as atypical HELLP syndrome, thus suggesting that advanced age, multiple births, hepatitis B virus infection and obesity are potential risk factors for atypical HELLP syndrome. HELLP refers to a disease involving multiple organ systems of the whole body. Besides the liver and kidney, which are the most frequently involved organs, cardiovascular, nervous, blood and other multiple systems will exhibit relevant pathophysiological changes. In the atypical preeclampsia (e.g. pregnancy-induced hypertension with microangiopathy/hemolysis, proteinuria with microangiopathy/hemolysis, preeclampsia or preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome 48 h after delivery, preeclampsia or preeclampsia or Hellp syndrome before 20 weeks' gestation), 96% of the patients were initially referred for vasospasm symptoms (e.g. headache, visual impairment, hearing impairment, and gastrointestinal symptoms). Besides, nearly one-third of the cases had fetal growth restriction, the decreased levels of placental growth factor (PLGF) were correlated with early onset preeclampsia and adverse pregnancy outcomes. As a relatively special HELLP, the diagnosis of protein-free HELLP is primarily dependent on the damage of other target organs, which is often accompanied by the abnormal performance of vital organs. The deterioration potential of its adverse outcome cannot be ignored due to the low level of urine protein. To achieve the objective of clinical postpartum management, aiming to improve the symptoms of puerperant women, HELLP syndrome will improve significantly in 48 h after delivery, such that the patient's vital signs and various laboratory indicators should be closely monitored. Patients with postpartum rebound or aggravation of their condition and with postpartum HELLP syndrome should be given symptomatic treatment actively (e.g. aggressive blood pressure control, magnesium sulfate prevention of eclampsia, fluid and electrolyte management, glucocorticoid treatment, blood transfusion and even plasma exchange, and prevention of deep vein thrombosis embolism).

### Hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity in the US, 2015–2019 [^113aBTSH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study found a 17.6-fold increased risk of developing cvSMM in the context of HELLP syndrome. Although an association between HDP and cvSMM has previously been identified, we herein describe a graded relationship with HDP subtype severity, which highlights the prominent association of HELLP syndrome with cvSMM. This observed association may be explained by the presence of microvascular dysfunction in both HELLP syndrome and cvSMM. Indeed, dysfunction in the hepatic microcirculation, initiated by vasoactive factors and inflammatory cytokines, is a proposed mechanism for liver injury characterizing HELLP syndrome and coronary microvascular alterations in patients with preeclampsia. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with microvascular endothelial dysfunction are observed in the context of HDP in women with preeclampsia and neurologic manifestations (including eclampsia and PRES), which may precede the development of pregnancy-associated stroke. Our findings support the concept that individuals who go on to develop cvSMM in the context of HDP, and particularly HELLP syndrome, may represent a subset of patients with more pronounced systemic vascular dysfunction in the acute phase of HDP, potentially underlying the lifelong increased risk of cardiovascular disease after HDP.

This investigation found that the association between all HDP subtypes (except gestational hypertension) and cvSMM was more pronounced than their association with overall SMM. This may in part be explained by the fact that SMM as a composite outcome includes a heterogeneous set of conditions representing dysfunction from multiple organ systems, and that this outcome measure may be less specific to HDP. Understanding the risk of SMM in general through the use of risk assessment tools, is a promising means to identify individuals who may benefit from delivery at designated health centers with higher levels of maternal care. However, improving the characterization of cvSMM risk could lead to more specific mitigation strategies. Accordingly, our findings delineate a differential risk of cvSMM according to HDP subtype, which supports the need to develop and evaluate cardiovascular interventions tailored to HDP subtypes during the acute setting. Patients with HDP subtypes at higher risk for cvSMM may benefit from proactive preventative strategies, including: intensive blood pressure treatment to achieve blood pressure targets and prevent severe hypertension, inpatient monitoring protocols during the early postpartum period, enhanced outpatient monitoring of blood pressure and clinical symptoms, and comprehensive and regular postpartum cardiovascular health assessments. Furthermore, reducing the burden of acute cvSMM may be an important strategy to improve the long-term cardiovascular outcomes of persons with HDP.

### Maternal myocardial dysfunction after hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome: a speckle-tracking study [^111FMk9Z]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE) and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases later in life. Subclinical cardiac alterations precede eminent CV diseases. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is an effective method to assess subclinical myocardial dysfunction. We performed a myocardial speckle tracking study to investigate the prevalence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in former PE patients (with and without HELLP syndrome) compared to normotensive women affected by HELLP syndrome.

Methods:

In this cross-sectional retrospective study, women with a history of normotensive HELLP (n = 32), PE without HELLP (n = 59), and PE with HELLP (n = 101) underwent conventional and STE as part of the clinical CV work-up after their complicated pregnancies from 6 months to 4 years postpartum. We excluded women with comorbidities, including chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity.

Results:

Women with a history of PE with HELLP syndrome were characterized by a higher prevalence of altered left ventricular circumferential and global longitudinal two-dimensional (2D) strain (74 and 20%, respectively), altered right ventricular longitudinal 2D strain (37%), and left atrial (LA) 2D strain (57%). Moreover, a higher proportion of alterations of biventricular and LA strains was also present in former PE without HELLP as well as in the normotensive HELLP group.

Conclusions:

In the first years after a pregnancy complicated by HELLP syndrome, irrespective of whether there was concomitant PE, a higher rate of abnormal STE myocardial function is observed. Therefore, these women may benefit from CV risk management.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^113BFpov]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been known for a long time that preeclampsia may be associated with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia. Weinstein regarded signs and symptoms to constitute an entity separated from severe preeclampsia and in 1982 named the condition HELLP (H = Haemolysis, EL = Elevated Liver enzymes, LP = Low Platelets) syndrome. The HELLP is currently regarded as a variant of severe preeclampsia or a complication.

Diagnosis of the complete form of the HELLP syndrome requires the presence of all 3 major components, while partial or incomplete HELLP syndrome consists of only 1 or 2 elements of the triad (H or EL or LP).

The HELLP syndrome, a serious condition in its complete form, is associated with substantial risk for the mother and her foetus. A wide range of complications may arise and the condition represents diagnostic and therapeutic problems; timing and method of delivery are important.

The aim of this review is to present an update on maternal clinical issues of the syndrome, with special focus on diagnosis, complications, surveillance, timing and mode of delivery and risk of recurrence. Perinatal mortality and morbidity are briefly outlined and controversial aspects of corticosteroid (CS) treatment are particularly discussed.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^113g9Q9q]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) including pregnancy‐induced hypertension, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count), occur in almost 10% of gestations and are a major cause of maternal death. Preeclampsia, a multi‐organ pregnancy disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and multi‐organ hypoperfusion, occurs in 3–4% of gestations in the Western world. Any HDP is a marker of future CV disease (CVD) risk including cerebral vascular accidents, cardiac atherosclerotic event, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and cardiac death with a dose effect risk resulting in the highest risk being present in early‐ and preterm‐ preeclampsia. Conventional risk factors for heart failure include hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and renal disease, all of which are highly present after HDP. Worse profiles in CV risk continue as early as 1 year postpartum after preeclampsia including higher levels of blood pressure (BP), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, markers of insulin resistance and body mass index (BMI). Hypertension after preeclampsia explained 64% of the increased risk of CAD and 49% of the increased risk of heart failure in these women.

Screening

There is general agreement that women who suffered from HDP should undergo CV screening starting as early as possible to make women aware of their increased CV risk and allow appropriate prevention. Although the exact modality of screening and protocol of intervention has not been standardized, mainly due to limited available evidence‐based clinical research on antenatal and postnatal care, recent evidence suggests a potential role for early BP control with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether this will result in improved reverse remodelling and prevention of heart failure is subject for future research. Established and cost‐effective prevention strategies should be implemented in regular clinical care.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and risk of preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157SJT1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and the risk for preeclampsia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, POPLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, and the World Health Organization COVID-19, Chinese, and preprint databases (all from December 1, 2019, to May 31, 2021). Google Scholar, bibliographies, and conference proceedings were also searched.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Observational studies that assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and preeclampsia and that reported unadjusted and/or adjusted risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals or data to calculate them.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The primary outcome was preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes included preeclampsia with severe features, preeclampsia without severe features, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Two reviewers independently reviewed studies for inclusion, assessed their risk of bias, and extracted data. Pooled unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and 95% prediction interval were calculated. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic, for which I² ≥ 30% indicated substantial heterogeneity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the overall findings.

Results

A total of 28 studies comprising 790,954 pregnant women, among which 15,524 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of unadjusted odds ratios showed that the odds of developing preeclampsia were significantly higher among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection than among those without SARS-CoV-2 infection (7.0% vs 4.8%; pooled odds ratio, 1.62; 95% confidence interval, 1.45–1.82; P < .00001; I² = 17%; 26 studies; 95% prediction interval of the odds ratio, 1.28–2.05). The meta-analysis of adjusted odds ratios also showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was associated with a significant increase in the odds of preeclampsia (pooled odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.39–1.80; P < .0001; I² = 0%; 11 studies). There was a statistically significant increase in the odds of preeclampsia with severe features (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–2.63; I² = 58%; 7 studies), eclampsia (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–3.84; I² = 0%, 3 studies), and HELLP syndrome (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.48–2.97; 1 study) among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared to those without the infection. Overall, the direction and magnitude of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy on preeclampsia was consistent across most prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections significantly increased the odds of developing preeclampsial; however, it was higher among patients with symptomatic illness (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.59–2.81) than among those with asymptomatic illness (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.10).

Conclusion

SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is associated with higher odds of preeclampsia.

### Preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease death: prospective evidence from the child health and development studies cohort [^116rXWi9]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

This study prospectively investigates the contribution of pregnancy complications and other reproductive age risk factors on the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease death. Participants were 14 403 women in the Child Health and Development Studies pregnancy cohort drawn from the Kaiser Permanente Health Plan in California. Only women with nonmissing parity and no previously diagnosed heart conditions were included. A total of 481 had observed preeclampsia, and 266 died from cardiovascular disease. The median age at enrollment was 26 years, and the median follow-up time was 37 years. Cardiovascular disease death was determined by linkage with the California Department of Vital Statistics. Observed preeclampsia was independently associated with cardiovascular disease death (mutually adjusted hazard ratio: 2.14 [95% CI: 1.29 to 3.57]). The risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease death was notably higher among women with onset of preeclampsia by 34 weeks of gestation (hazard ratio: 9.54 [95% CI: 4.50 to 20.26]). At 30 years of follow-up and a median age of 56 years, the cumulative cardiovascular disease death survival for women with early preeclampsia was 85.9% compared with 98.3% for women with late preeclampsia and 99.3% for women without preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease death later in life, independent of other measured risk factors. These findings reinforce previously reported recommendations that a history of preeclampsia should be used to target women at risk for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, women with preeclampsia earlier in pregnancy may be particularly at risk for cardiovascular disease death and could be targeted for early and intensive screening and intervention.

### HELLP syndrome: a rare, early presentation at 17 weeks of gestation [^116cWZrd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome before 20 weeks of gestation is extremely rare. This condition has been reported in only few cases, and always in conjunction with other comorbidities such as fetal triploidy and the antiphospholipid syndrome.

Case

A 24-year-old woman was admitted at 15 weeks and 3 days of gestation with uncontrollable hypertension and proteinuria. An extensive workup did not reveal any underlying medical or obstetric conditions. Within 11 days of admission her condition deteriorated and the diagnosis of severe HELLP syndrome was supported by the findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and severe thrombocytopenia, all of which resolved after termination of the pregnancy.

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in women presenting with clinical manifestations or laboratory abnormalities consistent with this diagnosis, even before 20 weeks of gestation.

### Cardiovascular sequelae of preeclampsia / eclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analyses [^113vjmVd]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia affects 3% to 5% of gestations and eclampsia 0.05% to 0.93%, but their subsequent cardiovascular sequelae are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine if women with a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia are at increased risk of long-term cardiovascular sequelae.

Methods

From Medline and Embase searches, we included case-control and cohort studies that examined cardiac, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease, or cardiovascular mortality > 6 weeks postpartum, in women with and without a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia and that controlled for or matched for confounders. Two independent reviewers determined study eligibility and extracted data.

Results

Five case-control and 10 cohort studies met eligibility criteria, with a total of 116,175 women with and 2,259,576 women without preeclampsia/eclampsia. Most studies focused on women < 56 years of age. Relative to women with uncomplicated pregnancies, women with a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia had an increased risk of subsequent cardiac disease in both the case-control studies (odds ratio 2.47, 95% CI 1.22–5.01) and the cohort studies (relative risk [RR] 2.33, 1.95–2.78), as well as an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease (RR 2.03, 1.54–2.67), peripheral arterial disease (RR 1.87, 0.94–3.73), and cardiovascular mortality (RR 2.29, 1.73–3.04). Meta-regression revealed a graded relationship between the severity of preeclampsia/eclampsia and the risk of cardiac disease (mild: RR 2.00, 1.83–2.19, moderate: RR 2.99, 2.51–3.58, severe: RR 5.36, 3.96–7.27, P < .0001).

Conclusions

Women with a history of preeclampsia/eclampsia have approximately double the risk of early cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease, and cardiovascular mortality. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms underlying these associations and to identify effective prevention strategies.

### Peripartum cardiomyopathy: current management and future perspectives [^116r73TZ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease affects around 4% of all pregnancies in Western industrialized countries with increasing tendencies. Even in the absence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease pregnancy complications such as hypertensive complications, i.e.g.estational hypertension and its more severe forms preeclampsia, the HELLP syndrome (H: haemolysis, EL: elevated liver enzymes, LP: low platelet count), and peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) may induce cardiovascular disease. – In addition, previously unrecognized genetic forms of cardiomyopathies can be demasked by pregnancy stress – and latent cardiac viral infection can be activated in pregnancy as a cause for myocarditis.

Pregnancy, delivery, and the peripartum period provide a challenge to the entire maternal organism, as they are associated with weight gain, oedema, physical discomfort, fatigue, and breathlessness. Therefore, understanding normal pregnancy is important for the timely recognition of cardiovascular pathologies to distinguish the peripartum discomfort in healthy women from signs of cardiovascular disease. This is a major challenge for physicians, midwives, and patients and may explain why diagnosis of peripartum heart failure is frequently delayed and still underestimated.

Here we summarize the current knowledge on aetiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology of PPCM in comparison with normal physiological changes in pregnancy and with related pathologies, specifically preeclampsia, myocarditis, and genetic forms of cardiomyopathies. Furthermore, we discuss state-of-the-art treatment options, prognosis, and management of PPCM.

### Hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity in the US, 2015–2019 [^113gEzBR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The incidence of severe maternal morbidity (SMM)-and particularly cardiovascular SMM (cvSMM), the first cause of pregnancy-related mortality-has been rising in North America. Although hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are common, their association with cvSMM specifically remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the association between individual subtypes of HDP and cvSMM, in addition to overall SMM, in a large, nationally representative sample.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A population-based cohort study using the United States National Inpatient Sample was conducted. Individuals with obstetric deliveries between 2015 and 2019 were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2023 to February 2024.

Exposure

HDP subtypes included gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia without severe features, severe preeclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet) syndrome.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of cvSMM (including conditions such as pulmonary edema, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction) and the secondary outcome was a composite of overall SMM (including cvSMM and other conditions such as respiratory failure, severe postpartum hemorrhage, and sepsis). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for the association between HDP subtypes and the outcomes were estimated using modified Poisson regression models adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

Among 15 714 940 obstetric deliveries, 2 045 089 (13.02%) had HDP, 23 445 (0.15%) were affected by cvSMM, and 282 160 (1.80%) were affected by SMM. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was of 29 (6) years. The incidence of cvSMM was higher in participants with HDP than those without HDP (0.48% [9770 of 2 045 089] vs 0.10% [13 680 of 13 669 851]; P < .001). Participants with HELLP syndrome had the highest risk for cvSMM (aRR, 17.55 [95% CI, 14.67–21.01]), followed by severe preeclampsia (aRR, 9.11 [95% CI, 8.26–10.04]), and chronic hypertension (aRR, 3.57 [95% CI, 3.15–4.05]). Although HDP subtypes were also associated with overall SMM, the association with HELLP syndrome (aRR, 9.94 [95% CI, 9.44–10.45]), severe preeclampsia (aRR, 3.66 [95% CI, 3.55–3.78]), and chronic hypertension (aRR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.88–2.03]) was attenuated compared with cvSMM.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, a graded relationship by severity characterized the association between HDP and cvSMM. Although all HDP subtypes were associated with an increased risk of overall SMM, the risk was more pronounced for cvSMM.

### Risk factors for chronic hypertension 5 years after a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114MiP7D]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Summary of findings

In this review, we describe the risk factors associated with the development of chronic hypertension in women with preeclampsia 5 years after pregnancy. Our comprehensive search and analysis revealed 32 possible risk factors, of which 14 showed a positive association with increased risk for the development of chronic hypertension: a higher BMI or blood pressure during the preconception or postpartum period, increased LVMi or IVST at postpartum assessment, eoPE (< 34 weeks gestational age), preterm preeclampsia (< 37 weeks), GDM, presence of decidual vasculopathy, and subsequent pregnancies affected by preeclampsia. No associations were found for preconceptional smoking and exercise, fetal birth weight, perinatal death, HELLP syndrome, eclampsia, liver parameters, and total cholesterol measured before pregnancy, or measures for glucose homeostasis, renal function, and HDL cholesterol or triglyceride postpartum. The literature is inconclusive regarding the association between maternal age, preterm birth, severe preeclampsia, and postpartum measured TC and LDL cholesterol levels with chronic hypertension after pregnancy.

Interpretation and comparison with existing literature

established risk factors for chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease

Our findings align with the broader literature on established cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors that identifies obesity and type 2 diabetes as significant risk factors for chronic hypertension.

Although our study found no association between smoking and lack of physical exercise with chronic hypertension after preeclampsia, the well documented effects of these behaviors on overall cardiovascular health suggest a latent risk that may not surface within the immediate postpartum period but could contribute cumulatively over time.

Dyslipidemia is traditionally associated with an increased risk of chronic hypertension. Our review yielded inconclusive results regarding LDL and total cholesterol in patients with a history of preeclampsia and risk of later chronic hypertension and no associations for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

Additionally, the increased risk of chronic hypertension after preeclampsia observed in individuals with familial predispositions underscores the genetic component of chronic hypertension. In our review, we included one study that investigated a specific genetic polymorphism; however, it found no association with development of chronic hypertension after preeclampsia.

As a result, of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease, maternal BMI, preexisting diabetes, and familial cardiovascular disease showed the greatest potential for inclusion in risk assessment models.

Postpartum screening for cardiovascular risk

Candidates for screening and recommendations are shown in Figures 5 and 6. Unfortunately for many, a pregnancy history is not uniformly obtained and development of incident hypertension and other CV risk factors may be missed. Novel approaches to improve patient participation include maternal health clinics, use of ancillary support services (Doulas/Cocoon clinics), telehealth visits, text messaging support for BP monitoring and diabetes screening.,

How should we screen women after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy? Screening considerations for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. A general cardiovascular risk assessment should be made of women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The transfer of care to well prevention from obstetrics and gynaecology typically occurs by 6 weeks. Subsequent screening performed at 6 and 12 months. This should include usual risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) including prior cardiovascular events, presence of chronic hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, physical inactivity, family history of CVD, mitigating factors such as breast feeding, physical parameters (body mass index [BMI], blood pressure [BP], waist circumference) and laboratory parameters including lipids, glucose/glycated haemoglobin and urine protein/creatinine ratio.

### Diagnosis, controversies, and management of the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [^113oQpW2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome has been recognized as a complication of preeclampsia-eclampsia for decades. Recognition of this syndrome in women with preeclampsia is increasing because of the frequency of blood test results that reveal unexpected thrombocytopenia or elevated liver enzymes. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome requires the presence of hemolysis based on examination of the peripheral smear, elevated indirect bilirubin levels, or low serum haptoglobin levels in association with significant elevation in liver enzymes and a platelet count below 100,000/mm(3) after ruling out other causes of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The presence of this syndrome is associated with increased risk of adverse outcome for both mother and fetus. During the past 15 years, several retrospective and observational studies and a few randomized trials have been published in an attempt to refine the diagnostic criteria, to identify risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome, and to treat women with this syndrome. Despite the voluminous literature, the diagnosis and management of this syndrome remain controversial. Recent studies suggest that some women with partial HELLP syndrome may be treated with expectant management or corticosteroid therapy. This review will emphasize the controversies surrounding the diagnosis and management of this syndrome. Recommendation for diagnosis, management, and counseling of these women is also provided based on results of recent studies and my own clinical experience.

### A narrative synthesis of factors that affect women speaking up about early warning signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and responses of healthcare staff [^117N6Zb5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a major obstetric problem affecting 2–8% of pregnancies and is a leading global cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. It is a pregnancy specific disease characterised by de-novo development of concurrent hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes progressing into a multisystem disorder. The potential adverse perinatal outcomes include intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and fetal death. If untreated, pre-eclampsia can develop into eclampsia when maternal seizures develop. HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated liver enzymes and Low Platelet) is regarded as a variant of severe pre-eclampsia and can occur in 10–20% of cases with severe pre-eclampsia.

The incidence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia varies internationally. Eclampsia is is more common in developing countries than in high income countries. For example, in Latin America and the Caribbean hypertensive disorders are responsible for around 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to around 9% of deaths. The incidence of pre-eclampsia is reported to have increased in the USA, which may be related to an increased prevalence of predisposing factors such as chronic hypertension, diabetes and obesity.

For the purposes of this synthesis pre-eclampsia was defined as "a combination of a new hypertension and proteinuria and typically occurs after 20 weeks gestation". Severe pre-eclampsia is pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension and/or symptoms and/or biochemical and/or haematological impairment and eclampsia is defined as a convulsive condition associated with pre-eclampsia which can also present for the first time in the postnatal period. For purposes of brevity in the remainder of the paper the term pre-eclampsia should also be understood to include severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia unless otherwise indicated.

One of the challenges for treating pre-eclampsia and preventing further deterioration is determining how best to enable early detection. If women or their partners and families are able to raise early warnings about potential signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy, birth and the postnatal period, they may be able to receive appropriate intervention to prevent onset of severe pre-eclampsia from developing. Early warning signs of severe pre-eclampsia, which can deteriorate very quickly, include specific physical symptoms such as severe headaches that does not resolve with simple painkillers, problems with vision, such as blurring or flashing before the eyes, severe pain just below the ribs, heartburn that does not resolve with antacids, rapidly increasing swelling of the face, hands or feet and feeling very unwell.

### HELLP syndrome: a diagnostic conundrum with severe complications [^114UqGx5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is believed to be part of the spectrum of pre-eclampsia, which falls within the category of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Maternal and fetal complications are more severe in HELLP as opposed to pre-eclampsia alone. We describe a 26-year-old primigravida woman with no medical history who presents with signs of HELLP with marked transaminitis and mild disseminated intravascular coagulation at 35weeks of gestation who required emergent delivery of the fetus; the patient also sustained acute kidney injury requiring continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and a prolonged intensive care unit admission. Remarkably, with supportive care, all laboratory derangements, including renal function, normalised after 4weeks. We discuss the diagnostic conundrum when faced with the possible diagnosis of HELLP in discriminating from its many imitators in order to assume proper treatment.

### Ethnic, geographical and altitude considerations and maternal mortality associated with HELLP syndrome in Ecuador: a population-based cohort study [^114VgUnH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

HELLP (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low platelet count) syndrome is a rare pregnancy complication, considered a variant or a complication of pre-eclampsia. It is characterised by the presence of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and a low platelet count, which can lead to liver and kidney failure, bleeding and even death for both the mother and the foetus. The pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve abnormal activation of coagulation and complement systems, oxidative stress and inflammation. Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. According to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), eclampsia and pre-eclampsia were identified as the third cause of maternal death in the country after pre-existing chronic diseases and postpartum haemorrhage. However, HELLP syndrome has been less studied than these two conditions in epidemiological terms, not only in Latin American countries but worldwide. The main reason behind this lack of epidemiological studies is the low incidence of the disease, leading to the use of small datasets. There are several well-known risks associated with HELLP syndrome (e.g. history of hypertension and cardiovascular problems, maternal age, diabetes, obesity and null parity). A recent Canadian-based population study by Lisonkova et al. brought valuable information. They pointed out that living in a rural area is a risk factor, which is consistent with previous studies, and that nulliparous women living more than 1 h from obstetric units have a 50% increased risk of HELLP syndrome.

### Placental syndromes and long-term risk of hypertension [^112T7qKV]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Higher blood pressure prior to pregnancy is associated with increased risk of placental abruption, hypertension and preeclampsia, preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction. These conditions are jointly termed placental syndromes as they are characterised by impaired placentation and early placental vascularization. Placental syndromes are associated with an increased maternal risk of progression to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life. Women affected by both a clinical placental syndrome and with evidence of placental maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) have a particularly high risk of hypertension and CVD. Yet whether placental impairment and clinical syndromes are causes or consequences of higher blood pressure in women remains unclear. In this review, we address the relationship between blood pressure and maternal health in pregnancy. We conclude that there is a pressing need for studies with a range of detailed measures of cardiac and vascular structure and function taken before, during and after pregnancy to solve the 'chicken and egg' puzzle of women's blood pressure and pregnancy health, and to inform effective precision medicine prevention and treatment of both placental syndromes and chronic hypertension in women.

### Hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity in the US, 2015–2019 [^115eNt4j]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study had several strengths. The recent study period allowed for a contemporaneous overview of the relationship between HDP and cvSMM, addressing an important and unmet clinical need. Moreover, the use of ICD-10-CM coding enabled us to distinguish HELLP syndrome from other HDP subtypes, thereby highlighting its pivotal contribution to adverse cardiovascular outcomes at delivery. Using a large, representative sample, we identified novel significant associations between HDP and relatively rare outcomes among a diverse patient population, increasing the generalizability of our findings.

Limitations

Our study had limitations. First, this administrative dataset did not include detailed clinical information which may be associated with cvSMM and overall SMM, such as body mass index, the presence of cardiovascular signs and symptoms, and echocardiographic and other imaging or laboratory results. Moreover, the dataset did not allow for linkage of consecutive hospitalizations per patient. As such, recurrent deliveries could not be assessed, and postpartum readmissions could not be evaluated. In addition, the extent to which misclassification bias of exposures and outcomes may have affected our results is not known. For instance, cases of eclampsia, an outcome measure associated with HDP by definition, may have been misclassified as unexposed to HDP. Moreover, as definitions for severe preeclampsia may include cvSMM outcomes (eg, pulmonary edema), some cvSMM events may be underreported. As a result, the associations observed in our study may have been attenuated. Although the association between HDP at delivery and postpartum adverse cardiovascular outcomes has been examined, additional research evaluating this association in the postpartum period at a national scale is required. Additionally, future work to better characterize the complex relationship between cardiometabolic risk factors (including obesity and weight gain across the pregnancy continuum), severity of HDP phenotypes, and cvSMM, would be needed.

### Pregnancy history at 40 Years of age as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^114eyjWJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data Sharing

The data belong to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and are available only to researchers who have applied for the data at the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Restrictions apply to the availability of the data according to the license from the Regional Committee on Medical and Health Research Ethics. Data are, however, available from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway upon reasonable request and with permission from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (access to data, Norwegian Institute of Public Health [fhi.no]).

Data Sources

Pregnancy data are from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Since 1967, the registry has collected data from all births after 16 weeks of gestation. Data include demographic, medical, and reproductive history, prepregnancy, and prenatal information from the antenatal chart, complications during pregnancy and delivery, and fetal and infant outcomes. Since 1999, the Medical Birth Registry notification form also includes information on smoking, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, and ultrasound‐based gestational age.

Using the Medical Birth Registry, we restricted analysis to women born from 1945 onward who had reached 40 years of age. The vast majority of women have finished their reproduction by 40 years of age (97%). These women were linked to their first, second, third, and fourth singleton deliveries (live and stillbirths) using their personal identification number. We used the Population Registry to identify women born from 1945 onward who had no recorded pregnancies. Information on cause of death was obtained from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry, whereas information on education was obtained from Statistics Norway.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^114J6jbA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

During pregnancy, hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. Severe hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have endorsed a lower threshold for diagnosing hypertension in non‐pregnant patients (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg). Some have suggested that this definition may also be appropriate for pregnant patients. However, use of the lower threshold has not been widely studied, would increase the incidence of hypertension in pregnancy by about 10%, and could increase potentially unnecessary testing, hospitalization, and intervention in the absence of a proven benefit. The clinical importance of distinguishing preeclampsia from other HDP, namely, chronic and gestational hypertension, relates to its greater risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Traditional and revised definition of preeclampsia

The traditional definition of preeclampsia refers to the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum. However, it is well recognized that many women with chronic or gestational hypertension still suffer from complications associated with preeclampsia such as pulmonary oedema, placental abruption, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small‐for‐gestational‐age infants, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.

To better reflect the risk of adverse pregnancy complications among women with a HDP, the definition of preeclampsia has been revised to include cases without proteinuria but with evidence of maternal end‐organ or uteroplacental dysfunction. This 'broad' definition has now been adopted by most national and international clinical practice guidelines. Several subtypes of preeclampsia exist (Table 1), with a variety of pathophysiological pathways leading to maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. The clinical features overlap, but the spectrum of disease and outcomes differ: early‐onset disease has been associated with poorer severe placental and maternal/foetal outcomes.

### Effect of HELLP syndrome on acute kidney injury in pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Psy48]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

At present, high blood pressure caused by pregnancy is still an important public health problem in the world. Up to 500,000 pregnant women die every year due to complications related to preeclampsia. HELLP syndrome was defined by Weistein in 1982 as a clinical manifestation of elevated liver enzymes, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. For pregnant women, HELLP syndrome is a serious pregnancy complication that can threaten the safety of the mother and fetus. According to reports in the literature, the incidence of HELLP syndrome in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension range from 2 to 19.3%, while the prenatal mortality rate can reach from 7 to 60%. Studies have reported that among patients with preeclampsia, patients with HELLP syndrome have shorter gestational age, lower fetal weight, and higher fetal mortality than those without HELLP syndrome.

In patients with HELLP syndrome, acute kidney injury is a common cause of maternal and fetal death. For pregnant women, acute kidney injury can lead to anuria, heart failure, and severe pulmonary edema. These complications can bring about rapid death of pregnant women and fetuses. At present, the relationship between HELLP syndrome and acute kidney injury in pregnancy is controversial. Many studies believe that acute kidney injury during pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes are related to HLEPP syndrome. However, there are also studies that have different opinions, and they believe that acute kidney injury in pregnancy is related to preeclampsia rather than HELLP syndrome. Therefore, a systemic analysis of the relationship between HELLP syndrome and P-AKI and pregnancy outcomes is necessary.

We collected studies on patients with hypertension during pregnancy, and performed a meta-analysis on those with or without HELLP syndrome. We used meta-analysis to assess the association between HELLP syndrome and acute kidney injury to help clinicians make better decisions. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of HELLP syndrome and Acute kidney injury during pregnancy (P-AKI). Our research has been registered with PROSPERO, the code is CRD42018112333.

### Advances in our understanding of cardiovascular diseases after preeclampsia [^116PBrjX]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a syndrome of hypertension in association with target organ dysfunction, including proteinuria, which manifests during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia originates from impaired trophoblastic invasion of the placental resulting in malperfusion and involves multiple mechanistic pathways that include anti-angiogenic factors, endothelial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Preeclampsia caries an increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular disease including left ventricular remodeling, diastolic dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, peripheral vascular abnormalities, and microvascular dysfunction and clinical cardiovascular disease including stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death from a cardiovascular cause. This review will highlight several common mechanistic pathways shared between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases that provide insight into potential targets for risk reduction and disease process mitigation that can be examined in future trials.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^1145iFzc]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States and include chronic and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. For patients with chronic hypertension, oral antihypertensive therapy should be initiated or titrated at a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or greater. Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features can be managed with blood pressure monitoring, laboratory testing for disease progression, antenatal testing for fetal well-being, and delivery at 37 weeks' gestation. The use of antihypertensive drugs to control nonsevere hypertension in the setting of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia does not improve outcomes and is not recommended. Antihypertensive therapy should be initiated expeditiously for acute-onset severe hypertension to prevent hemorrhagic stroke. Preeclampsia with severe features requires immediate stabilization and inpatient treatment with magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis and antenatal corticosteroids (if preterm). Patients in the preterm period should receive antenatal corticosteroids without delaying delivery to complete courses. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can worsen or initially present after delivery and account for up to 44% of pregnancy-related deaths in the first six days postpartum. Patients should be monitored closely in the early postpartum period. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are linked to poor long-term maternal and fetal outcomes, including increased maternal lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Daily low-dose aspirin therapy starting at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation is safe and effective for reducing the risk of preeclampsia for patients with risk factors.

### Severe pre-eclampsia complicated by acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome and acute kidney injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111RZQLR]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has presented many diagnostic challenges and uncertainties. Little is known about common pathologies complicating pregnancy and how their behaviour is modified by the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Pregnancy itself can alter the body's response to viral infection, which can cause more severe symptoms. We report the first case of a patient affected with sudden-onset severe pre-eclampsia complicated by acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy, HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet) syndrome and acute kidney injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although an initial diagnostic dilemma, a multidisciplinary team approach was required to ensure a favourable outcome for both the mother and the baby. Our case report highlights the need for health professionals caring for pregnant women to be aware of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

### Evaluation of cardiac function in women with a history of preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NRJVg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

First, a large proportion of the studies excluded women with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease. Women with such pre‐existing comorbidities are at a greater risk of developing preeclampsia. 51, 52 Furthermore, women with a history of preeclampsia are more likely to develop hypertension, metabolic syndrome, renal disease, and diabetes mellitus in the long term. 6, 53, 54, 55, 56 It is thus plausible that the cardiovascular morbidity associated with preeclampsia is a result of an increased incidence of these cardiovascular risk factors within this population group rather than the preeclampsia per se. Exclusion of these risk factors may have contributed to selection bias and may have influenced the results of the constituent trials included in this review. It is also plausible that the cardiovascular sequelae observed in those with a history of preeclampsia are a result of shared risk factors between preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease. 57 Therefore, when women with cardiovascular risk factors are excluded, the effect of preeclampsia on cardiac structure, function, and morbidity may be clinically insignificant. Further studies which compare pre‐eclamptic women with and without cardiovascular risk factors are required in order to answer this clinical question.

### Maternal cardiovascular function following a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia [^1144gax5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive pregnancy complication with an unknown etiology and high maternal burden worldwide. Burgeoning research has linked preeclampsia to adverse maternal health outcomes remote from pregnancy; however, the intermediary mechanisms responsible for this association have not been sufficiently established. In the present narrative review, we summarize leading evidence of structural and functional cardiovascular changes associated with prior preeclampsia, and how these changes may be linked to future maternal disease. KEY POINTS: · Prior preeclampsia is associated with subclinical structural and functional vascular changes remote from pregnancy. · Maternal cardiac adaptations to preeclampsia may have long-term implications on cardiovascular health. · Clinicians have an opportunity to minimize maternal disease risk following preeclampsia.

### Recognizing cardiovascular risk after preeclampsia: the P4 study [^112ieDEc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well recognized that women who have had preeclampsia have increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, renal disease, and premature death compared with women who have had normotensive pregnancies. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Although this association has been recognized for many years, only recently has preeclampsia become listed as an independent risk factor for cardiac disease. 12 The rate at which women are hospitalized with myocardial infarction is rising, not easily predicted by traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 13 and preeclampsia is probably a contributor to this risk. Indeed, women with preexisting essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or obesity are recognized as being at increased risk both for preeclampsia 14 and later life cardiovascular disease.

Women are at least as likely as men to develop cardiovascular disease but healthcare providers are not always aware of preeclampsia being a significant risk factor. 15 Even when women are assessed for their cardiovascular risk after a preeclamptic pregnancy clinicians (understandably) use traditional cut‐off values for risk factors such as blood pressure (BP) when assessing these women. Problems arise firstly in that learned groups differ in their criteria (either 130/80 or 140/90 mm Hg) for defining hypertension, 16, 17 and secondly that these normal values, and the benefits of anti‐hypertensive treatment, have not been derived from cohorts of young parous women, but more typically from older cohorts, and predominantly men. 18

We therefore undertook this prospective study 6 months after pregnancy to (1) define what constitutes "normal" for BP in young women, and (2) determine the proportion of women who had preeclampsia with BP and other cardiovascular risk factors that lay outside both traditional and these new normal ranges, so as to heighten clinicians' attention to potential risk for such women.

### The HELLP syndrome: clinical issues and management. A review [^113HBPE4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conservative management (> 48 hours)

Large randomized clinical trials aimed to compare conservative versus aggressive management with immediate delivery of women with the HELLP syndrome are missing. However, expectant management before completed 34 weeks' gestation may be an acceptable option in selected cases if it is performed in tertiary care units under close maternal and foetal surveillance (e.g. antihypertensive treatment, ultrasound and Doppler examination). Possible advantages due to limited prolongation of pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the increased risks for maternal and foetal complications (abruptio placentae, acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema, DIC, perinatal and maternal death). If the maternal condition worsens, immediate Caesarean section is inevitable. Conservative treatment is contraindicated in women with DIC.

The benefit of temporizing management of HELLP syndrome is questioned; some authors warn against expectant management to optimize maternal condition before delivery beyond 24–48 hours or conservative management is disregarded. However, expectant management of pregnant women with HELLP syndrome remote from term is common practice in the Netherlands, conditional on the safety of the mother.

### The global aHUS registry: methodology and initial patient characteristics [^111v9gbJ]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations of the Registry include possible underreporting of outcomes, missing data, and/or inadequate follow-up. Robustness of data gathered depends on the quality of data entry, number of aHUS patients who enroll, the diversity of their demographic and disease characteristics, including age and disease duration, and retention of recruited patients. Thus far, enrolled patients have had a mean of 5-year histories of aHUS before Registry enrollment. Future enrollment of patients who are newly diagnosed with aHUS will allow for analysis of more contemporary treatment and management approaches. Other limitations include the potential for varying interpretation of baseline disease characteristics by enrolling physicians. Increased clinician participation and collection of complete information will optimize the quality of Registry results and inform forthcoming analyses.

Future analyses from the global aHUS Registry will be conducted to increase understanding of the natural history and progression of the disease. Data gathered during the minimum 5-year follow-up period are collected from clinicians worldwide and will be valuable to help describe aHUS presentation, progression with or without eculizumab therapy, and patient outcomes. Thus far, observational studies in aHUS patients have led to varying conclusions regarding the effect of genetic background on prognosis. Although complement gene mutations, polymorphisms or factor H autoantibodies typically are identified in up to 70% of patients, they are not required for a diagnosis of aHUS. As part of ongoing research efforts, future analyses of the global aHUS Registry may also help to determine the relative degree to which genetic and other patient factors (e.g. age, gender and ethnicity) predict the development and clinical course of complement-mediated TMA complications. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is typically characterized by renal involvement; however, the medical literature increasingly is reporting extrarenal complications of the disease, including cardiovascular, neurological, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal. Future analyses will help to better characterize the development and progression of extrarenal and multisystemic complications. Several conditions that may potentially further increase complement activity are known to uncover an underlying diagnosis of aHUS and place patients at increased risk for renal and/or extrarenal organ damage. The Registry is open to all patients with a clinical history of aHUS, including those with these types of comorbid conditions that have been associated with TMA and/or aHUS, including autoimmune disease, malignancy, malignant hypertension, pregnancy-associated conditions of preeclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, and scleroderma. Inclusion of these patients may allow for further characterization of the relationship between these conditions and aHUS in future analyses. Finally, because enrollment in the Registry is not contingent upon receipt of eculizumab, data comparing the long-term outcomes of patients treated with eculizumab and patients managed with supportive therapies, including PE/PI, may be included in future analyses.

### Postnatal diagnosis of maternal congenital heart disease: missed opportunities [^113DafMG]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 30-year-old primigravida with no known comorbidities presented to the emergency department at 29+6/40 gestation, with breathlessness. The initial diagnosis was pulmonary embolism, which was later revised following initial investigations and considered to be pre-eclampsia/HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. Following caesarean section and delivery of a live baby, the patient had episodes of cyanotic hypoxia and was admitted to intensive care. A provisional diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension was performed. Decompensation led to transfer to a specialist intensive care unit for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, where a diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus and Eisenmenger's syndrome was made. Heart disease is the leading indirect cause of maternal death, and Eisenmenger's syndrome in pregnancy carries a 50–65% mortality. A literature review demonstrated that this is the only reported case of a postnatal diagnosis of Eisenmenger's syndrome. We considered missed opportunities to make an earlier diagnosis, so that patients and doctors will benefit from the lessons we learnt.

### Maternal myocardial dysfunction after hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome: a speckle-tracking study [^112ELQac]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study are the relatively small number of patients involved and the lack of pre-conceptional CV evaluation, which prevented us from demonstrating a cause–effect relationship between PE/HELLP and myocardial alterations. Pre-conceptional studies are needed to clarify whether myocardial subclinical impairment is directly related to PE/HELLP or whether it represents an expression of a maternal genetic predisposition already present before pregnancy. In addition, the retrospective nature of the study design and the free access to CV postpartum evaluation from all over the Netherlands may have introduced some biases in terms of obstetric management and sample selection. Finally, women in the PE+HELLP group delivered earlier and women with HELLP alone had not significantly more FGR babies: these issues could introduce some biases in the trend towards worse CV sequelae in the two groups, even if the difference among groups considering these two variables are clinically not relevant and multivariable analysis showed an independent association of HELLP syndrome with many echocardiographic variables.

Since CV risk factors (e.g. glucose intolerance, smoking habit, dyslipidemia, or overweight/obesity) play a key role in cardiac damage, the major strength of our study was to consider maternal pre-existent CV risk profile as a possible confounder and so, as an exclusion criterion.

It is important to use innovative tools to try to identify women who should benefit from an earlier CV risk profile assessment than the general population. Pregnancy and the postpartum period offer us such an opportunity, given that the development of certain pregnancy complications, including HELLP syndrome, can reliably identify women with underlying, often unrecognized, CV risk factors. Women with a history of HELLP syndrome with or without PE should be identified at the time of delivery and referred to CV units for regular follow-up. This would ideally take the form of a multidisciplinary team evaluation to carry out physical and biochemical screening as well as counseling regarding lifestyle modification and possible interventions, which should be individualized according to own findings and risks.

To conclude, women with a history of normotensive or hypertensive HELLP syndrome with no concurrent CV risk factors showed persistent cardiac dysfunction at short-medium term after delivery. This supports the need in these women for a closer monitoring in order to try to prevent CV morbidity.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^115xCZYQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

HELLP syndrome — timing, diagnostic laboratory thresholds, and management are detailed: HELLP complicates up to 20% of cases of severe preeclampsia/eclampsia and typically presents between 28 and 36 weeks of gestation, with 30% manifesting symptoms in the first week postpartum. Diagnosis relies on hemolysis and thrombocytopenia with platelets < 100,000 cells/μL with elevations in AST, ALT, serum bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase; hypertension and proteinuria occur in up to 80% of cases, whereas jaundice occurs in only 5% of patients. Maternal mortality rates are 1–3%. When the ALT or AST is > 1,000 U/l or abdominal pain radiates into the right shoulder, cross-sectional imaging can assist in excluding hepatic complications. Glucocorticoids are often part of the therapeutic protocol in HELLP, especially in pregnancies < 34 weeks; however, a Cochrane review found no difference in the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, or perinatal/infant death despite greater improvement in platelet count with dexamethasone. There is no contraindication to platelet transfusion, and transfusion to > 40,000 cells/μl is advised when invasive procedures are anticipated.

### The use of echocardiography to identify acute and chronic changes in left ventricular function in hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [^113ar61W]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a complex of diseases characterized by an increase in systolic and/or diastolic arterial pressures (> 140 or > 90 mmHg, respectively), and include hypertension alone, preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia. Preeclampsia can result in complications such as HELLP syndrome (acronym for hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelets) and eclampsia. Although there were advances in the treatment of these disorders with the introduction of magnesium sulfate, calcium, aspirin and other drugs, the lack of early interventions cause maternal and fetal-neonate morbity and mortality. The overall incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy worldwide, varies from 2–12% of all pregnancies, however, low socioeconomic status increases the risk, and they are particularly problematic in mid- to low-income countries such as Brazil. In United States, they also affect disproportionately women of Latin or African ascendancies at a greater risk.

Weight gain is associated with preeclampsia and the later development of cardiovascular disease, regardless of other risk factors. The weight gain is even more frequent in vulnerable population. Obesity at young age has become a worldwide problem even in lower income countries. The combination of weight gain and lack of adequate medical care for treating the hypertension contribute to the risk of complications during pregnancy.

Women who develop preeclampsia have a 3.5- fold increased risk of subsequently developing myocardial infarction, cardiac diseases such as hypertrophy or left ventricular remodeling, heart failure and coronary calcification. An earlier onset of preeclampsia is associated with subclinical impairment of ventricular function and worsened outcome, usually requiring interruption of the pregnancy to deliver a premature infant. Metabolic syndrome and vascular changes initiated during pregnancy can persist afterward, causing cardiovascular disease at an earlier age. In addition, chronic inflammation, which is common in more vulnerable population, can constitute a link between the cardiovascular risk during pregnancy and eventual development of cardiac structural alterations such as myocardial hypertrophy.

### Hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity in the US, 2015–2019 [^114K1pHK]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between subtypes of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity during delivery hospitalization?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study including more than 15 million deliveries, a graded relationship by severity characterized the association between HDP subtypes and cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity. Patients with HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome were at highest risk, followed by those with severe preeclampsia, and those with chronic hypertension.

Meaning

These results suggest that all HDP subtypes, particularly HELLP syndrome, are important risk factors for cardiovascular severe maternal morbidity at delivery.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1117aA6Y]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

HELLP syndrome — epidemiology, clinical features, and management — is present in 0.2%-0.6% of pregnancies and can occur in patients with normal blood pressure; it is diagnosed clinically, and liver biopsy is not advised. When symptoms are present, 65% of patients have weight gain and right upper quadrant pain or epigastric pain, 35% have nausea or vomiting, and 30% have headache as well as malaise. Jaundice is noted in up to 40% of patients, hypertension is present in 85% of cases, proteinuria is commonly noted, and disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is the hallmark of the disorder and the only treatment available for HELLP is delivery, which should occur as soon as maternal stabilization is achieved. If abdominal pain, shoulder pain, or hypotension develop, imaging must be performed to rule out hepatic hemorrhage, rupture, or infarction, which can occur in up to 45% of patients; management includes coagulation support, antibiotics, and transfusion, and urgent angiography and hepatic artery embolization or surgical intervention is indicated if supportive measures are unsuccessful.

### Is it time for precision screening in Preeclampsia? [^113cbhbr]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies in the United States and is divided into 2 phenotypes characterized by cardiovascular dysfunction: early-onset and late-onset. Early-onset preeclampsia (EO-PEC), which typically develops before 34 weeks gestation in singleton pregnancies, is associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR) and often involves low cardiac output and elevated vascular resistance. Conversely, late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PEC) typically develops after 34 weeks, is not associated with FGR, and presents with high cardiac output and low or normal vascular resistance. Preeclampsia carries significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and fetus, including eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, organ dysfunction, preterm birth, and FGR.

Notably, preeclampsia has been closely linked to elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Meta-analyses have demonstrated that patients with preeclampsia carry a 4-fold increased risk of heart failure and 2-fold increase of future CVD and stroke. Currently, aspirin is the gold standard in preeclampsia prevention. By regulating the imbalance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in the placenta, aspirin is thought to lower the risk of preeclampsia, preventing systemic hypertension and end-organ hypoperfusion. It is important to establish effective and comprehensive screening protocols for aspirin allocation in both EO-PEC and LO-PEC to not only prevent the development of preeclampsia, but to also decrease risk of future CVD. In this viewpoint, we present evidence in support of leveraging precision medicine tools such as serum biomarkers, uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for preeclampsia screening, in addition to considering clinical risk factors.

### Clinical review: special populations – critical illness and pregnancy [^1139cpuN]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Critical illness is an uncommon but potentially devastating complication of pregnancy. The majority of pregnancy-related critical care admissions occur postpartum. Antenatally, the pregnant patient is more likely to be admitted with diseases non-specific to pregnancy, such as pneumonia. Pregnancy-specific diseases resulting in ICU admission include obstetric hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, amniotic fluid embolus syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and peripartum cardiomyopathy. Alternatively, critical illness may result from pregnancy-induced worsening of pre-existing diseases (for example, valvular heart disease, myasthenia gravis, and kidney disease). Pregnancy can also predispose women to diseases seen in the non-pregnant population, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (for example, pneumonia and aspiration), sepsis (for example, chorioamnionitis and pyelonephritis) or pulmonary embolism. The pregnant patient may also develop conditions co-incidental to pregnancy such as trauma or appendicitis. Hemorrhage, particularly postpartum, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain the most frequent indications for ICU admission. This review focuses on pregnancy-specific causes of critical illness. Management of the critically ill mother poses special challenges. The physiologic changes in pregnancy and the presence of a second, dependent, patient may necessitate adjustments to therapeutic and supportive strategies. The fetus is generally robust despite maternal illness, and therapeutically what is good for the mother is generally good for the fetus. For pregnancy-induced critical illnesses, delivery of the fetus helps resolve the disease process. Prognosis following pregnancy-related critical illness is generally better than for age-matched non-pregnant critically ill patients.

### HELLP syndrome: recognition and perinatal management… [^111TK9Um]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The acronym HELLP was coined in 1982 to describe a syndrome consisting of emolysis, h levated e iver enzyme levels and l ow l latelet count. p 1The syndrome has been considered a variant of preeclampsia, but it can occur on its own or in association with preeclampsia. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are related and overlap in their presentations. Because of the serious associated morbidity and mortality, family physicians who provide maternity care need to be aware of HELLP syndrome so that they can identify it early. Etiology and Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of HELLP syndrome is not well understood. The findings of this multisystem disease are attributed to abnormal vascular tone, vasospasm and coagulation defects. 2 To date, no common precipitating factor has been found. The syndrome seems to be the final manifestation of some insult that leads to microvascular endothelial damage and intravascular platelet activation.

With platelet activation, thromboxane A and serotonin are released, causing vasospasm, platelet agglutination and aggregation, and further endothelial damage. 2 Thus begins a cascade that is only terminated with delivery. The hemolysis in HELLP syndrome is a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Red blood cells become fragmented as they pass through small blood vessels with endothelial damage and fibrin deposits. The peripheral smear may reveal spherocytes, schistocytes, triangular cells and burr cells. The elevated liver enzyme levels in the syndrome are thought to be secondary to obstruction of hepatic blood flow by fibrin deposits in the sinusoids. This obstruction leads to periportal necrosis and, in severe cases, intrahepatic hemorrhage, subcapsular hematoma formation or hepatic rupture. The thrombocytopenia has been attributed to increased consumption and/or destruction of platelets.

Although some investigators speculate that disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is the primary process in HELLP syndrome, most patients show no abnormalities on coagulation studies. Patients who develop DIC generally do so in the setting of well-developed HELLP syndrome. All patients with HELLP syndrome may have an underlying coagulopathy that is usually undetectable. 12 Alternatively, HELLP syndrome can be classified on the basis of platelet count nadir: class I, less than 50, 000 per mm.

### Preeclampsia and future cardiovascular health: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1156AmbY]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder resulting in hypertension and multiorgan dysfunction. There is growing evidence that these effects persist after pregnancy. We aimed to systematically evaluate and quantify the evidence on the relationship between preeclampsia and the future risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Methods and Results

We studied the future risk of heart failure, coronary heart disease, composite cardiovascular disease, death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease, stroke, and stroke death after preeclampsia. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis to determine the risk. Twenty-two studies were identified with > 6.4 million women including > 258000 women with preeclampsia. Meta-analysis of studies that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that preeclampsia was independently associated with an increased risk of future heart failure (risk ratio [RR], 4.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09–8.38), coronary heart disease (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.43–4.37), cardiovascular disease death (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.83–2.66), and stroke (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.29–2.55). Sensitivity analyses showed that preeclampsia continued to be associated with an increased risk of future coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke after adjusting for age (RR, 3.89; 95% CI, 1.83–8.26), body mass index (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.41–7.07), and diabetes mellitus (RR, 4.19; 95% CI, 2.09–8.38).

Conclusions

Preeclampsia is associated with a 4-fold increase in future incident heart failure and a 2-fold increased risk in coronary heart disease, stroke, and death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease. Our study highlights the importance of lifelong monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia, including preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension — preeclampsia is a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome characterized by hypertension with proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (superimposed preeclampsia). In preeclampsia, severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia, the occurrence of convulsive seizures, is one of the most severe forms, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk; pravastatin has been investigated in small studies but larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.
