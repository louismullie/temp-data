## Question

what is the source of enterococcus faecalis skin infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the source of Enterococcus faecalis skin infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's normal reservoirs and colonization sites. Then, I should verify the typical routes of entry into the skin and which clinical scenarios predispose to infection. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence for endogenous versus exogenous sources. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer and note any exceptions or nuances that might change management or interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the organism's ecology. Enterococcus faecalis is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and commonly colonizes skin and mucous membranes, particularly in hospitalized or debilitated patients, which establishes an endogenous reservoir that can seed infections when barriers are breached [^6ca5d678] [^1a10cc7c] [^367a3386].

> Wait, let me verify the primary source of skin infections. The predominant source is endogenous: E. faecalis from the patient's own gut or skin flora gains access to deeper tissues via breaks in the epidermis, such as surgical incisions, pressure injuries, diabetic foot ulcers, trauma, or perianal skin breakdown, where it can then proliferate and cause infection [^3c03ec0f] [^56788b54] [^c87fa58d] [^e7fe321f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exogenous sources. I should confirm how often those occur. Exogenous acquisition is less common but documented, including contamination of the surgical field from personnel or environment during operations, and environmental contamination of chronic wounds in healthcare settings; these are recognized contributors to surgical site infections and chronic wound colonization, though they are secondary to endogenous sources in most cases [^5ca05a37] [^01cb4246] [^b55d2ceb].

> I need to check the pathophysiology that makes E. faecalis particularly persistent in skin and soft tissue. E. faecalis forms biofilms and has intrinsic tolerance to multiple antibiotics, and it can modulate host immunity and delay wound healing, which helps explain why it often persists in chronic wounds and diabetic foot ulcers even when other flora are cleared [^6ca5d678] [^a7567901] [^6595e434].

> Let me consider special scenarios that raise suspicion for E. faecalis. In immunocompromised hosts, especially neutropenic patients, perianal cellulitis and abscesses frequently involve enteric organisms including Enterococcus spp., reinforcing the gut-to-skin translocation pathway in high-risk settings [^e7fe321f]. In diabetic foot infections, E. faecalis is commonly isolated and contributes to biofilm-driven chronicity, again aligning with an endogenous source in the setting of impaired host defenses and tissue ischemia [^c87fa58d] [^dec16595].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient lacks obvious portals of entry? I should double-check for occult sources or polymicrobial dynamics. In some cases, E. faecalis may be part of a polymicrobial infection where initial trauma or surgery introduced mixed flora, and enterococci persist due to their biofilm phenotype and antibiotic tolerance, which can blur the distinction between endogenous and exogenous contributions [^6ca5d678] [^3c03ec0f].

> I will now examine the clinical implications briefly, because source informs therapy. When E. faecalis is isolated from a skin or soft tissue infection, especially in chronic wounds or surgical sites, I should confirm whether it is a colonizer or a pathogen using clinical correlation and, when possible, obtain deep tissue or aspirate cultures rather than superficial swabs; if pathogenic, ampicillin remains first-line for E. faecalis, with vancomycin or linezolid reserved for resistant strains, and source control is essential to eradicate reservoirs [^3c03ec0f] [^aeac151a] [^8528b5a5].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. The source of Enterococcus faecalis skin infection is overwhelmingly endogenous, arising from the patient's own gastrointestinal or skin flora that gains entry through breaks in cutaneous or mucosal barriers; exogenous acquisition from the healthcare environment or procedures occurs but is less common, and distinguishing colonization from true infection guides appropriate antibiotic stewardship and source control [^6ca5d678] [^3c03ec0f] [^56788b54].

---

Enterococcus faecalis skin infections arise primarily from **endogenous sources** — the patient's own gastrointestinal or perineal flora — via breaches in skin or mucosa (surgical wounds, pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, trauma, or perianal infections) [^3c03ec0f] [^56788b54]. Exogenous transmission is less common but can occur through **healthcare contact** (contaminated hands, equipment, or environment) [^5ca05a37] [^01cb4246], especially in hospitals or long-term care settings [^notfound]. Risk increases with immunocompromise, diabetes, malnutrition, or prior antibiotics that disrupt normal flora [^dec16595] [^6a51ef68]. Management should prioritize **source control** (debridement, drainage) and antibiotics guided by susceptibility, as E. faecalis is intrinsically tolerant and can persist in biofilms [^6ca5d678] [^b3ea428c].

---

## Endogenous sources

E. faecalis commonly colonizes the **gastrointestinal tract** and perineal skin; skin infections typically result from translocation when barriers are breached [^6ca5d678] [^1a10cc7c].

- **Surgical wounds**: Incisions near the groin, perineum, or lower abdomen allow entry of enteric flora, including E. faecalis [^01cb4246] [^7248ee17].

- **Pressure ulcers**: Chronic pressure injuries, especially over bony prominences, provide a portal for endogenous E. faecalis [^56788b54].

- **Diabetic foot ulcers**: Neuropathic ulcers frequently harbor E. faecalis from the patient's own flora [^c87fa58d] [^dec16595].

- **Trauma or burns**: Skin breakdown enables E. faecalis invasion from colonized sites [^notfound].

---

## Exogenous sources

Although less common, **exogenous transmission** can occur in healthcare settings:

- **Healthcare personnel**: Contaminated hands or equipment can introduce E. faecalis into wounds [^5ca05a37] [^01cb4246].

- **Environmental contamination**: Hospital surfaces, medical devices, or prosthetic materials can harbor E. faecalis, facilitating transmission [^6a51ef68].

- **Community exposure**: Rarely, community-acquired E. faecalis skin infections may occur, particularly in individuals with frequent healthcare contact or chronic skin conditions [^3c166eff].

---

## Clinical risk factors

Several factors increase susceptibility to **E. faecalis skin infections**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Immunocompromised state | HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy [^12b4b453] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Poor glycemic control, neuropathy, vascular insufficiency [^dec16595] |
| Malnutrition | Protein-energy malnutrition, obesity [^notfound] |
| Chronic skin conditions | Eczema, psoriasis, chronic wounds [^notfound] |
| Prior antibiotic exposure | Disruption of normal flora, selection for resistant organisms [^6a51ef68] |

---

## Pathogenesis and virulence factors

E. faecalis possesses several **virulence traits** that facilitate skin infection:

- **Biofilm formation**: Enhances adherence to skin and medical devices, promoting persistence and tolerance to antibiotics [^6ca5d678] [^a7567901].

- **Immune evasion**: Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) confers resistance to host antimicrobial peptides, aiding survival in wounds [^a7567901] [^41a4f5ba].

- **Enzymes and toxins**: Gelatinase, hyaluronidase, and cytolysin contribute to tissue destruction and pathogenicity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

E. faecalis skin infections are often chronic, polymicrobial, and difficult to treat due to **biofilm formation** and intrinsic antibiotic tolerance [^6ca5d678]. Effective management requires:

- **Source control**: Surgical debridement, drainage, and removal of infected devices are essential [^b3ea428c].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Ampicillin is first-line for susceptible strains; vancomycin or linezolid are alternatives for resistant organisms [^aeac151a] [^8528b5a5].

- **Combination therapy**: Synergistic regimens (e.g. ampicillin plus gentamicin) may be necessary for severe infections [^1242d125].

- **Preventive measures**: Strict infection control, hand hygiene, and antimicrobial stewardship reduce transmission and recurrence [^390f5465].

---

Enterococcus faecalis skin infections are **primarily endogenous**, arising from the patient's own gastrointestinal or perineal flora via skin breaches, with exogenous transmission occurring less frequently in healthcare settings. Effective management hinges on **source control** and **antibiotic therapy** tailored to susceptibilities, given the organism's biofilm tolerance and intrinsic resistance.

Enterococci are a common cause of bacteremia but are also common contaminants. In our institution, approximately 17% of positive blood cultures with enterococci are mixed with skin organisms. Such isolates are probable contaminants. The specificity of the current definition of primary bloodstream infection could be increased by excluding enterococci mixed with skin organisms.

### Pyrexia: aetiology in the ICU [^c1cd9c2b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Any infection, but especially those in the lower respiratory tract, abdomen, or urinary tract, can invade the bloodstream. Given that bloodstream infection can also be primary or catheter related, the bloodstream is a common site of infection in critically ill patients with pyrexia. Among patients admitted to the ICU owing to a severe bloodstream infection that is community onset, the most common pathogens are E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae. For those infections that are hospital onset, S. aureus and E. coli are also the two most common pathogens, followed by Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis. Risk factors for developing a severe bloodstream infection (community or hospital onset) include older age and the presence of underlying medical comorbidities especially diabetes mellitus, dialysis-dependent renal failure, cancer, lung disease, and alcoholism. Fungemia with Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida species is important to consider as a cause of pyrexia that develops in hospital, especially in patients with risk factors such as recent surgical operation, sepsis, treatment with parenteral nutrition, and/or broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Although rates of catheter-related bloodstream infection have decreased considerably owing to use of infection prevention bundles and early removal of unnecessary catheters, this remains an important source of pyrexia in patients admitted to ICUs. While classically thought to present negligible risk, the infectious risk associated with arterial catheters is similar to central venous catheters. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common pathogen isolated in patients with catheter-related bloodstream infection, with other common organisms including S. aureus, enterococcal species, and Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae.

Other sources of infection include the skin and soft tissue, bone/joints, central nervous system, and ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Diagnoses such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis commonly take origin in the community, although they may rarely be hospital onset. Skin breakdown particularly in the sacral area is a common problem in patients with long ICU or hospital lengths of stay, and these areas may become infected. In addition, any operative wound can become colonized and ultimately infected. Hospital-onset infections of the central nervous system are uncommon outside the neurosurgical setting; however, among patients with persistent bacteremia and prolonged pyrexia, consideration should be given to potential seeding of the paraspinal and/or epidural spaces. Finally, for patients with prolonged insertion of nasogastric and/or nasotracheal tubes, sinusitis commonly develops, and may be responsible for pyrexia that is not accompanied by other systemic signs of infection.

### Skin and soft tissue infections in the elderly [^41a338b7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENT ETIOLOGY COMPARED TO ADULTS?

Skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Less commonly identified bacteria include other Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, and Gram-negative bacteria. MRSA has become a significant healthcare problem, especially in hospital settings. In the past decade, this organism has emerged in the community known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). Outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have been increasingly reported worldwide with skin and soft tissue as the most common manifestation. In the United States, the prevalence of SSTIs caused by CA-MRSA has been reported to range from 15% to 74% of all SSTIs. Thus, the first consideration is to understand whether elderly patients have higher risk to have a SSTI caused by MRSA compared to adults. As a matter of fact, identification of risk factors is important in initial decisions about antibiotic selection. Risk factors for MRSA acquisition included the following factors: recent hospitalization, recent outpatient visit (within 12 months), recent nursing home admission (within 12 months), recent antibiotic exposure (range, 1–12 months), chronic illness (such as end-stage renal disease, diabetes, or malignancy), injection drug use, and close contact with a person with risk factor(s) for MRSA acquisition. Living in an area with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA or admission to a hospital with a high prevalence of hospital acquired-MRSA is also considered a significant risk factor for MRSA colonization. Advancing age by itself is not considered a risk factor for MRSA infection. A study from UK studied the prevalence of MRSA in a general practice in London. Among 258 older subjects living in their own home, MRSA was found in two participants (0.78%) and past history of MRSA was the only significant risk factor for MRSA colonization. However, elderly patients may have more frequently other risk factors for MRSA. Moreover, age >65 years is a significant risk factor for hospitalization and poor outcome due to a MRSA infection. Hence, advancing age is indirectly linked to MRSA acquisition. Interestingly, a recent retrospective study conducted in patients >60 years old in Poland showed that the prevalence of MRSA is significantly different in categories of patients: 14.1% in young old (60–74 years), 19.5% in old old (75–85 years) and 26.7% in longevity (≥85 years old).

### Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic target attainment analyses for dalbavancin in pediatric patients [^f364e288]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a significant source of morbidity in children, with cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis being the predominant skin infections treated by pediatricians.If diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause hospitalization and serious life-threatening complications.Since the year 2000, rates of hospitalizations among pediatric patients with skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) have increased rapidly, with a 2013 survey showing a doubling between 1997 and 2009 to exceed 70,000 per year. This increase, which is also seen in adult patients with SSSI, coincided with the emergence of resistant pathogens, including community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), with many areas in the United States now reporting >40% MRSA rates among SSSI isolates. –

For more than 50 years, vancomycin has been the mainstay of antibacterial therapy for severe infections caused by resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. However, vancomycin is associated with a risk of nephrotoxicity, the need for drug monitoring, and the emergence of resistant S aureus and enterococci strains.Current guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIwere published before the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved dalbavancin, a second-generation, intravenous (IV) lipoglycopeptide, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for the treatment of adults with ABSSSI known or suspected to be caused by susceptible strains of the following Gram-positive microorganisms: S aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S agalactiae, S dysgalactiae, S anginosus (including S anginosus, S intermedius, S constellatus), and vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Dalbavancin is also approved in the United States for the treatment of ABSSSI in pediatric patients from birth to <18 years, and is the first and only single-dose IV treatment for ABSSSI currently approved in the United States and the European Union. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of dalbavancin, including its long half-life, makes it a convenient treatment option, even in the outpatient setting, and a single-dose regimen may improve compliance and reduce healthcare resource use.

### How to stratify patients at risk for resistant bugs in skin and soft tissue infections? [^c1637d11]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article describes the strategies for stratifying patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) according to their risk for infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

Recent Findings

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) now represents the main cause in a variety of serious SSTIs. Risk factors for MRSA are constantly evolving and the distinction between community-acquired MRSA and hospital-acquired MRSA is becoming less clear from a therapeutic standpoint because of overlapping susceptibility patterns. Given these observations, physicians should be aware that directed empirical coverage of MRSA for serious SSTIs should be required in communities where this resistant pathogen is recognized to be a prevalent cause of infection. Similarly, other MDR bacteria are demonstrating alarming trends as causative pathogens in SSTIs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus can play an important role in polymicrobial long-standing infections such as diabetic foot infection and decubiti, but are also increasingly recognized in monomicrobial SSTIs.

Summary

SSTIs caused by MDR bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, are on the rise especially in patients with long-standing infections and those with prior antibiotic exposure. Recognition of risk factors for infection with MDR bacteria should assist clinicians in targeting appropriate antibiotic therapy to at-risk individuals.

### The safety and efficacy of dalbavancin and active comparator in pediatric patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^9912d5bf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a significant source of morbidity in children. Studies have shown that among culture-positive skin and soft tissue infections in the United States, the majority were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and nearly half of those were methicillin resistant (MRSA). Community-acquired MRSA appears to have initially emerged and spread in children and is now one of the most common SSSI pathogens affecting children and adults. The epidemiology of S. aureus, characterized by successive emergence of regionally predominant strains, is reflected in other regions of the world,, resulting in an increased need for antibiotics with a spectrum of activity that includes MRSA for the empiric treatment of ABSSSI.

The long-acting, second-generation lipoglycopeptide anti biotic dalbavancin has been approved for use in adults and children by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and for use in adults by the European Medicines Agency for intravenous (IV) treatment of ABSSSI caused by susceptible strains of S. aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. anginosus (including S. intermedius, S. constellatus), and vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis.

The safety and efficacy of IV dalbavancin in adults have been demonstrated in several phase 2, and pivotal phase 3 – trials. Previous pediatric trials reported no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths related to dalbavancin treatment. In addition, audiograms showed no evidence of ototoxicity due to dalbavancin administration in those patients for whom results were obtained and evaluable.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of dalbavancin is well characterized in adults and shown to be linear, with low variability and long terminal elimination half-life (>14 days), allowing for simplified dosing regimens. – In adults, the standard treatment regimen is 1500 mg, either as a single dose or as 1000 mg followed 1 week later by a 500-mg dose, administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^675f2ef9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in wounds yet little is known about its pathogenic mechanisms in this setting. Here, we used a mouse wound excisional model to characterize the infection dynamics of E faecalis and show that infected wounds result in 2 different states depending on the initial inoculum. Low-dose inocula were associated with short-term, low-titer colonization whereas high-dose inocula were associated with acute bacterial replication and long-term persistence. High-dose infection and persistence were also associated with immune cell infiltration, despite suppression of some inflammatory cytokines and delayed wound healing. During high-dose infection, the multiple peptide resistance factor, which is involved in resisting immune clearance, contributes to E faecalis fitness. These results comprehensively describe a mouse model for investigating E faecalis wound infection determinants, and suggest that both immune modulation and resistance contribute to persistent, nonhealing wounds.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b3ea428c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Bacteremia management—Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

### Structural and functional analysis of entV reveals a 12 amino acid fragment protective against fungal infections [^51e09b40]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Management of disseminated fungal infections continues to be a major clinical problem. The limited spectrum of available antifungal agents contributes to both the development of acquired resistance and the rise in incidence of previously rare but intrinsically resistant pathogens,. Consequently, there is an unacceptably high mortality rate in patients with fungal infections. Antifungal discovery is complicated by the similar cell biology of fungi and mammals; as a result, there are only three classes of drugs for systemic infections, the newest of which was discovered nearly 40 years ago and approved for clinical use in 2001. This illustrates the challenges of developing new antifungals, despite the dire need for them.

Life-threatening fungal infections are seen nearly exclusively in immunodeficient patients, with healthy individuals routinely exposed to these pathogens –. Candida albicans is archetypal: it is a ubiquitous mammalian commensal of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts as well as the skin and is rarely isolated from environmental sources. The normally benign association of most C. albicans with the human host raises the prospect that successful antifungal therapy need not involve eradication, but rather a restoration of microbial balance, so as to confine it to a non-pathogenic association. Consequently, significant effort has been expended to understand the normal and pathological interactions of C. albicans with the host. Less attention has been paid to how these interactions may be impacted by other components of the microbiome, but C. albicans has been observed to have both synergistic and antagonistic relationships with various bacterial species, including human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis –. It stands to reason that C. albicans, often considered to be an obligate mammalian commensal, would have evolved specific responses to its bacterial neighbors in the microbiome and is thus a platform for uncovering molecular signals that may have therapeutic potential.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^52e9d412]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Surgical site infections are prevalent and can extend the average hospital stay by 5 to 17 days. Despite the prevalence and clinical importance of E faecalis wound infection, we know nothing of its pathogenic mechanisms in this infection setting. Here, we established a modified mouse wound excisional model to study the infection dynamics of E faecalis in surgical site infections.

We show that acute high-titer E faecalis wound infection associated with ≥10 6 CFU is associated with a robust cellular host immune response and visible signs of inflammation, along with delayed wound healing, whereas inflammation is suppressed or absent in lower-titer infections. Our observations are consistent with reports showing that bacterial counts of ≥10 6 perturb healing in humans. However, despite an early robust inflammatory response, E faecalis can persist in the local wound site regardless of the inoculum load. Consistent with this, we observed E faecalis in both the wound bed and at the epidermal wound edge at 3 dpi, suggesting that E faecalis reservoirs within host cells may promote persistence in this niche.

Consistent with reports that most wound infections involve biofilms, we observed the presence of microcolonies at the surface of E faecalis infected wounds at 8 hpi. However, a sortase null mutant, deficient in the surface display of a variety of biofilm-associated factors, was not attenuated in wounds. Together, these findings suggest that E faecalis wound-associated microcolonies or biofilms require other bacterial or host factors for their development, and that currently understood biofilm factors are less crucial in this niche. Instead, we found that a factor involved in resistance to host immune defenses is important for E faecalis survival in wounds. We observed that an MprF null strain was not attenuated at 8 hpi when acute bacterial replication is occurring, but displayed a fitness defect at 3 dpi when the bacterial burden resolves to a steady state of 10 5 CFU. Interestingly, the only immune cell type we observed to be significantly greater in infected wounds compared to mock-infected wounds was MHCII − macrophages and we only observed this at 3 dpi. Based on these findings, it is tempting to speculate that MprF may contribute to E faecalis survival in the face of macrophage infiltration. Consistent with this, we and others have shown that E faecalis can survive within and suppress immune activation of macrophages.

### The future approach for the management of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^44c5f574]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT

Long-acting antibiotics: dalbavancin and oritavancin

The availability of long-acting antibiotics may ensure a direct discharge from ED or an early discharge from the hospital. This approach may be of great interest to reduce hospitalization and its potential associated complications. Characteristics of long-acting antibiotics available for the management of patents with ABSSSI are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 
Summary of new available therapeutic options for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections

Dalbavancin and oritavancin are authorized in patients with ABSSSI caused by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA, and multiple Streptococcus species. Oritavancin has also been authorized for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Recent data suggested that dalbavancin retains in-vitro activity against vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) (vanB and vanC) and other uncommon Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci. Unlike dalbavancin, oritavancin retains activity vancomycin-susceptible and VRE, including both vanA and vanB, due to the peculiar mechanisms of direct interaction with cell membrane. Efficacy and safety of the two long-acting antibiotics have been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), DISCOVER 1/DISCOVER 2 and SOLO 1/SOLO2, respectively. Real-life data confirmed these favourable findings both for dalbavancin and oritavancin.

### Cefoxitin sodium (cefoxitin and dextrose) [^51b0e2a3]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

1.7 Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci (excluding enterococci, e.g., Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, and Peptostreptococcus species.

1.8 Prophylaxis

Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing uncontaminated gastrointestinal surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, or cesarean section.

If there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate treatment may be instituted.

1.9 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefoxitin for Injection and Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^de143349]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

To complement the analysis of soluble immune effectors, we performed flow cytometry to quantify the immune cell types present during infection (Supplementary Figure 5). Nearly all immune cell types examined were significantly increased in the infected wounds compared to the healthy skin at 1 and 3 dpi (Supplementary Figure 6); and neutrophil infiltration correlated with neutrophil-related chemokine expression in the infected wounds compared to the mock-infected controls (Figure 7A and C). Notably, at 3 dpi, there were significantly more MHCII − macrophages in the infected wounds compared to mock-infected controls (Figure 7D). Despite the presence of significant immune infiltrates at 3 dpi, the E faecalis bacterial burden in the wounds persisted at >10 5 CFU.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that high-titer inocula, resulting in high-titer wound infection, is associated with an acute inflammatory response concomitant with the peak of infection. The resolution of acute high-titer infection to a lower steady-state infection at 3 dpi corresponds to a suppression of cytokine and chemokine levels but also the presence of immune cellular infiltrate, suggesting a complex immunomodulatory program that is insufficient to resolve acute E faecalis wound infection.

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sites of colonization and sampling—an overview: The gastrointestinal tract is the main site of VRE colonization, though VRE has been identified on the skin of colonized patients with diarrhea. Most studies have used gastrointestinal tract samples, and some studies have included surveillance cultures from other sites including throat and urine. While limited, data comparing the sensitivity of rectal and perirectal cultures suggest that both are comparable.

High-Titer E faecalis Infection Alters Wound Healing and Delays Wound Closure

Infection of wounds by P aeruginosa and S aureus correlate with delayed re-epithelization and wound healing. To determine whether E faecalis similarly affects wound healing, we performed histology on skin tissue obtained from wounds of infected mice at 7 dpi. Hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed a hyperthickened epidermis, indicative of nonprogressive wound healing, with delayed closure in the infected tissues, which was not seen in the wounded, mock-infected controls (Figure 6A and B). Moreover, we also observed large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in H&E stained infected samples as late as 7 dpi as compared to mock-infected controls (Figure 6A). In addition, granulation tissue, which is indicative of dermal healing, was not properly formed in infected wounds, whereas healing was visible in mock-infected controls (Figure 6A and B). Long-term persistence of E faecalis also resulted in delayed wound closure (Figure 6C). These observations show that high-titer E faecalis infection negatively affects the wound healing process and delays the onset of wound closure.

### Evaluation of sequential oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment ofBloodstream infections [^4b870b32]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) antibiotics have historically been considered standard of care for treatment of bloodstream infections (BSIs). Recent literature has shown sequential oral (PO) therapy to be noninferior to IV antibiotics for certain pathogens and disease states. However, a gap exists in the literature for BSI caused by Enterococcus faecalis .

Objective

To compare outcomes of definitive sequential PO therapy to definitive IV therapy in patients with E faecalis BSI.

Methods

Multicenter, retrospective, matched cohort study of adult patients with at least one blood culture positive for E faecalis from January 2017 to November 2022. Patients with polymicrobial BSI, concomitant infections requiring prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, those who did not receive antibiotic therapy, and those who died within 72 hours of index culture were excluded. Subjects were matched based on source of infection in a 2:1 (IV:PO) ratio. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), antibiotic duration, and 30-day readmission rate.

Results

Of the 186 patients who met criteria for inclusion, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary composite outcome for PO compared to IV therapy (14.5% vs 21.8%; OR 0.53 [0.23-1.25]) or 30-day readmission (17.5% vs 29%; OR 0.53 [0.25-1.13]). Hospital LOS was significantly longer in patients receiving IV-only therapy (6 days vs 14 days; P < 0.001).

Conclusion and Relevance

Sequential oral therapy for E faecalis BSI had similar outcomes compared to IV-only treatment and may be considered in eligible patients.

### Resistance mechanisms, epidemiology, and approaches to screening for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in the health care setting [^390f5465]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. Prompt identification of colonized patients combined with effective multifaceted infection control practices can reduce the transmission of VRE and aid in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Increasingly, the clinical microbiology laboratory is being asked to support infection control efforts through the early identification of potential patient or environmental reservoirs. This review discusses the factors that contribute to the rise of VRE as an important health care-associated pathogen, the utility of laboratory screening and various infection control strategies, and the available laboratory methods to identify VRE in clinical specimens.

### Triple threat: how diabetes results in worsened bacterial infections [^dec16595]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

The altered nutrient composition of the diabetic infection microenvironment contributes to increased bacterial burden and virulence during infections. Hyperglycemia, the hallmark symptom of uncontrolled diabetes, is a pivotal factor in worsening bacterial infections by serving as an ideal growth environment for pathogens. Individuals with poorly managed glycemic control exhibit elevated glucose concentrations in tissues and organs throughout the body. Glucose is the preferred carbon source of numerous bacterial pathogens, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and enterococcal species, which use glucose to fuel their growth and virulence potential. In line with these observations, individuals with diabetes exhibit a greater incidence of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) arising from Gram-positive cocci species than non-diabetic individuals. SSTIs pose a significant burden on patients with diabetes, leading to complications such as gangrene, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and sepsis. Diabetic SSTIs can range from mild skin infections to severe necrotizing fasciitis and most frequently manifest on the lower extremities, known as diabetic foot infections (DFIs). DFIs are particularly problematic, necessitating frequent hospitalizations and serving as the most common precipitating event to lower extremity amputations. Several bacterial pathogens exhibit increased growth and virulence potential during infection of hyperglycemic tissues, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae [group B streptococcus (GBS)]. Left untreated, infecting bacteria in DFIs can penetrate further into the tissue and cause the development of secondary infections, including osteomyelitis, which is the second leading cause of amputation in the United States.

Concomitant with the altered nutrient environment in diabetic tissues enhancing bacterial growth and virulence, diabetes is further associated with compromised immune responses. The immune suppression associated with diabetes manifests at various levels, ranging from diminished immune cell recruitment at infection sites to alterations in cytokine and chemokine profiles. Furthermore, diabetes impairs the metabolic mechanisms essential for free radical generation by professional phagocytes, including macrophages and neutrophils. The diminished phagocytic and antibacterial capabilities of professional phagocytes in diabetic infections are associated with increased infection rates by facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens. Notably, individuals with diabetes exhibit an increased incidence of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mTb) and Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agents of tuberculosis and melioidosis, respectively. Compared with non-diabetic individuals, those with diabetes experience a threefold higher incidence of infection by mTb and a fivefold increased rate of mortality associated with tuberculosis. Furthermore, individuals with diabetes exhibit an astounding 13-fold increased rate of infection by B. pseudomallei, which can be lethal despite antibiotic intervention.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^02828fe9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 7. 
Enterococcus faecalis modulates the soluble and cellular host response at the wound site. Mice were wounded and infected with 10 2 colony forming units (CFU) or 10 6 CFU of E faecalis, or mock infected with phosphate buffered saline. At the indicated times, wounds were processed into single cell suspensions and subjected to (A, B) cytokine analysis, shown in pg/mL. Total number of (C) neutrophils (CD45 + MHCII − CD11b + Ly6G +) and (D) macrophages (CD45 + MHCII − CD11b + Ly6C − CD64 +) infiltrating into and accumulating in the skin analyzed by flow cytometry. N = 2, n = 5. Error bars represent the standard error of mean. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test. * P <.05, ** P <.01, *** P <.001, **** P <.0001. Abbreviations: CCL, chemokine ligand; CSF, colony stimulating factor; CXC, C-X-C motif chemokine; IL, interleukin; N, biological replicates; n, technical replicates; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon.

To gain further insight into the spectrum of soluble factors that were most associated with E faecalis immune modulation during infection, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Figure 4C). The PCA profiles of wounds infected with 10 6 CFU at 8 hpi and 3 dpi were distinct and clustered separately, confirming that high inoculum infection results in a temporally distinct inflammatory profile (Supplementary Figure 4C). Differences in IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12p70, and CCL11 specifically explained the variation between the PCA profiles and best represented differences between all sample groups. Among these, IL-2, IL-12p70, and CCL11 were significantly decreased in the 10 6 CFU infected group when compared to the mock-infected controls, suggesting that down-regulation of these cytokines in particular may be associated with an attenuated immune response (Supplementary Figure 4B).

### Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci [^d73fa492]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Enterococci are common inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract. Although >40 enterococcus species exist, nosocomial infections are primarily caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococcal infections are the third most common cause of nosocomial infection in intensive care units (ICUs), and multidrug-resistant enterococcal infections have been associated with higher hospitalization costs and a higher number of related deaths.

Linezolid, 1 of the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobial drugs, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S subunit of 23S rRNA. In April 2000, linezolid was approved in the United States and has been heavily marketed to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. Although more expensive than vancomycin, linezolid does not require testing for adequate serum drug concentrations or dosing adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency, and it has been regarded by some healthcare providers as more effective than vancomycin in treating nosocomial pneumonia and MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (–). Most reports of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) have been individual cases or small case series (–) or have specifically described linezolid-resistant and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (LRVRE) (–). We describe a large hospital outbreak of LRE infections.

### Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients [^fc0f560b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile.

Objective

This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI).

Methods

This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted.

Results

A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events.

Conclusions

In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.

### Risk factors for and epidemiology of community-onset vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in southeast Michigan [^3c166eff]. American Journal of Infection Control (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Given the known link between vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREF) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), the recent increase in prevalence of VREF in southeast Michigan has raised concerns about the presence of a large "community" reservoir of VREF. Efforts to control its spread face some important challenges.

Methods

Patients with clinical isolates of community-onset (CO) VREF (cases) were compared with matched uninfected controls (study 1) and patients with hospital-onset (HO) VREF (study 2). Here, CO was defined as a hospital stay of ≤2 days before VRE isolation.

Results

Independent predictors for the isolation of CO-VREF compared with uninfected controls were nonhome residence; chronic skin ulcers; previous invasive procedures/surgery; exposure to cephalosporin, penicillin, and/or vancomycin; immunosuppressive status; and the presence of indwelling devices. Independent predictors for isolation of CO-VREF compared with HO-VREF included no stay in an intensive care unit in the previous 3 months and recent hospitalization. VREF isolation from wounds and aminoglycoside exposure were inversely associated with isolation of CO-VREF.

Conclusions

Health care-related exposures and antimicrobial exposures are risk factors for the isolation of CO-VREF. Regional infection control practices are imperative in controlling CO-VREF, in addition to the emergence and spread of VRSA.

### Daptomycin [^3b720b81]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro . This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.

Mechanism of Action

Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.

Resistance

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

Interactions with Other Antibacterials

In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

### Focus on the prophylaxis, epidemiology and therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections and a position paper on associated risk factors: the perspective of an Italian group of surgeons [^01cb4246]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Microbiological epidemiology

According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system reports, Gram-positive cocci (particularly S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp.), followed by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. are the most commonly encountered pathogens in SSIs. In most cases, the source of pathogens is the endogenous flora of the patient’s skin, mucous membranes, or hollow viscera. When mucous membranes or the skin are incised, the exposed tissues are at risk of contamination by endogenous flora. These micro-organisms are usually aerobic Gram-positive cocci (e.g. staphylococci), but may include fecal flora (e.g. anaerobic bacteria and Gram-negative aerobes) when incisions are made near the perineum or groin. Exogenous sources of SSI pathogens include surgical personnel (especially members of the surgical team), the operating room environment (including air), and all equipment, instruments, and materials brought to the sterile field during an operation. Exogenous flora consists primarily of aerobes, especially Gram-positive organisms (e.g. staphylococci and streptococci).

Table 1 presents the more frequent pathogens according to the surgical procedure.

Table 1 
More frequent pathogens according to the surgical procedure

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a versatile and dangerous bacterial pathogen, combining virulence, antibiotic resistance, and survival fitness. Its spread is facilitated by cross-transmission through health-care workers’ hands and selection pressure exercised by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. MRSA infections represent a substantial burden, because they increase treatment costs and can cause excess morbidity and mortality. Since MRSA carriers without symptomatic infection are an important reservoir and source of spread of infections, risk profiles to identify patients at high risk of carrying MRSA might improve prevention of MRSA infections.

The control of SSIs within the hospital is important, as is identifying patients at risk of being colonized and subsequently infected by multi-drug resistant microorganisms such as MRSA; surveillance itself, even without any specific intervention, has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of SSIs, which is another reason to recommend implementation of surveillance systems.

According to the new ABSSSI classification, erysipelas and cellulitis are mostly due to Gram-positive organisms whereas SSIs and subcutaneous abscesses are due to mixed flora including Gram-positive microbes.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci utilise antibiotic-enriched nutrients for intestinal colonisation [^1644dda3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are multidrug-resistant pathogens and a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide,. These hospital-acquired pathogens pose a major therapeutic challenge as they have intrinsic resistance to several commonly prescribed antibiotics and also have acquired resistance to many available antibiotics.

E. faecium and E. faecalis are responsible for 75% of enterococcal infections and are commonly associated with hospital outbreaks of invasive infections such as bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and endocarditis,,. E. faecalis was more virulent and more prevalent in healthcare-associated infections than E. faecium, however, the prevalence of E. faecium is increasing due to the rise of vancomycin-resistant and lactam-resistant E. faecium strains. E. faecium has higher levels of intrinsic and acquired resistance than E. faecalis, where 80% of E. faecium isolates are vancomycin-resistant compared to 10% of E. faecalis isolates. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium has gained attention as the World Health Organisation classified it as a high priority pathogen due to its unfavourable rankings in several criteria, including mortality, trends of resistance, transmissibility, preventability, treatability, and pipelines for new medicines and diagnostics.

Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) background—“Bacteria that have become resistant to the common antibiotics are referred to as multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).” “Some people may have an MDRO living on their skin or in their bodies but they are not ill. This is called being ‘colonized’ with an MDRO. People can be colonized with an MDRO intermittently or consistently.” “People with chronic medical conditions (e.g., cancer, kidney failure, and transplant recipients) are at highest risk of becoming colonized or infected with an MDRO.” “Vaccines are not available for the prevention of the MDROs described here.” For specific pathogens: “Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a well-known MDRO. MRSA is a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. Healthy individuals may be colonized with MRSA, and the bacteria may live inside their nostrils or on their skin.” “MRSA infections frequently involve the skin, causing boils, or abscesses. MRSA also can cause very serious diseases, including pneumonia, infection of the bones and joints, and abscesses deep within the body.” “MRSA can spread from person-to-person, especially when there is close contact with the infected fluid or pus that is draining.” “Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of some people and it can cause infection. VRE infections in children are rare, and they usually occur in people with chronic illnesses such as cancer.” “Multiple types of Gram-negative bacteria have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics… Studies have found many healthy people in the community are colonized with Gram-negative bacteria, but the bacteria usually are identified when a patient is hospitalized.”

### Enterococcus faecalis urinary-tract infections: Do they have a zoonotic origin? [^9816c313]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Major human pathogens are frequently isolated from meat-producing animals, particularly poultry. Among them is Enterococcus faecalis, which is known to be one of the main cause of human urinary-tract infections worldwide. Early in 2015, we detected several, consecutive abnormal increases in the weekly number of human E. faecalis infections in various medical settings in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France, especially including community-acquired urinary-tract infections. Speculating that this region-wide epidemiological event may have originated from animal-based food, we initiated this work to provide an overview of the epidemiology of E. faecalis, with a particular focus on the possible link between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and those responsible for human urinary-tract infections. At that time, only one study had clearly identified strong epidemiological links between E. faecalis clones isolated from food-producing animals and human E. faecalis urinary-tract infections. This observation, coupled with our region-wide epidemiological experience, leads us to strongly believe that E. faecalis is a real zoonotic pathogen with potentially highly significant impact on human health. This is of particular concern because of its ability to acquire antibiotic-resistance genes and to infect animals and humans. Various strategies must be urgently implemented to address this public health threat, in particular through the development and implementation of large integrated automated surveillance systems based on animal and human health data to enable us to detect E. faecalis epidemiological events.

### Excretion of vancomycin-resistant enterococci by wild mammals [^367a3386]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, enterococci have emerged as a major cause of nosocomial infections, ranging from urinary tract and wound infections to life-threatening bacteremia (–). Enterococci are well suited as nosocomial pathogens because they readily colonize skin and mucous membranes, survive well in the environment, tolerate temperatures from 10°C to 45°C, survive in acid and alkaline conditions, and are intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial drugs such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. The importance of this pathogen has been heightened by the emergence of multidrug-resistant enterococci, which has raised the specter of untreatable infections. Although a number of Enterococcus species exist, most human infections are caused by E. faecalis and E. faecium. E. faecium is isolated more frequently in Europe and E. faecalis in the United States. Among several phenotypes of glycopeptide resistance, VanA (teicoplanin and vancomycin resistance) and VanB (vancomycin resistance only) account for most resistant isolates. The genes encoding both VanA and VanB are transferable, inducible, and detectable in both E. faecalis and E. faecium.

We have recently shown that wild rodents can be a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria. We now present data on carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) by wild mammals.

### Microbiome-mediated fructose depletion restricts murine gut colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^6a51ef68]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO), including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), have become a major threat to public health, compromising our capacity to treat common infectious diseases and increasing the risk of hospital medical procedures. Enterococcus isolates, including VRE, are among the third- to fourth-most prevalent pathogens causing infections in hospitalized patients worldwide, and can potentially lead to lethal outcomes,. Because of its wide resistance to multiple antibiotics, which impairs its treatment, VRE is listed among top priority multidrug-resistant pathogens for which new therapies should be developed according to the World Health Organization. Consequently, novel antibiotics have been introduced to treat VRE infections. However, strains resistant to these new antimicrobials rapidly emerge,, which encourage the implementation of non-antibiotic strategies to prevent infections by this clinically challenging pathogen.

VRE can colonize hospitalized patients through contamination of skin wounds or catheters, which can lead to urinary tract infections or bacteraemia. In addition, VRE infections can frequently start by the colonization of the intestinal tract, a crucial step that is suppressed by commensal microbes inhabiting the gut (i.e. the microbiota). However, antibiotic therapies disrupt the microbiota, enabling VRE to colonize the intestinal tract to extremely high levels –. Subsequently, VRE dense colonization of the gut promotes its dissemination to the bloodstream,, and to other patients through faecal contamination of the environment,. Thus, the microbiota acts as a natural defence that prevents most of the potential infections that could be caused by VRE, while antibiotics enhance infections by allowing the first step of VRE gut colonization. Despite its clinical relevance, only a few studies have started to define the members of the microbiota that are key for conferring protection against VRE and the mechanisms providing such protection. Specifically, two studies showed that production of inhibitory molecules by specific commensal bacteria restricts VRE gut colonization,. Blautia producta, an anaerobic commensal bacterium, produces a lantibiotic that directly inhibits VRE growth in mice and in vitro,. Moreover, the presence of this lantibiotic is associated with lower VRE faecal levels in humans. Similarly, E. faecalis containing a conjugative plasmid expressing a bacteriocin clears VRE gut colonization in mice.

### A phase 3 study of the safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate in patients [^a6c84f42]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), a subset of complicated bacterial skin and skin structure infections, are serious infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. – ABSSSI include major cutaneous abscesses, cellulitis/erysipelas, and wound infections, and are usually monomicrobial infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, predominantly by Staphylococcus spp. – Other pathogens implicated in ABSSSI include Streptococcus pyogenes, and Gram-negative and anaerobic species.Several antibacterial agents are available for the treatment of ABSSSI; however, the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens has created a need for novel antibacterial therapies.

Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is frequently isolated in ABSSSI cases. From 2001 to 2009, the incidence of skin and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus in children increased by 123%, and hospitalizations for ABSSSI among children exceeded 70,000 per year in the United States (US). ABSSSI remains a frequent cause of morbidity; ABSSSI caused by MRSA continue to be prevalent globally and result in substantial morbidity and mortality, owing to the resistance of MRSA to multiple commonly used and readily available antibacterial therapies.

Tedizolid phosphate (Sivextro ® ; Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. Rahway, NJ, USA) is a next-generation oxazolidinone, administered as an oral or intravenous (IV) dose, that exhibits antibacterial activity via inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.

Tedizolid phosphate is indicated in adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age in multiple countries and regions, including the US and European Union (EU), for the treatment of ABSSSI caused by S. aureus (including MRSA), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus group (including S. anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus), and Enterococcus faecalis that are susceptible to tedizolid. – Studies have shown that tedizolid phosphate is an effective treatment for ABSSSI in this population.

Proportion of positive and negative culture results by source in critically Ill patients. The bar chart displays the distribution of positive and negative culture samples from various sources in critically ill patients. Respiratory samples had the highest positivity rate (69.0%), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI, 53.6%), intraabdominal sources (39.0%), and urinary samples (28.1%). Blood cultures demonstrated a relatively low positivity rate (10.1%), while central nervous system (CNS) cultures had the lowest positivity rate (4.5%). Device cultures showed a balanced distribution with 50.0% positive and 50.0% negative samples, though the total sample size was small (n = 8). Device infections were exclusively pacemakers and other cardiac device leads. These findings highlight the variability in culture positivity depending on the source, with respiratory and SSTI sources having the highest rates of culture-confirmed infections

Prostatic abscess is rare. Its potentially serious course requires a high level of clinical suspicion and prompt and effective treatment. The causative germs are usually either enterobacteria or Enterococcus. The authors highlight the importance of considering epidemiological and clinical aspects in the early diagnosis and treatment. Prostatic abscess due to community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus has three typical characteristics: skin entry point, periprostatic compromise, and anaemia and low prothrombin.

### Efficacy of current agents used in the treatment of Gram-positive infections and the consequences of resistance [^3d1bd251]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

The proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. Inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. In the USA in 2000, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system reported that >50% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The emergence of community-acquired MRSA is a new concern. MRSA are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. The increasing prevalence of MRSA contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. Newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus have been reported. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the USA. The two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the USA.

---

### Daptomycin (Cubicin RF) [^3691a1a4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4	Microbiology

Daptomycin belongs to the cyclic lipopeptide class of antibacterials. Daptomycin has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic, Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro spectrum of activity of daptomycin encompasses most clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Daptomycin exhibits rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro . This has been demonstrated both by time-kill curves and by MBC/MIC (minimum bactericidal concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) ratios using broth dilution methodology. Daptomycin maintained bactericidal activity in vitro against stationary phase S. aureus in simulated endocardial vegetations. The clinical significance of this is not known.

Mechanism of Action

Daptomycin binds to bacterial cell membranes and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. This loss of membrane potential causes inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.

Resistance

The mechanism(s) of daptomycin resistance is not fully understood. Currently, there are no known transferable elements that confer resistance to daptomycin.

Interactions with Other Antibacterials

In vitro studies have investigated daptomycin interactions with other antibacterials. Antagonism, as determined by kill curve studies, has not been observed. In vitro synergistic interactions of daptomycin with aminoglycosides, β-lactam antibacterials, and rifampin have been shown against some isolates of staphylococci (including some methicillin-resistant isolates) and enterococci (including some vancomycin-resistant isolates).

Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection (cSSSI) Trials in Adults

The emergence of daptomycin non-susceptible isolates occurred in 2 infected patients across the set of Phase 2 and pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of cSSSI in adult patients. In one case, a non-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a Phase 2 trial who received CUBICIN at less than the protocol-specified dose for the initial 5 days of therapy. In the second case, a non-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with an infected chronic decubitus ulcer who was enrolled in a salvage trial.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis and Other Post-Approval Trials in Adults

In subsequent clinical trials in adult patients, non-susceptible isolates were recovered. S. aureus was isolated from a patient in a compassionate-use trial and from 7 patients in the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. An E. faecium was isolated from a patient in a vancomycin-resistant enterococci trial.

### Identification of multiple iron uptake mechanisms in Enterococcus faecalis and their relationship to virulence [^c07a3604]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

Among the unfavorable conditions bacteria encounter within the host is restricted access to essential trace metals such as iron. To overcome iron deficiency, bacteria deploy multiple strategies to scavenge iron from host tissues, with abundant examples of iron acquisition systems being implicated in bacterial pathogenesis. Yet the mechanisms utilized by the major nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis to maintain intracellular iron balance are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation to identify and characterize the iron acquisition mechanisms of E. faecalis and to determine their contribution to virulence. Bioinformatic analysis and literature surveys revealed that E. faecalis possesses three conserved iron uptake systems. Through transcriptomics, we discovered two novel ABC-type transporters that mediate iron uptake. While inactivation of a single transporter had minimal impact on the ability of E. faecalis to maintain iron homeostasis, inactivation of all five systems (Δ5Fe strain) disrupted intracellular iron homeostasis and considerably impaired cell growth under iron deficiency. Virulence of the Δ5Fe strain was generally impaired in different animal models but showed niche-specific variations in mouse models, leading us to suspect that heme can serve as an iron source to E. faecalis during mammalian infections. Indeed, heme supplementation restored growth of Δ5Fe under iron depletion and virulence in an invertebrate infection model. This study revealed that the collective contribution of five iron transporters promotes E. faecalis virulence and that the ability to acquire and utilize heme as an iron source is critical to the systemic dissemination of E. faecalis.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^a7567901]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Wound infections affect between 7% and 15% of hospitalized people globally. Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species across all types of wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. In surgical site infections, E faecalis is the third most commonly isolated organism. E faecalis infections are increasingly difficult to treat due to their intrinsic and acquired resistance to a range of antibiotics. Despite the high frequency of E faecalis in wound infections, little is known about its pathogenic strategies in this niche.

Bacterial biofilms, which are often polymicrobial in nature, are a major factor in wound healing and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Moreover, biofilm formation promotes survival and persistence of infecting microbes because it facilitates defense against the host immune response. E faecalis encodes several factors that contribute to biofilm formation, including 2 sortase enzymes, SrtC and SrtA, which polymerize and attach endocarditis- and biofilm-associated pili to the cell wall, respectively. These pili aid in the attachment of E faecalis to surfaces, which is required in the initial stages of biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo during catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Other biofilm-associated factors that are attached to the cell wall by SrtA include Ace, aggregation substance, and Esp.

In addition to initial adhesion and colonization, E faecalis must also overcome host defenses to establish infection. E faecalis can modulate and evade the host immune response in a number of settings. Biofilm formation, along with expression of the SrtA substrate aggregation substance, can promote E faecalis survival within macrophages and neutrophils. The multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) protein of E faecalis confers resistance to antimicrobial peptides via electrostatic repulsion, and is important for surviving both neutrophil-mediated clearance and within epithelial cells and macrophages in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

Previously, a mouse wound excisional model was developed to study wound healing processes. This model has been used to examine bacterial factors required for wound infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In the current study, we characterized the dynamics of E faecalis infection in the model. We establish the minimal doses of E faecalis required for colonization and infection of wounds. We also demonstrate a role for the innate immune defense factor MprF in wound infection, and show that modulation of early inflammatory responses and delayed wound healing are coupled with persistence of E faecalis within wounds.

### Global spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from distinct nosocomial genetic complex [^c4c41dbd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have caused hospital outbreaks worldwide, and the vancomycin-resistance gene (vanA) has crossed genus boundaries to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Spread of VRE, therefore, represents an immediate threat for patient care and creates a reservoir of mobile resistance genes for other, more virulent pathogens. Evolutionary genetics, population structure, and geographic distribution of 411 VRE and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium isolates, recovered from human and nonhuman sources and community and hospital reservoirs in 5 continents, identified a genetic lineage of E. faecium (complex-17) that has spread globally. This lineage is characterized by 1) ampicillin resistance, 2) a pathogenicity island, and 3) an association with hospital outbreaks. Complex-17 is an example of cumulative evolutionary processes that improved the relative fitness of bacteria in hospital environments. Preventing further spread of this epidemic E. faecium subpopulation is critical, and efforts should focus on the early disclosure of ampicillin-resistant complex-17 strains.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^aeac151a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

An extensive literature review demonstrated some evidence in favour of using empirical therapy with enterococcal coverage for IAIs in the following cases: 1) immunocompromised patients or patients with hospital-acquired/post-operative cIAIs; 2) patients with cIAIs who have previously received cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum antibiotics selecting Enterococcus spp.; 3) patients with cIAIs and valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular material, at high risk of endocarditis. The ideal therapeutic regimen for these high-risk patients remains to be determined, but empirical therapy directed against enterococci should be considered.

Nearly all strains of E. faecalis, including some strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, are susceptible to ampicillin. In patients with IAIs, E. faecium is increasingly encountered, particularly in patients with hospital-acquired IAIs. In contrast to E. faecalis, nearly all strains of E. faecium are resistant to ampicillin and the growing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant strains is an area of concern, although the main clinical problem seems strictly related to BSIs. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher mortality for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium BSIs compared with vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium BSIs (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.17–1.82). For patients with VanA-type vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, linezolid or daptomycin are the preferred agents. Both linezolid and daptomycin have good in vitro activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium although higher daily doses are needed. For VanB-type resistant strains teicoplanin should be considered the preferred drug.

What are the optimal daily doses and modality of administration of antibiotics in patients with IAIs?

19. In patients with IAIs and sepsis or septic shock, appropriate dose and administration mode of antibiotics should include: 1) proper loading dose, 2) extended or continuous infusion for beta-lactams and 3) knowledge of the peritoneal/biliary penetration rate (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

20. Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit good penetration rate in the peritoneal exudate fluid. In critically ill patients, continuous infusion should be implemented to grant optimal PK/PD target attainment at the infection site (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Administering adequate doses of antibiotics should be based on the intrinsic pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of each antibiotic class, the specific agent, and the specific pathophysiologic characteristics of the patient.

### Biofilm-associated infection by enterococci [^6ca5d678]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Enterococci are ubiquitous members of the human gut microbiota and frequent causes of biofilm-associated opportunistic infections. Enterococci cause 25% of all catheter-associated urinary tract infections, are frequently isolated in wounds and are increasingly found in infective endocarditis, and all of these infections are associated with biofilms. Enterococcal biofilms are intrinsically tolerant to antimicrobials and thus are a serious impediment for treating infections. In this Review, we describe the spatiotemporal development of enterococcal biofilms and the factors that promote or inhibit biofilm formation. We discuss how the environment, including the host and other co-colonizing microorganisms, affects biofilm development. Finally, we provide an overview of current and future interventions to limit enterococcal biofilm-associated infections. Overall, enterococcal biofilms remain a pressing clinical problem, and there is an urgent need to better understand their development and persistence and to identify novel treatments.

### The rise of the Enterococcus: beyond vancomycin resistance [^326b5ee3]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The genus Enterococcus includes some of the most important nosocomial multidrug-resistant organisms, and these pathogens usually affect patients who are debilitated by other, concurrent illnesses and undergoing prolonged hospitalization. This Review discusses the factors involved in the changing epidemiology of enterococcal infections, with an emphasis on Enterococcus faecium as an emergent and challenging nosocomial problem. The effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and on colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci are highlighted, including how enterococci benefit from the antibiotic-mediated eradication of gram-negative members of the gut microbiota. Analyses of enterococcal genomes indicate that there are certain genetic lineages, including an E. faecium clade of ancient origin, with the ability to succeed in the hospital environment, and the possible virulence determinants that are found in these genetic lineages are discussed. Finally, we review the most important mechanisms of resistance to the antibiotics that are used to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

### A contemporary case series of Fournier's gangrene at a Swiss tertiary care center-can scoring systems accurately predict mortality and morbidity? [^fffe6798]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fournier’s gangrene (FG) is a life-threatening infection of the genital, perineal, and perianal regions first described by Fournier in 1883. The male to female ratio is reported as 10:1, with an incidence of 1:7500 to 1:750,000. Conditions leading to decreased host immunity and thus rapid spread of infection are considered predisposing factors. FG is a polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic infection caused by three or more pathogens and therefore classified as type 1 necrotizing tissue infection. Bacteroides fragilis is the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacterial pathogen, while Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis represent the most commonly isolated aerobic pathogens. In patients with diabetes mellitus, Streptococcus spp. Staphylococcus spp. and aerobic flora are regularly detected. The combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can lead to the production of several enzymes, such as collagenases and heparinases, which may result in tissue destruction and rapid progression of the infection. Thus, the combination of less pathogenic bacteria can develop high virulence in immunocompromised patients. The FG diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory findings. Patients usually present with classical signs of soft tissue infections of the scrotum, perineum, and/or perianal areas (Fig. 1). Additionally, gangrenous or necrotic tissue and skin areas may be visible. Leukocyte and C-reactive protein levels are usually elevated. Imaging can be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain. Early diagnosis is essential for the outcome, yet diagnosis is often delayed in this relatively rare disease, which in turn results in a delayed treatment start. Optimal multimodal treatment consists of hemodynamic stabilization and supportive intensive care if necessary, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, and extensive surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue. Modern reconstructive techniques, such as skin grafting and flaps, provide reliable coverage of significant tissue defects and acceptable cosmetic results. Despite the advancements in health care over the last decades, the mortality rates of FG still range between 3 and 67% even in developed countries. Several risk scores, like Fournier’s Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI), the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC), and the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), have been developed to predict survival and prognosis in FG. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report our experiences in treatment of FG in a Swiss tertiary care center and to assess the capability of three different scoring systems (FGSI, LRINEC, and NLR) to predict not only mortality, but also morbidity.

### Clindamycin phosphate (Cleocin phosphate) [^ba731f21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE products are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.

CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE products are also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibacterial drug-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).

Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial drug therapy.

CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:

Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis), and Staphylococcus aureus.

Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.

Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes.

Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms.

Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis), and susceptible anaerobes.

Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE and other antibacterial drugs, CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Early recognition of methicillin-resistantsurgical site infections using risk and protective factors identified by a group of Italian surgeons through Delphi method [^b55d2ceb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Predominant pathogens in surgical site infections

According to the NNIS system reports, the most commonly encountered pathogens in SSIs are Gram-positive cocci, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), and Enterococcus spp. followed by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. The source of pathogens is often the endogenous flora of the patient’s skin, mucous membranes, or hollow viscera. Microorganisms of endogenous flora are usually aerobic Gram-positive cocci (e.g. staphylococci), but may also include fecal flora (e.g. anaerobic bacteria and Gram-negative aerobes).

Exogenous sources of pathogens involved in SSIs include surgical personnel (especially members of the surgical team), the operating room environment (including air), and all tools, instruments, and materials brought to the sterile field. Exogenous flora consists primarily of aerobes, especially Gram-positive organisms (e.g. staphylococci and streptococci).

Besides S. aureus and CoNS, Staphylococcus epidermidis may be responsible for severe infections following implantation of any prosthesis in general surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopedics, etc. Such infections may require removal of the prosthesis.

Table 1 lists the more frequent pathogens, according to surgical procedure.

### The skin and soft tissue infections in hematological patients [^e7fe321f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Perianal infections

Perineal abscess is a severe soft tissue infection affecting immunocompromised patients, with an incidence rate up to 10% in leukemic patients with febrile neutropenia [▪▪]. Allogeneic HSCT recipients during the preengraftment period are susceptible to this complication, particularly those with a previous history of anorectal infections [▪▪]. Common clinical symptoms and signs include persistent fever, erythema, and swelling with or without fluctuation and fistula in the perianal region. As with other bacterial infections, local signs may be blunted in neutropenic patients, who usually present only with fever and perirectal pain. Coliform and enteric pathogens are the most frequent organisms recovered from blood cultures or local drainage, followed by P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. Mortality rate, even with antibiotic treatment and surgical debridement, can reach 2.4% [▪▪,].

Ecthyma gangrenosum

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important pathogen in neutropenic patients, causing 5–10% of bloodstream infections. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a form of necrotizing vasculitis usually caused by P. aeruginosa. This peculiar syndrome, typical of the hematological setting, is associated with high mortality and early recognition is crucial for guiding antibiotic treatment. The skin lesion(s) commonly presents as an erythema surrounded-nodule eventually evolving to a necrotic ulcer with a central black eschar (Fig. 1). A systematic review of 167 cases of ecthyma gangrenosum, described in literature from 1975 to 2014, reported P. aeruginosa as the primary pathogen isolated either in blood or skin specimen cultures (74% of cases, 59% with concurrent bloodstream infection); nevertheless other bacterial causes were detected in 17% of cases and fungi in 9%. In particular, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp. and Fusarium have been reported as possible causative agents other than P. aeruginosa. Ecthyma gangrenosum can appear anywhere in the body but most commonly affects the anogenital and axillary areas, followed by the extremities, trunk and face. In individuals with the bacteremic form of ecthyma gangrenosum, the source of infection and other localization (CVC or pneumonia) must be carefully looked for. Targeted antibiotic therapy may be sufficient, although surgical excision of necrotic lesions or abscesses might be necessary.

1.5 Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Infections

Linezolid Injection is indicated for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.6 Limitations of Use

• Linezolid Injection is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative infections. It is critical that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

• The safety and efficacy of Linezolid Injection formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studie s (14)].

1.7 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Linezolid Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Linezolid Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Evaluation of hospital-onset bacteraemia and fungaemia in the USA as a potential healthcare quality measure: a cross-sectional study [^22d78b22]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Sources of non-commensal HOB

For non-commensal HOB events, there was agreement on source between the primary and secondary reviewers in 1431/1789 (80%) (88% for community and 79% for academic hospital events), and partial agreement in additional 15% events. The most common sources of infection were gastrointestinal (including neutropenic translocation) (35%) and endovascular (32%), followed by respiratory (12%), urinary tract (10%) and skin and soft tissue (9%). No source could be identified in 17% of HOB events (14% adult and 35% paediatric) (figure 1 and online supplemental table 2). Among 622 events of gastrointestinal origin, 194 (31%) were attributed to neutropenic bowel translocation. Of 563 non-commensal HOB events with endovascular source, 488 (87%) were related to an intravascular catheter-related infection; 435 (77%) attributed to central line-related infection and 76 (14%) to a peripheral catheter. Specific types of central lines to which HOB events were attributed included peripherally inserted central catheter (155, 28%), tunnelled line or implanted port (157, 28%) and temporary central line (132, 23%). Three per cent (60/1789) of non-commensal HOB events were considered contaminated blood cultures (online supplemental table 1).

Distribution of major sources of hospital-onset bacteraemia and fungaemia (HOB) events, stratified by non-commensal and commensal organisms. *Includes neutropenic translocation.

Non-commensal HOB sources also varied by organism (online supplemental table 3); endovascular and skin and soft tissue were the top sources for S. aureus, and gastrointestinal and endovascular for Candida spp and Enterococcus spp. Among gram-negative bacteria, sources varied among Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Likewise, S. aureus was the most frequent organism among HOB events of endovascular (38%), skin and soft tissue (63%) and bone and joint (77%) origin while E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp were most frequent among HOB events from gastrointestinal and urinary sources.

### The mortality burden of multidrug-resistant pathogens in India: a retrospective, observational study [^9fc56b7c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To evaluate patient mortality in relation to MDR, we conducted multivariate logit regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, hospital location, and specimen source. For overall analyses, patients with multiple organisms were collapsed to a single row and the highest resistance level was used. Sub-analyses were conducted for each pathogen, as well as groups of pathogens (ie, Gram-negative and Gram-positive), and were restricted based on the clinical significance of specific specimen sources and the availability of mortality data. Enterococcus infections were restricted to bloodstream, CSF, and urinary infections, based upon previous studies demonstrating significant clinical outcomes among patients with bacteriuria of Enterococcus spp. Because the 2 most common Enterococcus spp.— Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium —can have distinct antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, we analyzed each species separately. Regression models were clustered at the hospital level to account for differences between hospitals in management and treatment of infections. All analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^fc674adf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

### Revision of the diagnostic criteria for infective endocarditis is needed-please Do It thoroughly [^2c994989]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

—We read the Viewpoint by Dahl and coworkers with great interest. We believe that more extensive revisions of the Duke criteria are required than the one suggested.

Dahl and coworkers argue that Enterococcus faecalis should be regarded as a “typical endocarditis bacterium,” and thus, if found in 2 blood cultures, a major Duke criterium even if the infection has nosocomial acquisition and known primary focus. They propose a revision of the Duke criteria that, applied to a previously reported cohort, would increase the sensitivity when the assessment is used by the endocarditis team as a reference. It is noteworthy that it has been shown that infective endocarditis (IE) is uncommon in E. faecalis bacteremia with nosocomial acquisition and known origin of infection.

There are several problems in the way that Dahl and coworkers interpret the Duke criteria and the proposed revision of them. The first is that the proposed change would render all non- faecalis enterococci “nontypical endocarditis bacteria.” The consequence of this has not been addressed.

The second is that Dahl and coworkers erroneously regard the term “community acquisition” as if this would exclude healthcare-associated acquisition. When the Duke criteria were published in 1994 and revised 2000, it was clear that the term “community acquisition” should be regarded as non-nosocomial. This misclassification introduces a false increase in the sensitivity.

The third problem is the broad definition of the “portal of entry.” Thus, E. faecalis in a urinary culture would be sufficient to classify a patient as having a urinary tract infection. This also risks exaggeration of the sensitivity.

The fourth problem is that the type of E. faecalis bacteremia is not considered. It is not mentioned that monomicrobial bacteremia has high risk of IE, whereas polymicrobial bacteremia has a very low risk of IE.

### Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to describe the microbial characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers at a tertiary medical center in south China [^c87fa58d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Here, we simultaneously analyzed the DFUs wound samples by the mNGS and culture-based method. The concordance rate of positive detection between the two approaches was 83.3%, meaning that the microorganisms identified by the routine culture method were mostly identified in the mNGS sequencing results. Moreover, mNGS identified more 64 strains of microorganisms in this study. Enterococcus faecalis was the most common microorganism in all the mNGS results. Enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive bacterium and is one of the most prevalent microorganisms in several chronic infections. Li et al. reported that Enterococcus faecalis is the second most common in DFUs. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic multidrug-resistant pathogen because of its biofilm development, which causes persistent DFUs infection. In all culture-based analyses, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common microorganism in DFUs. Staphylococcus aureus is also a gram-positive bacterium, and it often causes severe wound infection. The virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, leukocidins, enterotoxins, and exfoliatins, seriously damage the tissue, and the appearance of multidrug-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, negatively impacts treatment and ultimately hinders wound healing.

We further summarized the characteristic distributions of microorganisms of the 3 subtypes of DFUs. The results of the two approaches showed several distinct constitutions. Given the more abundant results of mNGS, mNGS results might be more admissible than those of routine culture method. In mNGS analyses, Enterococcus faecalis was the most common microorganism in each DFU subtype, while Finegoldia magna was also the most common microorganism in A-DFUs and M-DFUs. Finegoldia magna is an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium that commensally colonizes the skin. Due to the difficulties of obtaining good-quality specimens and laboratory incubation of Finegoldia magna, its incidence in clinical analyses of infections was mostly underestimated. Ariane Neumann et al. found that Finegoldia magna was able to activate neutrophils to release reactive oxygen species and initiate host defense mechanisms. When the skin barriers are destroyed, Finegoldia magna might become an opportunistic pathogen that could cause opportunistic invasive infections. The distinct descriptions of microorganism distributions in DFUs subtypes can provide individualized diagnosis, which helps clinicians quickly understand the potential pathogens in several subtypes. We also plan to collect more samples to for further analysis according to Wagner classification to provide additional descriptions of every DFUs subtype.

### Vancomycin-resistant enterococci: consequences for therapy and infection control [^4be944a1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens, initially in the USA, but now also in Europe, where hospital outbreaks are being reported with increasing frequency, although the incidence of VRE infections remains extremely low in most European countries. The recently demonstrated in-human transmission of vancomycin resistance from VRE to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in two American patients underscores the potential danger of a coexisting reservoir of both pathogens. As MRSA is already endemic in many European hospital settings, prevention of endemicity with VRE seems relevant, but should be balanced against the costs associated with the implementation of effective strategies. The presence of a large community reservoir of VRE in Europe could hamper the feasibility of infection control strategies. Although the prevalence of colonisation amongst healthy subjects has apparently decreased after the ban on avoparcin use in the agricultural industry, a large proportion of admitted patients are still potential sources of VRE transmission. With no risk profile available to identify these carriers, effective screening, followed by barrier precautions for carriers, seems to be impossible. Recent studies, however, have suggested that hospital outbreaks are almost exclusively caused by specific genogroups of VRE that can be characterised phenotypically and genotypically (e.g., co-resistance to ampicillin and the presence of the variant esp gene). Based on our own experience, we propose that VRE infection control programmes should be restricted to patients colonised with these VRE strains. If such a strain is cultured from a clinical sample, surveillance amongst contact patients is recommended and barrier precautions should be implemented in the case of documented spread.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^56788b54]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Pressure ulcers are localized areas of tissue necrosis that tend to develop when soft-tissue is compressed between a bony prominence and an external surface for a prolonged period of time. The damage may be relatively minor, or it may lead to massive destruction of deeper tissues. The majority of pressure ulcers develop in areas adjacent to the ischium, sacrum, and greater trochanter. Pressure ulcers represent a frequent problem especially in frail elderly patients with chronic co-morbidities. When infection occurs, it is typically polymicrobial and includes aerobes (S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp.) and anaerobes (Peptococcus spp. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens).

Combination of surgical and antibiotic interventions may be required to manage infected decubitus ulcers. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove necrotic tissue. Antibiotic therapy should be used for patients with severe pressure ulcer infections, including those with spreading cellulitis or patients with systemic signs of infection. Because such infections usually are polymicrobial, therapeutic regimens should be directed against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative organisms as well as anaerobic organisms. In many cases of pressure ulcers, correct wound care management can largely prevent the occurrence of these infections.

### Sign of the times: updating infective endocarditis diagnostic criteria to recognize Enterococcus faecalis as a typical endocarditis bacterium [^d6618d01]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The modified Duke criteria requires that Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia must be both community-acquired and without known focus in order to be considered a microbiological "Major" diagnostic criterion in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. We believe that the microbiological diagnostic criteria should be updated to regard E. faecalis as a "typical" endocarditis bacterium as is currently the case, for example, viridans group streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Using data from a prospective study of 344 patients with E. faecalis bacteremia evaluated with echocardiography, we demonstrate that designating E. faecalis as a "typical" endocarditis pathogen, regardless the place of acquisition or the portal of entry, improved the sensitivity to correctly identify definite endocarditis from 70% (modified Duke criteria) to 96% (enterococcal adjusted Duke criteria).

### Vancomycin hydrochloride (sterile vancomycin hydrochloride) [^1242d125]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant (beta-lactam-resistant) staphylococci. It is indicated for penicillin-allergic patients, for patients who cannot receive or who have failed to respond to other drugs, including the penicillins or cephalosporins, and for infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible organisms that are resistant to other antimicrobial drugs. Vancomycin is indicated for initial therapy when methicillin-resistant staphylococci are suspected, but after susceptibility data are available, therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

Vancomycin hydrochloride is effective in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis. Its effectiveness has been documented in other infections due to staphylococci, including septicemia, bone infections, lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and skin-structure infections. When staphylococcal infections are localized and purulent, antibiotics are used as adjuncts to appropriate surgical measures.

Vancomycin hydrochloride has been reported to be effective alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside for endocarditis caused by S. viridans or S. bovis . For endocarditis caused by enterococci (e.g., E. faecalis), vancomycin hydrochloride has been reported to be effective only in combination with an aminoglycoside.

Vancomycin has been reported to be effective for the treatment of diphtheroid endocarditis. Vancomycin has been used successfully in combination with either rifampin, an aminoglycoside, or both in early-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis or diphtheroids.

Specimens for bacteriologic cultures should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to vancomycin.

The parenteral form of Sterile Vancomycin Hydrochloride may be administered orally for treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis. Parenteral administration of vancomycin hydrochloride alone is of unproven benefit for these indications. Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of infection.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of vancomycin and other antibacterial drugs, vancomycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Porcine-origin gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in humans, Denmark [^1d67d438]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a life-threatening infection that involves the endocardial surface or vascular structures in proximity to the heart. Its intrinsic resistance to a number of antimicrobial drugs makes enterococcal infective endocarditis cumbersome to treat. For decades, the mainstay has been the combination of a cell wall–active agent (ampicillin, penicillin, or vancomycin) and gentamicin. However, high-level resistance to gentamicin hinders the bactericidal activity of combination therapy and increases the likelihood of clinical and microbiologic failure and even death.

High-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) Enterococcus faecalis has been associated with the hospital setting and prior healthcare exposure, which suggests the existence of a healthcare reservoir. Nevertheless, enterococci are gut commensals in humans and warm-blooded animals; therefore, reservoirs of HLGR E. faecalis conceivably might exist in the community not directly linked to the healthcare setting.

During 2000–2002, the proportion of HLGR E. faecalis isolates increased from 2% to 6% in the pig population in Denmark (–), which coincided with the emergence of HLGR E. faecalis isolates among patients with infective endocarditis in North Denmark Region. We undertook this study to determine whether pigs are a source of E. faecalis infections in humans.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: a short case series [^db6409bf]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Because VRE, particularly E. faecium strains, exhibit resistance to many antimicrobials traditionally used to target vancomycin-susceptible isolates, the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs remains a challenge for the clinician. Indeed, no drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with VRE UTIs, and reliable clinical data about the optimal management of VRE UTIs are lacking in the scientific literature. Among the therapeutic options to be considered are those that have demonstrated activity against VRE in vitro, including older agents such as doxycycline, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin and newer agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin–dalfopristin, and tigecycline.

Daptomycin is a bactericidal cyclic lipopeptide approved by the FDA for the management of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible isolates of a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and for the management of bacteremia, including that associated with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus. Although the approved use of daptomycin in enterococcal infections is limited to the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible isolates of E. faecalis, 100% and 99.7% of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, were susceptible to daptomycin in more than 700 nonurinary VRE strains collected in the United States between 2007 and 2008. The daptomycin minimal inhibitory concentration required for 90% inhibition (MIC 90) of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis was determined to be 1 μg/mL, whereas that for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 2 μg/mL. The use of daptomycin is a particularly promising pharmacotherapeutic approach against VRE UTIs because 50% to 70% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine 24 hours after intravenous administration compared with 30% to 40% for linezolid, 15% to 19% for quinupristin–dalfopristin, and 20% to 30% for tigecycline. Moreover, another case series has described the successful use of daptomycin in patients with VRE UTIs.

### Evaluation of patients' skin, environmental surfaces, and urinary catheters as sources for transmission of urinary pathogens [^bcc77745]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

In hospitalized patients with urinary tract infection or asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary pathogens frequently contaminate skin, high-touch environmental surfaces, and urinary catheters. Contamination is more common in patients with a urinary catheter in place and with gram-positive pathogens. Patients' skin and environmental surfaces may provide an important source for transmission of urinary pathogens.

### Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [^b410996f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

First isolated in the late 1980s, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have rapidly become established as important nosocomial pathogens in the United States. In some hospitals, VRE are responsible for >20% of enterococcal infections.

Given the complex genetic machinery required to confer vancomycin resistance, de novo emergence of resistance is unlikely in an individual patient. Thus, newly detected VRE may represent either acquisition of resistant organisms (or genes) or expansion of preexisting but undetected populations of VRE with which the patient is colonized. The likelihood of nosocomial VRE may vary with time and space, according to the endemicity of VRE in a specific location (i.e. colonization pressure) and to the duration of hospitalization (i.e. time at risk). Indeed, initially most VRE isolates were recovered from patients in intensive-care units (ICUs); later VRE became more prevalent in patients on other wards. Certain coexisting conditions, e.g. malignancies, organ transplants, and chronic renal failure, were found to be associated with increased risk for VRE, as were exposure to contaminated equipment and proximity to a VRE carrier (–).

METHODS

Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions

E. faecalis type 2 was used to evaluate the polysaccharide component of the conjugates. To study the protein component in the conjugate we used the vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate E. faecium 11236/1. For cross-reactivity tests, the enterococcal strains used are listed in Figure 1. Strains were grown at 37°C in tryptic soy agar (Carl Roth). For polysaccharide purification E. faecalis type 2 was grown in Columbia broth (Becton-Dickinson) with 2% glucose at 37°C until an OD 600 of 0.8 was reached. For production of recombinant proteins, Escherichia coli M15/pQE30 protein-gene strains were cultured under shaking at 37°C in Luria/Miller medium (Carl Roth) supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL kanamycin.

### Enterococcus faecalis modulates immune activation and slows healing during wound infection [^41a4f5ba]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

MprF Contributes to E faecalis Fitness During Wound Infection

To determine E faecalis factors involved in wound colonization and infection, we examined the fitness of previously described biofilm factors as well as factors involved in immune defense (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 3). In single species and competitive infections, we found that a Δ srtAC double mutant strain defective in biofilm formation was not attenuated in fitness during coinfection at 8 hpi or 3 dpi (Supplementary Figure 3B–D). Because we observed overt inflammation after high-dose E faecalis infection in wounds, we predicted that resistance to host immune killing may be important for its survival. E faecalis encodes 2 paralogues of MprF. To address the contribution of these gene products to fitness in wounds, we coinfected mice with wild-type E faecalis OG1X and OG1RF Δmprf1/2, and found that OG1RF Δmprf1/2 was significantly less fit during coinfection at 3 dpi, but not at 8 hpi (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 3A). OG1RF Δmprf1/2 was not attenuated in single species infection (Supplementary Figure 3D). Together, these results suggest that traditional biofilm-associated factors may be less important for E faecalis wound infection than its ability to resist immune defense mechanisms.

Multiple peptide resistance factor (MprF) contributes to fitness during Enterococcus faecalis wound infection.

### Precision identification of diverse bloodstream pathogens in the gut microbiome [^a7c14446]. Nature Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

A comprehensive evaluation of every patient with a bloodstream infection includes an attempt to identify the infectious source. Pathogens can originate from various places, such as the gut microbiota, skin and the external environment. Identifying the definitive origin of an infection would enable precise interventions focused on management of the source 1,2 . Unfortunately, hospital infection control practices are often informed by assumptions about the source of various specific pathogens; if these assumptions are incorrect, they lead to interventions that do not decrease pathogen exposure 3 . Here, we develop and apply a streamlined bioinformatic tool, named StrainSifter, to match bloodstream pathogens precisely to a candidate source. We then leverage this approach to interrogate the gut microbiota as a potential reservoir of bloodstream pathogens in a cohort of hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients. We find that patients with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections have concomitant gut colonization with these organisms, suggesting that the gut may be a source of these infections. We also find cases where typically nonenteric pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, are found in the gut microbiota, thereby challenging the existing informal dogma of these infections originating from environmental or skin sources. Thus, we present an approach to distinguish the source of various bloodstream infections, which may facilitate more accurate tracking and prevention of hospital-acquired infections.

### Enterococcal bacteriophage: a survey of the tail associated lysin landscape [^fe8ee971]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The antibiotic resistance crisis is a major global health threat, with a predicted potential 10 million deaths annually by 2050 if unchecked. One particular bacterial genus that has contributed to this crisis is the enterococci, Gram-positive bacteria that normally inhabit the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) of humans as well as other animals such as reptiles, fish and insects. GIT colonization by enterococci is achieved through multiple factors such as genome plasticity, nutritional adaption and antimicrobial production and resistance. As a pathogen, they are commonly involved in human wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, urinary tract infection (UTI) as well as recalcitrant endodontic dental infections. Until 1984 enterococci were classified as Streptococcus but were reclassified into their own genus, with the two main species associated with human diseases being Enterococcus faecalis and faecium. These organisms the first to become resistant to the glycopeptide antibiotic of last resort Vancomycin in 1986- classed as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). These have now spread worldwide and have been recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as high priority to be targeted and investigated for new antimicrobials.

### Infectious complications following snakebite byin Martinique: a case series [^e5da3008]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 4 
Bacteriological characteristics of wound infection following snakebite described in the literature

The main involved bacteria are A. hydrophila (Gram-negative bacilli), recognized to cause soft tissue infections and necrotizing fasciitis. Aeromonas hydrophila is generally found in sewage, freshwater, stagnant water, and feces. Other bacteria such as M. morganii have also been isolated in abscesses after B. lanceolatus bite. They are also found in the mouth and on the fangs of these viperids. Staphylococci, group D streptococci, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, involved in wound infection, have been also isolated from the mouth of viperid species. Serratia marcescens is rarely isolated from cellulitis following snakebite but may be responsible for bullous cellulitis. By contrast, Staphylococcus aureus is not commonly isolated from the snake mouth, suggesting that if the organism causes post-snakebite infections, it probably originates from the patient’s skin rather than having been inoculated by the snake fangs. Therefore, strict disinfection of the bite site should systematically be performed.The snake mouth is colonized by bacteria which can be transmitted to the bitten patient through the skin injury associated with the bite.Inoculation of bacteria from the mouth, fangs, or venom of B. lanceolatus following a bite can cause local infection with abscess and necrotizing fasciitis in the most severe cases, as described in other cases of snakebites.Based on the most frequently isolated bacteria in the snakebite site according to the literature (Table 4), active antibiotics include third-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin–tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Conformingly, in one recent study, isolated Enterobacteriaceae following snakebite infection showed 69% resistance to ampicillin, 60% resistance to amoxicillin–clavulanate, and 66% resistance to second-generation cephalosporins.By contrast, bacteria were sensitive to ceftriaxone in 97% of the cases and sensitive to ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides in 100% of the cases. Enterococcus faecalis showed 92% sensitivity to ampicillin and amoxicillin–clavulanate and 100% sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. A recent experimental study examining the bacteria sampled from the oral cavity of 26 B. lanceolatus specimens collected from various areas in Martinique supported that microbiota from B. lanceolatus oral cavity was polymicrobial.The most frequently isolated bacteria were A. hydrophila (present in 50% of the samples), M. morganii, K. pneumoniae, Bacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility revealed that 67% of the isolated bacteria were resistant to amoxicillin–clavulanate. By contrast, most of the isolated bacteria were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins (i.e. 73% to cefotaxime and 80% to ceftazidime). Similar data were also reported in the oral microbiota of snakes from Brazil and India.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^ff50769f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Glycopeptides have been for many years the microbiological agents of choice used in complicated Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft-tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended, such as linezolid and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It has the advantages of early intravenous-to-oral switch with the oral preparation having very high bioavailability and excellent tissue penetration.

In 2010, an open-label study compared oral or intravenous linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for treatment of cSSTIs caused by MRSA. Patients receiving linezolid had a significantly shorter length of stay and duration of intravenous therapy than those receiving vancomycin. Both agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were similar to each drug’s established safety profile.

Recently, a Cochrane meta-analysis included all randomized controlled trials comparing linezolid with vancomycin in the treatment of SSTIs. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical (risk ratio [RR] = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03–1.16) and microbiological cure rate in adults (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16). For infections caused by MRSA, linezolid was significantly more effective than vancomycin in clinical (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03–1.17) and microbiological cure rates (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32).

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin. Although inpatient treatment with linezolid cost more than inpatient treatment with vancomycin per day, the median length of hospital stay was 3 days shorter with linezolid.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft tissue infections that range in virulence from very mild to limb/life threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations are varying and subject to controversy. Antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

### Genome-based analysis of Enterococcus faecium bacteremia associated with recurrent and mixed-strain infection [^6a59415f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Fourteen patients fulfilled the criterion for recurrence, and 10 patients fulfilled the criterion for putative mixed VREfm and VSEfm infection, with no overlap of cases between the two groups. Seven of the patients had mixed infection with other bacterial species, as shown in Data Set S1 in the supplemental material. Cross-referencing these 24 patients with the bacterial freezer archive identified 44 isolates from 21 patients (12 patients with recurrence and 9 patients with mixed VREfm and VSEfm infection), who were the basis for this study. Clinical data for the 21 cases were collected from paper and computerized medical records using a standardized form, including the suspected focus of infection, underlying comorbidities, and dates of positive and negative blood cultures. Neutropenia was defined as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count of less than 500 cells/μl within 24 h of the onset of bacteremia. The focus of infection was defined based on clinical, radiological, and microbiological features. Bacteremia was determined to be secondary to an intravascular device (i) if a positive intravascular catheter tip semiquantitative culture yielded more than 15 CFU ofwith an antibiogram identical to that of the blood culture isolate (definite) or (ii) if no other focus of infection was identified in the presence of an intravascular catheter and/or if clinical signs of sepsis improved after line removal (probable). For neutropenic patients with no definite clinical focus, mucosal translocation was presumed to be the origin of the bacteremia, based on the definition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In cases of recurrent infection, a focus was considered persistent if there was an unresolved deep source of infection or if a potentially infected intravascular catheter was not removed between episodes of bacteremia. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the local Research Ethics Committee (reference no. 13/EE/0044), and the need for informed consent was waived.

### Risk factors for vancomycin-resistant enterococci infection and mortality in colonized patients on intensive care unit admission [^2707705a]. American Journal of Infection Control (2012). Low credibility.

This study examined the incidence of and risk factors for development of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infection and death in VRE-colonized patients in a medical intensive care unit. VRE colonization was identified in 184 patients (17.6%) in whom VRE perianal swab cultures were obtained. Of these, 28 (11.9%) developed VRE infection. Control of infectious sources is crucial to decrease development of VRE infections and optimize the survival of VRE-colonized patients.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci co-colonization [^6275eb61]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is that investigators were unable to determine the species of the VRE isolates. Historically, Enterococcus faecalis has been more likely to be associated with conjugation events and subsequent VRSA colonization or infection compared with E. faecium. However, only 3 VRSA cases are known, and we are not aware of any biologic explanation for why E. faecium would be less likely to be involved in transmission of vancomycin resistance to MRSA compared with E. faecalis. Still, these data would have been useful and informative. A previous, hospitalwide study at UMMC suggested that among isolated VRE, the prevalence of E. faecium and E. faecalis were 87%, and 13%, respectively.

In summary, these data describe a high prevalence of patients co-colonized with VRE and MRSA on admission to an ICU at a tertiary-care hospital, none of whom would have been detected by clinical culture. Risk factors for VRE and MRSA co-colonization are also described. Given that many of these patients were discharged to other institutions, treating physicians and infection control personnel must be cognizant of the risks for VRSA colonization and infection and use appropriate precautions. Appropriate methods to rapidly detect co-colonized patients must be identified to suppress the emergence of VRSA; limit patient-to-patient transmission of MRSA, VRE, and VRSA; and prevent endemic VRSA colonization in healthcare institutions.

Table 14 Cure Rates at the Test-of-Cure Visit for Microbiologically Evaluable Adult Patients with Diabetic Foot Infections

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcal Infections

Adult patients with documented or suspected vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection were enrolled in a randomized, multi-center, double-blind trial comparing a high dose of linezolid (600 mg) with a low dose of linezolid (200 mg) given every 12 hours either intravenously (IV) or orally for 7 to 28 days. Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam or aminoglycosides. There were 79 patients randomized to high-dose linezolid and 66 to low-dose linezolid. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population with documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection at baseline consisted of 65 patients in the high-dose arm and 52 in the low-dose arm.

The cure rates for the ITT population with documented vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection at baseline are presented in Table 15 by source of infection. These cure rates do not include patients with missing or indeterminate outcomes. The cure rate was higher in the high-dose arm than in the low-dose arm, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

### Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin [^d4daa98f]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole.

Data Sources

Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included.

Data Synthesis

Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia.

Conclusions

The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.

### Modulation of virulence within a pathogenicity island in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis [^0c83ece2]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Enterococci are members of the healthy human intestinal flora, but are also leading causes of highly antibiotic-resistant, hospital-acquired infection. We examined the genomes of a strain of Enterococcus faecalis that caused an infectious outbreak in a hospital ward in the mid-1980s (ref. 2), and a strain that was identified as the first vancomycin-resistant isolate in the United States, and found that virulence determinants were clustered on a large pathogenicity island, a genetic element previously unknown in this genus. The pathogenicity island, which varies only subtly between strains, is approximately 150 kilobases in size, has a lower G + C content than the rest of the genome, and is flanked by terminal repeats. Here we show that subtle variations within the structure of the pathogenicity island enable strains harbouring the element to modulate virulence, and that these variations occur at high frequency. Moreover, the enterococcal pathogenicity island, in addition to coding for most known auxiliary traits that enhance virulence of the organism, includes a number of additional, previously unstudied genes that are rare in non-infection-derived isolates, identifying a class of new targets associated with disease which are not essential for the commensal behaviour of the organism.

### Consequences of excluding Enterococcus faecium as a typical endocarditis pathogen in the Duke-ISCVID criteria: endocarditis is endocarditis even if the bacterium is uncommon [^19a2f1fb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Consequence of the Dukes-ISCVID 2023 reclassification of E.faecium on IE, data from the Swedish Registry for Infective Endocarditis 2008–2023. Abbreviations: IE, infective endocarditis; ISCVID, International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases.

The sensitivity of the ISCVID-Duke criteria thus decreases when E. faecium is excluded from the “typical endocarditis pathogens.” The Duke-ISCVID criteria chose to include nosocomially acquired Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia with known focus as a major criterion, although IE is known to be rare in this condition. The argument for including E. faecalis was that the sensitivity of the criteria increased.

Our observations on E. faecium endocarditis point to the fact that it does not matter if a bacterium is a common or a rare cause of IE when the patient has IE as determined by echocardiography and concomitant bacteremia. We propose that the diagnostic criteria for IE could be revised so that patients fulfilling major imaging criteria and having significant bacteremia, irrespective of species, should be regarded as definite IE. In cases with negative imaging, the propensity of the bacterium to cause IE should be considered as well as other minor criteria.
