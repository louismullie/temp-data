## Question

Yeast UTI treatment regimen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about yeast UTI treatment regimens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing colonization from true infection and defining the clinical syndromes. Then, I should verify first-line therapy choices and dosing by syndrome, including renal dosing. Next, I will examine alternatives for resistant organisms and special scenarios like obstruction or fungus balls. After that, I need to check duration of therapy and when to repeat cultures. Finally, I should confirm what not to use, address pediatric nuances, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats about evidence quality and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because I need to ensure we are treating true infection rather than contamination or colonization. Candiduria is common in hospitalized patients, especially with catheters, diabetes, or antibiotics, and most cases are asymptomatic and benign, so I should verify symptoms, repeat a clean-catch or catheterized specimen, and look for pyuria and colony burden while remembering that colony counts are not reliably diagnostic for infection versus colonization [^7caa59d3] [^d7dd9523] [^a1bef9e4]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: in critically ill patients, candiduria can be a marker for invasive candidiasis, so I should maintain vigilance and consider imaging if systemic features are present or if obstruction is suspected [^a1bef9e4] [^baaa4218].

> Next, I should categorize the clinical syndrome, because treatment hinges on site and severity. Let me think about three buckets: asymptomatic candiduria, symptomatic cystitis, and ascending pyelonephritis or perinephric involvement, with a fourth category of fungus balls or obstructing mycelial masses that require procedural management. I should confirm that asymptomatic cases generally do not require antifungal therapy unless the patient is high risk or undergoing urologic instrumentation, whereas symptomatic lower tract disease warrants treatment and upper tract disease demands systemic therapy plus source control if obstructed [^616d4783] [^6e1c5b26] [^a1bef9e4].

> For asymptomatic candiduria, I need to ensure I prioritize removing predisposing factors rather than prescribing drugs. The IDSA recommends eliminating catheters when feasible and observing, reserving treatment for select high-risk scenarios such as neutropenia, neonates, or patients about to undergo urologic procedures, because spontaneous resolution is common and overtreatment drives resistance without clear benefit [^616d4783] [^7caa59d3] [^c766f6df]. Wait, let me verify the nuance: in critically ill patients, candiduria may herald invasive disease, so I should assess for systemic signs and consider blood cultures and imaging if clinically indicated rather than reflexively treating the urine alone [^a1bef9e4] [^baaa4218].

> For symptomatic Candida cystitis, fluconazole is first-line because it achieves urine concentrations roughly 10–20 times serum levels and is available in oral and IV formulations. I should confirm dosing as 200 mg loading on day 1, then 100–200 mg daily for at least 4 days, extending to 7–14 days if response is slow or if the patient is immunocompromised, and I should remember that non-albicans species like C. glabrata may have higher MICs and variable susceptibility, which may influence response and duration [^f77ab5ea] [^b36de55b] [^72bd862a]. Hold on, I should verify renal dosing: fluconazole is renally cleared, so dose reduction is needed if creatinine clearance is below 50 mL/min, and I should double-check that before finalizing the regimen [^4c89d91c].

> For Candida pyelonephritis or upper tract involvement, I should confirm that systemic therapy and source control are mandatory. Fluconazole 200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks is recommended for fluconazole-susceptible organisms, with the higher end favored in severe disease or C. glabrata, while fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata warrants amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days with or without flucytosine 25 mg/kg four times daily, and C. krusei should be treated with amphotericin B given intrinsic fluconazole resistance [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961]. I need to ensure I emphasize source control: relieving obstruction, draining abscesses, and removing or replacing infected hardware are critical steps that materially affect outcomes, and I should not forget to image the kidneys and collecting system when upper tract disease is suspected [^6e1c5b26] [^94757292].

> But wait, what if there is a fungus ball or obstructing mycelial mass? I should confirm that surgical or endoscopic removal is central to management, with adjunctive systemic antifungals per the above regimens and, if a nephrostomy tube is present, local amphotericin B irrigation at 25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water. I need to ensure I do not rely on irrigation alone without addressing the obstructing lesion, as recurrence is common without definitive source control [^94757292] [^6e1c5b26].

> I should double-check alternatives when fluconazole is unsuitable or resistance is present. Flucytosine achieves high urinary concentrations but should generally be combined with amphotericin B to mitigate resistance and is limited by myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. Echinocandins have minimal urinary penetration and are not preferred for isolated lower tract disease, though they may be considered in systemic candidiasis with urinary involvement when fluconazole is contraindicated or resistance is a concern, recognizing the evidence base is limited [^72bd862a] [^a8edd216] [^ce1d3721]. Hold on, I should verify that lipid formulations of amphotericin B do not achieve adequate urine levels for UTI treatment, reinforcing the preference for deoxycholate when amphotericin is used for urinary disease [^72bd862a].

> Next, I should review duration and follow-up, and I need to ensure I align with guideline ranges while individualizing. For symptomatic cystitis, 7–14 days is reasonable, with extension if immunocompromised or if response is suboptimal. For pyelonephritis, 2 weeks is standard, and for fungus balls, therapy continues until the obstruction is relieved and cultures clear, often beyond 2 weeks in complicated cases. I should confirm that repeating urine cultures is not routinely required after asymptomatic candiduria management, but after treating symptomatic infection, a follow-up culture around 7–14 days is sensible to document clearance, especially in complex hosts [^6e1c5b26] [^b36de55b].

> I will now examine what not to do, because overtreatment is common. Asymptomatic candiduria should not be treated with antifungals in most patients, bladder irrigation with amphotericin B is generally discouraged for routine candiduria due to high recurrence and limited benefit, and echinocandins should not be first-line for isolated lower tract disease given poor urinary levels. I should also remember that echinocandins are preferred for candidemia and invasive candidiasis except in CNS, eye, and urinary tract infections, which underscores their limited role here [^616d4783] [^72bd862a] [^cdcb9a5b].

> Let me consider special populations, and I should confirm pediatric nuances. In neonates and young infants, candiduria may reflect disseminated candidiasis and warrants systemic therapy and imaging for fungus balls. In children with cUTI, fungal etiologies are uncommon but possible, and management principles mirror adults with attention to renal function and source control. I need to ensure dosing is weight-based and that I consult pediatric infectious diseases for complex cases or non-albicans species [^baaa4218] [^2ee308e5].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, confirm candiduria with a properly collected specimen and assess symptoms and risk factors. If asymptomatic, remove catheters and observe, treating only if high risk or pre-procedure. If symptomatic cystitis, use fluconazole 200 mg load then 100–200 mg daily for 7–14 days, adjusting for renal function. If pyelonephritis or systemic features, use fluconazole 200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks or amphotericin B-based regimens for resistant species plus source control. If a fungus ball is present, arrange urologic intervention and add systemic therapy with local irrigation as indicated. Throughout, reassess at 7–14 days in symptomatic cases and tailor therapy to culture results and clinical response, recognizing that much of the evidence is low quality and expert opinion–based [^6e1c5b26] [^72bd862a] [^7caa59d3].

For yeast UTIs (candiduria), **treat only if symptomatic or high-risk** (e.g. immunocompromised, neutropenic, neonates, or before urologic procedures) [^616d4783] [^7caa59d3]. Fluconazole is **first-line**: 200 mg loading dose, then 100–200 mg daily for 7–14 days for cystitis; 200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks for pyelonephritis [^b36de55b] [^6e1c5b26]. For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata or C. krusei, use amphotericin B 0.3–0.6 mg/kg/day for 1–7 days, with or without flucytosine 25 mg/kg QID [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961]. Remove indwelling catheters when possible; bladder irrigation is not recommended [^616d4783] [^72bd862a]. Asymptomatic candiduria generally does not require treatment unless high-risk [^616d4783] [^7caa59d3].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment is **not routinely indicated** for asymptomatic candiduria; however, certain high-risk scenarios warrant therapy:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Dysuria, frequency, urgency, flank pain, or fever [^6e1c5b26].
- **High-risk patients**: Immunocompromised, neutropenic, neonates, or patients undergoing urologic procedures [^616d4783] [^7caa59d3].
- **Obstructive uropathy**: Presence of fungus balls or urinary tract obstruction [^94757292].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Before initiating treatment, confirm the diagnosis and assess severity:

- **Urine culture**: Obtain a clean-catch or catheterized specimen to confirm Candida species and colony count [^a1bef9e4].
- **Imaging**: Renal ultrasound or CT scan if obstruction or fungus balls are suspected [^a1bef9e4].
- **Blood cultures**: If systemic infection or candidemia is suspected [^notfound].

## Antifungal treatment regimens

### Fluconazole (first-line therapy)

Fluconazole is the **preferred agent** due to its excellent oral bioavailability, high urinary concentrations, and favorable safety profile [^f77ab5ea].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Regimen** |
|-|-|
| Cystitis (lower tract) | 200 mg loading dose, then 100–200 mg orally once daily for 7–14 days [^b36de55b] [^f77ab5ea] |
| Pyelonephritis (upper tract) | 200–400 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961] |
| Fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata or C. krusei | Amphotericin B 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily for 1–7 days, ± flucytosine 25 mg/kg orally QID [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961] |

---

### Alternative antifungal agents

- **Amphotericin B**: 0.3–0.6 mg/kg IV daily for 1–7 days for fluconazole-resistant species or severe infections [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961].
- **Flucytosine**: 25 mg/kg orally QID for 2 weeks; use with caution due to myelosuppression and resistance risk [^6e1c5b26] [^ce1d3721].
- **Echinocandins**: Not recommended for urinary tract infections due to poor urinary penetration [^a8edd216] [^cdcb9a5b].

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Catheter management**: Remove or replace indwelling catheters whenever feasible [^616d4783].
- **Obstruction management**: Surgical or endoscopic intervention for fungus balls or obstructive uropathy [^94757292].
- **Bladder irrigation**: Generally not recommended due to limited efficacy and high recurrence rates [^72bd862a].

---

## Duration of therapy

Duration depends on the **clinical scenario**:

- **Cystitis**: 7–14 days [^b36de55b].
- **Pyelonephritis**: 2 weeks [^6e1c5b26].
- **Fungus balls**: 2–6 weeks, individualized based on response and source control [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Repeat **urine cultures** after completion of therapy to ensure eradication, and monitor for **adverse effects** — including hepatotoxicity with fluconazole and nephrotoxicity with amphotericin B.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Fluconazole is first-line; dosing is weight-based (3–6 mg/kg/day) [^6e1c5b26].
- **Pregnancy**: Fluconazole is contraindicated; topical azoles are preferred for vulvovaginal candidiasis [^1ceac9e1].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Longer treatment durations and closer monitoring are recommended [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Treat only symptomatic or high-risk patients**: Avoid treating asymptomatic candiduria unless high-risk [^616d4783] [^7caa59d3].
- **Fluconazole is first-line**: 200 mg loading dose, then 100–200 mg daily for 7–14 days for cystitis; 200–400 mg daily for 2 weeks for pyelonephritis [^f77ab5ea] [^6e1c5b26].
- **Use amphotericin B for resistant species**: 0.3–0.6 mg/kg/day for 1–7 days, ± flucytosine [^6e1c5b26] [^24566961].
- **Remove catheters and address obstruction**: Essential adjuncts to therapy [^616d4783] [^94757292].

---

Fluconazole is **first-line** for yeast UTIs, with amphotericin B for resistant species; treat only if symptomatic or high-risk, and always address catheters and obstruction.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^b36de55b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

### Nosocomial candiduria: a review [^7caa59d3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Fungal infections of the urinary tract, especially those caused by Candida species, are becoming increasingly common. Often the line between Candida colonization and infection is blurred. Diagnosis typically depends on the discovery of pyuria with high colony Candida counts in the urine. To date, there have been few studies to have addressed treatment regimens for patients with candiduria. Fluconazole has become a mainstay of therapy; however, questions regarding when to treat, whom to treat, and how long to treat are still largely unanswered. Asymptomatic nosocomial candiduria does not frequently require treatment intervention, because morbidity is low and ascending infection and candidemia are rare complications. Treatment decisions are driven by an understanding of the anatomic site of infection. For Candida cystitis, the first-line treatment is fluconazole, given orally. Ascending pyelonephritis usually requires the administration of a systemic antifungal agent and often requires correction of the obstruction or surgical drainage. More research is needed to define diagnostic criteria and therapeutic pathways. This review will attempt to summarize the state of the art of diagnosis and management of candiduria.

Symptomatic ascending Candida pyelonephritis — recommended antifungal regimens and urinary tract interventions are as follows: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days with or without oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, monotherapy with oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 2 weeks, could be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Elimination of urinary tract obstruction is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who have nephrostomy tubes or stents in place, consider removal or replacement, if feasible (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^dffd6966]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

### Best practices in treatment of fungal urinary tract infections [^d4210566]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Fungal pathogens within the urine, specifically Candida species, are a common finding amongst hospitalized patients. Risk factors for the development of candiduria involve patients with indwelling urinary drainage devices, surgical patients, patients undergoing urologic instrumentation, and diabetic patients. Candiduria often presents with an asymptomatic course but can also be a severe life-threatening process. This article will review the epidemiology and risk factors associated with fungal urinary tract infections, and the diagnosis and categorization of these infections along with a review of current medical and surgical treatments for this condition.

---

### Candiduria [^d7dd9523]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Candiduria is a common finding. Yeasts can be detected in urine that is contaminated during collection, in patients who have bladder colonization, and in patients who have upper urinary tract infection that developed either from retrograde spread from the bladder or hematogenous spread from a distant source. Most patients with candiduria are asymptomatic. The rate of development of complications is not known but appears to be low; candidemia rarely results from asymptomatic candiduria unless obstruction is present or instrumentation of the urinary tract is done. Unfortunately, there are no established diagnostic tests that reliably distinguish infection from colonization. Guidelines for the treatment of candiduria, based almost entirely on anecdotal reports and expert opinions, rather than controlled clinical trials, have been suggested by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Until reliable methods to distinguish infection from colonization are developed, further treatment trials are unlikely to provide information to guide the clinician in the treatment of candiduria.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^72bd862a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Candida urinary tract infection (UTI) — first-line antifungal therapy and the role of bladder irrigation are described as follows: Fluconazole is the drug of choice for treating Candida UTI. Flucytosine demonstrates good activity against many Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei, but treatment with flucytosine is limited by its toxicity and the development of resistance when it is used as a single agent. Amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate is active against most Candida species, although some C. krusei isolates are resistant; lipid formulations of AmB appear to not achieve urine concentrations that are adequate to treat UTI and should not be used. Irrigation of the bladder with AmB deoxycholate resolves candiduria in 80%–90% of patients, but recurrent candiduria within several weeks was very common; this approach is useful only for bladder infections and generally is discouraged, especially in patients who would not require an indwelling catheter for any other reason.

### Diagnosis and management of fungal urinary tract infection [^396935f9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

When the terms funguria or fungal urinary tract infection are used, most physicians are referring to candiduria and urinary tract infections due to Candida species. Other fungi, including yeasts and molds can involve the kidney during the course of disseminated infection, but rarely cause symptoms referable to the urinary tract. Candida species appear to be unique in their ability to both colonize and cause invasive disease in the urinary tract. This overview focuses only on candiduria and Candida urinary tract infection because they are common and many times present perplexing management issues.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^24566961]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2016 guideline — symptomatic ascending Candida pyelonephritis management includes: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days, with or without oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, monotherapy with oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 2 weeks, could be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Elimination of urinary tract obstruction is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who have nephrostomy tubes or stents in place, consider removal or replacement, if feasible (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^901cd514]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

### Treatment of fungal urinary tract infection [^c766f6df]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Funguria, and particularly candiduria, is an increasingly common problem encountered by the practicing urologist and is associated with high-acuity care, indwelling catheters, diabetes mellitus, antibiotic and steroid use, and urinary tract disease. In most cases, candiduria is asymptomatic and follows a benign clinical course with antifungal therapy only required in symptomatic or high-risk cases, because spontaneous resolution is common in patients with asymptomatic colonization. Rarely, invasive infections can occur (such as fungus balls or renal abscesses) and may require percutaneous and endoscopic interventions. This article highlights the workup and treatment of funguria and its related urologic manifestations.

### Candida urinary tract infections – treatment [^b0262900]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In many instances a report from the clinical laboratory indicating candiduria represents colonization or procurement contamination of the specimen and not invasive candidiasis. Even if infection of the urinary tract by Candida species can be confirmed, antifungal therapy is not always warranted. Further investigation may reveal predisposing factors, which if corrected or treated, result in the resolution of the infection. For those with symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), the choice of antifungal agent will depend upon the clinical status of the patient, the site of infection, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent. Because of its safety, achievement of high concentrations in the urine, and availability in both an oral and intravenous formulation, fluconazole is preferred for the treatment of Candida UTIs. Flucytosine is concentrated in urine and has broad activity against Candida spp, but its use requires caution because of toxicity. Low-dose amphotericin B may be useful for Candida UTIs in selected patients. The role of echinocandins and azoles that do not achieve measurable concentrations in the urine is not clear. Small case series note some success, but failures have also occurred. Irrigation of the bladder with antifungal agents has limited utility. However, with fungus balls, irrigation of the renal pelvis through a nephrostomy tube can be useful in combination with systemic antifungal agents.

Triazoles — class activity and key fluconazole pharmacology are detailed: fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole demonstrate similar activity against most Candida species, although each azole has less activity against C. glabrata and C. krusei; in large clinical trials, fluconazole demonstrated efficacy comparable to amphotericin B deoxycholate for candidemia and is considered standard therapy for oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vaginal candidiasis, as well as urinary tract infections; fluconazole is readily absorbed, with oral bioavailability yielding concentrations equal to approximately 90% of those achieved by intravenous administration; among triazoles, fluconazole has the greatest cerebrospinal fluid and vitreous penetration, achieving concentrations of > 70% of those in serum; fluconazole achieves urine concentrations that are 10–20 times the concentrations in serum and is the preferred treatment option for symptomatic cystitis; all azoles can inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes to some degree, necessitating attention to drug interactions when adding or removing an azole.

Urinary tract Candida fungus balls — management recommendations state that surgical intervention is strongly recommended in adults (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Antifungal treatment as noted above for cystitis or pyelonephritis is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Irrigation through nephrostomy tubes, if present, with amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate, 25–50 mg in 200–500 mL sterile water, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). The evidence summary notes that in adults, surgical or endoscopic removal of the obstructing mycelial mass is central to successful treatment, while in neonates some series document resolution with antifungal treatment alone but others found that endoscopic removal was necessary; fungus balls in the bladder and lower ureter usually can be removed endoscopically.

Section 2: Background on definitions of CAUTI

The clinical diagnosis of CAUTI is often a diagnosis of exclusion, making it difficult to have a standardized definition. At present, all of the available definitions have substantial limitations. We discuss the criteria, advantages, and limitations of different definitions used for CAUTI in Table 4.

The optimal definition for CAUTI used for surveillance and quality improvement is one that only captures true instances of symptomatic infection that would benefit from antimicrobial treatment. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been adopted nationally, but other definitions are also used for clinical care and administrative purposes. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been updated in 2015 with exclusion of yeast as a pathogen and increase in the urine-culture bacterial threshold to ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to align with a clinical definition for symptomatic CAUTI.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^655a5797]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Insights into the use of a short-course strategy for the treatment of candidemia.

In recent years, the incidence of candidemia originating from the urinary system has been increasing annually, primarily occurring in patients with urinary stones following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This procedure can lead to the disruption of the ureteral or renal mucosal barriers, allowing Candida to enter the bloodstream and cause systemic dissemination. These patients are at risk of developing septic shock due to candidemia and often require treatment in the ICU. Once their hemodynamics stabilize and shock is alleviated, they are typically transferred back to the urinary surgery department for further treatment. In our recent observations, none of the 63 patients in this category completed the "full-course" treatment for candidemia, with an average treatment duration of only 9 days. Furthermore, only 31.7% of these patients received de-escalation therapy. However, none of them experienced recurrence of candidemia or mortality (Table 1). All patients included in our study underwent ureteroscopic procedures to relieve urinary tract obstructions and had no immunosuppressive conditions, thus benefiting from the shorter treatment course. In the future, we aim to further identify patient groups that can benefit from shorter treatment courses and strive for individualized adjustments to antifungal therapy.

### The paradox of the evidence about invasive fungal infection prevention [^ed57eceb]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are characterized by high morbidity and mortality in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. Attributable mortality due to Candida spp. infections ranges from about 42 to 63%. Data from large observational and retrospective studies show an association between early antifungal treatment and improved survival. Updated clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis have been recently published.

In 2006, Playford et al. published a Cochrane systematic review investigating the use of antifungal agents for prevention of IFIs in non-neutropenic critically ill patients. In that review, the outcome of proven IFI was defined as a clinical illness consistent with the diagnosis and either histopathological evidence of IFI or a positive fungal culture from one or more sterile site specimens (including blood). Notably, funguria (as indicated by a positive urine fungal culture), in the absence of a complicated urinary tract infection, and fungal esophagitis were classified not as IFIs but as superficial fungal infections. The review included 12 studies and 1606 patients, and the use of antifungal agents was associated with a mortality reduction of about 25% and with an IFI reduction of about 50%. Recently, we updated the original review by Playford et al. including 22 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2761 patients. We modified the definition of the outcome-proven IFI excluding positive culture of Candida spp. from the respiratory tract, even in the presence of systemic or respiratory signs of infection, and classifying it as colonization instead of IFI. Untargeted antifungal treatment, encompassing prophylactic, pre-emptive, and empiric regimens, was not associated with a significant mortality reduction (moderate-quality evidence). However, antifungal agents reduced IFIs by about 45% with low-grade-quality evidence. From these data, three clinical questions may arise.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^eb19bc7b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Single Dose

Vaginal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

Multiple Dose

SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF DIFLUCAN (FLUCONAZOLE) IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

The daily dose of DIFLUCAN for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

Esophageal candidiasis:

The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

Systemic Candida infections:

For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis:

For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^cdcb9a5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection — echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

### Probiotic agents to protect the urogenital tract against infection [^71b11304]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

The urogenital microflora of a healthy woman comprises approximately 50 species of organisms, which differ in composition according to reproductive stages and exposure to several factors, including antibiotics and spermicides. Infections are very common with > 300 million cases of urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast vaginitis worldwide per annum. At the time of infection in the bladder and vagina, the urogenital flora is often dominated by the infecting pathogens, in contrast with healthy phases when indigenous organisms dominate. Premenopausal women have a flora of mostly lactobacilli, and certain properties of these strains, including adhesive ability and production of acids, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide, and biosurfactants, appear important in conferring protection to the host. Efforts to artificially restore an unbalanced flora with the use of probiotics have met with mixed results but research aimed at selecting scientifically based strains could well provide a reliable alternative treatment and preventive regimen to antibiotics in the future.

Systemic Candida infections: For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used.

Urinary tract infections and peritonitis: For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 mg to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients.

Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: The recommended fluconazole daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg, once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils cells/mm³) should start fluconazole prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia, and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells/mm³.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^38cfbfed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Candida urinary tract infections – epidemiology [^baaa4218]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Candiduria is rarely present in healthy individuals. In contrast, it is a common finding in hospitalized patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs) who often have multiple predisposing factors, including diabetes mellitus, indwelling urinary catheters, and exposure to antimicrobials. Candiduria occurs much less commonly in the community setting. In a majority of episodes in adult patients in critical care facilities candiduria represents colonization, and antifungal therapy is not required. However, the presence of yeast in the urine can be a sign of a disseminated infection. In the critically ill newborn, candiduria often reflects disseminated candidiasis and is accompanied by obstructing fungus ball formation in the urinary tract. In ICU patients, although candiduria is a marker for increased mortality, it is only rarely attributable to Candida urinary tract infection.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^abdfb248]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bloodstream infections represent a formidable clinical challenge and are associated with major morbidity and mortality worldwide with 2.9 million deaths per year worldwide. Bloodstream infections can result from various reasons, including primary bacteremia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and infections secondary to other foci such as the urinary tract, respiratory tract, or intra-abdominal sites. Blood culture is the reference standard for detection of these micro-organisms in blood. The etiological agents are diverse, encompassing Gram-positive bacilli (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and fungi (e.g. Candida species).

The treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections has long involved the use of antibiotics, and longer-term antibiotic regimens is still the standard of care. The aim was to ensure complete eradication of the bacterial from the bloodstream and deep-seated foci of infection, also to prevent relapse or recurrence of the infection. However, in recent years, concerns have been mounting regarding the consequences of extended antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat. Prolonged use of antibiotics in the treatment of bloodstream infections is a significant contributor to the selection and spread of resistant organisms. Extended antibiotic courses increase the likelihood of emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial, which can lead to treatment failures and the need for more toxic and expensive alternative therapies. Additionally, longer antibiotic regimens are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. These may include allergic reactions, organ toxicity (such as hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity), and secondary infections, particularly Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, which can further complicate the patient's clinical course and prolong hospitalization.

### Flucytosine (Ancobon) [^ce1d3721]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ANCOBON is indicated only in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida and/or Cryptococcus.

Candida: Septicemia, endocarditis and urinary system infections have been effectively treated with flucytosine. Limited trials in pulmonary infections justify the use of flucytosine.

Cryptococcus: Meningitis and pulmonary infections have been treated effectively. Studies in septicemias and urinary tract infections are limited, but good responses have been reported.

ANCOBON should be used in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of systemic candidiasis and cryptococcosis because of the emergence of resistance to ANCOBON (see MICROBIOLOGY).

### Fluconazole [^e8613b63]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fluconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole tablets were also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing fluconazole tablets for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing fluconazole tablets to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis: Fluconazole tablets are also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a8edd216]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Echinocandins — spectrum, administration, and outcomes: Caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin are available only as parenteral preparations, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the echinocandins are low for most Candida species, including C. glabrata and C. krusei; however, recent case series have described treatment failures with resistant strains of C. glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis demonstrates innately higher MICs, raising concern it may be less responsive. Each of these agents has been studied for esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis and has demonstrated efficacy, and pooled randomized-trial analyses in almost exclusively nonneutropenic patients suggest a survival advantage associated with initial echinocandin therapy. All echinocandins have minimal adverse effects, are administered once daily intravenously, and achieve therapeutic concentrations in all infection sites with the exception of the eye, CNS, and urine.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^d43ebe27]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Economic evaluation suggested that, on average, a strategy of antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective and more costly than no prophylaxis. The incremental cost was £99 per UTI avoided (table 3). There was a 60% chance that prophylaxis would be cost-effective should society be willing to pay £200 to avoid a UTI. The incremental cost per QALY over 12 months was £5059 (as determined by the cost-utility analysis). In the probabilistic analysis, the likelihood that use of prophylaxis would be considered cost-effective at a threshold value of £20 000 per QALY was 64%. Adjustment for utility values that were recorded at the time of UTI gave similar results. A probabilistic sensitivity evaluation from the willingness to pay analysis suggested that use of prophylaxis has a 66% chance of being considered more efficient and would give a higher net benefit than a no prophylaxis strategy if society was prepared to pay £200 or more to avoid a UTI.

Table 3
Results of deterministic and probabilistic cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analyses

19 (9%) participants in the prophylaxis group reported 22 non-serious adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (table 4) and 13 (6%) of these 19 participants changed their originally selected agent or stopped prophylaxis during the 12-month trial. The incidence of adverse events with all three drugs used for prophylaxis was similar. At each of the 3-monthly reviews, less than 10% of participants in the prophylaxis group perceived adverse effects to be due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. At the time of UTI, 28 (14%) of 203 participants in the prophylaxis group reported ever having adverse events due to treatment antibiotics versus 60 (30%) of 201 participants in the no prophylaxis group — predominately nausea (20 [10%] of 203 vs 38 [19%] of 201), diarrhoea (13 [6%] of 203 vs 31 [15%] of 201), and candida infection (ten [5%] of 203 vs 19 [10%] of 201). The low numbers of adverse events in each category precluded statistical analysis.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^76ea8269]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be the most cost-effective treatment. Three-day regimens of ciprofloxacin, 250 mg twice daily, and ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily, were recently compared with three-day trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy. 3, 11 The oral fluoroquinolones produced better cure rates with less toxicity, but at a greater overall cost. Continuous daily prophylaxis with one of these regimens for a period of six months: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one-half tablet per day; nitrofurantoin, 50 to 100 mg per day; norfloxacin, 200 mg per day; cephalexin, 250 mg per day; or trimethoprim, 100 mg per day. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated.

Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen. 11 The total duration of therapy need not exceed 14 days, regardless of the initial bacteremia. Patients with persistent symptoms after three days of appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated by renal ultrasonography or computed tomography for evidence of urinary obstruction or abscess. In the small percentage of patients who relapse after a two-week course, a repeated six-week course is usually curative.
11. Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days.

Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications. The recommended duration of therapy for severe infections is 14 to 21 days. Treatment is not recommended for catheterized patients who have asymptomatic bacteriuria, with the following exceptions: patients who are immunosuppressed after organ transplantation, patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis and patients who are about to undergo urinary tract instrumentation.

### Urinary tract aspergillosis in a patient with chronic kidney disease [^55427401]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Management of urinary tract aspergillosis remains a therapeutic challenge in clinical settings. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend a combined therapy of medical and urological management for renal aspergillosis, and voriconazole has been recommended for parenchymal disease. However, it is uncertain whether voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B (AmB) formulations and the echinocandins could be used in the treatment of urinary tract aspergillosis as all exhibit poor urinary concentrations.

Nevertheless, these antifungal regimens have been used successfully in the treatment of urinary tract fungal infection in a few case reports. In our patient, AmB formulations and voriconazole were limited due to its nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, and itraconazole and caspofungin did not show favourable efficacy. Though cystoscopy was performed to remove the fungal ball, the patient still complained of flocculi in the urine, and the obstruction of ureter was revealed by ultrasonography. Posaconazole was then commenced. The patient recovered gradually with no relapse at 13-month follow-up. There are two possible reasons for our successful antifungal treatment. First, recent studies revealed that posaconazole provides a high concentration in renal tissue, and the levels of which could be 40-fold higher than serum levels. Though it is generally assumed that posaconazole penetration in the urine is low, since the elimination occurs primarily through faecal excretion (77%) and to a lesser extent through urinary excretion (14%), only 0.28% of active drug is eliminated in the urine. However, owing to the several surgeries our patient underwent, including cystoscopy, bilateral pelviostomy and drainage, which may lead to the physiological barrier of renal parenchyma and renal pelvis broken, the patient might achieve high concentration of posaconazole in urine. The second possible reason was that the source of infection of our patient was both in renal tissue and bladder, since the flocculi were still found in urine after the fungal ball removed. According to a recent study, while fungal balls are found in the ureters, the disease originates in or involves the renal parenchyma, and our successful treatment of posaconazole support it.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. On the basis of clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 4). Approximately 10%–20% of women will have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^8cbc4c81]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The hospital mortality and the proportion of patients with candidaemia were chosen as the main outcomes of this meta-analysis because they are the most specific clinically relevant outcomes of invasive fungal infections. There were no missing data for these two main outcomes in the included studies. The other outcomes assessed in this study included the proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi, the proportion of patients requiring rescue therapy by systemic amphotericin B treatment, the proportion of patients with an adverse effect requiring cessation of the study drug, the proportion of patients with fungal infections other than urinary tract infection, and the total length of hospital stay. Urinary fungal infection is difficult to distinguish from colonisation, and for this reason these infections were excluded from further analyses in the present study. The definition of prophylaxis failure requiring amphotericin B treatment varied between different studies, but the common definition involved clinical deterioration with positive fungal culture from blood, deep tissue, or sputum.

Statistical analyses

The differences in categorical outcomes between the treatment group and the placebo group were reported as the relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI), using a random effect model. The difference in the total length of hospital stay between the fluconazole group and the placebo group was reported as weight mean difference in days, using a random effect model. The presence of heterogeneity between trials was assessed by chi-square statistics and the extent of inconsistency was assessed by I² statistics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment and one study that recruited some medical patients in the trial. The publication bias was assessed by funnel plot using hospital mortality as an endpoint.

### The use of prophylactic fluconazole in immunocompetent high-risk surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^c5620bfb]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

There was a good overall consistency in the results, without significant heterogeneity. The use of prophylactic fluconazole was associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients with candidaemia (RR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06–0.72, P = 0.01; I² = 0%) and fungal infections other than lower urinary tract infection (RR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.24–0.65, P = 0.0003; I² = 0%), but was associated with no significant difference in hospital mortality (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.62–1.08, P = 0.15; I² = 7%) (Figures 2, 3, 4). The proportion of patients requiring systemic amphotericin B as a rescue therapy for systemic fungal infection was lower after prophylactic use of fluconazole (RR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.17–0.72, P = 0.004; I² = 0%). The proportion of patients colonised with or infected with fluconazole-resistant fungi (RR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.22–1.96, P = 0.46; I² = 0%) (Figure 5) and the proportion of patients with adverse events leading to cessation of the study drug (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.22–2.58, P = 0.65; I² = 0%) were not different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group. The total length of hospital stay was no different between the fluconazole group and the placebo group (weight mean difference = -0.4 days, 95% CI = -10.35 to 9.54, P = 0.94; I² = 52.4%).

Excluding one study with unclear allocation concealment and one study that recruited some medical patients did not affect the magnitude and significance of the results. None of the studies included a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Five studies received financial grant or drug support from Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – of which three studies stated explicitly that the funding agency was not involved in the collection and analyses of the data.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — etiology, symptoms, and frequency: VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge, although none of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^2ee308e5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Dose-ranging effects of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes [^882d38f4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Canagliflozin was well tolerated in this study, with no evident increase in overall AE incidence compared with placebo, across the once-daily treatment groups except for increased incidence of genital infections in female subjects. This included both symptomatic and asymptomatic reports (the latter reporting positive vaginal Candida cultures). The symptomatic infections were reported as mild and responded to standard oral and topical antifungal treatments. All women with a vaginal culture at the time of the VVAE were positive for yeast. The symptomatic infections were reported as mild and responded to standard oral and topical antifungal treatments. While baseline A1C, FPG, and BMI were not significant predictors of VVAEs in the pooled canagliflozin groups in a logistic regression analysis, positive cultures at baseline as well as location in the North American region predicted the occurrence of VVAEs in women treated with canagliflozin (odds ratios 9.1 [95% CI 2.4–34.0] and 4.2 [1.2–14.4], respectively). By increasing UGE, SGLT2 inhibitors increase vaginal colonization with Candida species, and the increase in colonization may be the etiology for the increased VVAEs seen in women treated with canagliflozin.

There appears to be no higher rate of urinary tract infections with canagliflozin treatment. These observations may suggest that an increase in UGE raises the risk of genital mycotic infections but apparently not of urinary tract infections. This is consistent with the observation that the incidence of mycotic genital infections is higher with poorly controlled diabetes (especially vulvovaginal candidiasis and balanoposthitis) but without a clear increase in bacterial or candidal urinary tract infections. However, evidence from the phase 3 dapagliflozin development program indicated an increase in events suggestive of urinary tract infections with dapagliflozin versus comparators. Larger and longer studies will be needed to better define the incidence of both types of infections and the impact, if any, on renal function in patients treated with canagliflozin.

RT G was lowered with canagliflozin (maximal reduction of 77 mg/dL) but remained above the hypoglycemic threshold (usually considered to be 60–70 mg/dL). Since minimal UGE occurs below the RT G, hypoglycemia would not be expected, and was not observed, above the rate reported for placebo in this study.

Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days OR Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days. OR Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days OR Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days. Treatment Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen. Oral fluconazole weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Severe VVC is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses is recommended.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^4c89d91c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Fluconazole — adult dosing and renal adjustment: For candidiasis in adults, it should be administered with an average loading dose of 800 mg (12 mg/kg), followed by an average daily dose of 400 mg (6 mg/ kg). The higher-dose level (800 mg daily, 12 mg/kg) is often recommended for therapy of susceptible C. glabrata infections, but this has not been validated in clinical trials. Fluconazole elimination is almost entirely renal; thus, a dose reduction is needed in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute.

### Intercurrent infection as a risk factor for disease flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^615dc46d]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Major infections were defined as infections for which hospital admission and/or intravenous antibiotic therapy was required. Minor infections were defined as infections for which hospital admission was not warranted, but were regarded or treated as such by a treating physician. Infections were confirmed by clinical findings and/or a positive culture and/or response to therapy. The risk interval for the occurrence of a disease flare was defined as 3 months from the index date of an infection. This interval was chosen from a clinical point of view and was in line with a few earlier studies on the same topic. The following data were collected retrospectively by chart review: the index date of infection (defined as the day on which treatment was started and/or the day on which the patient was admitted to hospital), severity of infection (minor/major), the involved organ system(s) (skin and soft tissue, musculoskeletal, central nervous system, otorhinolaryngologic, ophthalmologic, respiratory tract, cardiac, gastrointestinal, intra-abdominal, urinary tract, genital tract or bloodstream), the involved pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, yeasts or parasites), mortality causes (involved pathogen(s) and organ system(s)), treatment (classification of medication and specific agent), treatment duration and admission to hospital (yes/no) in the previous year since the last follow-up appointment.

### Candida urinary tract infections – diagnosis [^a1bef9e4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of candiduria in a patient with or without symptoms should be neither dismissed nor hastily treated, but requires a careful evaluation, which should proceed in a logical fashion. Symptoms of Candida pyelonephritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or epididymo-orchitis are little different from those of the same infections produced by other pathogens. Candiduria occurring in critically ill patients should initially be regarded as a marker for the possibility of invasive candidiasis. The first step in evaluation is to verify funguria by repeating the urinalysis and urine culture. Pyuria is a nonspecific finding; the morphology of the offending yeast may allow separation of Candida glabrata from other species. Candida casts in the urine are indicative of renal candidiasis but are rarely seen. With respect to culture, colony counts have not proved to be diagnostically useful. In symptomatic or critically ill patients with candiduria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and collecting systems is the preferred initial study. However, computed tomography (CT) is better able to discern pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. The role of magnetic resonance imaging and renal scintigraphy is ill defined, and prudent physicians should consult with colleagues in the departments of radiology and urology to determine the optimal studies in candiduric patients who require in-depth evaluation.

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Canagliflozin: efficacy and safety in combination with metformin alone or with other antihyperglycemic agents in type 2 diabetes [^9ed621a0]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is typically the first pharmacologic treatment recommended for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but many patients do not achieve glycemic control with metformin alone and eventually require combination therapy with other agents. Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, was assessed in a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical development program consisting of ~10,000 participants, of which ~80% were on background therapy that consisted of metformin alone or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs; e.g. pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, and insulin). In addition, the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin and metformin as the initial combination therapy and canagliflozin monotherapy were assessed versus metformin in treatment-naïve patients with T2DM. Across studies in patients with T2DM who were on metformin alone or in combination with other AHAs, canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg provided improvements in glycated hemoglobin for up to 104 weeks. Canagliflozin was also associated with reductions in body weight and systolic blood pressure when added to background therapy consisting of metformin alone or with other AHAs. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated, with increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to the mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition (i.e.g.enital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, and osmotic diuresis-related AEs). Consistent with its insulin-independent mechanism of action, canagliflozin was associated with low rates of hypoglycemia when background therapy did not include sulfonylurea or insulin. Due to its favorable efficacy and safety profile, these results suggest that adding canagliflozin to a background regimen consisting of metformin or implementing treatment with a fixed-dose regimen of canagliflozin and metformin would provide an effective and safe treatment regimen for T2DM management.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^1ec6abc3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Single-drug therapy or selective decontamination of the digestive tract as antifungal prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^a7932edd]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Proper management of yeast infections is challenging because the diagnosis is often elusive. At present, laboratory tests can be inconclusive (blood cultures have a sensitivity of only 70%) and it is difficult to distinguish between colonisers and pathogens. Yeast is part of the physiological microbiological flora, thus positive cultures may merely reflect colonisation or environmental contamination instead of actual infection. On the other hand, the gold standard for the diagnosis of candidemia, blood culture, is not perfect. False-negative blood cultures, especially, are a problem because sensitivity is approximately 70%.

Given the high and increasing incidence of Candida infection, its major clinical impact, and the lack of tests for an early and accurate diagnosis, a prophylactic approach for high-risk patients might be beneficial. Previous reviews on this topic have analysed specific yeast prophylaxis regimens with either a single-drug antifungal prophylaxis (SAP) or a multi-drug regimen of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD). There are no direct randomised comparisons between SAP and SDD treatments. Our aim is to review and compare the effectiveness of both therapeutic strategies on yeast colonisation, invasive yeast infection, candidemia, and in-hospital mortality.

Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

or
Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days
or
Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days
or

The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms < 2 months after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested. Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse outcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.

Follow-Up

Follow-up typically is not required. However, women with persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be instructed to return for follow-up visits.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize evidence on the efficacy of nonantibiotic treatments in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The need for antibiotic-free regimens seems to be imperative given the worldwide rates of resistance of uropathogens to available antibiotics.

Recent Findings

In the recently published literature, cranberry products and probiotics are the focus of research. They both seem to be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs compared with placebo, but their benefit becomes less clear when they are compared with antibiotics.

Summary

A number of nonantibiotic-containing alternatives are available for the prevention of recurrent UTIs. For the majority of these alternatives, contradictory results have been published. These can be, at least partially, explained by variation in doses administered and duration of treatment. Selection of patients more likely to benefit from these interventions seems to be a realistic approach from a clinical-practice perspective, as well a worthwhile focus for future research.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^7d4864e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

### A phase 3 study of micafungin versus amphotericin B deoxycholate in infants with invasive candidiasis [^df4a6529]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of IC required 1 of the following criteria to be met ≤ 4 days before the first dose of study drug: a positive blood culture collected for proven candidemia; a positive urine fungal culture by in and out catheterization (≥ 10³ colony-forming units/mL in a single urine culture) or suprapubic aspiration (≥ 10² colony-forming units/mL in a single urine culture) for proven candiduria; the presence of Candida spp. in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for proven Candida meningitis; either a positive tissue biopsy or culture from a normally sterile body fluid (ie, blood, urine or CSF); or a positive culture for Candida (or yeast) obtained from a new drain (≤ 7 days before first dose of study drug) from a normally sterile site.

Exclusion criteria included any history of hypersensitivity or severe vasomotor reaction to any echinocandin or systemic amphotericin B product, receipt of > 48 hours of systemic antifungal therapy before treatment for IC or breakthrough systemic fungal infection while receiving an amphotericin B product or an echinocandin as prophylaxis. In addition, infants who had previously failed systemic antifungal therapy for the current IC episode, including recurrence of the same Candida infection within 2 weeks of completing systemic antifungal treatment, were excluded, as were those who were coinfected with a non- Candida fungal organism or whose positive yeast cultures were solely from an indwelling bladder catheter or sputum, or with a concomitant medical condition that might create unacceptable additional risk in the opinion of the investigator and/or medical advisor.

The parent/legal guardian provided written informed consent. The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee at each site and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^a008a86f]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^84d6f45d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline — vulvovaginal candidiasis management details dosing and alternatives for uncomplicated, severe, Candida glabrata, and recurrent disease. For uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, a single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole, 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14 days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), or topical 17% flucytosine cream alone or with 3% AmB cream administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

Fluconazole-refractory disease — alternatives and dosing: Alternatives for fluconazole-refractory disease include voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily, or AmB deoxycholate oral suspension, 100 mg/mL 4 times daily (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Intravenous echinocandin options — caspofungin 70-mg loading dose then 50 mg daily, micafungin 100 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200-mg loading dose then 100 mg daily — or intravenous AmB deoxycholate 0.3 mg/kg daily are other alternatives for refractory disease (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1ceac9e1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) — sex partner management and special populations: For complicated VVC, no recommendation can be made for treating sex partners because no data exist to support this practice. In compromised hosts, efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made and more prolonged (i.e., 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary. During pregnancy, only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women, and a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used. In HIV infection, treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV; although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC, and the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^372ed96e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^de3787a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^5a267aef]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Throughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for specific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication of comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence is planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. When more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended and the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar rates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are listed alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are prioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended regimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be considered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical contraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative regimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on the basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes and disadvantages of the regimens.

### Delivering on antimicrobial resistance agenda not possible without improving fungal diagnostic capabilities [^427a4013]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Other Clinical Scenarios

We have not addressed multiple other clinical situations in which a precise fungal diagnosis could reduce the inappropriate prescribing of antimicrobial drugs (i.e. overtreatment or incorrect treatment). Among those situations are cases of cryptococcal meningitis (Figure 4); Candida infection or colonization of the respiratory or urinary tract; febrile neutropenia in leukemia; Aspergillus bronchitis in bronchiectasis; and allergic, chronic, and invasive fungal sinusitis and PCP in HIV-negative patients. In all these clinical situations, inappropriate antibacterial or antifungal prescribing is common because of the lack of adequate fungal diagnostic testing. We also have not addressed rapid detection of antifungal drug–resistant fungi (i.e. A. terreus, C. krusei) or the use of diagnostics to prevent superinfection with fungi that are commonly resistant to antifungal drugs, such as C. glabrata or Rhizopus oryzae. Antifungal drug resistance is problematic in some settings and demands informed prescribing, therapeutic drug monitoring, and development of new antifungal agents.

Special Considerations

Compromised Host

Women with underlying immunodeficiency, those with poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions (e.g. HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression therapy (e.g. corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as well to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e. 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.

Pregnancy

VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used.

HIV Infection

Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina.

Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### The role of carbapenems in initial therapy for serious Gram-negative infections [^a292e398]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with serious Gram-negative infections must be both prompt and correct. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mortality risk is significantly increased when the initial antibiotic regimen does not adequately cover the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, changing to an appropriate regimen once culture results are available does not reduce this risk. Therefore, one must empirically treat serious infections with a regimen that covers likely pathogens. Selecting such a regimen is complicated by the increasing prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover, multidrug-resistant pathogens, once limited to hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly being detected in community-acquired infections, especially those involving the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts or in immunocompromised patients. Consequently, the initial antibiotic regimen must have a broad spectrum of activity that includes potential resistant pathogens, as indicated by the local antibiogram. Many multidrug-resistant pathogens remain susceptible to carbapenems despite increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance. This article reviews the role played by carbapenems in the initial treatment of serious Gram-negative infections and the potential effect of emerging resistance on this role.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^d2fcbd30]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.
