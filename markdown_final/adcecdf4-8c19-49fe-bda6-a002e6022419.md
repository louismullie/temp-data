## Question

Is an SGLT2 inhibitor indicated for the dissolution of nephrolithiasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether SGLT2 inhibitors can dissolve existing kidney stones or be used for the dissolution of nephrolithiasis and not merely for prevention of new stones or recurrences. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the crucial distinction between prevention versus dissolution. Then, I should review the clinical evidence on SGLT2 inhibitors and nephrolithiasis outcomes to see if any trials tested dissolution. Next, I will examine proposed mechanistic pathways to assess whether they plausibly support litholysis. After that, I should check major urology guidelines for any recommendations regarding SGLT2 inhibitors in stone management. Finally, I will confirm standard medical dissolution strategies by stone type and synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with caveats and recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because conflating prevention with dissolution can mislead clinical decisions. Dissolution refers to medically dissolving an existing stone, whereas prevention addresses reducing incident or recurrent stone formation; the question here is explicitly about dissolution, so I need to keep that focus while acknowledging that much of the SGLT2 literature addresses incidence or recurrence rather than litholysis of established calculi.

> Wait, let me verify whether any randomized trials or robust observational studies have evaluated SGLT2 inhibitors as a treatment to dissolve existing stones. The highest quality data consistently show a lower risk of incident or recurrent nephrolithiasis with SGLT2 inhibitors compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or placebo, but none of these studies evaluated dissolution endpoints; examples include a pooled analysis of empagliflozin trials showing fewer urinary stone events, a very large US new-user cohort study, a target trial emulation focused on recurrence, and a meta-analysis indicating reduced stone risk, all speaking to prevention and not to litholysis of formed stones [^112wox6W] [^1163Exab] [^112MCi4i] [^112MCi4i].

> I need to check mechanisms next to see if they plausibly enable dissolution. SGLT2 inhibitors cause osmotic diuresis that increases urine volume, dilutes lithogenic solutes, and reduces supersaturation, a preventive effect rather than a litholytic one for established stones; they also appear to increase urinary citrate, which inhibits calcium crystal growth, again preventive, though citrate itself in therapeutic doses is a recognized litholytic adjunct for uric acid stones when used as alkali, which is not the same as SGLT2-mediated modest changes; they lower serum urate via uricosuria, which reduces risk of uric acid stone formation but does not directly dissolve existing stones; and they raise urine pH to some extent via increased urinary bicarbonate excretion, which could theoretically favor uric acid solubility but has not been studied as a targeted litholytic strategy with SGLT2 inhibitors and appears modest in magnitude overall [^111PKs3L] [^115FmMB8] [^115VnvLg] [^1139Z5Zy]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the urine pH rise might be around 0.3–0.5 units, but I should double-check; the data describe an alkalinizing effect via NHE inhibition and bicarbonate excretion, yet absolute changes vary and are not well standardized in stone formers, reinforcing that this is a preventive metabolic shift rather than a validated litholytic intervention [^111PKs3L].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking guidelines. Major urology guidelines list thiazides, alkali citrates, allopurinol or febuxostat, and stone-specific diet as preventive therapies and delineate when dissolution is feasible, but they do not recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for either prevention or dissolution of nephrolithiasis; this absence is consistent across AUA 2014 and EAU 2025, with Canadian guidance similarly focused on thiazides and alkali citrate, while contemporaneous CKD guidelines emphasize SGLT2 inhibitors for kidney and heart protection rather than stone management [^114RwJwv] [^117C3ee1] [^116tSoqN] [^113RQSA4] [^112zUicR].

> Next, I should review standard medical dissolution to ensure I am using the correct comparator. For uric acid stones, urine alkalinization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate to maintain pH typically above 6.5–7.0 can dissolve stones over weeks to months; for cystine stones, aggressive alkalinization and thiol agents are used; calcium-based stones, which comprise the majority, are not amenable to medical dissolution and require procedural management such as ESWL, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous approaches when indicated; none of these pathways includes SGLT2 inhibitors as a litholytic therapy [^117C3ee1] [^114RwJwv] [^116JHNf2].

> I should synthesize the answer now but keep checking for any overlooked signals. Direct answer: No, SGLT2 inhibitors are not indicated for dissolution of existing kidney stones; the evidence base shows reduced incidence and recurrence, not litholysis, the mechanisms are preventive rather than directly stone-dissolving, and urological guidelines do not include SGLT2 inhibitors in dissolution algorithms; thus, using them to dissolve stones would be unsupported and speculative at this time [^112wox6W] [^1163Exab] [^117C3ee1].

> But wait, what if a patient with type 2 diabetes and uric acid stones is already on an SGLT2 inhibitor and experiences a small urine pH increase and higher citrate excretion; could that subtly assist dissolution alongside deliberate alkalinization? Let me reconsider: while the directionality of these changes might theoretically complement uric acid stone management, no trials have tested SGLT2 inhibitors as litholytic agents, the magnitude of pH change appears modest and variable, and standard alkali remains the evidence-based cornerstone for dissolution, so SGLT2 therapy should not be relied upon for litholysis outside hypothesis-generating contexts [^111PKs3L] [^115FmMB8].

> I need to ensure the practical recommendations are clear. For an existing stone, manage according to composition and guideline-based pathways, including urine pH targets, 24-hour urine metabolic evaluation, and indicated pharmacologic or procedural therapies; do not substitute an SGLT2 inhibitor for alkali or other stone-specific treatments, though SGLT2 inhibitors may be continued or initiated for their approved cardiorenal indications in appropriate patients, independent of stone considerations [^116ezhUo] [^114bcW1T] [^112zUicR].

---

No, SGLT2 inhibitors are not indicated for dissolving existing kidney stones. They may reduce stone recurrence risk via osmotic diuresis, uric acid lowering, and urine alkalinization [^111PKs3L] [^1139Z5Zy], but there is **no evidence of stone dissolution** [^1141ZMSp] and they are not recommended for this purpose in current guidelines [^114bcW1T] [^117C3ee1]. Standard dissolution therapy remains **first-line** [^114bcW1T] [^114RwJwv] (alkali citrate for uric acid/cystine stones) [^117C3ee1], and SGLT2 inhibitors should be used only for approved indications (T2DM, CKD, HF) [^112zUicR] [^113ydvHh].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to nephrolithiasis

SGLT2 inhibitors act in the proximal tubule [^1139Z5Zy] to increase glycosuria and natriuresis, producing osmotic diuresis and modest natriuresis. These effects can alter **urinary parameters** relevant to stone risk:

- **Osmotic diuresis**: Increased urine volume dilutes lithogenic solutes, reducing supersaturation [^111PKs3L] and potentially lowering stone recurrence risk [^1141ZMSp].

- **Uric acid lowering**: SGLT2 inhibitors modestly lower serum uric acid via uricosuria [^114FgRFE], which may reduce uric acid stone risk.

- **Urine alkalinization**: Empagliflozin may modestly increase urine pH [^111PKs3L], potentially reducing uric acid crystallization.

Despite these favorable changes, there is **no evidence of stone dissolution**.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding stone dissolution

There is **no clinical evidence** that SGLT2 inhibitors dissolve existing kidney stones. Available data address incident or recurrent stone risk, not dissolution of established stones [^1141ZMSp].

- **Empagliflozin trials**: Pooled RCT data showed a ~40% reduction in incident urinary tract stone events versus placebo [^112wox6W], but did not assess dissolution of existing stones.

- **Observational studies**: SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with lower nephrolithiasis risk versus GLP-1 RAs or DPP-4 inhibitors [^1163Exab] [^113C3Ssn], but these studies did not evaluate dissolution [^112MCi4i].

- **Target trial emulation**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduced recurrent nephrolithiasis versus GLP-1 RAs in patients with prior stones [^1141ZMSp], but did not assess dissolution.

Thus, while SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce recurrence, there is **no evidence of dissolution**.

---

## Comparison with standard dissolution therapies

Standard dissolution therapy depends on **stone composition**:

| **Stone type** | **Standard dissolution therapy** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Uric acid stones | Alkali citrate (potassium citrate) to alkalinize urine (pH 6.5–7.0) | High |
| Cystine stones | Alkali citrate, with tiopronin for refractory cases | High |
| Calcium oxalate/phosphate stones | No effective dissolution therapy; prevention with thiazides or citrate | High [^114RwJwv] |

---

SGLT2 inhibitors have **no evidence of dissolution** for any stone type and are not recommended for this purpose [^114bcW1T] [^117C3ee1].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but **relevant risks** include:

- **Volume depletion**: Osmotic diuresis can cause dehydration [^113gaeTT], potentially worsening stone symptoms or precipitating colic.

- **Genital infections**: Increased risk of mycotic infections, which may complicate management.

- **Euglycemic ketoacidosis**: Rare but serious [^113eHypy], especially with prolonged fasting or illness [^111zkqmE].

These risks must be weighed against potential benefits, especially since there is **no evidence of dissolution**.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

No major guideline recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for **stone dissolution** [^114bcW1T]. Across current clinical guidelines and recommendations, **AUA/CUA/EAU** recommend alkali citrate for uric acid/cystine stones and thiazides/citrate for calcium stone prevention, with SGLT2 inhibitors not mentioned for dissolution [^114RwJwv] [^117C3ee1] [^113RQSA4], whereas **KDIGO/UKKA** recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD progression risk reduction, not for stone dissolution [^112zUicR] [^112uK1Be] [^112XfoUN].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

There are **no ongoing trials** specifically evaluating SGLT2 inhibitors for stone dissolution [^115FmMB8]. Future studies could assess effects on urinary biochemistry and stone recurrence, but dissolution is unlikely given current evidence [^113yXZcJ].

---

In sum, **do not use SGLT2 inhibitors to dissolve kidney stones**; use standard dissolution therapy when indicated [^114bcW1T], and reserve SGLT2 inhibitors for approved indications (T2DM, CKD, HF) [^112zUicR] [^113ydvHh].

Risk for urolithiasis between SGLT2i users and non‐users was analyzed using the TriNetX and Taiwan NHIRD datasets. Log-rank tests in both datasets indicated that SGLT2i users had a lower cumulative incidence of urolithiasis compared to DPP4i users. In the NHIRD cohort, the incidence of urolithiasis was 10.26 vs. 12.78 cases per 1000 patient‐years for SGLT2i and DPP4i users, respectively (P < 0.0001). The incidence of urolithiasis requiring surgery was 2.04 vs. 3.12 cases per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.0001).

Similarly, in the TriNetX cohort, the incidence of urolithiasis was 9.16 vs. 10.98 cases per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.0001). The incidence of urolithiasis requiring surgery was 0.46 vs. 0.75 cases per 1000 patient‐years (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, gender, diabetes duration, comorbidities, and medications, the SGLT2i group in the NHIRD cohort had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.77–0.87; P < 0.0001) for urolithiasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63–0.82; P < 0.0001) for urolithiasis requiring surgery. In TriNetX, the adjusted HRs were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78–0.90; P < 0.0001) for urolithiasis and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56–0.89; P = 0.0027) for urolithiasis requiring surgery after adjusting for age, gender, race, diabetes duration, comorbidities, and medications.

### Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or gout: Target trial emulation studies [^1141ZMSp]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to emulate target trials comparing the recurrence of nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis, both overall and stratified by concomitant gout, who were initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors versus an active comparator.

The design involved target trial emulation studies. The setting used was a Canadian population database, spanning from January 2014 to June 2022.

Participants included 20,146 patients with nephrolithiasis and type 2 diabetes, among them those with concomitant gout at baseline, representing a high-risk group.

The interventions involved the initiation of either an SGLT-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor serving as an alternative comparator.

The main outcome measures included:

- **Primary outcome**: Recurrent nephrolithiasis events ascertained from diagnoses during emergency department visits, hospital admissions, or outpatient visits.
- **Secondary outcomes**: Nephrolithiasis resulting in hospital admission or emergency department visits, flare-ups of gout, a positive control outcome (genital infection), and negative control outcomes (osteoarthritis encounter and appendicitis).

Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed for the primary analyses, along with overlap weighting.

The results showed that after inverse probability of treatment weighting, there were 1,924 recurrent nephrolithiasis events among the 14,456 weighted patients who used an SGLT-2 inhibitor, translating to 105.3 per 1000 person-years. In comparison, 853 events occurred among the 5,877 weighted patients who used a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which equals 156.4 per 1000 person-years. The adjusted rate ratio demonstrated…

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: A potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition [^112wox6W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

- **Abstract**: Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for nephrolithiasis. A recent observational study found that in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a 49% lower risk of nephrolithiasis compared with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

- **Objective**: We examined the association between nephrolithiasis and the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, using existing data from randomized clinical trials.

- **Methods**: We pooled data from 15,081 T2D patients randomized to empagliflozin (n = 10,177) or placebo (n = 4,904) from 20 phase I-IV trials, including the large cardiovascular outcome trial, EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Incident urinary tract stone events were captured using a predefined collection of MedRA terms. A sensitivity analysis using a narrower definition was also performed. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs were calculated using the relative risk estimate, stratified by study.

- **Results**: The median exposures to study drug were 543 days (placebo) and 549 days (empagliflozin); 183 patients experienced an incident urolithiasis during follow-up (placebo, 79; empagliflozin, 104), yielding annual incidence rates of 1.01 vs 0.63 events/100 patient-years in the two respective groups. The IRR was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48–0.86), in favor of empagliflozin. In the sensitivity analysis, the results were similar (IRR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45–0.85]).

- **Conclusion**: Compared with placebo, empagliflozin therapy was associated with an approximate 40% reduced risk of urinary tract stone events in T2D patients. The underlying mechanisms are unknown but may involve altered lithogenic profiles.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and nephrolithiasis risk in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1163Exab]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of kidney stones. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) might lower the risk of nephrolithiasis by altering urine composition. However, no studies have investigated the association between SGLT2i use and nephrolithiasis risk in patients receiving routine care in the US.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between SGLT2i use and nephrolithiasis risk in clinical practice.

This new-user, active comparator cohort study used data from commercially insured adults aged 18 years or older with T2D who initiated treatment with SGLT2is, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4is) between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. The data were analyzed from July 2021 through June 2023.

- **Exposure**: New initiation of an SGLT2i, GLP-1RA, or DPP4i.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was nephrolithiasis diagnosed by International Classification of Diseases codes in the inpatient or outpatient setting. New SGLT2i users were 1:1 propensity score matched to new users of a GLP-1RA or DPP4i in pairwise comparisons. Incidence rates, rate differences (RDs), and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

- **Results**: After 1:1 propensity score matching, a total of 716,406 adults with T2D (358,203 pairs) initiated an SGLT2i or a GLP-1RA (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [9.7] years for both groups; 51.4% vs 51.2% female; 48.6% vs 48.5% male) and 662,056 adults (331,028 pairs) initiating an SGLT2i or a DPP4i.

### Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or gout: target trial emulation studies [^111PKs3L]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

The biological mechanisms underlying the lower risk of recurrent nephrolithiasis with SGLT-2 inhibitor use could partly be attributed to increased urinary output from osmotic diuresis. Randomized controlled trials have shown that increasing fluid intake lowers the risk for recurrent nephrolithiasis by increasing urinary volume and reducing the concentration of stone-forming solutes. Indeed, SGLT-2 inhibitors can increase urinary volume up to twofold, although this effect may be most pronounced at the start of treatment.

Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibitors also lower serum urate levels and have been associated with a lower risk of incident and recurrent gout. Glycosuria is thought to be a central mechanism for the urate-lowering effect, competing with soluble urate for transporter-mediated reabsorption in the proximal tubule and enhancing the excretion of uric acid. This uricosuria could raise the potential to transiently increase the risk of uric acid stones, as do prototypic uricosuric urate-lowering drugs such as probenecid or benzbromarone. However, our results suggest that the net effect for nephrolithiasis recurrence is beneficial. Indeed, urine pH levels, rather than hyperuricosuria itself, are thought to be the main determinant of uric acid crystallization and precipitation (and potentially calcium oxalate stone formation). This is because a more alkaline environment will enhance the solubility of uric acid crystals and prevent stone formation. To that end, empagliflozin can raise urine pH by inhibiting the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger and increasing urinary bicarbonate excretion.

### The mechanism of hypocalciuria with NaCl cotransporter inhibition [^115iy6Mt]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Thiazide diuretics are used to prevent the recurrence of calcium-containing kidney stones. The ability of these drugs to reduce urinary calcium excretion plays a key role in this process. Although studies have shown a reduction in the recurrence rate of calcium-containing stones in patients treated with thiazides, whether hypocalciuria results from increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal or distal nephron is still unclear. When extracellular fluid volume is considerably reduced, the proximal tubule is likely to have a major role in thiazide-induced hypocalciuria. This process frequently occurs when high doses of thiazides and sodium restriction are prescribed for the treatment of kidney stone disease. The distal tubule is predominantly involved in NaCl cotransporter inhibition-induced hypocalciuria when the extracellular fluid volume is not reduced, a clinical scenario observed in patients with Gitelman syndrome. In this Perspectives article, we discuss the evidence supporting the hypocalciuric effects of NaCl cotransporter inhibition in the proximal and distal nephron.

### Editorial: The role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^117WbcGA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

The kidneys play an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the production of glucose via gluconeogenesis. They not only filter and reabsorb plasma glucose but also use glucose as a metabolic fuel. These physiologic processes have been studied for a long time but have become an area of renewed and intense research interest in recent years as a result of the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular outcomes and delaying the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The kinetics of glucose reabsorption was first studied in the early 1930s. These early studies demonstrated that renal glucose transport in the tubules can reach a maximum beyond which glucose is excreted in the urine. Wright et al. demonstrated in the 1990s that the SGLT1 and SGLT2 transporters are responsible for glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

Phlorizin was the first inhibitor of the SGLT transporters, but it never entered clinical practice due to its gastrointestinal side effects and metabolism to phloretin, which inhibits glucose transporters. Phlorizin's poor tolerability and the molecular characterization of the SGLT transporters in the 1990s stimulated further development of small molecules that selectively inhibit the SGLT2 transporter. Interestingly, in hindsight, early studies demonstrated the potential of first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors to slow CKD progression. The first selective SGLT2 inhibitor, T-1095, showed profound reductions in urinary albumin excretion in experimental studies.

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: A consensus statement [^116bWx9U]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering drugs that have beneficial effects on blood pressure and bodyweight, indirectly exerting renoprotection. They also reduce albuminuria and are postulated to have direct hemodynamic effects on the kidney. Large-scale CV outcome trials (CVOTs) of SGLT2i, conducted to meet regulatory requirements and ensure CV safety, have shown promising effects on a range of albuminuria and kidney outcomes in the populations studied.

With this background, in this consensus statement, we discuss the treatment approaches and the role of SGLT2i in managing as well as delaying the progression of DKD in people with T2DM.

### UK Kidney Association clinical practice guideline: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 update [^112uK1Be]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning SGLT-2 inhibitors, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors to slow the rate of kidney function decline in patients with an eGFR of 20–45 mL/min/1.73 m² and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of less than 25 mg/mmol.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: A review of their basic and clinical pharmacology [^111CN6jg]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Glucosuria (i.e. the excretion of glucose through the kidneys) only occurs if the maximal capacity of various glucose transporter proteins (350 mg glucose/min) is exceeded. Earlier, glucosuria was thought to be a pathological mechanism or a marker of illness. However, one may approach this condition from a different viewpoint. Persons with ambient hyperglycemia are at risk of endothelial dysfunction and resultant complications due to the high levels of glucose in circulation.

Kidneys try to prevent an excessive rise in blood glucose levels by glucuresis, thereby mitigating the adverse effects associated with high glucose levels. Theoretically, compounds that promote glucuresis should help to reduce circulating glycemia, manage diabetes, and prevent long-term complications.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^1154puTw]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for nephrolithiasis, specifically concerning the prevention of stone recurrence, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend not offering allopurinol routinely as first-line therapy in patients with uric acid stones.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors for the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis [^115FmMB8]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Although there is good evidence suggesting that SGLT-2 inhibitors may help prevent the formation of kidney stones, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. Several possibilities exist. First, osmotic diuresis and the dilution of urine could reduce urinary supersaturation, which underlies the crystallization of stone-forming salts. Second, increased urinary citrate excretion, as shown previously in healthy volunteers treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo, may have a beneficial effect in patients with calcium-related nephrolithiasis. Finally, the protective effect against kidney stones might be explained by the anti-inflammatory actions of SGLT-2 inhibitors. These actions may influence the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that could facilitate kidney stone formation.

To address these questions, a short-term proof-of-concept study followed by long-term prospective clinical trials would be valuable for patients, clinicians, and researchers. Such studies could explore metabolic factors influencing kidney stone formation and inform more targeted treatments. Future studies should also include patients with nephrolithiasis but no diabetes to test the potential benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors for this group.

A recent trial of hydrochlorothiazide, a commonly used treatment for hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, failed to show its hypothesized effect in reducing the formation of kidney stones. However, one reason to consider SGLT-2 inhibitors instead of hydrochlorothiazide is their potential benefits beyond calcium reduction.

### State-of-the-art review: Mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^1139Z5Zy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

- **Goal**: Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcomes, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

- **Results**: The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to the lowering of albuminuria but also to long-term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule glucotoxicity, and by shifting transport downstream, may simulate "systemic hypoxia". The resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery.

### Why do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans [^112y7HAX]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin is the most advanced SGLT2 inhibitor in clinical trials. In addition, multiple other SGLT2 inhibitors are in phase II to III trials. However, none of these SGLT2 inhibitors can inhibit more than 30–50% of the filtered glucose load, despite in vitro studies indicating that 100% inhibition of the SGLT2 transporter should be achieved at the drug concentrations in humans. In this perspective, we shall examine potential explanations for this apparent paradox. The resolution of the paradox has important clinical implications with regard to the efficacy of this class of drugs and the development of more efficacious SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitors: potential for renoprotection beyond blood glucose lowering [^114V2bYo]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The proximal tubule's sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT2) accounts for the vast majority of glucose reabsorption by the kidney. Its selective inhibition, accordingly, leads to substantial glycosuria, lowering blood glucose and facilitating weight loss in individuals with diabetes. During the past year, two SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Beyond their anti-hyperglycemic properties, this new class of drugs has several other attributes that provide a theoretical basis for kidney protection. Like agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) in the chronically diseased kidney, though by quite different mechanisms. Additional potentially beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibition include modest reductions in blood pressure and plasma uric acid. Finally, cell culture studies indicate that glucose uptake from the tubular lumen, as well as from the basolateral compartment, can contribute to proximal tubular production of extracellular matrix proteins. Whether such attributes will translate into reducing the progression of chronic kidney disease will require the undertaking of long-term, dedicated studies.

### Kidney outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs in real-world clinical practice: The Japan chronic kidney disease database [^116t6Wwx]. Diabetes Care (2021). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials have shown kidney-protective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and clinical practice databases have suggested that these effects translate to clinical practice. However, the long-term efficacy, as well as whether the presence or absence of proteinuria and the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline prior to SGLT2 inhibitor initiation modify treatment efficacy among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, is unknown.

- **Research design and methods**: Using the Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database (J-CKD-DB), a nationwide multicenter CKD registry, we developed propensity scores for SGLT2 inhibitor initiation, with 1:1 matching with patients who were initiated on other glucose-lowering drugs. The primary outcome included the rate of eGFR decline, and the secondary outcomes included a composite outcome of 50% eGFR decline or end-stage kidney disease.

- **Results**: At baseline, the mean age at initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor (n = 1,033) or other glucose-lowering drug (n = 1,033) was 64.4 years, mean eGFR was 68.1 mL/min per 1.73 m², and proteinuria was apparent in 28.0% (578) of included patients. During follow-up, SGLT2 inhibitor initiation was associated with reduced eGFR decline (difference in slope for SGLT2 inhibitors vs. other drugs 0.75 mL/min/1.73 m² per year [0.51 to 1.00]). During a mean follow-up of 24 months, there were 103 composite kidney outcomes: 30 events (14 events per 1,000 patient-years) in the SGLT2 inhibitors group and 73 events (36 events per 1,000 patient-years) in the other group.

### Evaluating the overall renal outcomes of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^112TVhy1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting more than 10% of the global population, emerging as the third fastest growing cause of death worldwide. Often an asymptomatic complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD requires annual screening for diagnosis. Until 2021, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin was approved for CKD.

Over the last four years, trials such as DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE, and EMPA-KIDNEY have demonstrated the renal protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients, regardless of diabetes status. Consequently, international guidelines have advocated for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients. Despite well-established kidney protective outcomes and high levels of evidence advocating their use in people with CKD, the utilization of SGLT2 inhibitors remains unexpectedly low in many countries.

Additionally, a retrospective cohort study found that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors occurred among fewer than 4% of patients with CKD and albuminuria. Patient-level factors may have influenced this low rate of treatment adoption.

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: A potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition [^112X98Tg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Recently published data indicate that SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is associated with a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis, at least in comparison to GLP-1 RA therapy. We confirm these findings in a large dataset encompassing more than 15,000 T2D patients randomized to either empagliflozin or placebo, usually against a backdrop of a variety of glucose-lowering therapies.

About 75% to 80% of all renal stones are composed of calcium salts, commonly calcium oxalate and, less frequently, calcium phosphate. The remaining 20% to 25% of stones are composed of uric acid, struvite, or cystine. Abnormal urinary concentrations of lithogenic substances, along with decreased urinary flow, promote crystallization of stone-forming salts.

- **Mechanism for decreased stone risk**: One proposed mechanism for decreased stone risk with SGLT2 inhibitors is increased urinary flow rate due to osmotic diuresis from glucosuria and natriuresis, and consequent changes in urinary concentrations of lithogenic substances. Urine volume increases by 200 to 400 mL/day at the initiation of treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and is most likely accompanied by a commensurate increase in oral fluid intake.

While natriuresis appears to be transient and quickly reversed by compensatory mechanisms, glucosuria — and therefore an osmotic diuresis — persists while on treatment, even when the blood glucose concentrations are in the normal range.

### Why do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans [^116ZYPXw]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It is generally accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? We will try to provide an explanation to this puzzle in this perspective analysis of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials and examine possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may be responsible.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: A position statement by Kasralainy Nephrology Group (KANG) [^111BB4oq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a revolutionary drug class that delivers benefits exceeding those of diabetes management alone. Initially approved for type 2 diabetes management, research continually demonstrates their protective effects on kidney function across several nephrological conditions, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis-dependent kidney failure, anemia, metabolic bone disease, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), glomerulonephritis, and kidney transplantation.

- **Purpose**: This study aims to identify how SGLT2 inhibitors modify nephrological care by investigating their mechanisms of action, therapeutic outcomes, and potential applications in multiple kidney diseases. It summarizes clinical trial data alongside mechanistic insights to provide a comprehensive assessment of therapeutic outcomes beyond diabetes mellitus.

- **Findings**: Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with or without diabetes. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors provide kidney protection by enhancing tubuloglomerular feedback, improving renal blood flow, and reducing inflammation and ischemic tissue damage. They also provide cardiovascular benefits to dialysis patients while maintaining effective blood flow during dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) outside clinical trials. The potential impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone mineral health, particularly regarding bone mineral density (BMD) reduction and fracture risk, requires further investigation.

### Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: A review of their basic and clinical pharmacology [^114MzJWk]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Uric acid levels, a marker of metabolic dysfunction, are markedly reduced (5.9–17.8%) by SGLT2 inhibitors, with the effect sustained for 2 years. The drugs may affect uric acid excretion directly, by acting on its transport system, or indirectly, by reducing sodium reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The beneficial impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on uric acid is attenuated if insulin is co-prescribed.

Renal hyperfiltration has been found to be closely associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Pooled data from two randomized clinical trials, including 600 patients with normo- or microalbuminuria followed up for 4 years, demonstrated that hyperfiltration has a central role in the pathogenesis of DN. SGLT2 is one of the main determinants of glomerular hyperfiltration, and blockade of SGLT2 has potential nephroprotective action.

### Empa-REG outcome: The nephrologist's point of view [^114B6UXE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials. These trials include the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus Sulphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study.

- **Potential mechanisms**: The mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial. Direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role.

This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

### SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin: Finally at the latter stage of understanding [^114tsbQo]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are a relatively new adjunctive treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extraglycemic benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition include weight and blood pressure reduction. Cherney et al. now demonstrate that these extraglycemic properties of empagliflozin are preserved despite reduced urinary glucose excretion in advancing chronic kidney disease. Limited therapeutic options for patients with type 2 diabetes in the latter stages of chronic kidney disease make empagliflozin an attractive therapeutic agent with additional cardiovascular benefits.

### Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or gout: Target trial emulation studies [^113ahG8N]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of nephrolithiasis, due in part to impaired kidney ammoniagenesis leading to low urinary pH, a primary factor in the formation of uric acid stones. Acidic urine increases the concentration of insoluble, undissociated uric acid, facilitating precipitation at levels of urine uric acid within or even below the normal range. For example, in a study involving 2464 patients with nephrolithiasis, type 2 diabetes was the strongest predictor of uric acid stones, with an odds ratio of 6.9. Similarly, gout was associated with a twofold higher risk of kidney stones in a large male health professional prospective cohort study, which was also thought to be through insulin resistance (a close correlate for gout) interfering with renal ammoniagenesis, leading to acidic urine. The prevalence of pure and mixed uric acid stones has been found to be up to 43–88% in patients with gout. Interestingly, a previous randomized trial found allopurinol reduced events of calcium oxalate stones, suggesting potential benefit of urate reduction for preventing these stones. The study addressed overall risk of kidney stones irrespective of composition.

- **Clinical implications**: Among those with the additional risk factor of gout, SGLT-2 inhibitor use was associated with simultaneous risk reduction in gout recurrence, with a trend of a larger absolute risk reduction in nephrolithiasis recurrence, given their high background rate, particularly compared with DPP-4 inhibitors.

### Sglt2 inhibitors and nephrolithiasis risk: A meta-analysis [^112MCi4i]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel anti-diabetic medications with potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes, metabolic parameters, and body weight. Recent studies have investigated the potential role of SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy on nephrolithiasis development. Nephrolithiasis, a condition affecting almost 10% of the general population at least once during a lifetime, is a common disorder with considerable risk for acute and chronic kidney injury and relatively few effective therapeutic options.

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search through multiple databases, including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. We followed the systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We included a total of 11,635,698 patients who experienced nephrolithiasis from six clinical trials in this meta-analysis study.

- **Results**: In the pooled analysis, nephrolithiasis occurred in 1.27% of patients in the SGLT2i group (n = 739,197), compared with 1.56% of patients (n = 10,896,501) in the control arm (active control, placebo, or no therapy). SGLT2 inhibitor therapy has been associated with a lower risk for nephrolithiasis compared with placebo [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.70, P < .00001] or active therapy such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors.

### Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or gout: Target trial emulation studies [^1175reqv]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

To account for the non-random allocation of patients to the treatment groups, we used stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting for the average treatment effect in the whole population. Weights were calculated based on all covariates described above in a multivariable logistic regression model to predict each patient's probability (i.e. propensity score) of filling a prescription for an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist before the start of follow-up.

Inverse probability of treatment weights based on propensity scores of the cohort result in a weighted cohort where treatment assignment is independent of measured confounders. Stabilized weights are recommended to account for the otherwise large weights assigned to individuals with a low probability of receiving the treatment of interest and resultant large variance for the inverse probability of treatment weights estimator. We assessed the balance of the distribution of covariates before and after weighting using standardized differences between treatment groups (< 0.1 denoting negligible difference).

In a sensitivity analysis, we applied overlap weighting of the propensity score instead of inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance baseline characteristics. The overlap weighting estimate can be interpreted as the average treatment effect in the overlap population, representing patients with a realistic likelihood of receiving either treatment. This approach results in exact balance of the mean of every measured covariate.

We report crude and weighted numbers of events and person time.

The study found that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D was associated with a reduced risk of both urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery, compared to the use of DPP4 inhibitors. This suggests that SGLT2i may have a protective effect against the development of kidney stones and severe cases requiring surgery in T2D patients.

### Beyond SGLT2: Proximal tubule transporters as potential drug targets for chronic kidney disease [^111UJnUh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of patients with diabetes receiving SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrates strong uricosuric effects, likely indirect due to the effect of high urinary glucose levels of GLUT9. However, SGLT2 inhibitors may not increase the risk for urate stones, as urine pH tends to become more alkaline and diluted, thereby reducing the propensity to form urate crystals.

Evidence does not support the concept that inhibition of renal urate transporters may provide a benefit in patients with CKD to halt disease progression. Reduction of serum urate levels can be achieved even in patients with reduced eGFR; however, care should be taken to avoid high levels of intratubular urate, which at low urinary pH can precipitate as uric acid, triggering the development of uric acid stones or uric acid nephropathy.

### Effect of canagliflozin on serum uric acid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115xJdr2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased risk of gout, kidney stones, and cardiovascular disease. The present post hoc analysis of pooled data from four placebo-controlled phase III studies assessed the effect of canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, on serum uric acid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and in a subset of patients with hyperuricaemia, defined as baseline serum uric acid ≥ 475 µmol/l (∼8 mg/dl). At week 26, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg were associated with a ∼13% reduction in serum uric acid compared with placebo. In the subset of patients with hyperuricaemia, placebo-subtracted percent reductions in serum uric acid were similar to those in the overall cohort. More patients in the hyperuricaemic group achieved a serum uric acid level of < 360 µmol/l (∼6 mg/dl) with both canagliflozin 100 mg (23.5%) and 300 mg (32.4%) compared with placebo (3.1%). Incidences of gout and kidney stones were low and similar across groups. In conclusion, canagliflozin treatment decreased serum uric acid in patients with T2DM, including those with baseline hyperuricaemia.

### Sglt2 inhibitors and the kidney: Effects and mechanisms [^116Fivqr]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical trials have shown that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert a favorable effect on indices of renal function, such as albuminuria and the decline of glomerular filtration rate over time, and reduce the incidence of hard renal endpoints, including renal death or the initiation of renal replacement therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: In this review, we describe in detail the evidence regarding the nephroprotective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors and outline the risk factors that may predispose patients to the development of acute kidney injury when receiving these drugs.

- **Results**: Although the impact of these drugs on renal hemodynamics is shown to be the most important renoprotective mechanism of action, many other effects of these compounds, such as beneficial effects on metabolism and blood pressure, have also been proposed to contribute to the observed clinical benefit.

- **Conclusions**: SGLT2 inhibitors clearly exert beneficial effects on kidney function through many proposed mechanisms.

### Treatment and prevention of kidney stones: an update [^116JHNf2]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) is rising worldwide, especially in women and with increasing age. Kidney stones are associated with chronic kidney disease. Preventing recurrence is largely specific to the type of stone (e.g. calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite [magnesium ammonium phosphate], and uric acid stones); however, even when the stone cannot be retrieved, urine pH and 24-hour urine assessment provide information about stone-forming factors that can guide prevention.

Medications, such as protease inhibitors, antibiotics, and some diuretics, increase the risk of some types of kidney stones, and patients should be counseled about the risks of using these medications. Managing diet, medication use, and nutrient intake can help prevent the formation of kidney stones. Obesity increases the risk of kidney stones. However, weight loss could undermine prevention of kidney stones if associated with a high animal protein intake, laxative abuse, rapid loss of lean tissue, or poor hydration.

- **Prevention strategies**: For prevention of calcium oxalate, cystine, and uric acid stones, urine should be alkalinized by eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables, taking supplemental or prescription citrate, or drinking alkaline mineral waters. For prevention of calcium phosphate and struvite stones, urine should be acidified; cranberry juice or betaine can lower urine pH.

- **Acute management**: Antispasmodic medications, ureteroscopy, and metabolic testing are increasingly being used to augment fluid and pain medications in the acute management of kidney stones.

### SGLT2i: Beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^112TRHK6]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new type of glucose-lowering drug that can reduce blood glucose by inhibiting its reabsorption in proximal tubules and by promoting urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2i are widely used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In recent studies, SGLT2i were found not only to reduce blood glucose but also to protect the heart and kidney, which can significantly reduce cardiovascular events, delay the progression of renal failure, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce medical expenses for families and society.

As adverse cardiac and renal events are the most common and serious complications of T2DM, it is very important to understand the cardio- and renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i. This article reviews the historical development, pharmacological mechanism, heart and kidney protection, and safety of SGLT2i. The information presented provides a theoretical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications and for the development of new glucose-lowering drugs.

### Renal effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and other anti-diabetic drugs: Clinical relevance and potential risks [^1141btti]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease affecting an increasing percentage of the general population worldwide. Patients with T2DM are frequently characterized by impaired renal function, primarily as a result of diabetic kidney injury but also due to other contributing factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and medications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors have emerged as a new, promising class of antidiabetic agents with actions that seem to extend beyond their hypoglycemic effect.

### Metabolic communication by SGLT2 inhibition [^113ydvHh]. Circulation (2024). Low credibility.

SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) is primarily expressed in the brush border of the early proximal tubule of the kidney, where the transporter is responsible for quantitative reabsorption of filtered glucose. Inhibitors of SGLT2 (SGLT2i) are an effective therapy to treat hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these compounds also protect the heart and kidneys from failing. This includes patients with chronic or acute heart failure (HF), chronic or acute impairment in kidney function, and reduced or preserved cardiac ejection fraction, independent of hyperglycemia (i.e. type 2 diabetes) and sex. As a consequence, SGLT2i constitute a pillar of therapy for HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction, and are guideline-directed in patients with chronic kidney disease irrespective of the presence of diabetes. Whereas an increased risk for ketoacidosis is a safety concern for the use of SGLT2i in patients with type 1 diabetes, and therefore, approval in this patient group is limited to a few countries, similar cardiovascular benefits and mechanisms are expected.

Many effects and pleiotropic mechanisms have been purported for SGLT2i on the basis of large-scale and reductionist approaches, covering enhanced ketogenesis and fasting-like metabolic responses, renal and systemic hemodynamic effects, on- and off-target effects, direct effects on the heart, vasculature, and tubular cells, and many more. None of the studies, however, was successful in crystallizing a key mechanism of SGLT2i that is critical for cardiovascular and renal protection.

- **Study identification and selection**: Figure 1 shows the study selection process. The search of relevant databases and manual scanning of reference lists identified 161 potentially relevant citations. After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, 19 articles remained for full-text evaluation. Following detailed evaluation, 10 articles were excluded because (i) the population was not relevant (n = 7); (ii) duplicate studies (n = 2); and (iii) treatment comparison was not relevant (n = 1). The remaining nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

- **Study characteristics and risk of bias**: The nine articles comprised eight studies, including one based on a pooled individual patient data (IPD) analysis of 13 trials. No randomized controlled trial specifically investigated the combination of SGLT2 and RAAS inhibitors compared with SGLT2-Is alone. All eligible studies were based on trials that had investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibition compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. They reported subgroup results for those treated with or without RAAS-Is at baseline. Of the 34,551 total participants, 23,109 involved the comparison of SGLT2-I vs placebo with RAAS inhibition at baseline, and 11,442 involved the comparison of SGLT2-I vs placebo without RAAS inhibition at baseline. In addition to diabetes, patients had other comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or heart failure.

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: A potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition [^111YWXuj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibition may also have indirect effects on bone and mineral metabolism; some of these are not intuitively linked to decreased risk of urolithiasis. For example, increased sodium availability in the renal tubule modulates both nephron calcium and phosphate handling. Decreased renal calcium absorption and increased phosphate absorption result in increased urinary calcium excretion and low urinary phosphate concentrations. High urinary calcium, in the setting of hypocitraturia and low urinary volume, promotes supersaturation and crystallization of calcium oxalate and, less frequently, calcium phosphate, leading to renal stone formation.

SGLT2 inhibitors are also associated with decreased serum uric acid levels due to increased urate excretion. However, hyperuricosuria per se is not associated with an increased risk of nephrolithiasis. The principal determinant of uric acid crystallization and precipitation (which may also serve as a nidus for calcium oxalate stone formation) is low urine pH. Uric acid crystals are more soluble in an alkaline milieu, thus preventing stone formation even in patients with high urinary urate. Animal experiments have demonstrated increased urinary bicarbonate excretion and higher urine pH after SGLT2 inhibition.

Finally, hypocitraturia is another common metabolic abnormality seen in 20% to 60% of patients with nephrolithiasis. Urinary citrate serves to inhibit supersaturation and crystallization of calcium salts. Additionally, citrate increases urine pH and reduces calcium concentration in the urine by forming complexes with calcium.

### Diabetes and gout: Another role for SGLT2 inhibitors [^113DdgGT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Thus, having emerged as agents to manage Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in people who are overweight, SGLT2 inhibitors have recently expanded their indications to include heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for people with or without diabetes. Because the lowering of serum urate by SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of existing treatments for hyperuricaemia and additive to such treatments, SGLT2 inhibitors offer an extra resource for the management of hyperuricaemia and symptomatic gout. Moreover, the opportunity for improved long-term control of serum urate is anticipated to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) and renal disease associated with hyperuricaemia. Also, the independent cardiorenal protection provided by an SGLT2 inhibitor should afford additional health gains for individuals with hyperuricaemic gout.

### Medical management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: A systematic review for an American College of Physicians clinical guideline [^115x1LvW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Optimum management to prevent kidney stones is uncertain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefits and harms of interventions to prevent recurrent kidney stones.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Cochrane, and other databases through September 2012, including reference lists of systematic reviews and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Study selection**: 28 English-language RCTs that studied treatments to prevent recurrent kidney stones and reported stone outcomes.

- **Data extraction**: One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and two independently rated quality and graded strength of evidence.

- **Data synthesis**: In patients with one past calcium stone, low-strength evidence showed that increased fluid intake halved the risk of composite stone recurrence compared with no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84]). Low-strength evidence indicated that reducing soft drink consumption decreased the risk of symptomatic stone recurrence (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.98]). In patients with multiple past calcium stones, most of whom were receiving increased fluid intake, moderate-strength evidence showed that thiazides (RR, 0.52 [CI, 0.39 to 0.69]), citrates (RR, 0.25 [CI, 0.14 to 0.44]), and allopurinol (RR, 0.59 [CI, 0.42 to 0.84]) each further reduced composite stone recurrence risk compared with placebo or control, although the benefit from allopurinol seemed limited to patients with baseline hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Other baseline biochemistry measures did not allow prediction of treatment efficacy.

### A review of the safety of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors [^113KGYFv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Acute kidney injury**: As discussed within the text, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute kidney injury, which has been demonstrated in clinical trials and large real-world studies.

- **Hyperkalaemia**: In contrast to early concerns about hyperkalaemia risk, individual patient meta-analysis of six large SGLT2 inhibitor trials shows a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia. This reduction is consistent with the mechanism of effect of increased sodium delivery to the distal tubules of the nephrons, leading to increased sodium reabsorption by the principal cells. This process, in turn, creates a stronger electronegative charge within the tubules and thereby promotes potassium excretion.

- **Fracture**: Concern regarding fracture risk was raised by the CANVAS programme, where the risk of fractures was higher with canagliflozin than with placebo (15.4 vs. 11.9 participants per 1000 patient-years). The CANVAS programme involved two cohorts, CANVAS and CANVAS-R, and the elevated risk was only seen in the former group. This risk has not been seen in other major clinical trials, including with the use of canagliflozin in CREDENCE. Real-world cohorts have seen no association between fractures and the use of canagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors, including among older persons.

- **Severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia**: Despite a haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction of approximately 0.5–0.7%, there is no increase in the risk of severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia in large trials among people with diabetes. Dose reduction of insulin or secretagogues may nonetheless be appropriate given the effect of reducing HbA1c if the HbA1c is not above target.

### Comparative effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for recurrent nephrolithiasis among patients with pre-existing nephrolithiasis or gout: target trial emulation studies [^113Y8Sx9]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Covariates were assessed, selected a priori based on previous literature and subject and methodological expertise. These included sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, area-level socioeconomic status, and residence in one of British Columbia's five geographic health regions. Other factors considered were the calendar year of first dispensing, the time since the first recorded diagnosis of diabetes, chronic comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease), and diabetes complications including neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Additionally, risk factors for nephrolithiasis such as nephrolithiasis duration, frequency of nephrolithiasis events in the past 12 months, gout diagnosis, obesity, thiazide diuretic use, and use of urate-lowering treatment were examined.

Relevant drugs and healthcare utilization were also assessed. The study included variables like gout duration, baseline flare-up rate, and use of drugs for flare-ups in the secondary target trial emulation among patients with nephrolithiasis and concomitant gout. Medical conditions were assessed from 1990 or from enrolment, whichever came later, whereas healthcare utilization and drug use were assessed during the year before the target trial index date.

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xbTYi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

This study included 21 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials with a total of 96,196 participants, investigating empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for heart failure. Secondary efficacy endpoints were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalizations for heart failure, kidney disease progression, and acute kidney injury. We conducted subgroup analyses based on underlying comorbidities, including diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Safety endpoints were also assessed among SGLT2 inhibitors in the overall cohort.

In the overall cohort, no significant differences in the primary efficacy outcome were observed among the SGLT2 inhibitors. Empagliflozin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.53–0.92]) and dapagliflozin (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.96]) were associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury than sotagliflozin. The presence or absence of diabetes did not alter the results. In patients with chronic kidney disease, no differences in efficacy outcomes were observed among the SGLT2 inhibitors. In patients without chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome compared with ertugliflozin (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98]). For safety outcomes, no significant differences were observed in amputation, urina.

### Why do SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30–50% of renal glucose reabsorption in humans [^115KSLcv]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a novel and promising treatment for diabetes under late-stage clinical development. It is generally accepted that SGLT2 mediates 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical development inhibit only 30–50% of the filtered glucose load. Why are they unable to inhibit 90% of glucose reabsorption in humans? This perspective analysis aims to provide an explanation for this puzzle by examining the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical trials. It will address possible mechanisms and molecular properties that may be responsible for this limitation.

### Empagliflozin lowers serum uric acid in chronic kidney disease: Exploratory analyses from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^115VnvLg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

- **Key learning points**:
	- **What was known**: Hyperuricaemia and gout are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce uric acid and may reduce the risk of gout in people with diabetes and/or heart failure. Uric acid–lowering effects at lower levels of kidney function were uncertain.

	- **This study adds**: SGLT2 inhibition modestly lowers uric acid in CKD, with greater effects at higher levels of kidney function and in the absence of diabetes. There is particular attenuation when glycaemic control is poor. This uric acid–lowering effect does not appear to explain the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition on the kidney.

	- **Potential impact**: Uric acid lowering may be an additional advantage of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with CKD. The magnitude of this effect is small compared with uricosuric agents, but SGLT2 inhibitors further lower uric acid in addition to such therapies in patients with CKD.

### Sglt2 inhibition in chronic kidney disease: a preventive strategy against acute kidney injury at the same time [^115SB6bf]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are known to slow down the progression of chronic kidney disease. However, theoretical concerns still exist that SGLT2 inhibitors could increase the risk of acute kidney injury. Heerspink et al. revealed that dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of abrupt declines in kidney function during the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. Their findings may serve to reassure clinicians prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors to patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: A position statement by Kasralainy Nephrology Group (KANG) [^111AxFKi]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a revolutionary drug class that delivers benefits exceeding those of diabetes management alone. Initially approved for type 2 diabetes management, research continually demonstrates their protective effects on kidney function across several nephrological conditions, including acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis-dependent kidney failure, anemia, metabolic bone disease, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), glomerulonephritis, and kidney transplantation.

- **Purpose**: This study aims to identify how SGLT2 inhibitors modify nephrological care by investigating their mechanisms of action, therapeutic outcomes, and potential applications in multiple kidney diseases. It summarizes clinical trial data alongside mechanistic insights to provide a comprehensive assessment of therapeutic outcomes beyond diabetes mellitus.

- **Findings**: Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression in patients with or without diabetes. These findings indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors provide kidney protection by enhancing tubuloglomerular feedback, improving renal blood flow, and reducing inflammation and ischemic tissue damage. They also provide cardiovascular benefits to dialysis patients while maintaining effective blood flow during dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) outside clinical trials. The potential impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on bone mineral health, particularly regarding bone mineral density (BMD) reduction and fracture risk…

### Prevention of nephrolithiasis [^111QDiXD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The high incidence of recurrence after an initial stone event underscores the need for an effective medical prophylactic program. Dietary modification and drug therapies have long been advocated to reduce the likelihood of stone recurrence. While the efficacy of a high fluid intake has been validated in a randomized trial, the benefit of other dietary measures is based on modulation of urinary stone risk factors and outcomes derived from observational studies. Several drug therapies have been evaluated in a limited number of prospective, randomized trials, and efficacy has been demonstrated for thiazides, allopurinol, and alkali citrate in some populations of recurrent stone formers. The role of selective versus nonselective therapy for stone prevention awaits further study.

### Empagliflozin and decreased risk of nephrolithiasis: A potential new role for SGLT2 inhibition [^114g9S2L]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, we demonstrate that the use of empagliflozin was associated with an approximate 40% reduced risk of renal stone disease compared with placebo. Even when we applied a more stringent definition, excluding renal colic (which is subjective) and nephrocalcinosis (which is a tubulointerstitial disease with a different pathophysiology), the results persisted. These data extend the preliminary observations of Kristensen et al. This potential additional benefit of SGLT2 inhibition is identifiable compared with placebo across a wide background of glucose-lowering therapies used in the trials included herein and not just compared with GLP-1 RA therapy as Kristensen et al. report. Dedicated randomized prospective clinical trials would now appear to be warranted in order to confirm these initial observations in patients both with and without T2D. Moreover, further studies of the lithogenic profile of the urine in stone formers after SGLT2 inhibition should now be conducted to provide insights into the precise underlying mechanisms involved.

### Sglt2i: beyond the glucose-lowering effect [^111DG54K]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Low credibility.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a new type of glucose-lowering drug that can reduce blood glucose by inhibiting its reabsorption in proximal tubules and by promoting urinary glucose excretion. SGLT2i are widely used in the clinical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In recent studies, SGLT2i were found to not only reduce blood glucose but also protect the heart and kidney, which can significantly reduce cardiovascular events, delay the progression of renal failure, greatly improve the quality of life of patients, and reduce medical expenses for families and society. As adverse cardiac and renal events are the most common and serious complications of T2DM, it is very important to understand the cardio- and renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i. This article reviews the historical development, pharmacological mechanism, heart and kidney protection, and safety of SGLT2i. The information presented provides a theoretical basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of diabetes and its complications, and for the development of new glucose-lowering drugs.

### Use of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors and the incidence of urolithiasis: A multi-database and cross-country study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115st48B]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

This multi-center, multi-ethnic study demonstrated that, compared to DPP-4i use, SGLT2i was associated with an approximately 15%–30% lower risk of urolithiasis and urolithiasis requiring surgery in T2D patients. Findings from both Taiwan's NHIRD and the TriNetX cohort indicate that the benefits of SGLT2i in reducing urolithiasis risk, especially for upper urinary stones, were observed across subgroups, including gender, use of metformin, statins, or ACE inhibitors/ARBs.

Understanding the protective effects of glucose-lowering drugs against urolithiasis in T2D is crucial, given the poor outcomes associated with urolithiasis in these patients. While urolithiasis is considered in SGLT2i clinical trials, it has not been a prespecified outcome, highlighting the need for dedicated research. Our study provides robust evidence on the association between SGLT2i use and urolithiasis incidence.

Previous studies suggested a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis among SGLT2i users compared to other antidiabetic medications, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.5 to 0.6. However, these studies had limitations, including neutral or unspecified risks for bladder stones, lack of examination of surgical intervention risks, and invalidated renal stone diagnoses. Only one previous study discussed the potential of SGLT2i to reduce the risk of urolithiasis requiring surgical intervention, which was consistent with our study, further confirming the reliability of this result. Our study offers a deeper understanding of SGLT2i benefits and risks in T2D patients prone to urolithiasis.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors for the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis [^113yXZcJ]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

McCormick and colleagues' novel study confirmed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors can be an additional treatment strategy for patients with nephrolithiasis and type 2 diabetes, adding extra benefits to those already documented for the heart and kidneys. Their findings align with another large study of claims data from the US, showing that among people with type 2 diabetes, those taking SGLT-2 inhibitors had a significantly lower risk of nephrolithiasis than those taking GLP-1 receptor agonists or DPP-4 inhibitors, over a median follow-up of 192 days. An observational study comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes showed a noticeable decrease in the risk of both incident and recurrent nephrolithiasis among those treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Two previous meta-analyses of clinical trials evaluating SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes reported mixed findings. One reported no difference in the risk of nephrolithiasis relative to placebo or active comparators, whereas the other reported a statistically significant reduction in the risk of nephrolithiasis relative to placebo.

### Empagliflozin lowers serum uric acid in chronic kidney disease: exploratory analyses from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^114FgRFE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

These exploratory analyses sought to quantify the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on uric acid and gout in a broad population of patients with CKD at risk of progression. In EMPA-KIDNEY, empagliflozin resulted in an early and sustained reduction in serum uric acid, with larger effects at higher eGFR and in those without diabetes. In exploratory analyses, the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression were not dependent upon baseline uric acid level nor were they explained by on-study uric acid levels. Overall, the average effect was relatively modest (a 6% relative reduction in uric acid levels) and did not translate into a measurable effect on clinical risk of gout events in this trial population. This effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on uric acid is much smaller than that achieved by xanthine oxidase inhibitors (approximately 30–50%) or the newer URAT1 inhibitor verinurad (approximately 40–60%). Nevertheless, empagliflozin lowered serum uric acid in participants reporting such uric acid–lowering therapy use at baseline, suggesting a mechanism of action not saturated by existing therapies and likely complementary effects.
