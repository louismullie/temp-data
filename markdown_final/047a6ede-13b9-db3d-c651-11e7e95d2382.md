## Question

Why use augmentin for downs syndrome with pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is used for pneumonia in Down syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique respiratory vulnerabilities in Down syndrome that shape empiric antibiotic choices. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for adding clavulanate to amoxicillin. Next, I will review guideline-based recommendations for community-acquired pneumonia in children and adults, including dosing and formulation choices. After that, I should check the evidence base specific to Down syndrome, acknowledging gaps and what we can reasonably extrapolate. Finally, I will consider alternatives, special situations, and safety monitoring before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile in Down syndrome, because that will anchor the empiric choice. Children and adults with Down syndrome have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections due to anatomical factors (hypotonia, macroglossia, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, tracheobronchomalacia, subglottic stenosis), functional issues (impaired airway clearance, swallowing dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea), and immune dysfunction (impaired B- and T-cell function, reduced antibody production), which together lead to more frequent, more severe, and more complicated pneumonias, often requiring hospitalization and respiratory support [^111MSpHJ] [^1133uXVZ].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacologic rationale for choosing amoxicillin/clavulanate rather than amoxicillin alone. The clavulanate component inactivates beta-lactamases produced by common respiratory pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, thereby extending amoxicillin's spectrum to cover these beta-lactamase–producing organisms that are frequently implicated in pediatric and adult community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in patients with chronic respiratory disease or recurrent infections where polymicrobial or resistant patterns are more likely [^113PhKJT] [^114ciXbz].

> Next, I should review pediatric guidance for community-acquired pneumonia, because Down syndrome patients span pediatric and adult ages. For children older than 3 months with suspected bacterial CAP, IDSA/PIDS recommend amoxicillin as first-line therapy in otherwise healthy, appropriately immunized children; however, in the presence of comorbidities, severe infection, recent antibiotics, daycare attendance, or risk factors for resistant pneumococcus, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate is favored to ensure coverage of beta-lactamase producers and penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, which aligns with the risk profile seen in Down syndrome [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify adult guidance as well, since many individuals with Down syndrome are adults. ATS/IDSA recommend combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide for outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as an acceptable beta-lactam option; this strategy addresses resistant pneumococcus and atypical pathogens, and is particularly relevant in patients with chronic lung disease or immunocompromise, which are common in Down syndrome [^117JT7za] [^114NQhP1].

> I need to check dosing and formulation choices that optimize pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets against resistant pneumococcus. For adults, pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily achieves time above MIC targets that improve eradication of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae, and clinical studies show high success rates even against isolates with elevated MICs; for children, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided twice daily is recommended in settings of high endemic penicillin resistance or risk factors, which fits the Down syndrome population [^115pKvFR] [^113iBmqi].

> But wait, what if someone argues there is no Down syndrome–specific randomized trial proving Augmentin is superior? I should double-check the evidence base. There are no robust RCTs specifically in Down syndrome to guide antibiotic selection for pneumonia; the rationale is extrapolated from pediatric and adult CAP guidelines, mechanistic considerations, and observational data showing higher respiratory morbidity and hospitalization risk in Down syndrome, which justifies empiric coverage that addresses beta-lactamase producers and resistant pneumococcus pending culture data [^115uxgYh] [^111MSpHJ].

> Let me consider alternatives and special scenarios, and I should confirm when they apply. If there is a true beta-lactam allergy, non–beta-lactam options such as doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone may be used in adults per guidelines, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is low; in children, macrolides are added when atypical pathogens are suspected or when there is treatment failure, but they should not replace a beta-lactam as first-line in typical bacterial CAP; in severe disease or inpatient settings, parenteral therapy such as ceftriaxone or ampicillin may be indicated, with step-down to oral amoxicillin/clavulanate when stable [^117JT7za].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring considerations. Augmentin is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should monitor for gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and rare hepatotoxicity; in patients with renal impairment, dose adjustments are needed, and in those with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with amoxicillin/clavulanate, the agent is contraindicated; given the high risk of C. difficile with antibiotics, use the shortest effective course and reassess at 48–72 hours [^116Pgno1] [^116HsNvd] [^113tqqwp].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. Augmentin is used for pneumonia in Down syndrome because the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate provides reliable coverage for the typical bacterial pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia, including beta-lactamase–producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae, which are more likely in patients with chronic respiratory disease, recurrent infections, or structural airway abnormalities; guideline-concordant dosing, including high-dose pediatric regimens and pharmacokinetically enhanced adult formulations, helps achieve PK/PD targets for resistant organisms, and this approach is reasonable while we await Down syndrome–specific trials [^112c53gw] [^115h6tNF] [^117JT7za] [^115pKvFR].

---

Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is used for pneumonia in Down syndrome because it provides **broad-spectrum coverage** against common respiratory pathogens, including beta-lactamase–producing organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are more frequent in this population due to anatomical and immune vulnerabilities [^112c53gw] [^1172CCoN]. It also covers **penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae**, a key concern in Down syndrome, and is recommended by pediatric guidelines for severe or complicated pneumonia, especially with comorbidities or recent antibiotic exposure [^115h6tNF]. Augmentin is preferred over amoxicillin alone when beta-lactamase producers or resistant pneumococcus are suspected, and dosing should be adjusted for age, weight, and renal function to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects [^112c53gw] [^116HsNvd].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations in Down syndrome

Children with Down syndrome have **unique anatomical and immunological features** that increase their susceptibility to respiratory infections, including pneumonia:

- **Anatomical abnormalities**: Hypotonia, macroglossia, relative adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and structural defects such as laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and subglottic stenosis contribute to airway obstruction, impaired clearance, and increased risk of aspiration [^111MSpHJ].

- **Immune dysfunction**: Impaired B-cell and T-cell function, reduced antibody production, and chronic inflammation predispose to recurrent and severe infections [^111MSpHJ].

- **Comorbidities**: Congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, and obstructive sleep apnea further exacerbate respiratory morbidity [^116BYgoX].

These factors collectively increase the risk of **bacterial pneumonia** and complications, necessitating careful antibiotic selection and management [^1172CCoN].

---

## Microbiological considerations

The **bacterial pathogens** commonly implicated in pneumonia in children with Down syndrome include:

- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**: The most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, including penicillin-resistant strains [^117Go1ag].

- **Haemophilus influenzae**: Frequently beta-lactamase–producing, necessitating beta-lactamase inhibitor coverage [^112c53gw].

- **Moraxella catarrhalis**: Often beta-lactamase–producing, common in pediatric respiratory infections [^112c53gw].

Given these pathogens, **empiric antibiotic therapy** must cover both typical and beta-lactamase–producing organisms [^117Go1ag].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for Augmentin

Augmentin combines amoxicillin, a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, with clavulanate, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. This combination **extends amoxicillin's activity** to include beta-lactamase–producing organisms such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, which are common in pediatric pneumonia [^112c53gw]. It also provides coverage of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, a critical consideration in children with Down syndrome who are at increased risk of resistant infections [^115pKvFR].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Although direct comparative studies in Down syndrome are limited, pediatric guidelines support the use of **amoxicillin/clavulanate** in severe or complicated pneumonia, particularly when:

- **Beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected**: H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis coverage is needed [^112c53gw].

- **Penicillin-resistant pneumococcus is a concern**: Local resistance patterns or patient-specific risk factors are present [^112p63Z3].

- **Recent antibiotic exposure**: Increases likelihood of resistant organisms [^112p63Z3].

The **IDSA/PIDS guidelines** recommend amoxicillin as first-line therapy for uncomplicated pediatric CAP, but suggest amoxicillin/clavulanate for severe infections, comorbidities, or recent antibiotic exposure [^115h6tNF].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety

Augmentin has **demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes** in pediatric pneumonia, including:

- **High clinical success rates**: Effective against common respiratory pathogens, including beta-lactamase–producing organisms [^113iBmqi].

- **Well-established safety profile**: Generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea [^114Q1S9r].

- **Dosing flexibility**: Available in multiple formulations and dosages, allowing individualized therapy based on age, weight, and renal function [^111mU89t].

---

## Comparison with alternative antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Coverage** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | - S. pneumoniae <br/> - Some H. influenzae | - No beta-lactamase coverage <br/> - Limited activity against resistant pneumococcus |
| Cefuroxime | - S. pneumoniae <br/> - Some H. influenzae | - No beta-lactamase coverage <br/> - Limited activity against resistant pneumococcus |
| Azithromycin | - Atypical pathogens | - Increasing resistance in S. pneumoniae <br/> - Limited activity against H. influenzae |
| Levofloxacin | - Broad-spectrum including resistant pneumococcus | - Not routinely recommended in pediatrics due to safety concerns |

---

Augmentin's **unique combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate** provides broader coverage than amoxicillin alone, making it particularly suitable for pneumonia in children with Down syndrome [^112c53gw].

---

## Practical considerations and dosing

When prescribing Augmentin for pneumonia in Down syndrome, clinicians should consider:

- **Age and weight-based dosing**: Ensure appropriate dosing to achieve therapeutic levels [^111mU89t].

- **Renal function**: Adjust dosing in patients with impaired renal function [^116HsNvd].

- **Duration of therapy**: Typically 7–10 days, individualized based on clinical response and severity [^1156akW3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Augmentin is a **rational first-line choice** for pneumonia in children with Down syndrome because it provides broad-spectrum coverage, including beta-lactamase–producing organisms and penicillin-resistant pneumococcus. Its use is supported by pediatric guidelines and clinical experience, with favorable outcomes and a well-established safety profile. Clinicians should individualize dosing and consider patient-specific factors, including age, weight, renal function, and local resistance patterns, to optimize therapeutic outcomes [^115h6tNF] [^112c53gw].

Table 5. Bacteriologic Eradication Rates in the Per Protocol Population

Clinical assessments were made in the per protocol population 2 to 4 days post-therapy and 15 to 18 days post-therapy. Patients who responded to therapy 2 to 4 days post-therapy were followed for 15 to 18 days post-therapy to assess them for acute otitis media. Non-responders at 2 to 4 days post-therapy were considered failures at the latter timepoint. The clinical assessments in the per protocol population are presented in Table 6.

In the intent-to-treat analysis, overall clinical outcomes at 2 to 4 days and 15 to 18 days post-treatment in patients with S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC equal to 2 mcg/mL and 4 mcg/mL were 29/41 (71%) and 17/41 (42%), respectively.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for the
treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial
sinusitis due to confirmed, or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H.
parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin
(i.e., penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). AUGMENTIN XR is not indicated for the
treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with
penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see
CLINICAL STUDIES).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant
pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other
common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g., alcoholism,
immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were
not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected,
bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms
and their susceptibility when AUGMENTIN XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a
penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a
β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another AUGMENTIN®(amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower
daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e., 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12
hours). Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN XR and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN XR should
be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly
suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibacterial with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam, structurally related to penicillin, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug resistance.

The clavulanic acid component of AUGMENTIN ES-600 protects amoxicillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, AUGMENTIN ES-600 possesses the distinctive properties of a broad spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including isolates with penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL)

Gram-Negative bacteria:

Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. However, the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Staphylococci which are resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Streptococcus pyogenes

S. pyogenes do not produce beta-lactamase, and therefore, are susceptible to amoxicillin alone. Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have established the effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical infections due to S. pyogenes.

Susceptibility Test Methods:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors:

- Antibacterial drug exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms listed above.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published epidemiologic studies and pharmacovigilance case reports over several decades of use with amoxicillin and clavulanate during pregnancy have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal outcomes. A study in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) reported that prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates (see Data). Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rodents, given up to approximately 2 times the amount of amoxicillin and 15 times the amount of clavulanate in the Maximum Human Recommended Dose (MHRD) of AUGMENTIN ES-600, revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

One randomized, controlled trial included 4,826 pregnant women with premature rupture of fetal membranes who were randomly assigned to 250 mg erythromycin (n = 1,197), 250 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid (amoxicillin and clavulanate, n = 1,212), amoxicillin and clavulanate and erythromycin (n = 1,192), or placebo (n = 1,225) four times daily for 10 days or until delivery. Amoxicillin and clavulanate was associated with a significantly increased rate of proven neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis: 1.9% (n = 24) in the amoxicillin and clavulanate only group versus 0.5% (n = 6) in the placebo group (p = 0.001), and 1.8% (n = 44) in the any amoxicillin and clavulanate group versus 0.7% (n = 17) in the no amoxicillin and clavulanate group (p = 0.0005).

### COVID-19 and children with down syndrome: is there any real reason to worry? Two case reports with severe course [^1112yDDD]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Literature on COVID-19 in patients with DS is sporadic thus far. Given their characteristics, this population is considered to be at risk. De Cauwer et al. described the clinical course of four adults with DS during the COVID-19 outbreak. In all four patients, the disease course was severe, warranting hospital care in three patients and resulting in a fatal outcome in one. The first case involved a 60-year-old woman with DS who was treated with oxygen and antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate, initially, and meropenem, subsequently) with a favorable outcome. The second case involved a 48-year-old woman who was treated with oxygen, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, and chloroquine and recovered. The third case involved a 55-year-old woman who was treated with oxygen, amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloroquine, and azithromycin; however, she did not respond to therapy and died in the hospital. The fourth case involved a 62-year-old patient with DS who developed respiratory failure and subsequently received supportive care. In a recent preprint, Malle et al. reported an analysis of 4,615 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Mount Sinai Health System, within 55 days beginning on March 1, 2020. They estimated that the incidence of hospitalization in the DS population was 8.9 times higher (CI: 4.00–20.0) than that in the general population, for individuals 30–64 years old. Moreover, these patients were significantly younger than the rest of the hospitalized population.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this underpowered, randomised, placebo-controlled study observed no added value of treatment with antibiotics in outpatients with moderate to severe AECOPDs and intermediate probability of infection. Instead of more equivalence trials comparing two antibiotics, we need more placebo-controlled studies to determine whether we can properly define subgroups of COPD outpatients in which antibiotics indeed are of additional value and in whom there is no use at all.

### Overview of newer antimicrobial formulations for overcoming pneumococcal resistance [^1116Ukz9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of an antimicrobial agent provides important information that can be used to maximize bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, minimize selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, and determine an optimal dosing regimen. Judicious selection of an antimicrobial based on local susceptibility data and PK and PD parameters is imperative in this era of increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactam antimicrobials display time-dependent bacterial killing with minimal to no persistent effects. Ketolides and fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent bacterial killing, and tetracyclines and macrolides display time-dependent killing. All have prolonged persistent effects (e.g., postantibiotic effect) that retard or prevent bacterial regrowth when free drug levels fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). New high-dose and/or extended-release formulations of traditional antimicrobials have been added to the current armamentarium for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These formulations include amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 90/6.4 mg/kg per day divided every 12 hours (Augmentin ES-600; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets 2 x 1,000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours (Augmentin XR; GlaxoSmithKline), clarithromycin extended-release tablets 2 x 500 mg once daily (Biaxin XL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and cefaclor extended-release tablets 375 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours (Ceclor CD; Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Of these agents, only amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets were designed to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci (penicillin MIC ≤ 2 microg/mL). Extended-release clarithromycin does not provide higher daily doses than its immediate-release counterpart; rather, it allows for once-daily dosing of this agent because of its slower absorption following oral administration. Extended-release cefaclor is considered clinically equivalent to 250 mg of immediate-release cefaclor pulvules administered 3 times daily; it cannot be used interchangeably with 500 mg 3-times-daily dosages of other cefaclor formulations. Thus, despite providing a similar or higher total daily dose than its immediate-release counterpart, extended-release cefaclor is indicated only for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms.

### Limited evidence on the management of respiratory tract infections in Down's syndrome: a systematic review [^113UreSc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Outcomes of Interest

As our systematic review aimed to identify interventions to either prevent or treat RTIs, identified papers were likely to encompass a broad range of outcome measures. As a consequence, we did not pre-specify any detailed outcome measures. We looked specifically at impact on frequency and recurrence of RTIs and any documented adverse effects.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted using a standardized form including information on study characteristics, setting, design, randomization, inclusion and exclusion criteria, data-analysis methods, interventions, outcomes and results.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We measured risk of bias in RCTs and non-randomized studies using the relevant "Risk of Bias" tools developed by Cochrane. We excluded studies with a critical risk of bias from our analyses.

Assessment of Heterogeneity

We assessed clinical heterogeneity across the included studies by reviewing differences in populations, interventions and outcomes measured. In view of the marked differences in the interventions used in the individual studies, we did not perform a meta-analysis.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study illuminates the potential benefits of chronic Azithromycin treatment in mitigating respiratory morbidity among young children with Down syndrome. The significant reduction in the length of stay for respiratory hospitalizations highlights its potential impact on clinical outcomes. These findings call for further investigation and support the need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to determine the optimal use and long-term effects of Azithromycin treatment in this vulnerable population. Ultimately, such research may enhance the management and outcomes of respiratory infections in children with Down syndrome.

### COVID-19 and children with down syndrome: is there any real reason to worry? Two case reports with severe course [^111VYRv5]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

In Italy, the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started in the Lombardy region, probably on February 18, 2020. The province of Bergamo registered the highest incidence of COVID-19 in Italy. Here, we report the clinical cases of children with DS who presented, with confirmed COVID-19, at the emergency departments of hospitals in Bergamo Province between February and May 2020. One case is a COVID-19 acute viral pneumonia and second case of immunoinflammatory condition that presented nearly 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Case 1

A 14-year-old Caucasian girl with DS was admitted to our ward due to fever, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, fatigue, and dyspnea. She had no cardiac anomalies, but she was overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 36 and had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Before admission, she had already started on amoxicillin-clavulanate and acetaminophen for fever. On admission, chest radiography revealed bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. Due to her worsening respiratory condition, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she was initially intubated; then, she was weaned to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and later supported by an oxygen mask. She underwent treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin), antiviral drugs (lopinavir and ritonavir), hydroxychloroquine, and low-molecular-weight heparin. Respiratory symptoms recovered after 14 days, and the course was complicated by a sacral bedsore needing prolonged curettage. A lung computed tomography (CT) performed after recovery revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities and bilateral air trapping. No evidence of thromboembolism was found. Spirometry 30 and 60 days after recovery were normal.

### Randomized trial of amoxicillin for pneumonia in Pakistan [^111vsDEg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

OUTCOMES

Primary outcome was cumulative treatment failure (TF) from randomization until completion of the 3 day course of study drug. TF was indicated by using any of the following: death, WHO defined danger sign, onset of lower chest indrawing, hospitalization for any reason and change in study drug by study physician due to new onset comorbid infection or for serious non-fatal antibiotic associated adverse event. The null hypothesis was of inferiority of the placebo to amoxicillin: the alternative was of non-inferiority. Secondary outcome included relapse assessed between days 4–14 using the same criteria mentioned above. Treatment adherence was defined as follows: per protocol status (taking 5/6 or 6/6 doses by day 3) or adherence to the time of treatment failure if it occurred within 3 days with no other treatment. Adverse events were defined as: non severe (diarrhea, rash and mouth ulcer and severe adverse event) or severe (diarrhea requiring intravenous hydration, anaphylaxis, and organ failure, life threatening injury or death).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The initial sample size was based on a study by Hazir et al specifying a TF of 5% with amoxicillin and a non-inferiority (NI) margin of 2.5% (50% greater than the standard treatment). After interim analysis of 1,000 participants, the overall TF was found to be lower, 3.5%. Therefore sample size was revised to specify a more conservative NI margin of 1.75% with a presumed TF of 3.5% with amoxicillin. With this NI margin, a minimum of 3,778 children were required to complete treatment per-protocol to achieve 90% power at one sided alpha of 0.05. Considering a non-per protocol rate of 5% a minimum of 3,978 were, therefore, required.

### The effect of azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with down syndrome [^111z2XoR]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties, has been widely used for various indications, notably in treating respiratory infections. Research in the general pediatric population has demonstrated the increasing use of macrolides for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, especially in infants with recurrent wheezing. Considering the higher prevalence of recurrent wheezing in children with Down syndrome, there is rationale for investigating the potential benefits of azithromycin in this population. In addition, various studies acknowledge the increasing use of macrolide medications as a component of LRTI treatment in children. In a study conducted by Kozyrskyj et al. a 15-fold increase in the prescription of broad-spectrum macrolides (azithromycin and clarithromycin) for infants with recurrent wheezing was reported.

In a study involving children aged 1–6 years with recurrent wheezing, it was found that early administration of azithromycin during lower airway infection resulted in a reduction in symptom severity and a decreased rate of severe infections compared to a placebo. Since the efficacy of early azithromycin therapy was already reported in the pediatric population, The potential for the benefit of chronic azithromycin therapy in Down syndrome patients should be explored. Despite the predominantly viral etiology of LRTIs in children, infants with recurrent wheezing carry a higher prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in the airways. The collective data, along with our findings, lend support to the potential role of chronic Azithromycin in preventing respiratory morbidity in young children with Down Syndrome. Unfortunately, the secondary respiratory outcomes did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the small sample size (only two children were admitted to the PICU).

### Recommendations for treatment of childhood non-severe pneumonia [^117Go1ag]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been effective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3–5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48–72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the first-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable second-line agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an affordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114Au4Le]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The trial was approved by the Versailles/Saint-Germain-en-Laye University Ethics Committee, the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, and the French Data Protection Agency. The study was performed in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinkiand the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent, which included the conduct of future studies. All data were deidentified. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Randomization and Masking

After 3 full days (72 hours) of β-lactam treatment, patients with all clinical criteria of stability were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/62.5 mg) treatment or placebo (2 pills 3 times daily) for 5 extra days. Randomization was performed with stratification according to randomization site and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (score of ≤ 70 or > 70). The PSI is scored from 0 to 395, stratifying patients into classes according to the 30-day risk of death: low risk for classes I and II (scores, 0–70), low risk for class III (scores, 71–90), medium risk for class IV (scores, 91–130), and high risk for class V (scores, 131–395). Patients, treating physicians, investigators, pharmacists, and study coordinators were masked to treatment allocation.

### Effect of antibiotics in preventing hospitalizations from respiratory tract infections in children with down syndrome [^115dwgUF]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to anatomical variations, comorbidities, and immune system immaturity. Evidence on interventions to reduce this risk is incomplete. This study aims to quantify the effect of antibiotics prescribed for RTIs in primary care on the subsequent risk of RTI-related hospitalization for children with DS versus controls.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 992 children with DS and 4874 controls managed by UK National Health Service General Practitioners (GPs) and hospitals as identified in CALIBER (Clinical disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records), 1997–2010. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were undertaken.

Results

In children with DS, the prescription of antibiotics following an RTI-related GP consultation did not significantly reduce the risk of RTI-related hospitalization in the subsequent 28 days (risk with antibiotics, 1.8%; without, 2.5%; risk ratio, 0.699; 95% confidence interval, 0.471–1.036). Subgroup analyses showed a risk reduction only in infants with DS, after adjustment for covariates. There was no reduction in risk for controls, overall or across subgroups.

Conclusions

In conclusion, while prescription of antibiotics following RTI-related GP consultations were effective for infants with DS in reducing subsequent RTI-related hospitalization, this was not the case for older children with DS. We would encourage further high-quality cohort and randomized controlled trials to interrogate this finding, and to examine the impact of antibiotics on other endpoints, including symptom duration.

### Building in efficacy: developing solutions to combat drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^115pKvFR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The development of our understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine antimicrobial efficacy has advanced substantially over the last 10 years. We are now in a position to use PK/PD principles to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation so that we can predict eradication of specific pathogens or resistant variants when agents are used clinically. Optimisation of PK/PD parameters to enable the treatment of resistant pathogens with oral agents may not be possible with many current agents, such as some cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Aminopenicillins, however, such as amoxicillin, have linear PK and have a good safety profile even at high doses. The new pharmacokinetically enhanced oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate, 2000/125 mg twice daily, was designed using PK/PD principles to be able to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of up to and including 4 mg/L, which includes most penicillin-resistant isolates. For amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC (T > MIC) of 35–40% of the dosing interval (based on blood levels) is predictive of high bacteriological efficacy. This target was met by the design of a unique bilayer tablet incorporating 437.5 mg of sustained-release sodium amoxicillin in one layer plus 562.5 mg of immediate-release amoxicillin trihydrate and 62.5 mg of clavulanate potassium in the second layer, with two tablets administered for each dose. This unique design extends the bacterial killing time by increasing the T > MIC to 49% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 4 mg/L, and 60% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 2 mg/L. Based on these results, this new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation should be highly effective in treating respiratory tract infections due to drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### The effect of azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with down syndrome [^114Kd3E5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with Down syndrome experience greater vulnerability and have unique characteristics compared to the general pediatric population. Respiratory illness constitutes a significant proportion of their health concerns, emphasizing the need to explore additional approaches for prevention and treatment. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the impact of chronic Azithromycin treatment on respiratory infections in children with Down syndrome. We hypothesized that such treatment may reduce the occurrence and complications of respiratory morbidity in these children. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of chronic azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with Down syndrome.

Bacterial pneumonia treatment — first-choice options for S. pneumoniae (occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) include amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management, ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternative parenteral options are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate; for children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day), and add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae).

### Susceptibility to COVID-19 diagnosis in people with down syndrome compared to the general population: matched-cohort study using primary care electronic records in the UK [^117MGpLW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our data and other research suggest that individuals with DS are particularly at risk for COVID-19 and other respiratory infections. Our data further emphasises the need to prioritise individuals with DS for COVID-19 vaccination. They should also be prioritised for surveillance of respiratory infections during high-risk periods, and for implementing additional safety measures during pandemics. This may include preventing and rapidly containing transmission in long-term care facilities, providing support to caregivers on close monitoring and safe care, and identification of symptoms that may indicate the need for assessment for admission to hospital. Active medical management to ensure access to oxygen therapy and drugs such as steroids and antibiotics when needed could prevent complications and hospital admissions. There may also be a rationale for offering pneumococcal vaccine in addition to flu vaccine to children and adults with DS. Other preventative measures include management of comorbidities such as obesity and treatment of sleep apnoea. Future studies on the contribution of TMPRSS2 triplication and developing therapies that may be particularly relevant to DS are needed.

### Amoxicillin for 3 or 5 days for chest-indrawing pneumonia in Malawian children [^117QVCyC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

A relative non-inferiority margin of 1.5 times the TF rate in the 5-day amoxicillin group was chosen based on an anticipated TF rate in the 5-day group of 8%. This non-inferiority margin, 50% higher TF rate in the 3-day compared to the 5-day group, was chosen after extensive discussions among the investigators and with external experts regarding what TF rate might be acceptable to clinicians for the 3-day compared to the 5-day group, considering the anticipated potential TF rate in the 5-day group and potential for enrollment into the study. Initially adjusting for 2 formal interim analyses (with O'Brien-Fleming boundary for early noninferiorityand Pocock boundary for early inferiority), enrolling 2,000 children (1,000 per group) provided 88.1% power if the TF rate was equal in both groups at 8%, and 64.8% power if the TF rate was 4% in both groups. A potential increase in sample size was considered during planning of the study in case the overall TF rate was much lower than the anticipated 8%. After the second formal interim analysis, it was clear that the overall TF rate was less than 6%. To maintain a power (with equal TF rates) of 80% or higher, the maximum sample size was increased to 3,000 children (1,500 per group), and a third formal interim analysis was performed after a little more than 2,000 children were enrolled. The decision to increase the sample size was made by blinded study investigators after consultation with the funding agency. With increase in maximum sample size (and assuming equal TF rates in each group), the study had 84.8% and 89.8% power for 5% and 6% TF rates, respectively. Power calculations took into account a drop-out rate of 5% and assumed a 1-sided alpha of 0.025 for a test of a difference in proportions. Primary analyses were performed based on the intent-to-treat principle of complete cases using linear regression adjusted for age groups, study phase and sex, and using robust standard errors based on the Huber-White sandwich estimator. Justified because the sample size was sufficiently large, linear regression was used for this binary outcome to model differences in rates. Estimates for treatment differences for prespecified subgroups are reported with individual 95% confidence intervals (CIs) without adjustment for multiple comparisons. No post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed. The independent DSMB considered formal stopping boundaries during their interim reviews, but decided not to follow them, but rather, treat them as guiding only. Thus, the primary analysis was not adjusted for interim monitoring. Sensitivity analyses were performed using multiple imputations and tipping point analyses. For multiple imputations, a hot-deck approach (20 imputations) was used considering a match on at least 3 of the following 5 factors: age (2–11, 12–35, 36–50 months), sex, mother's education (none, primary, secondary/tertiary), number of children in the home (1, 2, 3, 4+), and number of amoxicillin doses taken (≤ 4, 5–7, 8–9, 10). Analyses of secondary endpoints used robust standard errors unadjusted for interim analyses or other factors. Of 6 prespecified subgroup analyses, 4 are reported.

### Limited evidence on the management of respiratory tract infections in Down's syndrome: a systematic review [^1172CCoN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Down's syndrome, also known as trisomy 21, is amongst the commonest genetic conditions worldwide, with an incidence of 1 in 1000 live births in the United Kingdom. Despite advances in antenatal screening since the 1990s, the number of children born with Down's syndrome in the United Kingdom has remained stable.

Discrete immune deficiencies, morphologic variations of the airways, generalized hypotonia and swallowing dysfunction predispose children with Down's syndrome to frequent and more severe respiratory tract infections (RTIs). – One in 3 of all hospitalization of children with Down's syndrome less than 3 years of age are caused by RTIs, with 80% occurring before 2 years of age.

Children with Down's syndrome on average spend 2–3 times more time in hospital than those without Down's syndrome. In children with Down's syndrome, up to the age of 18, RTIs are the second leading cause of death. It is therefore important that effective interventions to prevent and treat these infections are developed. A number of preventive interventions are commonly practiced and believed to be of benefit including use of prophylactic antibiotics, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis for subgroups (eg, those with cardiac disease), additional immunizations and longer treatment courses. However, no previous systematic review has been undertaken to ascertain the evidence base.

The aim of this study is to systematically review the literature on the management of RTIs in this vulnerable group to identify which strategies work best.

We evaluated the efficacy of a new pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate (2,000/125 mg) twice daily for the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (PRSP; penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs]: ≥ 2 microg/ml. A total of 2,482 patients received study medication (safety population). Of these, 2,324 were clinically evaluable (efficacy population), and 1,156 of them had at least one pathogen isolated at screening (bacteriology population). S pneumoniae was isolated from 371 patients in the bacteriology population, including 37 with PRSP. Follow-up in the bacteriology population on days 17 through 28 revealed that amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was successful in 345 of 371 patients with S pneumoniae infection (93.0%) and in 36 of 37patients with PRSP infection (97.3%), including 7 of 8 patients (87.5%) whose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid MICs were 4/2 microg/ml or higher. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate was generally well tolerated, as only 2.2% of patients withdrew because of adverse events. This agent represents a valuable new therapeutic option for the empiric treatment of ABRS, particularly in areas where antimicrobial-resistant pathogens (including beta-lactamase-positive organisms) are prevalent, and for the treatment of patients who are at increased risk of infection with PRSP.

### Efficacy of antibiotic regimens for pneumonia in young infants aged 0–59 days: a systematic review [^112xJjnQ]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

CONTEXT

Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in young infants.

OBJECTIVES

To evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens to treat young infant pneumonia on critical clinical outcomes.

DATA SOURCES

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, World Health Organization (WHO) Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Registry of Trials.

STUDY SELECTION

We included randomized controlled trials of young infants aged 0 to 59 days with pneumonia (population) comparing the efficacy of antibiotic regimens (intervention) with alternate regimens or management (control) on clinical outcomes.

DATA EXTRACTION

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to assess certainty of evidence.

LIMITATIONS

Trials were heterogeneous, which precluded data pooling.

RESULTS

Of 2601 publications screened, 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Seven trials were hospital-based (n = 869) and 3 were nonhospital-based (n = 4329). No hospital-based trials evaluated WHO-recommended first-choice regimens. One trial found the WHO-recommended second-choice antibiotic, cefotaxime, to have similar rates of treatment success as non-WHO-recommended regimens of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (RR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82–1.10) or amoxicillin–clavulanate/cefotaxime (RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.86–1.12). Among 3 nonhospital-based trials comparing oral amoxicillin to alternate regimens to treat isolated tachypnea among infants aged 7–59 days, there were no differences in treatment failure between amoxicillin and alternate regimens. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for all primary outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

We found limited evidence to support the superiority of any single antibiotic regimen over alternate regimens to treat young infant pneumonia.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1132XXKh]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Standard dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy were cefazolin (100 mg/kg/day continuously after a loading dose of 2 g), amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2 g q 8 h), or third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone [2 g q 24 h] or cefotaxime [2 g q 8 h]). In the treatment period, patients who remained in ARC benefited from increased dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy (cefazolin 150 mg/kg/day, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2 g q 6 h, ceftriaxone 2 g q 12 h, or cefotaxime 2 g q 6 h). A 7-day course was considered sufficient unless inadequate initial antibiotic therapy, bacteremia, immunosuppressive disease, or MDR pathogen.

The overall treatment of patients with HAP-VAP during the control and treatment periods was similar except for the antimicrobial dosing regimens. There were no known significant changes to our ICU protocols, ventilation or weaning procedures, or patient population during the study period.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was a composite criterion defined as a poor clinical outcome of the antimicrobial therapy, including therapeutic failure and HAP-VAP recurrence within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization.
Therapeutic failure was defined as an impaired clinical response (persistent or worsening symptoms of HAP-VAP) with the need for escalating empirical antimicrobial therapy. Inappropriate empirical treatment was not considered as therapeutic failure. De-escalation did not qualify as therapeutic failure. Superinfections due to new causative pathogens with natural resistance to the initial antimicrobial therapy were not considered as therapeutic failure.
Recurrence was defined by a second HAP-VAP with at least one of the initial causative bacterial strains growing at a significant concentration from a second sample after completing antibiotic therapy. Tracheobronchial colonization without evidence of pulmonary infection was not considered as HAP-VAP recurrence.

The primary outcome was assessed by one of the investigators (GC) based on clinical and microbiologic data. External validation was performed independently by at least two other investigators (CC, NS) blinded to the allocated period and antibiotic dosing regimen.

The secondary endpoints were the reported antibiotic side effects during treatment (cholestasis, cytolysis, delirium, seizure, renal failure), the secondary acquisition of antimicrobial resistance within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the status (alive or dead) at discharge.

### Proof of concept: performance testing in models [^113PhKJT]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that predict antimicrobial efficacy can be used to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation. Although current formulations of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate have retained their efficacy against many, but not all, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, additional coverage is required to address the growing problem of drug-resistant strains. Accordingly, two new oral formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate, a paediatric formulation at 90/6.4 mg/kg/day and a pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation at 2000/125 mg twice daily for adults, were designed using PK/PD principles. These principles indicate that for amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC of 35–40% of the dosing interval is predictive of high bacterial efficacy. In line with PK/PD predictions, simulation of human pharmacokinetics in in-vitro kinetic models and in a rat model of pneumonia, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was highly effective against S. pneumoniae strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4 or 8 mg/L. Against strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4 mg/L, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than the conventional 875/125 mg twice daily formulation, azithromycin and levofloxacin, even though all levofloxacin MICs were ≤ 1 mg/L. Following infection with S. pneumoniae strains with amoxicillin MICs of 8 mg/L, the amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily formulation was more effective than the conventional amoxicillin/clavulanate formulations of 875/125 mg twice daily and three times daily and 1000/125 mg three times daily, and had similar or better efficacy than azithromycin and levofloxacin, depending on the strain. These data indicate the potential benefit of therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily compared with conventional formulations and other marketed antimicrobials in the treatment of respiratory tract infection.

### Performance in practice: bacteriological efficacy in patients with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^113iBmqi]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily was designed to provide adequate levels of amoxicillin over the 12-h dosing interval to eradicate penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP, penicillin MICs ≥ 2 mg/L) with amoxicillin MICs of at least 4 mg/L. The clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was evaluated in patients with respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, including isolates with elevated penicillin (2–8 mg/L) MICs. Data from 10 clinical studies were combined: seven randomised (1:1), double-blind, controlled trials (efficacy intent-to-treat [ITT]N = 3376): amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg twice daily vs. levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS); levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB); clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily in AECB; amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily/three times daily and 1000/125 mg three times daily in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and three noncomparative studies (efficacy ITT N = 3024): two in ABS, one in CAP. The bacteriological per-protocol (PP) population at follow up (days 14–39) comprised 1295 patients for amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg and 241 for comparators. With amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg at follow-up, outcome was successful (clinical success and eradication/presumed eradication) in 85/90 (94.4%) patients with S. pneumoniae in comparative studies and 421/445 (94.6%) in noncomparative studies, and with comparators 58/70 (82.9%) were successes. In the amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg group at follow up, 52/552 S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin. At follow up, 50/52 (96.2%) patients with PRSP were successes, including 6/7 with amoxicillin MICs of 4 mg/L and 7/8 with amoxicillin MICs of 8 mg/L. Success rates for amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg against PRSP were similar for CAP (96.0%[24/25]), AECB (100%[3/3]) and ABS (95.8%[23/24]). There were six PRSP isolates in the comparator group (two isolates were from one patient), and three of five patients in this group were successes. In conclusion, amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg demonstrated combined clinical/bacteriological success against 50/52 patients with PRSP, including 13/15 strains with amoxicillin MICs of 4–8 mg/L. These results for the pharmacokinetic-enhanced formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg are in line with the high efficacy against PRSP predicted using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^117RBjuf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — a prospective observational cohort at 1 hospital in Barcelona of adults hospitalized with bacteremic pneumococcal CAP receiving empiric therapy reported resistance patterns and mortality associated with discordant therapy. Among 100 consecutive patients, penicillin resistance was present in 29 isolates (17 intermediate minimum inhibitory concentrations [0.12–1 μg/mL] and 12 high minimum inhibitory concentrations [≥ 2 μg/mL]); 18 were nonsusceptible to macrolides and 2 to cephalosporin, and 27 patients were immunocompromised. Discordant initial therapy occurred in 10 patients, with mortality 50% (5/10) versus 13/90 (14%) with concordant therapy, and the estimated excess mortality for initial discordant therapy was 35.6% (95% CI 3.73–67.4). The study states a significant association between discordant therapy and higher mortality in bacteremic pneumococcal CAP; only 3 of 9 patients still alive when discordance was demonstrated had therapy changed to appropriate therapy, and limitations include the very small discordant sample leading to wide CIs and contextual factors such as 6 discordant patients initially receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate and 2 who were PSI V.

We examined the impact of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines that recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing of ampicillin/amoxicillin increased following guideline publication, but remains low. Cephalosporin and macrolide prescribing decreased but remains common. Further studies exploring outcomes of and reasons for compliance with guidelines are warranted.

### Efficacy / safety of amoxicillin / clavulanate in adults with bacterial rhinosinusitis [^111p1NoR]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common and uncomfortable condition, frequently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Antibacterial resistance among these and other common respiratory pathogens is now widespread and of concern. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was developed to be effective against the common respiratory pathogens, including many resistant strains.

Materials and Methods

This open-label, noncomparative study assessed the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg in adult patients with ABRS. Requirements for study entry included a clinical diagnosis of ABRS supported by radiologic findings. In addition, sinus puncture for bacteriologic assessment was required at study entry.

Results

Overall, bacteriologic success (eradication or clinical evidence of eradication) at the follow-up visit (days 17–28) was achieved in 87.8% (722/822) of patients with 1 or more pathogen isolated at screening, in 93.2% (246/264) of patients with S pneumoniae, in 96.7% (29/30) of those with penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations ≥ 2 microg/mL), and in 88.7% (110/124) of patients with beta-lactamase-positive pathogens. Bacteriologic success was achieved against 6 of 7 S pneumoniae isolates with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4/2 microg/mL or higher.

Conclusions

Amoxicillin/clavulanate 2000/125 mg was generally well tolerated. This new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation provides a suitable option for empiric therapy for ABRS in adults.

### Susceptibility to COVID-19 diagnosis in people with down syndrome compared to the general population: matched-cohort study using primary care electronic records in the UK [^112KZMiq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Individuals with DS have both increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and are more likely to experience severe outcomes. Susceptibility to COVID-19 is increased during peaks of the pandemic and associated with health comorbidities in individuals with DS, particularly chronic respiratory conditions. Although lockdowns and the associated measures to wear masks and social distancing appeared to have an effect in reducing the initial wave of the pandemic, it did not seem to prevent excess infections in DS individuals during the 2 nd wave in the autumn winter of 2020, suggesting that these measures were not fully utilised for this group, or else that additional safeguards may be required. This has important public health implications to manage risk during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as well as to manage the risk associated with respiratory infections in people with DS. Individuals with DS who have underlying lung conditions should take extra care to safeguard themselves during viral pandemics, and our findings suggest a strong rationale for them to be prioritised for vaccination with COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116R7qqa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Limited evidence on the management of respiratory tract infections in Down's syndrome: a systematic review [^115uxgYh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims:

To systematically review the effectiveness of preventative and therapeutic interventions for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in people with Down's syndrome.

Methods:

Databases were searched for any published and ongoing studies of respiratory tract diseases in children and adults with Down's syndrome. These databases were searched for controlled trials, cohort studies and controlled before–after studies. Trial registries were searched for ongoing studies. Initially, all study types were included to provide a broad overview of the existing evidence base. However, those with a critical risk of bias were excluded using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Results:

A total of 13,575 records were identified from which 5 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and 3 fulfilled our criteria for data extraction. One randomized controlled trial of moderate risk of bias compared zinc therapy with placebo. Outcome data were only reported for 50 (78%) children who presented with extreme symptoms; no benefit of zinc therapy was found. One non-randomized controlled trial with serious risk of bias included 26 children and compared pidotimod (an immunostimulant) with no treatment; pidotimod was associated with fewer upper RTI recurrences compared with no treatment (1.43 vs. 3.82). A prospective cohort study with moderate risk of bias compared 532 palivizumab treated children with 233 untreated children and found that children treated with palivizumab had fewer respiratory syncytial virus-related hospitalization (23 untreated and 8 treated), but the same number of overall RTI-related hospitalizations (73 untreated and 74 treated) in the first 2 years of life.

Conclusions:

The evidence base for the management of RTIs in people with Down's syndrome is incomplete; current studies included children only and carry a moderate to serious risk of bias. Methodologic rigorous studies are warranted to guide clinicians in how best to prevent and treat RTIs in children with Down's syndrome.

### Antibiotics for preventing suppurative complications from undifferentiated acute respiratory infections in children under five years of age [^113KZ48r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Undifferentiated acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a large and heterogeneous group of infections not clearly restricted to one specific part of the upper respiratory tract, which last for up to seven days. They are more common in pre-school children in low-income countries and are responsible for 75% of the total amount of prescribed antibiotics in high-income countries. One possible rationale for prescribing antibiotics is the wish to prevent bacterial complications.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics in preventing complications in children aged two to 59 months with undifferentiated ARIs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4, MEDLINE (1950 to May week 2, 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) or quasi-RCTs comparing antibiotic prescriptions with placebo or non-treatment in children up to 59 months with an undifferentiated ARI for up to seven days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted and analysed data using the standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We identified four trials involving 1314 children. Three trials investigated the use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to prevent otitis and one investigated ampicillin to prevent pneumonia. The use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo to prevent otitis showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.11, three trials, 414 selected children, moderate-quality evidence). Methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not clearly stated in two trials. Performance, detection and reporting bias could not be ruled out in three trials. Ampicillin compared to supportive care (continuation of breastfeeding, clearing of the nose and paracetamol for fever control) to prevent pneumonia showed a RR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49, one trial, 889 selected children, moderate-quality evidence). The trial was non-blinded. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment methods were not clearly stated so the possibility of reporting bias could not be ruled out. Harm outcomes could not be analysed as they were expressed only in percentages. No studies were found assessing mastoiditis, quinsy, abscess, meningitis, hospital admission or death.

Authors' Conclusions

The quality of evidence currently available does not provide strong support for antibiotic use as a means of reducing the risk of otitis or pneumonia in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs. Further high-quality research is needed to provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in this population.

### The effect of azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with down syndrome [^1133uXVZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective study involving 23 episodes of chronic Azithromycin treatment (≥ 6 weeks) in 18 children with DS (≤ 6 years of age), we revealed a significant reduction in the length of respiratory hospitalizations following Azithromycin initiation. This finding suggests that chronic Azithromycin treatment may contribute to shorter hospital stays, possibly by mitigating airway inflammation and associated complications. Other secondary respiratory outcomes did not exhibit significant differences between the pre and post-Azithromycin treatment. The decrease in LOS for respiratory hospitalizations has important implications for healthcare resource utilization and the overall well-being of children with Down syndrome.

Children with DS suffer more from recurrent respiratory infections and associated complications, leading to frequent and prolonged hospitalizations. This often necessitates respiratory support and admission to intensive care units. Notably, recurrent wheezing is more common in children with Down syndrome compared to those without the syndrome. The respiratory system is a major site of pathology in individuals with Down syndrome, primarily due to structural and functional abnormalities, as well as compromised immune function. The increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, coupled with the frequent hospitalizations observed in these children, underscores the urgency for effective preventative measures through diverse therapeutic strategies. Given the unique characteristics and vulnerabilities of this population, exploring novel approaches for managing respiratory illnesses becomes imperative.

### Limited evidence on the management of respiratory tract infections in Down's syndrome: a systematic review [^115fZhiU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

We developed a broad search strategy combining the terms Down's Syndrome, Respiratory Tract Infections and relevant synonyms. To increase the yield of potential relevant articles, management options for Down's syndrome-related comorbidities such as sleep-disordered breathing, chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease were also included in the syntax. To obtain a broad overview of the existing evidence base, we did not limit our search strategy to specific study types, language or publication date (Appendix 1).

Information Sources

We searched the following electronic databases from their inception up to February 2015: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. Trial registries such as WHO ICTRP andwere also searched for completed or ongoing studies. To identify any additional studies, reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were screened.

We searched gray literature through web searches via Google Scholar, SIGLE and relevant research websites [including National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council]. Contact with research networks and charities were also made (including Trisomy 21 Research Society, Down's Syndrome Association, Downs Syndrome International, Down's Heart Groupand Downs Syndrome Medical Interest Group United Kingdom and Ireland).

Eligibility Criteria

We included studies of individuals with Down's syndrome irrespective of age and covering any intervention (ie, medical and/or surgical) for the prevention or treatment of RTIs including watchful waiting and supportive care. We anticipated that the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for this topic would be limited because of the specific study population. Therefore, we included all study types except for case series and case reports.

Study Selection and Inclusion

Two review authors (L.M. and K.R.) independently screened titles and abstracts retrieved from the database searches along with the reference lists of the included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The same authors independently reviewed the full text of potentially relevant studies against the predefined eligibility criteria. A third author (R.V.) reviewed the discrepancies, and differences were resolved by consensus. Data extraction was performed by 1 reviewer (K.R.) and was independently checked by 2 reviewers (L.M. and R.V.). Two reviewers (L.M. and R.V.) independently performed the quality assessment of included studies.

### The effect of azithromycin treatment on respiratory morbidity in children with down syndrome [^111MSpHJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Down syndrome (DS), resulting from trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common chromosomal syndrome, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 600–800 live births. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive physical features and systemic involvement, primarily affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Structurally and functionally, respiratory involvement constitutes this syndrome's main pathology. Additionally, there is a suboptimal functioning of the immune system in DS, including impaired B-cell and T-cell function, reduced antibody production, and the presence of inflammatory cytokines, leading to recurring infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Children with DS experience about five times more hospitalizations than the general pediatric population.

Respiratory abnormalities in children with Down syndrome stem from a variety of factors associated with their characteristic phenotypes, such as hypotonia, macroglossia, relative hypertrophy of adenoid tissue, and obesity, as well as structural defects like laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and subglottic stenosis. Additionally, congenital heart defects associated with Down syndrome may lead to secondary airway obstruction due to vascular pressure on the airways and/or complications from cardiac surgeries. More than half of all hospitalizations of children with Down syndrome were due to respiratory illness, with 40% specifically attributed to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), making it the leading cause of acute hospitalization in these children.

Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic widely used for various indications, including respiratory infections, has anti-inflammatory effects on the respiratory system. It reduces exaggerated airway responsiveness caused by eosinophilic inflammation, suppresses the production of cytokines such as IL-5, IL-8, and IL-6, and inhibits neutrophil activity on airway epithelial cells. Azithromycin is widely used in people with Cystic fibrosis (PwCF), based on clinical trials demonstrating improved lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerbations. A recent study on monocytes of PwCF highlighted the cellular functions and molecular targets of azithromycin, which improved the uptake of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and restored anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization in PwCF. Biegelman et al. reported that children treated with Azithromycin during an RSV bronchiolitis episode had fewer respiratory symptoms over the subsequent year than those treated with a placebo.

### Limited evidence on the management of respiratory tract infections in Down's syndrome: a systematic review [^112JV3B6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

By a broad systematic search and review of the literature, we identified only 5 published studies on the management of RTIs in children with Down's syndrome. This is remarkable in the light of the large body of literature in this field: Most high-quality studies on the management on RTIs in children have excluded this vulnerable group that are at high risk of these infections.

We found that pidotimod, an immunostimulant, and palivizumab, a human monoclonal antibody, may have a role in preventing RTIs in children with Down's syndrome with the latter particularly effective in young children (until 2 years of age) against RSV-RTI hospitalizations. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of palivizumab in children with Down's syndrome who are at risk of severe RSV-related infections (eg, congenital heart disease, airway clearance issues, prematurity). Once published, the ongoing postmarketing observational study is likely to add to this evidence base. Oral zinc was not noted to be effective in preventing RTIs.

The evidence base for RTI management in people with Down's syndrome is incomplete, with only a limited number of moderate to serious risk of bias studies available on the prevention of RTIs in children. As such, clinical management of RTIs in this vulnerable group is currently guided by studies including either no or only limited number of children with Down's syndrome. Methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to guide clinicians on how best to prevent and treat RTIs in children with Down's syndrome.

### Necessity of amoxicillin clavulanic acid in addition to prednisolone in mild-to-moderate COPD exacerbations [^11419Yes]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Study design

This study was a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to either the intervention or control group based on a computer generated randomisation list. The hospital pharmacy provided both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo in identical containers with identical capsules. Based on the randomisation list, the hospital pharmacy sequentially numbered the containers with both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo. This list was kept in a safe at the hospital pharmacy throughout the course of the study. Patients received these numbered containers in sequence of randomisation, which was recorded on a medication distribution list.

Patients in both groups received oral prednisolone, 30 mg/day for 7 days. Patients in the intervention group additionally received oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 500/125 mg three times daily for 7 days, while control patients received a matching placebo. The choice for this amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is based on the negligible prevalence of organisms resistance in our region (less than 5%). All patients continued their prescribed inhaled regimen. Patients were followed for 28 days for the primary outcome and for 4 months to detect new AECOPDs.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the duration of the AECOPD. Start of the AECOPD was defined as the day the patient presented with an AECOPD at the outpatient clinic. The end day of the AECOPD was based on a symptom diary, which patients completed daily. In this diary, patients reported whether their major symptoms and minor symptoms, according to Anthonisen et al (table 1), were beyond normal. At inclusion all patients received a 'what is normal' card on which their individual levels of major symptoms in stable health state were recorded. This card was used as a reference for the diary. When patients experienced no increase in severity of any symptoms listed in the diary, they could tick 'no change in symptoms'. In all other cases, they had to report on all the symptoms in the diary - whether the level of each symptom was normal, whether there was a small increase or an evident increase in severity compared to their stable state.
