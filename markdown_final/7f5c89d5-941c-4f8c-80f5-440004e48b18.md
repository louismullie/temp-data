Would you be able to prepare an examination for me?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to prepare a high-quality medical examination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the exam's purpose and scope and anchoring validity early. Then, I should define assessment standards and blueprinting. Next, I will consider item formats for knowledge, reasoning, and skills, followed by item development, peer review, and psychometrics. After that, I need to plan standard setting and equating, and then operational implementation before, during, and after the exam. Finally, I should address fairness, educational impact, and continuous quality improvement, and close with practical next steps and limitations to ensure feasibility and quality [^111izzdn] [^114YKK1E] [^114Jv6og].

> Let me first confirm the foundational step: purpose and scope must drive everything, because validity hinges on alignment between what is tested and what decisions the exam supports, and I need to ensure the target learners, stakes, and content domain are explicitly specified and traceable to an authoritative curriculum or competency framework; the dermatology SCE model underscores transparent blueprinting as a "contract" with candidates, which I should emulate here to maintain defensible validity claims [^111izzdn] [^114Jv6og].

> Next, I should review which assessment standards we are adopting and why; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about reliability without considering practicability, cost, fairness, and educational impact too, because the radiology board-exam checklist literature consistently identifies six core standards — validity, reliability, practicability, cost, fairness, and educational impact — and I need to ensure our plan explicitly maps to each; moreover, I must remember that even excellent exams often operate at the "shows how" level of Miller's pyramid, so complementary workplace-based assessments may still be needed to approximate the "does" level in practice [^114YKK1E] [^114tGSuH].

> I will now examine blueprint development; wait, let me verify the content–objective mapping and cognitive level targets before setting proportions by topic and format, because item-level alignment with learning objectives and Bloom's taxonomy improves construct validity and later psychometric interpretability; explicit specification of content areas, item counts, and time allocations strengthens transparency and supports later equating and comparability across administrations as shown in specialty exams and audit frameworks [^116j7knU] [^113KEZ9g] [^114Jv6og].

> For knowledge assessment, I need to ensure MCQs are crafted to test higher-order thinking rather than recall; hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check we avoid common pitfalls like unfocused stems, cueing options, and "all of the above", and that distractors reflect real misconceptions; multiple item-writing guides converge on these principles, and adherence here will directly influence item difficulty and discrimination downstream [^115eGACg] [^113uodTP].

> For clinical reasoning, let me consider short clinical cases and structured formats like the EDiR's CORE; but wait, what if we assume CORE is automatically superior to oral exams — hold on, I should verify objectivity data first; analyses show comparable outcomes with CORE demonstrating better objectivity, so incorporating a structured reasoning component alongside MCQs and short cases can enhance reliability and fairness if we maintain rigorous scoring rubrics and examiner training [^1154nnFF] [^113dA1Wv].

> For skills assessment, my first thought is to lean heavily on OSCEs as the superior method; wait, let me reconsider, because critical reviews do not show unequivocal superiority, and OSCE validity and reliability depend on meticulous station design, content sampling, standardized patients, and scoring checklists — so I need to specify these implementation factors up front, especially for high-stakes decisions, to avoid overinterpreting OSCE scores [^113tg1ka].

> Now, I should confirm the item development and quality assurance cycle; initial drafting must align explicitly to the blueprint and cognitive targets, but I need to check that every item undergoes multi-expert peer review for clarity, accuracy, and bias detection, followed by piloting and psychometric review; audits like RadExam's show a meaningful minority of items require revision or retirement based on p-values and discrimination indices, so I must plan for iterative improvement rather than assume first-pass adequacy [^114Jv6og] [^116j7knU].

> Hold on, I should verify the standard setting plan before we talk reporting; established methods like Angoff or Hofstee are appropriate, but I need to ensure year-over-year comparability via statistical equating to keep difficulty stable, as practiced in the SCE processes; if early administrations reveal low mean scores or narrow spread, as seen in the medical genetics in-service exam, we should recalibrate items, enhance feedback, and possibly adjust the blueprint to better discriminate across the competency spectrum [^114Jv6og] [^112Txpk6].

> Next, I should review operational implementation steps across the exam lifecycle; I need to ensure pre-exam processes cover venue and technology readiness, proctor and SP training, candidate identity verification, and contingency plans; during the exam, standardized conditions and irregularity monitoring are critical; post-exam, I must secure responses, apply scoring rubrics consistently, conduct psychometric analysis, and produce interpretable reports; the web-based checklists and 174-element guide provide a structured way to ensure no critical step is missed [^114YKK1E] [^113KEZ9g].

> I should also confirm fairness, accessibility, and educational impact considerations; wait, let me verify accommodation pathways, language clarity, and cultural sensitivity are explicitly planned, and that candidates have transparent expectations and practice materials; evidence from counseling contexts suggests that structured pre-visit prompts can enhance candidate engagement and specificity of information exchange, and SCE experience highlights the importance of actionable feedback when pass rates fluctuate, all of which informs our feedback and remediation design [^115eUeFT] [^114Jv6og] [^114YKK1E].

> For continuous quality improvement, I need to ensure a cyclical process: audit reliability coefficients and item statistics, review pass rates, solicit stakeholder feedback, and update the blueprint to align with evolving practice; hold on, I should verify that we have thresholds for item retirement or revision based on discrimination and difficulty, as RadExam audits illustrate, and that we document changes to support defensibility and longitudinal comparability [^116j7knU] [^114YKK1E].

> Let me think about feasibility and limitations; while I can design the blueprint, formats, psychometric plan, and implementation checklists grounded in the literature, I should confirm input from specialty content experts for clinical accuracy and arrange access to a representative pilot cohort for calibration; without these, reliability and validity claims would be weaker, so staging pilots and expert reviews is non-negotiable for a high-stakes exam [^113KEZ9g] [^111izzdn].

> Finally, I should double-check the practical next steps to operationalize this; please specify the specialty domain, trainee level and numbers, stakes, preferred formats, timeline, resource constraints, and any existing blueprint or item bank, and then I will deliver a tailored package including the blueprint, sample items with cognitive level targets, a psychometrics plan, OSCE station templates where applicable, an implementation checklist, and a standard-setting and equating protocol, each tied back to the relevant evidence and standards to maintain clinical rigor and defensibility [^114Jv6og] [^115eGACg] [^114YKK1E].

Could you please **specify the subject area and level** (e.g. undergraduate biology, internal medicine, radiology) [^113dA1Wv], the **preferred format** (MCQ, OSCE, oral, or mixed) [^113uodTP] [^113tg1ka], the **approximate length**, and any **specific competencies or topics** to emphasize? With that information, I can **draft a tailored exam** [^115eGACg] with **clear instructions and scoring** [^114Jv6og] [^116j7knU] aligned to best practices.

### How to perform an excellent radiology board examination: A web-based checklist [^111izzdn]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

In the developed checklist, the assessment standard that most closely matches the questions at all stages of the exam was validity. Validity is an indispensable feature in terms of defending the comments and decisions reached as a result of the evaluation. It is particularly important to demonstrate the validity of the decisions at the end of the certification exams because the inadequate success of candidates with insufficient competencies will have undesirable consequences for candidates, institutions, and the healthcare provided. Therefore, the more "yes" answers given to questions that match the validity, the higher the validity of the exam will be.

Following validity in our checklist, the standard that most closely matches the questions was reliability. The goal of evaluation is to achieve the desired level of measurement accuracy and to maintain the consistency of scores over time under different test conditions and different evaluators. High reliability standards of the exam will enable us to achieve these goals. However, it should be noted that reliability is affected by almost all error sources. Effort for reliability also contributes to the fairness and transparency of the assessment.

### Objective structured clinical exams: A critical review [^113tg1ka]. Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Since their inception in the 1970s, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) have become popular and are now part of the US Medical Licensing Examination for all US medical graduates. Despite general acceptance of this method, there is debate over the value of OSCE testing compared to more traditional methods. A review of reliability and validity research does not clearly show the superiority of OSCE testing. To use OSCEs in a valid and reliable way, attention must be paid to test content, test design, and implementation factors, especially when the results will be used for high-stakes decision-making. While questions remain around the application of OSCE testing, there are known and hidden benefits to students, faculty, and organizations that use OSCEs. This paper reviews the pros and cons of the OSCE method and outlines important issues for medical educators to consider when planning to use OSCEs in their programs.

### How to write a high quality multiple choice question (MCQ): A guide for clinicians [^113uodTP]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the variety of assessment tools available, multiple choice questions (MCQs) still play an integral role in examinations at both national and specialty board levels. MCQs offer several methodological advantages; however, their effectiveness is linked to the quality of the questions posed. Recently, there has been a shift towards using MCQs to test higher-order concepts involving integration, interpretation, and problem-solving skills. This paper emphasizes the importance of question development and highlights potential pitfalls to avoid.

### The dermatology specialty certificate exam [^114Jv6og]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

The SCE is part of the compulsory assessment for medical specialties stipulated by the GMC to maintain high standards in doctors and ensure public confidence. This review aims to explain the process of producing the exam and setting reliable standards, informing candidates of the exam structure and aiding learning strategies. Questions are based on the curriculum blueprint, which is available online.

Exam questions are produced following the work of the question writers, the Exam Board, and the Standard Setting Group, and are subject to multiple rounds of peer review. The pass mark is set by statistical test equating to ensure the same level of difficulty from year to year. Optimum preparation for the exam should include exposure to a wide variety of patients in different clinical contexts and extensive reading. The pass rate for UK residents has reduced in the last three years; candidates not passing should consider feedback from the exam and discuss with their educational supervisors.

### Survey design: To ask or not to ask? That is the question [^115KrEat]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Surveys are one of the most frequent modes of observation and measurement. Survey research can be exploratory, descriptive, and/or explanatory. Modes of survey administration vary and include face-to-face, telephone, mail, and Internet. There are numerous considerations that must be taken into account when designing and conducting a survey. Deciding what information is needed and why is important when developing questions for a survey; it is essential to define the purpose of the survey and to be as specific as possible in terms of the data to be collected. Response rate varies by target audience and is influenced by a number of factors such as incentives, survey length, and perceived burden. From question development to survey construction, the goal is to minimize measurement error with systematic planning and execution.

### Implementation of the clinically oriented reasoning evaluation: Impact on the European Diploma in Radiology (EDiR) exam [^1154nnFF]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The European Society of Radiology (ESR) created the EDiR examination in 2011 to address the heterogeneity of training programs across Europe and to establish a reference standard for radiology training assessment. More than 3,000 candidates took the EDiR from 2011 to 2019, and this number is expected to grow substantially in the coming years due to the online-based examination structure. Radiology residency programs are now being reviewed, and their board examinations are being adapted to modify or replace the oral examination with the CORE examination.

Most board examinations include multiple-choice questions and short cases. There is an ongoing discussion about which type of exam is more effective when assessing trainees' competencies — the oral or the CORE examination.

The EDiR is broadly used as an objective indicator of radiology knowledge at a European level. It is formatted to include multiple-choice questions, short clinical cases, and a CORE examination component.

Our analysis yielded similar results between the oral and the CORE examinations, with the CORE examination found to be more objective.

### ChatGPT can pass the AHA exams: Open-ended questions outperform multiple-choice format [^112XRgaC]. Resuscitation (2023). Low credibility.

The study by Fijačko et al. tested ChatGPT's ability to pass the BLS and ACLS exams of the AHA but found that ChatGPT failed both exams. A limitation of their study was the use of ChatGPT to generate only one response, which may have introduced bias. When generating three responses per question, ChatGPT can pass the BLS exam with an overall accuracy of 84%. When incorrectly answered questions were rewritten as open-ended questions, ChatGPT's accuracy rate increased to 96% and 92.1% for the BLS and ACLS exams, respectively, allowing ChatGPT to pass both exams with outstanding results.

### Asking a question: Linking evidence with practice [^112Q6NFr]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

For clinicians and researchers alike, a clear and answerable question is the starting point of the evidence-based practice process. For clinicians, the question captures the patient and defines the information needed to treat this patient, while for researchers, the question directs study design and drives everything from recruitment to reporting. The question is also the anchor point that links clinical practice to research. Engaging in evidence-based practice forces a subconscious process that occurs during the assessment of the patient into the conscious mind and makes it explicit. Clearly and concisely defining the question leads directly to the search for relevant research.

### Provera [^112jvvJE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To lower your chances of experiencing a serious side effect with Provera, talk with your healthcare provider regularly about whether you should continue taking the medication. The addition of a progestin is generally recommended for women with a uterus to reduce the chance of developing cancer of the uterus (womb). Consult your healthcare provider immediately if you experience vaginal bleeding while taking Provera.

Have a pelvic exam, breast exam, and mammogram (breast X-ray) annually, unless your healthcare provider advises otherwise. If there is a family history of breast cancer, or if you have ever had breast lumps or an abnormal mammogram, you may need breast exams more frequently. If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol (fat in the blood), diabetes, are overweight, or use tobacco, you may have a higher risk of developing heart disease. Ask your healthcare provider for strategies to lower your risk of heart disease.

Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not take Provera for conditions for which it was not prescribed. Do not give Provera to others, even if they have the same symptoms, as it may harm them.

Keep Provera out of the reach of children. This leaflet provides a summary of the most important information about Provera. For more information, talk with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. You can request information about Provera that is written for health professionals.

### Pocket-sized ultrasound as an aid to physical diagnosis for internal medicine residents: a randomized trial [^111v58mM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Proficiency and self-confidence in the physical examination are poor among internal medicine residents, and interest in ultrasound technology has expanded.

- **Objective**: We aimed to determine whether a pocket-sized ultrasound improves the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of residents following a 3-hour training session and 1 month of independent practice.

- **Design**: This was a randomized parallel group controlled trial.

- **Participants**: Forty internal medicine residents in a single program at an academic medical center participated in the study.

- **Intervention**: Three hours of training on the use of pocket-sized ultrasound was followed by 1 month of independent practice.

- **Main measures**: The primary outcome was a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of a physical exam alone versus a physical examination augmented with a pocket-sized ultrasound. Other outcomes included confidence in exam findings and a survey of attitudes towards the physical exam and the role of ultrasound.

- **Key results**: Residents in the intervention group using a pocket-sized ultrasound correctly identified an average of 7.6 out of 17 abnormal findings (accuracy rate of 44.9%). Those in the control group correctly identified an average of 6.4 abnormal findings (accuracy rate of 37.6%, p = 0.11). Residents in the intervention group identified on average 15.9 findings as abnormal when no abnormality existed (false positive rate of 16.8%). Those in the control group incorrectly identified an average of 15.5 positive findings (false positive rate of 16.3%). There was no difference between groups regarding self-assessment.

### Use of image-based analytics for ultrasound practice management and efficiency improvement [^114nDXhX]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Our ultrasound practice is becoming increasingly focused on managing practice resources and improving our efficiency while maintaining quality. We frequently address questions related to equipment utilization, management, study type statistics, and productivity. To support these efforts, we are developing an analytics system aimed at facilitating more evidence-based management of our ultrasound practice. This system aggregates information from tens of thousands of DICOM images generated during exams, including structured reporting, public and private DICOM headers, and text extracted from the images via optical character recognition (OCR). The collected data is further enhanced by inventory/location information to support comprehensive data aggregation. Statistical analysis and metrics, such as median exam length (measured from the first to the last image), transducer models used in each exam, and exams conducted in specific rooms, practice locations, or by certain sonographers, are computed.

- **Operational efficiency reports**: These reports provide insights into the length of a scan room's operational day, the number and types of exams performed, the time intervals between exams, and summary data such as exams per operational hour and time-based room utilization.

Our findings have already informed some practice decisions. Notably, we identified two defective probes that were not replaced, resulting in savings of over $10,000, due to utilization data indicating that three or more probes of the shared model were consistently idle. Neck exams have been identified as the most time-consuming on an individual basis; however, the high volume of abdominal exams causes them to accumulate the most total scan time. Consequently, abdominal exams are prime candidates for efforts aimed at optimizing efficiency. A small subset of sonographers demonstrates similar trends…

### Tips for a physician in getting the right job, part VI: Some possible interview questions for an executive position [^1153ScQz]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This article examines numerous general questions and possible responses that will be of special interest for those doctors interviewing for an administrative position. These queries are presented under the topic headings of why do you want to change jobs, what are your strong and weak points, what credentials do you possess to perform this job well, and what are your career objectives. However, some of these questions and answers will also be helpful to physicians seeking a clinical position. Additional types of questions and answers, such as those found in behavioral, situational, and stress interviews, will be discussed in subsequent articles.

### Assessing ChatGPT's potential in HIV prevention communication: A comprehensive evaluation of accuracy, completeness, and inclusivity [^1172MMJa]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Low credibility.

- **Measures**: The team formulated questions regarding the aforementioned topics by examining HIV forums and authoritative websites. Additional questions were crafted based on their experience counseling individuals on these subjects. These questions were then submitted to ChatGPT 4, and the responses were collected in Excel. The questions were categorized into five topics: (1) general information about HIV (20 questions), (2) behaviors increasing the risk of contracting HIV (54 questions), (3) pregnancy and HIV (8 questions), (4) testing (12 questions), and (5) use of prophylaxis (36 questions). This process was conducted between June 10, 2023, and June 22, 2023.

- **Questions and answers evaluation**: All responses from ChatGPT were meticulously recorded and shared with teams 2, 3, and 4. A designated team member from team one managed the recording and transcription of all dialogues between ChatGPT and the staff inputting questions, ensuring fidelity in the information captured in a comprehensive file, which was then distributed to the other teams. Team two reviewed the answers related to "general information about HIV" (topic 1, 20 questions) and "testing" (topic 4, 12 questions). Team three addressed "behaviors increasing the risk of contracting HIV" (topic 2, 54 questions). Team four evaluated "pregnancy and HIV" (topic 3, 8 questions) and "use of prophylaxis" (topic 5, 36 questions). Their task was to read the questions created by the first team and rate them.

### Can we reduce the workload of mammographic screening by automatic identification of normal exams with artificial intelligence? A feasibility study [^114XZtjb]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Performance of the AI system**: The distributions of digital mammography (DM) exams as a function of AI score are shown in Fig. 1 (for each type of exam according to ground truth: a, normal; b, cancer; c, benign). As expected, normal exams are distributed evenly across AI scoring categories, with an average of 10.0% of normal exams per category (range 7.2–14.9%). For the exams containing cancer, 72.5% are categorized within the highest cancer-present likelihood category (10), whereas 95.1% lie in the categories 5–10. In comparison, only 27% of exams containing benign lesions are in category 10. An example of an exam with cancer that was assigned a low AI score is shown in Fig. 2.

- **Fig. 1**: Distribution of normal (a), cancer (b), and benign exams (c) as a function of AI score, representing the likelihood of cancer present (1–10, 10 means high likelihood of cancer present). The contribution of each dataset to the overall percentage of exams is shown.

- **Fig. 2**: An example of the nine exams in our study that contained cancer but were assigned an AI score of 1 or 2, the lowest cancer-present likelihood categories. None of the six radiologists recalled this exam during the original multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study (read without priors), suggesting that the cancer visibility with mammography is poor in these exams, and in fact, the cancer may have been detected by other means.

### 'It made you think twice' - an interview study of women's perception of a web-based decision aid concerning screening and diagnostic testing for fetal anomalies [^111H7yx5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Participants reported that the use of the decision aid (DA) initiated reflections about the value of screening for fetal anomalies and raised their awareness regarding the potential and limitations of prenatal screening examinations. Reading the expectant parents' stories on the website, women recognized that couples in those stories based their decisions on personal values. This recognition made women more aware of their own standpoint, realizing that there are no right or wrong approaches in these decisions, just different ones.

"You can interpret the figures, but to learn from other people's stories, it is more meaningful. It's sort of more real,… you can relate. One may start thinking, okay, what would we do and how would we react and what is it that we may need to talk about". (Participant nr 5)

Using worksheets enabled women to put their thoughts and beliefs into words. Furthermore, some women, who had made their choices before they had access to the website, appreciated that the use of this website made them more convinced that they had made the right decision.

- **Involved the partner**: The women stated that the DA initiated discussions with their partner. Five of them mentioned that they reviewed the website together with their partner. The other six said that they went through it by themselves but discussed some of the issues with their partners afterward.

"My partner and I went through this together, you could see if you both thought the same way or if you had different views… for it can also be a good basis to discuss".

### How to perform an excellent radiology board examination: A web-based checklist [^114YKK1E]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Questions in the item pool are grouped under four main titles, considering all the steps related to a board exam: (1) management of the entire procedure: general principles, (2) before examination/preparation for the exam, (3) implementing the exam, and (4) after the exam. It has been observed that questions under each title could also be collected under subtitles, and relevant subtitle names have been determined.

- **Determination of the assessment standards**: The standards to be used as a basis for performing a perfect evaluation are determined by a literature review. Many standards in the literature are expected to be considered in an assessment, which can be handled individually or together. In our study, six basic standards agreed upon by the researchers were determined as the recommended standards to be controlled during the assessment process. These standards were practicability, validity, reliability, cost, fairness, and educational impact.

- **Matching questions with assessment standards**: Information related to the standards was noted during the literature review step to determine the draft statements for the checklist. Thus, matching the questions in the draft checklist with the appropriate standards becomes integral to developing a comprehensive evaluation tool.

### The development and implementation of an in-service exam for medical genetics residency programs [^112Txpk6]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

In-service exams are a commonly used educational tool in postgraduate medical education. Although most specialties utilize such exams, medical genetics did not initially. It was decided in the spring of 2009 at the inaugural Medical Genetics Residency Program Directors (PDs) Group meeting to develop and implement such a test.

- **Methods**: Using questions sent in from PDs, a 125-question exam was created, featuring multiple-choice questions according to the format of the National Board of Medical Examiners. The exam covered genetics in the following areas: basic/molecular (~45 questions), cancer and adult (20 questions), prenatal (20 questions), biochemical (20 questions), and pediatric/dysmorphology (20 questions). The exam was administered for the first time in February 2010 and again with modifications in 2011.

- **Results**: In total, 174 trainees from 35 programs completed the exam in 2010; in 2011, the number increased to 214, representing 39 US programs and 4 Canadian programs. For both years, most participants were medical genetics residents (106 in 2010; 127 in 2011), but a substantial number of clinical laboratory fellows also participated (68 in 2010; 85 in 2011).

- **Conclusion**: The development and implementation of this test were an overall success in that, over two years, almost 100% participation from medical genetics residency programs was secured. Additionally, an infrastructure to develop and implement this exam yearly was created. However, there is a need for improvement, notably in the relatively low mean score and narrow spread of scores. Efforts are underway to address these issues.

### Editorial commentary: Black Mirror: Reviving the art of the physical exam [^112i7bzM]. Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Increased reliance on advanced imaging and time constraints have contributed to the general underuse of the physical examination to inform diagnostic reasoning. Advanced imaging is not a substitute for a well-performed history and physical examination and frequently does not alter diagnosis or treatment, especially when ordered in the primary care setting. Appreciating the diagnostic utility of various physical examination maneuvers will help leverage its value for more cost-effective selection of advanced imaging, reduce medical errors, improve patient counseling, and lead to an overall enhanced and personalized patient experience.

### Eyes and the heart: What a clinician should know [^115XwzuV]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Good clinical examination has always been holistic, with the inclusion of the eyes as part of any specialty clinical evaluation, including the heart. Increased reliance on investigative tools and increasing bureaucracy are threatening to eliminate the time-honored clinical examination skills. We have demonstrated the intricacies of the pathology of the eye and how these relate to the cardiovascular system. Mastery of cardiology follows mastery of internal medicine. Acquiring and maintaining these skills will improve clinical acumen and identify signs that may otherwise be missed, thus helping to improve diagnosis and patient management.

### 'It made you think twice' - An interview study of women's perception of a web-based decision aid concerning screening and diagnostic testing for fetal anomalies [^116xNrTz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

This first theme concerns women's opinions about significant features of the decision aid (DA) and what these features meant to them, specifically, being easily accessible on the Internet, more attractive than a "boring piece of paper", and being reliable.

- **Easily accessible and reliable**: The women reported that the Internet was their most common source of information when they had questions on pregnancy-related issues. The fact that the women were experienced Internet users was evident in these interviews; they recognized the features of the DA from other websites they had encountered and expressed that they, therefore, had no problems navigating their way to the parts of the DA they were interested in. "I saw right away that this is where I wanted to read every tab" (Participant nr 7). The women also appreciated that the DA felt reliable, which was supported by the link to the Fetal Medicine Unit. They mentioned that they had searched on the Internet for facts related to pregnancy but mainly ended up on chat sites, with information that could not be relied upon. "It feels good… when you have a webpage that you can rely on. Of course, one can read in chat forums and places like that, but it is not the same, and with these kinds of things, you really want it to be something from… an institution or something like that" (Participant nr 2).

- **More attractive than a "boring piece of paper": The women stated that it was important to them that information was readily accessible online. They described the generic pamphlet they were given during antenatal care as being less attractive.

### The annual physical examination: Important or time to abandon [^113D27uP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The annual physical examination remains a popular format with both patients and providers, despite the lack of evidence that either a comprehensive examination or laboratory screening tests are indicated for healthy adults. Patient desire for extensive testing and comprehensive examination, combined with provider belief that the physical examination is both of proven value and can detect subclinical illness, have led to the continued pervasive practice of annual physical examinations in our country. The authors review the forces behind the ongoing popularity of the annual physical examination and the recommendations for preventive services in healthy adults, and provide thoughts on what the busy practicing clinician can focus on in the realm of proven preventive health.

### Actiq [^111nQzYL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Detailed instructions for the proper storage, administration, disposal, and managing an overdose of Actiq are provided in the Actiq Medication Guide. Encourage patients to read this information in its entirety and give them an opportunity to have their questions answered.

In the event that a caregiver requires additional assistance in disposing of excess unusable units remaining in the home following a patient has expired, instruct them to call the toll-free number for Teva Pharmaceuticals (1–888–483–8279) or seek assistance from their local DEA office.

- **Addiction, abuse, and misuse**: Inform patients that the use of Actiq, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instruct patients not to share Actiq with others and to take steps to protect it from theft or misuse.

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression**: Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including the fact that the risk is greatest when starting Actiq or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help immediately in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Physical examination findings among children and adolescents with obesity: An evidence-based review [^116nEsYC]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Overweight and obesity affect 1 in 3 US children and adolescents. Clinical recommendations have largely focused on screening guidelines and counseling strategies. However, the physical examination of the child or adolescent with obesity can provide the clinician with additional information to guide management decisions. This expert-based review focuses on physical examination findings specific to children and adolescents with obesity. For each physical examination element, the authors define the finding and its prevalence among pediatric patients with obesity, discuss the importance and relevance of the finding, describe known techniques to assess severity, and review evidence regarding the need for additional evaluation. The recommendations presented represent a comprehensive review of evidence as well as expert opinion. The goal of this review is to highlight the importance of conducting a targeted physical examination during pediatric weight management visits.

### Tips for a physician in getting the right job, part XII: General questions for the applicant to ask [^111Qwvng]. Clinical nuclear medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The type and caliber of the questions asked by a job hunter are one of the ways an interviewer will evaluate the candidate. Questions that show poor preparation should be avoided, such as those indicating a failure to read materials provided by the employer or neglect to conduct elementary research on the practice, organization, or community. Additionally, asking about insignificant details is not beneficial. Failing to have any meaningful questions to ask is viewed negatively in an interview. This article discusses many important questions that applicants might consider asking during an interview.

### The cardiovascular physical examination - Is it still relevant [^117CpnQX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Advances in technology have reshaped the practice of medicine, greatly benefiting our patients. However, amidst these advances, the importance of basic clinical tools is more pertinent than ever. Despite the growing reliance on technology, the physical exam remains valuable and cost-effective, often enabling the well-trained clinician to arrive at a diagnosis rapidly and accurately. The physical exam must not become a relic of a distant past. We aim to investigate competency and proficiency, proposals for change in teaching curriculums, and the relationship with technology such as hand-held echocardiography. A skillful exam provides both emotional and intellectual satisfaction. It may be a lost art, but it is well worth the effort to restore.

### Assessment of H1N1 questions and answers posted on the web [^112Zdwxz]. American Journal of Infection Control (2012). Low credibility.

A novel strain of human influenza A (H1N1) posed a serious pandemic threat worldwide during 2009. The public's fear of pandemic flu often raises awareness and discussion of such events.

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to characterize major topical matters of H1N1 questions and answers raised by the online question-and-answer community Yahoo! Answers during the H1N1 outbreak.

- **Methods**: The study used Text Mining for SPSS Clementine (v.12; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) to extract the major concepts of the collected Yahoo! questions and answers. The original collections were retrieved using "H1N1" in the search keyword and then filtered for only "resolved questions" in the "health" category submitted within the past 2 years.

- **Results**: The most frequently formed categories were as follows:
	- **General health**: health, disease, medicine, investigation, evidence, problem
	- **Flu-specific terms**: H1N1, swine, shot, fever, cold, infective, throat
	- **Nonmedical issues**: feel, North American, people, child, nations, government, states, help, doubt, emotion

	The study found that URL data are fairly predictable: those providing answers are divided between ones dedicated to giving trustworthy information — from news organizations and the government, for instance — and those looking to espouse a more biased point of view.

- **Conclusion**: Critical evaluation of online sources should be taught to select the quality of information and improve health literacy. The challenges of pandemic prevention and control, therefore, demand both e-surveillance and better-informed "Netizens".

### Computed tomography referral guidelines adherence in Europe: Insights from a seven-country audit [^113jHkcW]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The study presented the distribution of exam types where a more appropriate examination was recommended in each country. On average, in 89% of cases where inappropriate CT examinations were requested, a different exam was recommended instead of the requested one, with variations ranging from 83% in Estonia to 96% in Hungary.

It was observed that at least one auditor recommended one of four types of exams as more suitable: MR (13–39%), X-ray (11–28%), other CT (7–26%), or US (3–10%). The highest percentage of exams recommended to replace the referred CT in each country were MR (35% in Belgium; 32% in Estonia; 39% in Slovenia; and 32% in Hungary), more than two exams (35% in Denmark; 30% in Greece), X-ray (28% in Greece), and other CT than the one referred (26% in Finland).

Performing at least two different types of exams was suggested in 7% (Estonia) to 35% (Denmark) of cases. This recommendation may stem from disagreements between auditors.

### Clinical assessment in emergency medicine [^114nUzeR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has challenged all residencies with a new paradigm — to teach and evaluate residents based on six core competencies. One of these core competencies is clinical assessment. Standardized patients and direct observation are the most promising methods for emergency medicine educators to use in assessing this competency. There is significant opportunity for research and national standardization of methods.

### Part ii: Preparing and assessing first-year radiology resident on-call readiness technical implementation [^112Ht8Y1]. Academic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of using a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)-based interactive examination system in evaluating the readiness of first-year radiology residents before taking overnight call in the emergency department (ED) was reported in Part I of this article. This report describes the technical aspects for the design and implementation of this system.

- **Materials and methods**: The examination system consists of two modules: Data Collection and Image Viewing. The Data Collection module was a personal computer (PC)-based DICOM storage server based on a free public domain software package, the Mallinckrodt Central Test Node. The Image Viewing module was a Java-based DICOM viewer created using another freeware package: zDicom ActiveX component.

- **Results**: The examination takes place once a year at the end of the first 6-month rotation. Cases selected for the examination were actual clinical cases according to the American Society of Emergency Radiology core curriculum. In the 3-hour timed examination, each resident was required to read the cases and provide clinical findings and recommendations. Upper-level residents also participated in the examination to serve as a control. Answers were scored by two staff radiologists.

- **Conclusion**: We have been using this examination system successfully in our institution since 2003 to evaluate the readiness of the first-year residents before they take overnight call in the ED. This report describes a step-by-step procedure for implementing this system into a PC-based platform.

### Advancing the science of measurement of diagnostic errors in healthcare: the Safer Dx framework [^116yCjVM]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Low credibility.

Processes in the Safer Dx framework account for the fact that diagnosis evolves over time and is not limited to events during a single provider visit. Accordingly, the framework includes five interactive process dimensions:

- **The patient–provider encounter**: History, physical examination, ordering tests/referrals based on assessment.
- **Performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests**
- **Follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information over time**
- **Subspecialty and referral-specific factors**
- **Patient-related factors**:

Outcomes in our Safer Dx framework include intermediate outcomes, such as safe diagnosis (correct and timely as opposed to missed, delayed, wrong, or overdiagnosis), and account for patient and healthcare delivery outcomes. In much of the measurement-related work, we envision that the intermediate outcome of a safe diagnosis would be the default primary outcome.

### Clinical neurology: Why this still matters in the 21st century [^115RrTMe]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

What are the components of the neurological examination, which are essential and in what context?

If we set about teaching medical students to examine all patients with a complete neurological examination, are we at risk of making them neurophobic? After all, one group concluded from a review of the literature and the American Academy of Neurology clerkship core curriculum no less than 94 individual elements of the neurological examination. Clearly, if an experienced neurologist can examine a patient effectively in 3 minutes, how can we teach what really matters to our students? There are two approaches.

### Three questions to ask before using model outputs for decision support [^1121Rnd7]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Models tend to look right as they are presented with the claim of being realistic enough for their purpose. Looking right, though, has many dimensions. We suggest the three screening questions presented here as a simple approach for decision makers to disentangle them.

Once we know a model's purpose, we can assess whether its organization is meaningful. Once we know its purpose and organization, we can assess whether it represents the real system dynamics relevant to a specific problem. Once we know which patterns it can reproduce, we can assess whether its model outputs can support decisions. When all three questions are answered for a suite of models, they can be compared and taken into account to varying degrees.

The three questions do not replace more detailed guidelines on GMP, but they provide a simple and effective common language that will allow us to develop models and use their outputs for decision support in a more transparent, robust, and safe way.

It is still important to keep in mind that models can only support decisions. The responsibility for using model outputs lies with decision makers. Answers to the three screening questions allow them to transparently base their decisions on a weight-of-evidence approach and update their decisions when new data and updated models are available.

### The 'help' question doesn't help when screening for major depression: External validation of the three-question screening test for primary care patients managed for physical complaints [^117FK2bw]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

During the index and follow-up consultations, GPs read out the two screening questions for major depression: "During the past month have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?" and "During the past month have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?" Patients responding positively to either of these questions were asked the 'help' question: "Is this something with which you would like help?" with three possible responses: "no", "yes, but not today", or "yes". These three screening questions were translated from English to French and then reverse translated. Patients responding positively to either of the first two questions were considered 'positive' for the two screening questions. Patients who responded positively to either of the two questions and to the 'help' question ("yes" or "yes, but not today") were considered 'positive' for the three screening questions. All other patients were considered 'negative'.

### Changes of radiological examination volumes over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic: A comprehensive analysis of the different waves of infection [^112u7G9p]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Over the course of four waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the years 2020/21, the number of radiological examinations decreased significantly compared to baseline data from 2018/19. The decrease was more pronounced in the field of acute medical care than in outpatient settings. When compared to wave 1, examination volumes were about 17% higher during wave 2 and 33% higher in wave 3 of the pandemic, indicating a lower impact of the two latter waves on provided medical care.

### How to perform an excellent radiology board examination: A web-based checklist [^113KEZ9g]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Board exams are considered means of quality procedures that aim to maintain the professional knowledge and skills of physicians at the highest level. For an assessment to be scientifically valid, it must be conducted within defined standards. Although various sources exist in this field, there is a need for a resource that details the steps required for examinations to be performed perfectly, including descriptions of the reasons for the procedure and the association of these steps with assessment standards. Experts with national and international experience in both radiology and medical education contributed to the preparation of this checklist.

- **Results**: The guide includes 174 elements to consider before and after the exam order and examination. From the perspective of assessment standards, it has been observed that the steps to be considered before the exam have a greater impact on the validity and reliability of the exam. The standard in which the questions are most associated was validity, with 117 (67.24%) questions.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that our guide, which will be accessible online, will be useful to teams with a development goal or those just starting the exam, the candidates who will take the exam, and the examiners.

### How to find answers to clinical questions [^114BuGKA]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Many barriers exist to finding answers to physicians' clinical questions. Lack of time, resources, and computer skills, as well as physicians' environment and attitudes about problem-solving, all contribute to unanswered questions. Making use of computer-based information resources can provide physicians with a framework for answering questions and keeping their practice consistent with the best available evidence.

### Barriers and decisions when answering clinical questions at the point of care: A grounded theory study [^112XqGSg]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Answering clinical questions affects patient-care decisions and is important to continuous professional development. The process of point-of-care learning is incompletely understood.

- **Objective**: To understand what barriers and enabling factors influence physician point-of-care learning and what decisions physicians face during this process.

- **Design**: Focus groups with grounded theory analysis. Focus group discussions were transcribed and then analyzed using a constant comparative approach to identify barriers, enabling factors, and key decisions related to physician information-seeking activities.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center and outlying community sites.

- **Participants**: Purposive sample of 50 primary care and subspecialist internal medicine and family medicine physicians, interviewed in 11 focus groups.

- **Results**: Insufficient time was the main barrier to point-of-care learning. Other barriers included patient comorbidities and contexts, the volume of available information, not knowing which resource to search, doubt that the search would yield an answer, difficulty remembering questions for later study, and inconvenient access to computers. Key decisions were whether to search (reasons to search included infrequently seen conditions, practice updates, complex questions, and patient education), when to search (before, during, or after the clinical encounter), where to search (with the patient present or in a separate room), what type of resource to use (colleague or computer), and what specific resource to use (influenced first by efficiency and second by credibility).

### Applying recommendations for diagnostic disclosure of mild cognitive impairment and dementia: Practical guidance for clinicians [^114ZW5Zv]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The clinician should probe further, assessing the patient and care partner's understanding and appreciation of the presence and severity of cognitive impairment and its possible etiologies. Patients could be asked to describe a typical day in their life. The clinician would then ask a follow-up question such as, "Have you ever had difficulty going about those activities you described because of cognitive changes?" Comparing the patient and care partner's responses to this question will provide insight into differences between their perceptions. Clinicians should also assess knowledge of and concern about likely etiologies of symptoms. For example, if patients or their care partner are concerned about a cognitive change, the clinician might say, "It sounds like you have noticed a definite change in your memory and thinking. What do you think might be causing this? Is there a particular condition you are worried about?"

Discussions around any referral (e.g. for neuropsychological evaluation) or testing (e.g. neuroimaging) provide additional opportunities to assess patient understanding and appreciation. A clinician can explore the patient's or care partner's desire for information about the cause of the cognitive problems. A clinician might approach this by saying, "Today you told me that you are having trouble with your short-term memory. Based on your exam, I agree, there are changes in your memory that are beyond what we would expect for your age. I typically recommend a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain to look for causes of memory change".

### The neurologic exam [^116bKQDS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

For most of human history, diseases affecting the nervous system could only be identified indirectly through neurological signs, making the neurology clinician's examination the principal diagnostic tool. While advanced imaging and electrophysiological techniques available today provide greater diagnostic precision, the wide array of tools and their applications emphasize the accuracy of the neurological examination in localization. In turn, this accuracy enables our technology to effectively and efficiently aid in diagnosis.

### Perfecting the gastrointestinal physical exam: Findings and their utility and examination pearls [^116zKZYC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The physical examination of the patient is the cornerstone of the practice of medicine, and the skills to complete a thorough abdominal examination are critical in the care of patients. When performed correctly, the abdominal examination can be revealing when it comes to the overall health of the patient as well as acute pathology. The examination of the abdomen has the potential to minimize further testing or radiation and serves as a key diagnostic tool. In this article, we will discuss each portion of the abdominal examination in detail as well as pathologic findings, abdomen-specific signs, special patient populations, and clinical pearls.

This article summarizes the overall assessment of the shoulder joint and seeks to help direct clinicians in diagnosing shoulder pathology using standard and specific physical examinations. The history and standard examination can prompt the examiner to focus on specific tests to further evaluate the shoulder and limit the differential diagnoses. An appropriate and directed shoulder physical examination allows the clinician to focus on further diagnostic strategies and treatment options for the patient.

### Your evidence? Machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and prediction [^115Pp8AJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

The second issue of diagnosis based on machine learning is that it may undermine exactly this process. On the one hand, quantification of confidence, as outlined above, will provide numerical information on how likely a certain diagnosis or outcome is expected relative to a large training dataset. That is, experts' opinion on whether a failure was foreseeable will need to be reconciled with this quantification, allowing for conflicting interpretations. Would the AI-based diagnosis that the physician followed trump the consensus expert opinion to the contrary, and hence make her non-responsible? If so, would that not mean that the algorithm needs to take responsibility for the (wrong) suggestion? This is undoubtedly a rather problematic implication. In any case, such a judgment would only be reasonable if interpretability is ensured.

In view of a "black box", we cannot, in principle, recapitulate evidence employed within "the box" and, as a consequence, cannot evaluate the degree of responsibility. Importantly, this is not necessarily the fault of the programmers of the system. While it is true that they initially implemented certain success functions, during the learning process the algorithm turned into something new, something epistemically opaque or "inscrutable" (for more details on the latter notion, see Selbst & Barocas, 2018, pp. 1094–1096). As a consequence, the assignment of responsibility is no longer possible — at least in the conventional way in which we assign responsibility to individuals.

### Telemedicine use by pediatric rheumatologists during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112FStJF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Survey participants were queried regarding the ability to perform standard exam components reliably during a video visit. Though this survey was presented to rheumatology-focused providers, all exam components were included. The exam features reported as being most reliably completed by video visit (as determined by total number selected) were examination of the extremities, the musculoskeletal cervical exam, musculoskeletal hand, wrist and elbow, musculoskeletal knees and ankles, skin exam, and mental status. The exam components that ranked lowest were the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, strength, and neurologic examinations.

Of note, 69.1% of survey participants reported utilizing a standardized exam approach during video visits, and 86.5% of participants also reported engaging the patient or patient caregiver to help conduct components of the virtual exam. Of the standardized exam approaches, the vast majority of providers reported use of the Pediatric Gait Arms Legs and Spine (pGALS) or a modified form, as well as other variations of standardized exams such as the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) or their own in-person clinical template adapted for telemedicine.

In terms of how patient caregivers were included in the examination process, providers reported (in free-form response) that caregivers were asked to palpate, assess for warmth, and passively range various joints, as well as other exam components such as identifying skin lesions and abdominal palpation.

### Clinical questions raised by clinicians at the point of care: A systematic review [^112fNttA]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

In making decisions about patient care, clinicians raise questions and are unable to pursue or find answers to most of them. Unanswered questions may lead to suboptimal patient care decisions.

To systematically review studies that examined the questions clinicians raise in the context of patient care decision-making, data were sourced from MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), and Scopus (from 1947), all through May 26, 2011. Studies that examined questions raised and observed by clinicians, including physicians, medical residents, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, dentists, and care managers, were independently screened and abstracted by two investigators. Of 21,710 citations, 72 met the selection criteria.

Question frequency was estimated by pooling data from studies with similar methods. The frequency of questions raised, pursued, and answered, and questions by type according to a taxonomy of clinical questions, were analyzed.

- **Results**: In 11 studies, 7012 questions were elicited through short interviews with clinicians after each patient visit. The mean frequency of questions raised was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38–0.77) per patient seen. Clinicians pursued 51% (36%–66%) of questions and found answers to 78% (67%–88%) of those they pursued. Overall, 34% of questions concerned drug treatment, and 24% concerned potential causes of a symptom or physical finding.

Thematic analysis of barriers to information-seeking and the effects of information-seeking on decision-making was conducted.

### Modern internet search analytics and total joint arthroplasty: What are patients asking and reading online [^115Ce2xk]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Low credibility.

Patients considering total joint arthroplasty often search for information online regarding surgery; however, little is known about the specific topics that patients search for and the nature of the information provided. Google compiles frequently asked questions associated with a search term using machine learning and natural language processing. Links to individual websites are provided to answer each question. Analysis of this data may help improve understanding of patient concerns and inform more effective counseling.

- **Methods**: Search terms were entered into Google for total hip and total knee arthroplasty. Frequently asked questions and associated websites were extracted into a database using customized software. Questions were categorized by topic; websites were categorized by type. JAMA Benchmark Criteria were used to assess website quality. Pearson's chi-squared and Student's t-tests were performed as appropriate.

- **Results**: A total of 620 questions (305 total knee arthroplasties, 315 total hip arthroplasties) were extracted with 602 associated websites. The most popular question topics were specific activities (23.5%), indications/management (15.6%), and restrictions (13.4%). Questions related to pain were more common in the TKA group (23.0% vs. 2.5%, P < .001) compared to THA. The most common website types were academic (31.1%), commercial (29.2%), and social media (17.1%). JAMA scores (0–4) were highest for government websites (mean 3.92, P = .005).

In conclusion, the most frequently asked questions on Google related to total joint arthroplasty are centered around specific activities, indications, and pain management concerns.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: A question-raising article [^112ZrCUP]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples include subjects who may inadvertently skip some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects might prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong answers than to missing ones. Sometimes, certain items are reserved for specific respondents, for example, those who have attempted a given activity in the past or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers occur, the easiest and most practiced solution is to transform scores into a percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and scores seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's total score is 87.5% (7/8). This procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" method, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the strong and unlikely assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose there are 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it becomes evident this approach may not be appropriate.

### Selecting the right medical student [^114tGSuH]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

It is, in any case, by no means certain that examination performance is an accurate reflection of true clinical performance. At best, the examination occurs at the 'shows how' level of Miller's triangle (a hierarchy of skills competency from 'knows what' through 'knows how', 'shows how', and 'does' to 'mastery'). Attempts to get closer to the 'does' level of actual practice have given rise to attempts at workplace-based or in-training assessments, but even these, as currently constructed, may not give an accurate reflection of the doctor's abilities. Measuring the ultimate level of 'mastery' is even more of a challenge. Until we develop methods that allow meaningful measurement of clinical performance, we will be forced to continue using surrogate measures which may not reflect the true situation. This affects decisions not only about selection processes but also about educational delivery.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: A question-raising article [^116wHKVW]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

Cumulative questionnaires, or "scales", consist of a list of observable behaviors, i.e. the questionnaire's items, considered as the manifestations or effects of a shared latent property. When counting the number of behaviors expressed by an individual, such as when a questionnaire's total score is calculated, three assumptions are implicitly accepted: (1) that all observations are caused by the same variable; (2) that all observations are caused by a single variable; and (3) that the larger the sum score, the more of the latent variable there is. Remember, in this regard, the oranges example reported previously.

In the most straightforward "dichotomous" items, a 0/1 labeling (no/yes, pass/fail) is assigned to the absence/presence of a given behavior, e.g. a wrong/correct answer to an algebraic question in a knowledge of math scale or being dependent/independent in walking in a disability questionnaire. By "observed behavior", a "yes = 1" endorsement by the subject or passing a given test is intended. The symbol "1" is simply a label. "How many times" a "1" is observed — that is, how many times a subject manifests these behaviors across items, the cumulative total scale score — provides the estimate of subjects' overall "ability". Conversely, "how many times" an item receives a 1/yes/pass label across subjects provides an estimate of item "difficulty" (the lower the item score across subjects, the "more difficult" the item).

Together with dichotomous items, "polytomous" items are also widespread (e.g. "with someone's help…).

### Effects of exam-room computing on clinician-patient communication: a longitudinal qualitative study [^111bbdAr]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of exam-room computers on communication between clinicians and patients. The research design involved a longitudinal, qualitative study using videotapes of regularly scheduled visits from three points in time: one month before, one month after, and seven months after the introduction of computers into the exam room.

The setting for the study was a primary care medical clinic within a large integrated delivery system. The participants included nine clinicians, comprising six physicians, two physician assistants, and one nurse practitioner, as well as 54 patients.

Results indicated that the introduction of computers into the exam room influenced the visual, verbal, and postural connection between clinicians and patients. Variations were observed across the visits in the magnitude and direction of the computer's effect. Four domains were identified where exam-room computing impacted clinician-patient communication: visit organization, verbal and nonverbal behavior, computer navigation and mastery, and spatial organization of the exam room.

- **Visit organization**: The facilitation and inhibition of behaviors observed prior to the computer introduction were amplified with exam-room computing.
- **Verbal and nonverbal behavior**: Similar to visit organization, pre-existing behaviors were intensified by the presence of computers.
- **Computer navigation and mastery**: Exam-room computing introduced challenges and opportunities in communication, requiring navigation and mastery skills.
- **Spatial organization of the exam room**: The introduction of computers affected the spatial dynamics, posing both challenges and opportunities.

In all four domains, little change in exam-room computing behaviors was observed from the point of introduction to seven months later.

### A pre-visit website with question prompt sheet for counselees facilitates communication in the first consultation for breast cancer genetic counseling: Findings from a randomized controlled trial [^115eUeFT]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The initial breast cancer genetic counseling visit is mainly educational, with large amounts of relatively standard information and little counselee participation. Counselors might provide more counselee-specific information if counselees would participate more actively. A pre-visit website providing computer-tailored information and a question prompt sheet (QPS) might help counselees pursue a more active role.

Counselees were randomized to receive usual care (UC) or UC plus the pre-visit website. The QPS questions were sent to the counselor before the visit. All counselees completed a baseline questionnaire, and visits were videotaped.

Intervention-group counselees (n = 102) did not ask more questions than UC-group counselees (n = 90). However, counselees in the intervention group more often shared their agenda (B = 10.37; confidence interval (CI) 2.68–18.06; P = 0.01), directed the communication (B = 0.41; CI 0.28–0.53; P = 0.01), and paraphrased the counselors' words (B = 5.18; CI 0.43–9.92; P = 0.03). Counselors introduced and answered the QPS questions, which resulted in them providing more information about the topics of these questions. The information was more specific to whether there was an indication for DNA testing.

A pre-visit website with a QPS helped counselees communicate more assertively. Consequently, the information provided was more counselee-specific, without affecting the visit duration.

### A randomized trial of hypothesis-driven vs screening neurologic examination [^116MHvSf]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that trainees would perform better using a hypothesis-driven rather than a traditional screening approach to the neurologic examination.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 16 medical students to perform screening examinations of all major aspects of neurologic function or hypothesis-driven examinations focused on aspects suggested by the history. Each student examined four patients, two of whom had focal deficits. Outcomes of interest were the correct identification of patients with focal deficits, number of specific deficits detected, and examination duration. Outcomes were assessed by an investigator blinded to group assignments. The McNemar test was used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the two examination methods.

- **Results**: Sensitivity was higher with hypothesis-driven examinations than with screening examinations (78% vs. 56%; p = 0.046), although specificity was lower (71% vs. 100%; p = 0.046). The hypothesis-driven group identified 61% of specific examination abnormalities, whereas the screening group identified 53% (p = 0.008). Median examination duration was 1 minute shorter in the hypothesis-driven group (7.0 minutes vs. 8.0 minutes; p = 0.13).

- **Conclusions**: In this randomized trial comparing two methods of neurologic examination, a hypothesis-driven approach resulted in greater sensitivity and a trend toward faster examinations, at the cost of lower specificity, compared with the traditional screening approach. Our findings suggest that a hypothesis-driven approach may be superior when the history is concerning for an acute focal neurologic deficit.

### Pilot trial comparing COVID-19 publication database to conventional online search methods [^113PrKY1]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). Low credibility.

A significant difference was seen between the number of correct answers gathered by group A and group B. This observation contrasts with other examples from the literature. For example, when using a question answering system compared with a document retrieval system, Smucker et al. found that participants answered questions correctly at similar rates. The question answering system described in the Smucker study resembles the new COVID-19 database in that they both aim to present condensed, succinct information independently of its source articles. Therefore, we suspect that the marked improvement in answer accuracy observed in our study may be related to the format in which information is presented. The parent–child organisation structure in the new database system may enable users to more easily adjust the information they are viewing without repeatedly editing their query.

A set of bivariate Cox proportional hazard models showed that among the demographic factors considered in this pilot study, previous research experience was the only one to confer an advantage in study performance. A correlation matrix, however, indicated that the pre-stratification of participants had evenly distributed their degree of prior research experience between the two groups. When examining responses from just group A, major (biology and biochemistry vs. dietetics, nutrition and food sciences) and previous research experience did approach significance. This indicates that familiarity with research literature and biomedical language is potentially advantageous in using the database, but ultimately…

### ChatGPT in Iranian medical licensing examination: Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and decision-making capabilities of an AI-based model [^112Bb9eG]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2023). Low credibility.

The results demonstrate that ChatGPT achieved an excellent mark in the examination, surpassing the pass mark by a significant margin. This indicates that ChatGPT has the potential to accurately answer medical-related MCQs and perform well in different question types, including basic science evaluation, diagnosis, and decision-making. The superior performance of ChatGPT in decision-making aligns with its advanced natural language processing capabilities and its ability to generate precise responses. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted the effectiveness of ChatGPT in various domains, including medical sciences.

In a similar study evaluating the performance of ChatGPT in the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), the AI-based model achieved a correct answer rate of over 60%, which is equivalent to the passing score of a well-trained third-year medical student. Moreover, another study focusing on the three steps of the USMLE, involving 376 MCQs, also reported similar passing scores of 60%. Additionally, multiple studies have assessed the performance of public AI language models, such as ChatGPT, in medical licensing examinations, particularly in various specialties and subspecialties. These studies have demonstrated the success of AI models in disciplines such as radiology, ophthalmology, medical physiology, and plastic surgery. It is important to note that these studies primarily evaluated the performance of ChatGPT with exams conducted in the English language. However, studies on Chinese medical exams have reported suboptimal results.

### Measuring the benefits of a regional imaging environment [^117KkS7J]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

A key initiative that Canada Health Infoway (CHI) set out to accomplish is the goal of "One Patient, One Record". Part of this goal involves allowing clinical users to seamlessly access diagnostic imaging (DI) exams that did not originate at their local institution. In the province of Ontario, a government agency, eHealth Ontario, oversaw the creation of four DIRs. This paper focuses on the benefits analysis of one specific DIR, Hospital Diagnostic Imaging Repository Services (HDIRS), which manages the DIR for sites in the Toronto-East region of Ontario.

The DIR is set up as a hub and spoke environment. The individual connected organizations are spoke sites that archive to the hub DIR. HDIRS has over 100 individual sites contributing DI exams to the DIR, resulting in approximately 4,800,000 exams a year. The seamless access of DI exams is accomplished by connecting individual hospitals and clinics to central diagnostic imaging repositories (DIRs) and allowing the sites to consume foreign exams.

In 2013, Canada Health Infoway Standards Collaborative Working Group 10 defined foreign exam management as, "An instance of a radiology exam with images and/or reports that were originally acquired outside of the local enterprise". In a typical hospital/clinic environment, a site's local PACS only has access to diagnostic images that were acquired at that local site, and only healthcare providers who share the same PACS system have access to these exams. Alternatively, within a DIR environment, when foreign exam management is enabled, authorized users are able to access…

### How to perform an excellent radiology board examination: A web-based checklist [^114wcEx2]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

We think that the main limitation of our study may be the number of expert opinions received. Although it is hypothetically valid that more experts' opinions might have contributed more to the determination of the exam steps that lead us to perfection, it has been suggested that this constraint can be ignored by long-term experienced experts from different countries having international exam practices. Additionally, as this tool will be accessible on the web, this will provide a platform to dynamically improve the checklist with the continuing contribution of different opinions and experiences. Our tool is focused on radiology, but we believe that it can be easily adapted to and be used by other specialties, including not only physicians but also other health professionals.

As a result, our tool has the properties of covering all the steps of a board exam, being prepared and validated with the help of experienced specialist opinions, bringing explanations about each step, being prepared as yes/no questions, and being accessible on the web and associated with the exam and education standards. It should be accepted as an instructional tool that will be developed with continuous feedback derived from practical applications. Quantitative data that will be obtained in these applications in line with our guide will increase the reproducibility of our tool.

We hope that it will be a useful guide for board exam organizers, exam staff, and candidates who will take part in the exam.

### Predictors of success on the ABR core examination [^112wkQoV]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The ABR Core Examination tests the comprehensive radiology curriculum. On the first attempt, 10% of radiology residents fail. This study investigates factors that predict success or failure on the examination.

- **Methods**: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all accredited residency programs in diagnostic radiology. Residents who had recently taken the examination answered questions regarding demographics, program, preparation, learning methods, and examination results. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

- **Results**: The study survey was completed by 273 residents. One-tenth of respondents failed or conditionally passed the examination. Residents were more likely to pass the examination if they had trained at an academic program, scored higher on the US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2, achieved a higher in-training examination percentile score, completed more practice questions, practiced with both oral and multiple-choice practice questions, and slept longer per night (P < .05 for all). Success was not associated with the utilization of specific study resources or protected study time. Lower total number of months spent studying and lower total number of call-containing weeks before the examination were protective factors in multivariate analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Prior performance on standardized examinations predicts success. Training at an academic institution confers an advantage in performance. The ACR In-Training Examination is an appropriate readiness preparation tool. No specific preparation material or resource can guarantee success.

### Auditing RadExam: Employing psychometrics to improve exam quality [^116j7knU]. Academic Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

RadExam is a question item and exam database jointly developed by the Association of Program Directors in Radiology and the American College of Radiology. It provides formative resident assessment, offering performance metrics benchmarked against institutional and national resident performance. Beyond resident performance, data is available on question and exam performance. Despite considerable investment in the education and training of its question writers and editors and meticulous attention to psychometrically validated methods, it was anticipated that a minority of exam questions would still perform poorly. Audits were performed to identify these questions, determine reasons for poor performance, and modify or replace the affected questions. Exam performance was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Two audits were performed. The first occurred after the February-May 2018 RadExam pilot phase, and the second nearly one year after the full implementation of RadExam. In each audit, RadExam subspecialty editors evaluated all exam questions and exams using statistical data, including the number of administrations, question p-value, Discrimination Index (DI), Bloom's taxonomy learning level, exam p-value, and the number of image-based questions in each exam. Identified questions were modified or removed and replaced.

- **Results**: Audit 1 was performed after the administration of 3,114 exams, comprising 2,520 questions administered across 100 residency programs. Audit 1 identified 617 questions with DI < 0.1 and 565 questions with unacceptable p-values.

### A practical guide to surveys and questionnaires [^112hiFJh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Surveys with questionnaires play a vital role in decision and policy making in society. Within medicine, including otolaryngology, surveys with questionnaires may be the only method for gathering data on rare or unusual events. In addition, questionnaires can be developed and validated to be used as outcome measures in clinical trials and other clinical research architecture. Consequently, it is fundamentally important that such tools be properly developed and validated. Just asking questions that have not gone through rigorous design and development may be misleading and unfair at best; at worst, they can result in under- or overtreatment and unnecessary expense.

Furthermore, it is important that consumers of the data produced by these instruments understand the principles of questionnaire design to interpret results in an optimal and meaningful way. This article presents a practical guide for understanding the methodologies of survey and questionnaire design, including the concepts of validity and reliability, how surveys are administered and implemented, and, finally, biases and pitfalls of surveys.

### Exam failure suicides and policy initiatives in India [^111xeJ8n]. The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Every year, two major exams, referred to as public or board exams, are conducted — one at the end of the 10th grade and the other at the end of the 12th grade in India.

SNEHA is an NGO working as a suicide prevention centre in Chennai, India. There was a fourfold increase in calls and visits from suicidal students in the month of May when the results of the public exams are announced. An exploratory assessment revealed that students who failed in one or two subjects were the ones who died by suicide. Public debates, media articles, and press releases were issued, and parent association meetings were organized.

This proactive stance by SNEHA, alongside enormous media support, created a tremendous public response. The government was approached, and it issued a government order in 2003, allowing students who had failed to re-write their exams (supplementary exams) and pursue their studies without losing an academic year.

The Tamil Nadu Government was the first state government in India to introduce the supplementary exam. After the introduction of the supplementary exams, there has been a reduction in exam failure suicides by 70% in Tamil Nadu and 82% in Chennai.

Many states followed suit and have introduced supplementary exams. In 2023, 127,622 students appeared for the supplementary exam, and 60,551 (40%) of them passed. This provision of a second chance for failed candidates has saved many young lives.

There has been increasing awareness about students' suicides, and many helplines have been initiated.

### The normal newborn exam, or is it [^115ugJAW]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the broad technological advancements in medicine, screening for illness in infants is highly reliant on a complete physical exam. For this reason, it is critical that the examining physician not only has a thorough understanding of abnormal findings but also of normal findings and their variants. The vast majority of infants are healthy, and findings predictive of future health problems are subtle and infrequent. Yet, outcomes can be devastating; therefore, it is critical the physician remains diligent when screening for these. It is our hope that this article will assist you in this task and allow for more accurate and timely diagnoses that prevent or minimize long-term health problems in children.

### Galantamine hydrobromide [^112tyeRg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The effectiveness of galantamine as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. These studies involved four trials with the immediate-release tablet and one with the extended-release capsule, utilizing the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for diagnosis, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ranging from ≥ 10 to ≤ 24.

- **Doses and titration**: Doses studied with the tablet formulation ranged from 8 mg to 32 mg/day, given as twice daily doses. In three of the four studies with the tablet, patients began with a low dose of 8 mg, which was titrated weekly by 8 mg/day to 24 mg or 32 mg as assigned. In the fourth study (USA 4-week dose escalation fixed-dose study), dose escalation of 8 mg/day occurred over 4-week intervals.

- **Patient demographics**: The mean age of patients participating in these four galantamine trials was 75 years, with an age range of 41 to 100. Approximately 62% of patients were women, and 38% were men. Racial distribution was 94% White, 3% Black, and 3% other races.

Two additional studies examined a three-times-daily dosing regimen. These also showed or suggested benefit but did not indicate an advantage over the twice-daily dosing regimen.

### Family physicians' experiences of physical examination [^1162MeHd]. Annals of Family Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The increased availability of reliable diagnostic technologies has stimulated debate about the utility of physical examination in contemporary clinical practice. To reappraise its utility, we explored family physicians' experiences.

Guided by principles of phenomenology, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews exploring 16 family physicians' experiences of conducting physical examinations: 7 (44%) men and 9 women (56%) whose clinical experience varied widely, from 11 (69%) urban and 5 (31%) rural locations. We recorded the interviews, transcribed them verbatim, and identified initial themes using template analysis. We worked reflexively, critiquing our own and other team members' interpretations in order to synthesize and write a final interpretation.

Participants described two facets of physical examination: making diagnoses and estimating prognoses rationally and objectively; and responding subjectively and intuitively to patients' illnesses, which formed relationships between doctor and patient that enacted medical care in the moment. Physical examination allowed physicians to use their own bodies to experience patients' illnesses. Performing physical examination was integral to being a family doctor because it promoted rapport and developed trust.

Physical examination is part of the identity of family physicians. It not only contributes diagnostic information but is a therapeutic intervention in and of itself. Physical examination contributes to relationship-centered care in family practice.
