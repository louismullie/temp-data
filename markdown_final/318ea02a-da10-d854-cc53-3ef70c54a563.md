## Question

What could carbon dioxide of 19 in the blood mean? Patient experiences light headed, fainting.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a blood carbon dioxide level of 19 means and how it relates to lightheadedness and fainting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly is being measured and whether 19 refers to PaCO2 or total CO2. Then, I should verify the normal reference ranges and classify the abnormality. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology linking hypocapnia to cerebral perfusion and syncope. After that, I should review common clinical causes of hypocapnia and how to distinguish them. Finally, I will outline immediate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management steps, making sure I double-check where end-tidal CO2 can substitute for arterial CO2 and where it cannot.

> Let me first confirm the measurement and units. A "CO2 of 19" in blood gas terminology almost always refers to the partial pressure of arterial CO2, PaCO2, measured in mmHg, rather than total CO2 or bicarbonate, which are different parameters and would be reported in mEq/L or mmol/L. I should double-check that assumption because total CO2 of 19 mmol/L would imply metabolic acidosis rather than respiratory alkalosis, which changes the interpretation entirely.

> Now, I need to verify the normal range. Normocapnia is typically defined as PaCO2 between about 35 and 45 mmHg, so a PaCO2 of 19 mmHg represents marked hypocapnia, i.e., respiratory alkalosis, assuming the specimen is arterial and the lab is reliable. Wait, let me verify that I'm not conflating kPa with mmHg; 19 kPa would be about 142 mmHg and clearly hypercapnic, but given the context and common reporting, 19 mmHg is the correct interpretation here.

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology linking hypocapnia to symptoms. Hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction, reducing cerebral blood flow and potentially precipitating lightheadedness, visual disturbances, and syncope. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of effect; studies show hypocapnia can reduce cerebral blood flow velocity substantially, and in susceptible individuals, this cerebrovascular response is exaggerated, contributing to neurally mediated syncope and orthostatic intolerance syndromes [^116tTmrn] [^116szGvn] [^111KcHxR].

> I will now examine likely clinical contexts. Hyperventilation from anxiety or panic can drive PaCO2 down to the teens, producing presyncope or syncope. But wait, what if the patient is orthostatic? Postural hyperventilation and hypocapnia are well described in POTS and related orthostatic intolerance syndromes, where upright posture triggers hyperventilation and hypocapnia that worsen cerebral perfusion and symptoms. I should also consider that vasovagal syncope can be preceded by hyperventilation and hypocapnia, reinforcing the causal link to cerebral hypoperfusion [^116VSA2Y] [^111wE5DE] [^111KcHxR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for alternative or contributing causes of syncope and ensure I'm not missing a more dangerous etiology. Pulmonary embolism can present with respiratory alkalosis and presyncope or syncope, so I should keep that on the differential, especially with risk factors or concomitant dyspnea or tachycardia. I should also remember that carbon monoxide poisoning can mimic hypoxic symptoms and confound the picture, though COHb is the key test there, not PaCO2 [^114KoAL9] [^114QmV7z].

> Next, I should review the immediate evaluation. I need to ensure we obtain a proper arterial blood gas to confirm PaCO2 and assess pH and bicarbonate, because venous CO2 is not a reliable substitute for arterial PaCO2 in this context. I should confirm oxygenation and look for a mixed disorder. Concurrent vitals, orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, an ECG, and a focused neurologic and cardiopulmonary exam are essential. If CO exposure is suspected, I should order a COHb level, recognizing that noninvasive CO oximetry can be misleading and that blood testing is preferred [^112BnKSQ] [^112sVy57] [^114QmV7z].

> Let me consider ancillary testing. End-tidal CO2 can be a useful noninvasive trend monitor, but I should double-check its agreement with PaCO2. In ED studies of dyspneic patients, mainstream EtCO2 correlates reasonably with PaCO2, yet limits of agreement are about ± 10 mmHg, so a PaCO2 near 19 mmHg could correspond to EtCO2 roughly in the high teens to low 20s, but I should not rely on EtCO2 to precisely quantify severe hypocapnia. Transcutaneous CO2 has even wider limits of agreement and should not replace ABG here [^112FLGq1] [^116CCPBH].

> I should confirm the differential diagnosis and prioritize. Most likely causes of PaCO2 around 19 mmHg with presyncope or syncope include hyperventilation from anxiety or panic, orthostatic hyperventilation in POTS or related autonomic disorders, and vasovagal syncope with a hyperventilation prodrome. Less likely but important considerations include pulmonary embolism, sepsis with respiratory alkalosis, and iatrogenic overventilation. I need to ensure I tailor testing to pretest probabilities and red flags [^116VSA2Y] [^111KcHxR] [^114KoAL9].

> Now, I will outline management principles. For acute symptomatic hypocapnia, the priority is to normalize ventilation and restore PaCO2 toward 35–45 mmHg, using reassurance, breathing retraining, and in select cases brief CO2 rebreathing under supervision. I should treat the underlying trigger, whether anxiety, orthostatic intolerance, or another cause, and address syncope prevention with education on prodrome recognition, hydration, salt loading if appropriate, and orthostatic counter-maneuvers. If pulmonary embolism or other serious disease is suspected, I should pursue targeted diagnostics and treatment rather than attributing symptoms solely to hypocapnia [^116VSA2Y] [^114t5zQy] [^114KoAL9].

> But wait, what if the original "CO2 of 19" was actually total CO2 from a metabolic panel rather than PaCO2? Total CO2 of 19 mmol/L would suggest a metabolic acidosis rather than respiratory alkalosis, prompting a different workup for high anion gap or non–anion gap acidosis. I should double-check the source and units to avoid a misclassification error, and if there is discordance between total CO2 and ABG bicarbonate, I need to consider assay interference or a mixed disorder before concluding [^117CpYhf].

> In summary, a blood CO2 of 19 mmHg almost certainly reflects severe hypocapnia from hyperventilation, which can cause cerebral vasoconstriction and contribute to lightheadedness and fainting. I should confirm with an arterial blood gas, evaluate for common hyperventilation syndromes and orthostatic intolerance, and exclude serious mimics like pulmonary embolism, while using EtCO2 only as a trend adjunct and not as a replacement for ABG in this range [^116tTmrn] [^112FLGq1] [^114KoAL9].

A CO₂ level of 19 mmHg on an arterial blood gas indicates **severe hypocapnia** (respiratory alkalosis) from hyperventilation, which reduces cerebral blood flow and can cause lightheadedness, dizziness, and syncope [^116tTmrn] [^116szGvn]. This is a **red flag** that warrants urgent evaluation for causes such as anxiety, panic, pain, hypoxia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, or metabolic disturbances [^112U4Rqm]. Confirm with an ABG, check electrolytes and lactate, and treat the underlying cause; if hyperventilation persists, consider rebreathing techniques or sedation to restore CO₂ and cerebral perfusion [^1163B8Tc] [^116VSA2Y].

---

## Physiological interpretation of CO₂ level 19 mmHg

- **Normal range**: Arterial CO₂ (PaCO₂) is normally 35–45 mmHg; 19 mmHg is severely low (hypocapnia) [^116tTmrn].
- **Mechanism**: Hyperventilation increases CO₂ elimination, lowering PaCO₂ and causing respiratory alkalosis [^114t5zQy].
- **Cerebral effects**: Hypocapnia constricts cerebral vessels, reducing cerebral blood flow and causing ischemic symptoms (lightheadedness, syncope) [^116tTmrn] [^116szGvn].

---

## Clinical significance of CO2 level 19 mmHg

Severe hypocapnia is a **red flag** indicating significant hyperventilation and reduced cerebral perfusion; symptoms correlate with the degree of CO2 reduction and cerebral vasoconstriction [^116tTmrn] [^116szGvn].

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** and response to therapy; **complications** include cerebral ischemia, seizures, and arrhythmias if uncorrected [^116tTmrn] [^116szGvn].

---

A CO₂ of 19 mmHg reflects **severe hypocapnia** from hyperventilation, reducing cerebral blood flow and causing lightheadedness and syncope; it is a **red flag** requiring urgent evaluation and targeted therapy to restore CO₂ and perfusion.

### Carbon dioxide for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in adults: a novel therapy [^117Q1Ptr]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a hallmark feature of autonomic nervous system failure. On standing, people with nOH experience large reductions in blood pressure (≥ 20/10 mmHg) and debilitating symptoms (e.g. light-headedness, blurred vision, and syncope). Current blood pressure therapies have limited efficacy and potentially serious side effects, including supine hypertension, creating a strong clinical need for new therapeutic approaches.

Previous studies examining the effects of hypocapnia [i.e. low arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2)] on blood pressure have shown that hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia decreases supine blood pressure in nOH patients and can be readily prevented with exogenous CO 2. Whether exogenous CO 2 can prevent OH in these patients is unknown. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the hypothesis that increased inspired CO 2 increases standing blood pressure in patients with nOH.

Study protocol

A stable environment was maintained during the study to avoid stress and abrupt stimulation.

Before the start of the study, sedative drugs were titrated to Richmond agitation sedation scale values of − 3 to − 2, an assisted breathing mode trial was conducted, and support pressure level were adjusted to achieve tidal volume < 6 mL/kg. The ECMO GF was adjusted to achieve stable baseline conditions, defined as PaCO 2 < 40 mmHg, respiratory rate < 25 bpm, and peak airway pressure < 25 cm H 2 O. PEEP, fraction of inspired oxygen, PSV, ECMO blood flow, and dose of norepinephrine, sedatives, and analgesics remained unchanged throughout the study.

The study protocol was initiated when the baseline parameters were stable. The baseline parameters, including ventilation settings, arterial and arterial blood gas analysis, hemodynamics, and indicators of respiratory effort were measured in the baseline phase. Then, the ECMO GF was modified to 50% of the baseline, and etCO 2 values were monitored. ECMO GF was adjusted at 5-min intervals (increasing or decreasing by 0.5 L/min each time) until etCO 2 stabilized at a level 5–10 mmHg higher than the baseline. After 20 min, the parameters were measured for the second time in the high-CO 2 phase (Fig. 1).

In this study, the primary endpoint parameters were PMI and ΔPOCC, and the secondary endpoint parameters were respiratory parameters such as respiratory rate and tidal volume.

The study was stopped if the heart rate (HR) was > 140 bpm and/or respiratory rate was > 40 bpm and/or systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg and/or patients experienced anxiety or diaphoresis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### The influence of changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide upon the bispectral index [^111uRowD]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Carbon dioxide is known to affect consciousness in animals and humans. We surmised that changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide during anaesthesia might affect the Bispectral Index. Twenty-four patients due to undergo surgery were anaesthetised with fentanyl and a propofol infusion. The Bispectral Index, pulse rate and blood pressure were recorded while end-tidal carbon dioxide levels were changed. The patients acted as their own controls as they were subjected to high, normal and low levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (3–12 kPa) according to a randomised sequence. There were no changes in the Bispectral Index or haemodynamic variables resulting from manipulation of the end-tidal carbon dioxide. At the level of hypnosis involved in this study, changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide, within the range tested, do not result in changes in the Bispectral Index.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning (acute) [^114QmV7z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless gas, and poisoning causes hypoxia, cell damage, and death. Exposure to carbon monoxide is measured either directly from blood samples and expressed as a percentage of carboxyhaemoglobin, or indirectly using the carbon monoxide in expired breath. Carboxyhaemoglobin percentage is the most frequently used biomarker of carbon monoxide exposure. Although the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning can be confirmed by detecting elevated levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in the blood, the presence of clinical signs and symptoms after known exposure to carbon monoxide should not be ignored.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of oxygen treatments for acute carbon monoxide poisoning? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: 100% hyperbaric oxygen, oxygen 28%, and oxygen 100% by non-re-breather mask.

### Carbon monoxide toxicity [^1131gquf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide accounts for thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Clinical effects can be diverse and include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, syncope, seizures, coma, dysrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia, and severe toxicity generally affects the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Because of its complex pathophysiology, effects of toxicity can be acute or delayed. The diagnosis can be elusive, as carboxyhemoglobin levels do not always correlate with the degree of poisoning. Even when the diagnosis is certain, appropriate therapy is widely debated. Normobaric oxygen is the standard therapy, and the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^115PgMxh]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blood gas analysis, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pH and pCO2 on blood gas to determine the primary process of an acid-base disorder. Recognize that abnormal values increasing or decreasing in the same direction indicate a metabolic process, while those shifting in opposite directions indicate a respiratory process.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^112sVy57]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide poisoning — noninvasive CO oximetry versus blood carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in emergency department patients: Sebbane et al. measured both modalities in 93 patients and reported a mean difference of -0.2% (SD 3.3; 95% limits of agreement -6.7, 6.3) with only 33% simultaneous testing, 46% before blood (mean time difference = 19 minutes) and 21% after; Coulange et al. studied 12 patients with a mean difference of -1.5% (SD 2.5; 95% limits of agreement -6.4, 3.4); together these 3 studies do not support the use of noninvasive testing to detect elevated COHb levels among patients with suspected CO poisoning. In additional convenience cohorts, Roth et al. identified 1,578 patients with noninvasive CO oximetry screening tests who also had blood COHb testing within 60 minutes, with 17 of 1,578 diagnosed (1.1%; 95% CI 0.6% to 1.7%), noninvasive readings 3% higher than blood and limits of agreement -3.6% to 9.5%, and Weaver et al. reported 1,363 patients with 4 cases (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%) in whom noninvasive testing underestimated COHb in all four; in two cases blood COHb was 8.7% and 8.4% versus noninvasive 4% and 2%, respectively.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^117PQRFC]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — definition and core features within transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC) — is defined as a T-LOC due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery. This definition differs from others by including the cause of unconsciousness, and without that addition the definition becomes wide enough to include disorders such as epileptic seizures and concussion. T-LOC is a term meant to encompass all disorders characterized by self-limited loss of consciousness irrespective of mechanism, and distinguishing both T-LOC and syncope minimizes conceptual and diagnostic confusion. Syncope can include a prodromal period with symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, weakness, and visual disturbances warning that syncope is imminent, although loss of consciousness often occurs without warning. Recovery is usually accompanied by almost immediate restoration of appropriate behaviour and orientation, retrograde amnesia may be more frequent than previously thought particularly in older individuals, and the post-recovery period may be marked by fatigue.

### Veno-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (CO ₂ gap… [^11522sbB]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction, and is a major healthcare problem. Septic shock is the most severe form, involving increase capillary permeability and vasodilation leading to hypotension and tissue hypoxia. Early identification and treatment of tissue hypoperfusion are pivotal components of initial resuscitation to limit progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis guidelines suggest guiding initial resuscitation to decrease serum lactate levels in patients with elevated lactate level. However, although increases in lactate level may represent tissue hypoxia, serum lactate is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion. Hyperlactatemia may be related to causes other than tissue hypoperfusion, may reflect accelerated aerobic glycolysis driven by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation or decreased clearance rather than an increase in production.

The venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference, which is inversely related to cardiac output, has been shown to reflect the adequacy of venous blood flow to remove CO2 from the tissues. The CO2gap is closely related to microcirculatory blood flow during the early resuscitation phases of septic shock and might be effectively used to identify persistent tissue hypoperfusion during shock states. Persistent high CO₂ gap during the early resuscitation of septic shock has been shown to be associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Finally, CO2gap has been shown to respond to changes in cardiac output during inotrope infusion in patients with low blood flow, suggesting that its assessment might be useful to allow adjustments of therapy. Therefore, there are compelling arguments to evaluate the usefulness of CO2gap to guide early resuscitation in septic shock patients.
- A suspected or documented site of infection or positive blood culture AND
- Acute increase of at least 2 points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score consequent to the infection AND
- Having a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/l AND
- Requirement of vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Statistical analyses will be performed with the statistician blinded to the allocation group. Arms and Interventions.

### Tolerance and survival in severe chronic hypercapnia… [^1156uL2Y]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study of ten patients, mean age, 56 years, with a mean forced expiratory volume in one second, 0. 41 liters, and mean level of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood of 90 mm Hg reveals that this chronic steady state can exist for many months and that it is well tolerated. Elevated CO2, per se, does not seem to cause central nervous system dysfunction with the possible exception of a fine tremor in some patients. Well oxygenated "steady state" chronically severely hypercapnic patients have the ability to maintain a high plasma bicarbonate level; mean, 45 mEq/liter; and, therefore, nearly normal arterial pH; mean, 7.

### Carbon dioxide for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in adults: a novel therapy [^112jVQqE]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Increased inspired CO 2 elevates standing blood pressure in patients with nOH and reduces the duration of OH. These findings support further exploration of CO 2 delivery interventions as an acute blood pressure therapy in nOH, potentially improving orthostatic tolerance and preventing syncope, traumatic falls, and, in turn, OH-related hospitalizations.

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^116VSA2Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Standing upright (orthostasis) translocates central blood volume (CBV) to the dependent body and can precipitate orthostatic intolerance (OI). Symptoms of OI generally begin within 5 minutes of orthostatic stress. OI is defined by signs, such as changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), or respiration; and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, headache, nausea, fatigue, cognitive deficits, and exercise intolerance starting while upright and relieved by recumbency. 1, 2 Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a common form of chronic OI, is associated with excess upright tachycardia in the absence of hypotension. 3, 4, 5

Dyspnea, hyperventilation, and hypocapnia have been reported in association with POTS and also in other forms of OI, including neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and vasovagal syncope. 6, 7, 8 Circulatory collapse 9 and milder perturbations, such as induction of hypotension in healthy volunteers, result in hyperventilation and hypocapnia. 10, 11 Hypotension and reduced cardiac output (CO) precedes hyperventilation in these OI variants and may act by causing ischemia of the carotid body ("stagnant hypoxia"), 12 in part related to sympathetic vasoconstriction of the artery to the carotid body. 13

Systemic hypotension, however, does not cause hyperventilation in POTS because, by definition, hypotension is absent in POTS. 3, 4, 5 Nevertheless, intermittent hyperventilation, presenting as postural hypocapnic hyperpnea, has been reported. 14, 15, 16, 17 We observed hypocapnic hyperpnea in POTS in response to a rapid initial orthostatic decrease in CO and CBV. 15 In contrast, hyperventilation has not been observed during past experiments using graded incremental upright tilt. 18

Hyperventilation produces sinus tachycardia, whereas resultant hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood flow, and results in symptoms and maladaptive effects, including impaired neuronal activation. 19 Hypocapnia can be eliminated or diminished by artificial CO 2 rebreathing or by adding CO 2 to inhaled gas sufficient to produce eucapnia while maintaining oxygen concentration constant. 20

We hypothesize that postural hyperventilation is a cause of POTS with normal CO supine, but decreased CO, decreased CBV, and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) common to all with POTS when upright. We further propose that hyperventilation‐associated POTS occurs when initial reduction in CO is sufficiently large and that circulatory abnormalities normalize with restoration of CO 2. 21, 22

### Transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring in infants and children [^1164AsaT]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2009). Medium credibility.

Transcutaneous blood gas monitoring — monitoring and documentation require that the monitoring schedule of patient and equipment be integrated into patient assessment and vital signs determinations, with results documented in the medical record detailing the conditions under which readings were obtained; records should include the date and time of measurement, the transcutaneous reading, the patient's position, respiratory rate, activity level, and the inspired oxygen concentration or supplemental oxygen flow specifying the type of oxygen delivery device.

### Carbon dioxide monitoring and evidence-based practice-now you see it, now you don't [^116gMPqP]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Carbon dioxide has been monitored in the body using a variety of technologies with a multitude of applications. The monitoring of this common physiologic variable in medicine is an illustrative example of the different levels of evidence that are required before any new health technology should establish itself in clinical practice. End-tidal capnography and sublingual capnometry are two examples of carbon dioxide monitoring that require very different levels of evidence before being disseminated widely. The former deserves its status as a basic standard based on observational data. The latter should be considered investigational until prospective controlled data supporting its use become available. Other applications of carbon dioxide monitoring are also discussed.

Carbon monoxide poisoning represents a potentially preventable and reversible cause of mortality and morbidity if sources and cases can be identified. The elderly have been shown to be particularly at risk. Concerns continue to be raised about potential unrecognised cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. These concerns arise from difficulties in knowing who to suspect as a potential victim of poisoning as well as how, when and what to test. In general carbon monoxide has no helpful unique clinical presentation and is known to mimic common illnesses as well as exacerbate established diseases. As a gas it is undetectable by the human senses and is potentially present in most households. This paper reviews the issues associated with carbon monoxide poisoning including pointers to early diagnosis and discussion of pathophysiology and management.

### Can transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure be a surrogate of blood gas samples for spontaneously breathing emergency patients? The ERNESTO experience [^116CCPBH]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is known that the arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) is useful for emergency physicians to assess the severity of dyspnoeic spontaneously breathing patients. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PtcCO2) measurements could be a non-invasive alternative to PaCO2 measurements obtained by blood gas samples, as suggested in previous studies. This study evaluates the reliability of a new device in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We prospectively included patients presenting to the ED with respiratory distress who were breathing spontaneously or under non-invasive ventilation. We simultaneously performed arterial blood gas measurements and measurement of PtcCO2 using a sensor placed either on the forearm or the side of the chest and connected to the TCM4 CombiM device. The agreement between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was assessed using the Bland-Altman method.

Results

Sixty-seven spontaneously breathing patients were prospectively included (mean age 70years, 52% men) and 64 first measurements of PtcCO2 (out of 67) were analysed out of the 97 performed. Nineteen patients (28%) had pneumonia, 19 (28%) had acute heart failure and 19 (28%) had an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mean PaCO2 was 49mmHg (range 22–103). The mean difference between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was 9mmHg (range -47 to +54) with 95% limits of agreement of -21.8mmHg and 39.7mmHg. Only 36.3% of the measurement differences were within 5mmHg.

Conclusions

Our results show that PtcCO2 measured by the TCM4 device could not replace PaCO2 obtained by arterial blood gas analysis.

### Carbon dioxide levels in neonates: what are safe parameters? [^116tTmrn]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a physiological gas produced as a consequence of aerobic metabolism. Plasma CO 2 levels are tightly regulated under physiological conditions to maintain blood pH. CO 2 is mainly removed from the body via the lungs and can accumulate in lung pathologies. In humans, normocapnia is defined as a pCO 2 of between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa (35.3–45.0 mmHg), with pCO 2 reflecting the balance between CO 2 production and removal. Consequently, slightly higher pCO 2 values are associated with the venous circulation as CO 2 -enriched blood is returned towards the lungs. Importantly, the local microenvironment of cells and tissues can experience pCO 2 levels that differ markedly from systemic PaCO 2, e.g. in solid tumours. This is likely a consequence of local metabolic activity and alterations in local blood supply. Adaptive responses to changes in CO 2 can be classified as being acute or chronic. Acute responses to CO 2 are generally sensed through brain stem central chemoreceptors that modulate the rate and depth of breathing to try and maintain normocapnic partial pressures of CO 2. Chronic responses to CO 2 can be elicited on a cellular level through CO 2 -dependent changes in gene expression, e.g. genes associated with immune signalling. The cerebral vasculature is very sensitive to physiological gases. Given the brain's significant demand for oxygen to maintain normal function, several adaptive cerebral vasodilatory mechanisms are elicited to promote and maintain cerebral blood flow under conditions of hypoxia. Elevated CO 2 levels, which are frequently associated with hypoxia, also promote an increase in cerebral blood flow through dilation of cerebral arteries and arterioles. In contrast, hypocapnia leads to vascular constriction and reduced blood flow. Thus, the cerebral vasculature is highly sensitive to the level of circulating physiological gases with hypocapnia and hypercapnia capable of affecting brain oxygen levels indirectly through modulation of cerebral blood flow.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope definitions — syncope is defined as "a symptom that presents with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness, associated with inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery" and "The presumed mechanism is cerebral hypoperfusion", with the caveat that "There should not be clinical features of other nonsyncope causes of loss of consciousness, such as seizure, antecedent head trauma, or apparent loss of consciousness (ie, pseudosyncope)". Loss of consciousness is "A cognitive state in which one lacks awareness of oneself and one's situation, with an inability to respond to stimuli". Transient loss of consciousness is "Self-limited loss of consciousness" that "can be divided into syncope and nonsyncope conditions", and nonsyncope examples include "seizures, hypoglycemia, metabolic conditions, drug or alcohol intoxication, and concussion due to head trauma", with mechanisms "attributed to different mechanisms". Presyncope (near-syncope) comprises "symptoms before syncope", including "extreme lightheadedness; visual sensations, such as 'tunnel vision' or 'graying out'; and variable degrees of altered consciousness without complete loss of consciousness", which "could progress to syncope, or it could abort without syncope". Unexplained syncope is "Syncope for which a cause is undetermined after an initial evaluation", where "The initial evaluation includes but is not limited to a thorough history, physical examination, and ECG". Orthostatic intolerance is "A syndrome consisting of a constellation of symptoms" on standing that "can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, OH, or syncope", and individuals "have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture".

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^114xEx7x]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia classification by clinical presentation — definitions used include: Asymptomatic defined as "The absence of symptoms that could result from an arrhythmia". Minimal symptoms/palpitations are patient-reported palpitations in the chest, throat, or neck with sensations such as "Heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing", "An unpleasant awareness of heartbeat", or "Feeling skipped beats or a pause". Presyncope is reported with symptoms including dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or "Graying out". Syncope is "Sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, not related to anesthesia, with spontaneous recovery as reported by the patient or observer", and patients "may experience syncope when supine". Sudden cardiac death is "Death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms", whereas sudden cardiac arrest is the same presentation "in whom medical intervention (e.g., defibrillation) reverses the event".

C. Arterial and capillary blood gases (see full Guideline sections 7.1.3 and 8.4 and 8.5)
C1. For critically ill patients or those with shock or hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), the initial blood gas measurement should be obtained from an arterial sample. For most patients who require blood gas sampling, either arterial blood gases or arterialised earlobe blood gases may be used to obtain an accurate measure of pH and PCO 2. However, the PO 2 is less accurate in earlobe blood gas samples (it underestimates the oxygen tension by 0.5–1 kPa) so oximetry should be monitored carefully if earlobe blood gas specimens are used and a repeat arterial specimen should be taken if there is any concern about the accuracy of a capillary sample (grade D).
C2. Local anaesthesia should be used for all arterial blood gas specimens except in emergencies (grade A).
C3. Blood gases should be checked in the following situations: ▶ All critically ill patients (Grade D). ▶ Unexpected or inappropriate fall in SpO 2 below 94% in patients breathing air or oxygen or any patient requiring oxygen to achieve the above target range. (Allowance should be made for transient dips in saturation to 90% or less in normal individuals during sleep) (grade D). ▶ Deteriorating oxygen saturation (fall of ≥ 3%) or increasing breathlessness in a patient with previously stable chronic hypoxaemia (eg, severe COPD) (grade D). ▶ Most previously stable patients who deteriorate clinically and require increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) to maintain a constant oxygen saturation (grade D). ▶ Any patient with risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure who develops acute breathlessness, deteriorating oxygen saturation, drowsiness or other symptoms of carbon dioxide retention (grade D). ▶ Patients with breathlessness who are thought to be at risk of metabolic conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or metabolic acidosis due to renal failure (grade D). ▶ Any other evidence from the patient's medical condition that would indicate that blood gas results would be useful in the patient's management (eg, an unexpected change in 'track and trigger' systems such as a sudden rise of several units in the NEWS score or an unexpected fall in oxygen saturation of 3% or more, even if within the target range) (grade D).

### Cerebral vasoconstriction in vasovagal syncope: any link with symptoms? A transcranial Doppler study [^111KcHxR]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebral vasoconstriction has been described previously in vasovagal syncope (VVS). This phenomenon appears paradoxical in view of the well-known decrease of systemic vascular resistances taking places during VVS. We aimed to assess (1) whether cerebral vasoconstriction in VVS is an independent paradoxical phenomenon and (2) whether cerebral vasoconstriction has any link with symptoms and/or VVS onsets.

Methods and Results

Seven young patients with recurrent VVS participated in the study. Each patient underwent monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity (by means of transcranial Doppler), end-tidal PCO(2), peripheral oximetry, respiratory rate, and tidal volumes both at rest and during head-up tilt. All the subjects experienced tilt-induced VVS. A significant increase of respiratory tidal volumes was observed in each subject ≥ 160 seconds before VVS. This deep breathing induced a PCO(2) decrease and, consequently, also a decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity and increase in cerebrovascular resistance (expressed by the increase of the pulsatility index). Within 40 seconds, 5 subjects started complaining of discomfort, in the absence of any significant blood pressure drop.

Conclusions

Cerebral vasoconstriction is not a paradoxical phenomenon when it occurs before tilt-induced VVS but rather is only the physiological consequence of the hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia that occurs in habitual fainters. The large lag between the onset of syncope and cerebral vasoconstriction excludes the hypothesis that VVS is dependent on abnormal behavior of cerebral hemodynamics.

### Measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide in spontaneously breathing patients in the pre-hospital setting. A prospective evaluation of 350 patients [^111f5TUm]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Monitoring of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) is good clinical practice in the patient who is intubated and ventilated. This study investigated the EtCO(2) values in spontaneously breathing patients treated in a physician-staffed mobile intensive care unit (MICU). This article also discusses whether EtCO(2) monitoring may have an influence on therapeutic decisions by emergency physicians by providing additional information.

Methods

Over a period of 6 months, 350 spontaneously breathing patients (162 males, 137 females) were treated and transported in our MICU and monitored using a LifePak 12 monitor (EtCO(2), respiratory rate, pO(2), blood pressure, heart rate). Only 299 were enrolled in the study.

Results

Pathological EtCO(2) values were detected in 19 patients (6.3%). EtCO(2) levels of > 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa) were found in nine of 12 (75%) patients with asthma, in one of 23 patients with hypoglycaemia (4.3%), and in all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute seizures and drug intoxications. With the exception of the asthma patients, all patients had an initial Glasgow Coma Score < 8. EtCO(2) levels < 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa) were found in all patients with hyperventilation or shock due to volume deficiency. Errors in EtCO(2) measurement occurred in 5% of cases.

Conclusion

Although EtCO(2) monitoring may be a useful additional variable in spontaneously breathing patients. Consideration of the respective disease and the cost to benefit ratio suggests that this method should only be used for selected indications.

### Carbon monoxide: a critical physiological regulator sensitive to light [^115pip6r]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Bright light of 10,000 lux illuminance (comparable to ambient daylight) robustly elevated free CO concentrations in blood and detectable in ambient gas of blood specimens. One likely mechanism is the catalytic release by the light of CO bound to hemoglobin. Although this biochemical release was first documented over a century ago, our data confirm the finding with state-of-the-art chemical techniques. This light-induced chemical dissociative process was dismissed at its discovery as clinically irrelevant and later ignored due to the mistaken belief that CO was biologically inert, except as a poison that interfered with normal hemoglobin oxygen-carrying capacity. Other scientists have erroneously hypothesized that any free CO would be immediately scavenged by hemoglobin.

The research technique we used of gas chromatography flame ionization detection of headspace air is the "gold standard" for assessing levels of free CO in a blood sample. This procedure is distinct from the routine measurement of carboxyhemoglobin saturation done in cases of suspected CO poisoning. That saturation level is the proportion of oxygen-binding sites on hemoglobin that instead of being occupied by oxygen are instead bound tightly to CO. Instead, we measured the level of free (unbound) CO in the blood indirectly by sampling the level of it in the headspace air above the blood in the tube. As there is presumably an equilibrium between the free levels of CO in the liquid and the air in the tube, the headspace concentration is a reliable measurement of the free CO levels in blood. Free CO is a gasotransmitter and therefore available for other chemical reactions.

Syncope terminology — core definitions for syncope, loss of consciousness (LOC), transient LOC, presyncope, and unexplained syncope — are defined consistently as follows: Syncope is "a symptom that presents with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness, associated with inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery" and "the presumed mechanism is cerebral hypoperfusion", while features of other causes such as seizure or apparent loss of consciousness (pseudosyncope) should be absent; LOC is "a cognitive state in which one lacks awareness of oneself and one's situation, with an inability to respond to stimuli"; transient LOC "can be divided into syncope and nonsyncope conditions" with examples including seizures, hypoglycemia, metabolic conditions, drug or alcohol intoxication, and concussion, and mechanisms differ; presyncope refers to prodromal symptoms (for example, extreme lightheadedness, "tunnel vision", "graying out") that may progress to syncope or abort; unexplained syncope is syncope "for which a cause is undetermined after an initial evaluation" including "a thorough history, physical examination, and ECG".

### Carbon monoxide intoxication: what we know [^114eRQe6]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic, color-, taste- and odorless gas with fatal consequences if undetected. Intoxication caused by CO is frequent possibly leading to a high morbidity and mortality. The disease involves multiple organ systems without a typical clinical presentation. The clinical picture is furthermore unrelated to levels of carboxyhemoglobin - the routine biomarker. Therefore the diagnosis and treatment can be very demanding. This article in detail reviews epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis and the therapy of this multidisciplinary challenge.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111GMg9t]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome — American Thoracic Society diagnostic recommendation: The panel suggests that clinicians should measure PaCO2 in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are strongly suspected of having OHS, and it suggests using a serum bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with low to moderate probability of OHS (e.g. BMI 30–40 kg/m2). In this group, a bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L precludes the need for an arterial blood gas, whereas a bicarbonate level ≥ 27 mmol/L should trigger clinicians to measure PaCO2 as a confirmatory diagnostic test, especially when the pretest probability of OHS is 10 to 20% (generally a BMI > 35 kg/m2). A formal statement specifies, "we suggest measuring Paco2, rather than using serum bicarbonate or Spo2, to diagnose" in those strongly suspected.

### Effects of acute hypoventilation and hyperventilation on exhaled carbon monoxide measurement in healthy volunteers [^114dtpoE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

While eCO values are scarcely affected by hypoventilation that occurs during measurement, hyperventilation should be avoided because it significantly decreases eCO values. Nonetheless light hyperventilation occurring during measurements may be acceptable because eCO changes are much less pronounced than ventilation changes (reflected by etCO 2).

### Acute respiratory failure in COVID-19: is it "typical" ARDS? [^111Ey1Ni]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Specific features of COVID-19-related ARDS

Injury site of COVID-19

ARDS occurs as a result of an acute systemic inflammatory response, which can be caused by insults to the lung, either direct or indirect. The early exudative stage presents diffuse alveolar damage with destruction of epithelial and endothelial cells. COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs. Studies reported that acute myocardial injury (7.2–17%) and acute renal injury (2.9–15%) could occur in severe patients. The reported incidence of ARDS was 15.6–31%, higher than that of other organ injuries.

The most common respiratory symptom of COVID-19 is dry cough (59.4–82%). Sputum production was less. It suggested that injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation. Endothelial cells line the inner surface of blood vessels in all organs. It was possible that due to less damage to the endothelial cells, other organ functions were less involved in COVID-19 patients.

Specificity of clinical features

The respiratory system was mainly involved in COVID-19 patients as mentioned above. Some patients had a low oxygenation index, indicating severe respiratory failure. Chest imaging findings suggested the involvement of both lungs. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans usually showed multifocal bilateral patchy shadows and/or ground-glass opacities; some patients showed a mixed pattern of ground-glass opacities and consolidation. The CT results indicated diffuse and severe lung injury. However, the clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some patients. These patients might have no complaint of dyspnea, no significant increase in respiratory rate, and no respiratory distress. Hemodynamics and indexes of tissue perfusion such as lactate were also relatively stable. The clinical symptoms were inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings. However, these patients may deteriorate rapidly and need to be monitored closely. Blood carbon dioxide levels may be a meaningful indicator for invasive mechanical ventilation.

### The effect of carbon dioxide on near-death experiences in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors: a prospective observational study [^114sVqc1]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Data collection

Eligible patients were approached during their hospital stay by a member of the research team, who explained the purpose of the study, assured their complete anonymity, and obtained their informed consent (Figure 1). No patients refused the interview. Then they filled in a self-administered questionnaire about the NDEs [see Additional file 1], which consists of 16 questions about the cognitive, affective, paranormal, and transcendental component of NDEs. The questions could be answered on a three-point scale (from 0 to 2), with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum of 32. The total number of scores of 7 or above defines the existence of a NDE. The questionnaire was translated from English to Slovene using the guidelines recommended by Guillemin and co-workers. Other data obtained with the interview with the patients were: sex, age, level of education, religious belief, previous NDEs, and fear of death before and after the cardiac arrest (Table 1).

### Enhanced vascular responses to hypocapnia in neurally mediated syncope [^116szGvn]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The susceptibility to suffer neurally mediated syncope and loss of consciousness varies markedly. In addition to vasodilatation and bradycardia, hyperventilation precedes loss of consciousness. The resultant hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation. We postulate that more pronounced cerebral and peripheral vascular responses to reductions in arterial CO(2) levels underlie greater susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope.

Methods

We compared vascular responses to CO(2) among 31 patients with histories of recurrent neurally mediated syncope and low orthostatic tolerance and 14 age- and sex-matched control subjects with no history of syncope and normal orthostatic tolerance. Vascular responses to CO(2) were calculated after all subjects had fully recovered and their blood pressures and heart rates were stable. We measured blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler) and in the left brachial artery (brachial Doppler), and end-tidal CO(2) during voluntary hyperventilation and hypoventilation (end-tidal CO(2) from 21-45mm Hg), and determined the slopes of the relations.

Results

Hypocapnia produced a significantly greater reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity and in forearm vascular resistance in patients with neurally mediated syncope than in control subjects. Opposite changes occurred in response to hypercapnia. In all subjects, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and forearm vasodilatation were inversely related with orthostatic tolerance.

Interpretation

Susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope can be explained, at least in part, by enhanced cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation in response to hypocapnia. This may have therapeutic implications.

### Prilocaine hydrochloride (citanest plain) [^114gzzWw]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Swelling and persistent paresthesia of the lips and oral tissues may occur. Persistent paresthesias lasting weeks to months, and in rare instances paresthesia lasting greater than one year, have been reported.

Adverse experiences following the administration of prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or unintentional intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:

Central Nervous System

CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.

Drowsiness following the administration of prilocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.

Cardiovascular System

Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.

Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position. Less commonly, they may result from a direct effect of the drug. Failure to recognize the premonitory signs such as sweating, a feeling of faintness, changes in pulse or sensorium may result in progressive cerebral hypoxia and seizure or serious cardiovascular catastrophe. Management consists of placing the patient in the recumbent position and ventilation with oxygen. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require the administration of intravenous fluids, and, when appropriate, a vasopressor (e.g., ephedrine) as directed by the clinical situation.

### Carbon monoxide: a critical physiological regulator sensitive to light [^111t9JuU]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Effects of bright light

In the first study, after samples of blood were taken from 24 women (mean age = 42 ± 14 years), we found that light-unexposed peripheral blood headspace gas had mean CO concentration of 1.8 ± 0.4 SD ppm/g. Blood samples exposed for 2 h to bright white light of 10,000 lux had mean CO concentration of 3.7 ± 1.2 ppm/g (p < 0.0001, two-tailed paired t -test, t = 8.728, df = 23) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Thin lines depict individual CO concentrations in the first study.

The thick line depicts mean values from the two conditions.

In the second study, after samples of blood taken from 11 women (mean age = 46 ± 13 years), light-unexposed peripheral blood headspace gas had mean CO concentration of 1.4 ± 0.5 SD ppm/g. Identically treated blood samples with 2 h of exposure to bright white light of 10,000 lux had mean CO concentration of 2.8 ± 1.7 ppm/g (p < 0.02, two-tailed paired t -test, t = 2.966, df = 10) (Fig. 2).

### Impact of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels on mortality in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113eb6ZE]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The systematic search yielded 14,311 studies after removing 9,577 duplicates. A total of 328 full-texts were sought for retrieval, and 12 could not be obtained despite consulting academic libraries and multiple attempts to contact the first and/or corresponding authors. Ultimately, 316 full-texts were assessed for eligibility, and 21 studies met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis (Fig. 1). A summary of the study characteristics is provided in Table 1. Further study characteristics and patient demographic data are available in Additional file 1: Tables S4-6. A total of 41,980 adult patients across studies published from 1973–2024 were included. All included articles were cohort studies published in English. They were all scored on the NOS as good or fair, with a median rating of 8 (range 6–9) (Additional file 1: Table S7). GRADE revealed low- to moderate-quality evidence for the exposure-outcome pairs (Additional file 1: Table S8). Seventeen studies assessed hypoxia, hypocapnia, and hypercapnia in-hospital, 2 measured pre-hospital, and 2 measured them in both settings.

### Reduced stroke volume and brain Perfusion drive postural hyperventilation in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^111wE5DE]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a chronic, debilitating disorder of the autonomic nervous system that predominantly affects premenopausal women. Adult patients with POTS present with cardiovascular dysregulation and crippling cardiac and neurologic symptoms (eg, light-headedness, blurred vision, shortness of breath, presyncope). While upright, patients can also experience exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity, paralleled by exaggerated increases in ventilation, which decreases carbon dioxide levels in the blood (ie, hypocapnia). Hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood velocity, and exacerbates symptoms. As postural hyperventilation has been implicated as a cause of POTS, identifying the underlying mechanisms is crucial to the development of targeted therapies.

Studies have proposed that heightened peripheral chemoreceptor activity underlies postural ventilation and sympathetic activation in patients with POTS. Peripheral chemoreceptors, mainly the carotid bodies, respond to hypoxia (low O 2), hypercapnia (high CO 2), and hypoperfusion, and they increase ventilation and sympathetic activity when activated. In patients with POTS, reduced cardiac venous return and stroke volume in the upright position, are thought to reduce blood flow to the carotid bodies, leading to hypoperfusion, and subsequent activation.

Alternatively, reduced cerebral blood velocity at the onset of orthostasis can precede increases in ventilation and sympathetic activity in patients with POTS. These findings suggest that brain hypoperfusion may underlie increased ventilation and sympathetic activity when patients are upright. The roles of peripheral chemoreceptor activity and changes in systemic and cerebrovascular hemodynamic status as drivers of postural ventilation and sympathetic activation have not been examined concurrently in patients with POTS.

In this study, we explored potential mechanisms driving postural ventilation in patients with POTS. Initially, we assessed exaggerated peripheral chemoreceptor activity driving postural ventilation and increased sympathetic activity. Next, we examined the relationship among postural hemodynamic status, ventilation, and sympathetic activity in both humans and an in situ preparation.

### ACR-SIR practice parameter for minimal and / or moderate sedation / analgesia [^114bkeZU]. ACR/SIR (2025). High credibility.

ACR–SIR minimal and moderate sedation — monitoring and intra-procedure management states that qualitative clinical signs, such as chest excursion, should be monitored, and during moderate sedation, the adequacy of ventilation should be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs and monitoring for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient's clinical status, procedure, or equipment. Intravenous access must be maintained, normothermia should be preserved, and patients should be protected from pressure-related and position-related injuries. All patients should be continuously monitored throughout the procedure by physiologic measurements that should be recorded (at least every 5 minutes), these measurements include, but are not limited to, level of consciousness, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, capnography (if available), blood pressure (as indicated), heart rate, and cardiac rhythm, and capnography should be used in accordance with institutional policies and guidelines. Items listed include supplemental oxygen with size-appropriate equipment, suction equipment, and a defibrillator with backup emergency power and an emergency cart, including equipment for intubation and ventilation.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2024 update [^112yFF3E]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society drowning guidelines — diagnostics (laboratory testing): No studies have identified clinically significant electrolyte or hematologic abnormalities in drowning patients that help guide initial therapy or provide prognostic information. We do not recommend routine use of complete blood count or electrolyte testing in the drowning patient. Arterial blood gas testing in patients with evidence of hypoxemia or respiratory distress (eg, cyanosis, low oxygen saturation, tachypnea, persistent tachycardia) may be indicated to guide respiratory interventions, and for patients with persistent altered mental status or unknown inciting cause, laboratory testing for causes should be considered. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Sensitivity to carbon dioxide in subjects with a single lifetime panic attack: possible clinical "bedside" predictive test for panic disorder after a first attack [^115YrcVF]. Depression and Anxiety (2004). Low credibility.

There is currently no way of knowing whether a patient who has recently had a single panic attack has incipient panic disorder. Sensitivity to carbon dioxide (CO2) is lower in healthy volunteers than in panic disorder patients. If this is also true of people who experience a single lifetime panic attack, it could be used as a prognostic test. Subjects with a single lifetime panic attack and subjects with panic disorder received an inhalation of 35% CO2. Subjects completed the panic symptoms scale (PSS), and also stated whether they considered that they had experienced an attack. None of 14 subjects with a single lifetime panic attack, compared to 7 of 17 subjects with panic disorder (P = 0.009), had an attack. The PSS also distinguished between the groups. The 35% CO2 challenge warrants further investigation as a predictive test after a first panic attack.

### Isoflurane (terrell) [^1173r8SL]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Isoflurane causes a dose-dependent reduction in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Particular care must be taken when selecting the dosage for patients who are hypovolemic, hypotensive, or otherwise hemodynamically compromised, e.g., due to concomitant medications.

Isoflurane markedly increases cerebral blood flow at deeper levels of anesthesia to produce a transient increase in intracranial pressure. In patients with or at risk for elevations of intracranial pressure (ICP), administer isoflurane in conjunction with ICP-reducing strategies, as clinically appropriate.

Isoflurane, like some other inhalational anesthetics, can react with desiccated carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbents to produce carbon monoxide, which may result in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin in some patients. Barium hydroxide lime and soda lime become desiccated when fresh gases are passed through the CO2absorber canister at high flow rates over many hours or days. When a clinician suspects that CO2absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced before the administration of isoflurane.

The color indicator of most CO2absorbents does not necessarily change as a result of desiccation. Therefore, the lack of significant color change should not be taken as assurance of adequate hydration of the CO2absorbent material. CO2absorbents should be replaced routinely regardless of the state of color indicator following current manufacturer's guidelines for use of anesthesiology equipment.

The following reactions have been reported following occupational exposure to isoflurane: dyspnea, bronchospasm, stridor, cough, dizziness, paresthesia, hepatic reactions, flushing rash, contact dermatitis, erythema, periorbital edema, eye irritation, conjunctival hyperemia, and headache.

Information for Patients

Isoflurane, as well as other general anesthetics, may cause a slight decrease in intellectual function for 2 or 3 days following anesthesia. As with other anesthetics, small changes in moods and symptoms may persist for up to 6 days after administration.

Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development: Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs (see WARNINGS /Pediatric Neurotoxicity).

Laboratory Tests

Transient increases in BSP retention, blood glucose and serum creatinine with decrease in BUN, serum cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase have been observed.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^117VRhbs]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Carbon dioxide targets after cardiac arrest — although mild permissive hypercapnia (target Paco2 50–55 mm Hg) might improve brain perfusion, observational studies have demonstrated mixed results on patient outcomes; in the TAME randomized trial, maintenance of normocapnia (Paco2 35–45 mm Hg) versus mild hypercapnia (Paco2 50–55 mm Hg) for 24 hours in comatose patients found no difference in neurologic outcome at 6 months. The protocol recommended suspending the intervention if pH < 7.1 and base excess ≤ −6 mmol/L, and the mild hypercapnia arm was stopped more often. As a result, maintaining the Paco2 within a normal physiologic range (generally, 35–45 mm Hg) is supported, whether targets should be individualized based on individual patient physiology remains unknown. Measurement after arrest without blood gas is limited, and observational studies suggest end-tidal carbon dioxide levels may be falsely low and may not accurately reflect Paco2 levels in post–cardiac arrest patients.

### Regional cerebral blood flow: response to carbon dioxide inhalation in cerebrovascular disease… [^114kviTj]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Regional cerebral blood flow measurements were performed in three groups of patients before and during 5% carbon dioxide inhalation. In the first group with normal cerebral angiograms, the rCBF increased 60%. Patients with diffuse cerebrovascular disease had baseline flow of 34 ml/100 gm/min with an increase to 44 ml/100 gm/min during hypercapnia. In 20 patients with angiographic evidence of focal vascular disease, blood flow was measured both as the hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow and as rCBF in normal or nonfocal regions and in abnormal or focal regions. In nonfocal regions, mean rCBF increased from 37 to 50 ml/100 gm/min; in focal regions, rCBF increased from 28 to 36 ml/100 gm/min. Fifty-seven percent of the focal regions and 71% of the nonfocal regions increased significantly during hypercapnia. McHenry LC, Goldberg H, Jaffe ME, Kenton EJ, West JW, Cooper ES.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^1173Z4v5]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 10- to 12-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

Long-term maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who prescribes paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Can mainstream end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement accurately predict the arterial carbon dioxide level of patients with acute dyspnea in ED [^112FLGq1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was designed to determine whether the mainstream end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) measurement can accurately predict the partial arterial carbon dioxide (Paco2) level of patients presented to emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea.

Methods

This prospective, observational study was conducted at a university hospital ED, which serves more than 110000 patients annually. Nonintubated adult patients presented with acute dyspnea who required arterial blood gas analysis were recruited in the study for a 6-month period between January and July 2010. Patients were asked to breathe through an airway adapter attached to the mainstream capnometer. Arterial blood gas samples were obtained simultaneously.

Results

We included 162 patients during the study period. The mean ETCO2 level was 39.47 ± 10.84 mm Hg (minimum, 19 mm Hg; maximum, 82 mm Hg), and mean Paco2 level was 38.95 ± 12.27 mm Hg (minimum, 16 mm Hg; maximum, 94 mm Hg). There was a positive, strong, statistically significant correlation between ETCO2 and Paco2 (r = 0.911, P < .001). The Bland-Altman plot shows the mean bias ± SD between ETCO2 and Paco2 as 0.5 ± 5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -1.3165–0.2680) and the limits of agreement as -10.5 and +9.5 mm Hg. Eighty percent (n = 129) of the ETCO2 measurements were between the range of ± 5 mm Hg.

Conclusion

Mainstream ETCO2 measurement accurately predicts the arterial Paco2 of patients presented to ED with acute dyspnea. Further studies comparing mainstream and sidestream methods in these patients are required.

### Prilocaine hcl and epinephrine (citanest forte DENTAL) [^11666u3o]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Swelling and persistent paresthesia of the lips and oral tissues may occur. Persistent paresthesia lasting weeks to months, and in rare instances paresthesia lasting greater than one year have been reported.

Adverse experiences following the administration of prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or unintentional intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:

Central Nervous System

CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.

Drowsiness following the administration of prilocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.

Cardiovascular System

Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.

Signs and symptoms of depressed cardiovascular function may commonly result from a vasovagal reaction, particularly if the patient is in an upright position. Less commonly, they may result from a direct effect of the drug. Failure to recognize the premonitory signs such as sweating, a feeling of faintness, and changes in pulse or sensorium may result in progressive cerebral hypoxia and seizure or serious cardiovascular catastrophe. Management consists of placing the patient in the recumbent position and ventilation with oxygen. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require the administration of intravenous fluids, and, when appropriate, a vasopressor (e.g., ephedrine) as directed by the clinical situation.

Allergic

Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to prilocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.

### Increased pulsatile cerebral blood flow, cerebral vasodilation, and postsyncopal headache in adolescents [^114t8EtV]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We hypothesize that, after a sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in adolescents, a faint, rapid hyperemic pulsatile CBFV occurs upon the patient's return to the supine position and is associated with postsyncopal headache.

Study Design

This case-control study involved 16 adolescent subjects with a history of fainting and headaches. We induced fainting during 70° tilt-table testing and measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, end-tidal CO(2), and CBFV. Fifteen control subjects were similarly evaluated with a tilt but did not faint, and comparisons with fainters were made at equivalent defined time points.

Results

Baseline values were similar between the groups. Upon fainting, mean arterial pressure decreased 49% in the patients who fainted vs 6% in controls (P < .001). The heart rate decreased 15% in fainters and increased 35% in controls (P < .001). In patients who fainted, cerebrovascular critical closing pressure increased markedly, which resulted in reduced diastolic (-66%) and mean CBFV (-46%) at faint; systolic CBFV was similar to controls. Pulsatile CBFV (systolic-diastolic CBFV) increased 38% in fainters, which caused flow-mediated dilatation of cerebral vessels. When the fainters returned to the supine position, CBFV exhibited increased systolic and decreased diastolic flows compared with controls (P < .02).

Conclusion

Increased pulsatile CBFV during and after faint may cause postsyncopal cerebral vasodilation and headache.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111zE1HP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, more specifically with respect to blood gas analysis, ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having OHS. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of OHS. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of OHS is very unlikely in these patients.

### Pseudohypobicarbonatemia caused by an endogenous assay interferent: a new entity [^115rZ8ob]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Serum total carbon dioxide, measured using a chemistry analyzer, and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate, calculated from the pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide, often are used interchangeably for clinical purposes. When they disagree, there is a tendency to accept total carbon dioxide and discredit gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate values. We report a patient who, during a 5-month hospitalization, had persistently low total carbon dioxide levels (12.4 ± 2.7 [standard deviation] mEq/L [12.4 ± 2.7 mmol/L]), measured using an enzymatic/photometric assay, and a high anion gap (19.2 ± 3.1 mEq/L [19.2 ± 3.1 mmol/L]), suggesting high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, but who had gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate (24.0 ± 0.9 mEq/L [24.0 ± 0.9 mmol/L]) and arterial pH values in the reference range. Organic anion levels in blood and urine were unremarkable. Negative interference with the enzymatic assay by the patient's serum was shown by the findings that total carbon dioxide level was 7.0 ± 0.1 mEq/L (7.0 ± 0.1 mmol/L) higher when measured using the electrode-based method than using the enzymatic method (P < 0.01), and the patient's serum, but not control serum, altered the reaction kinetics of the enzymatic assay by producing turbidity, resulting in an initial increase in absorbance and a falsely low total carbon dioxide value. The turbidity may have resulted from precipitation of 1 of 2 paraproteins in the patient's serum or an endogenous antibody binding with an animal protein included in the assay reagents. In summary, a discrepancy between total carbon dioxide level measured using an enzymatic assay and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate level was found to be the result of turbidity caused by an endogenous interferent with the total carbon dioxide assay, a novel artifact. When total carbon dioxide and gas panel-derived plasma bicarbonate values disagree, measurement error in total carbon dioxide level should be considered.

### The relationship between dlPFC activity during unpredictable threat and CO-induced panic symptoms [^116HyhG1]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Panic disorder is characterized by sudden, repeated, and unexpected attacks of intense fear and anxiety. Not only do individuals with panic disorder suffer from these paralyzing attacks, but they also express intense worry and overwhelming anxiety about when another attack may strike. Although this disorder may profoundly impact the quality of life of the affected individuals, we know little about the etiology of this disorder, or the neural and cognitive systems that maintain and regulate panic symptoms.

Many symptoms of panic attacks, such as breathing problems, dizziness, and numbness, can be traced to the respiratory system. Accordingly, elevated CO 2 blood levels are thought to contribute to panic attacks. To study panic attacks, researchers have developed a CO 2 challenge to experimentally induce panic symptoms. During this challenge, enriched air (5–7.5% CO 2) is inhaled for up to 20 min, resulting in elevated symptoms of anxiety and panic, especially in those susceptible to panic disorder –. Although effective for identifying panic susceptibility (i.e. elevated psychophysiological arousal and intense feelings of fear/anxiety in response to the CO 2 administration), little is known about how CO 2 -induced panic symptoms relate to fear and anxiety.

### The level of partial pressure of carbon dioxide affects respiratory effort in COVID-19 patients undergoing pressure support ventilation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^117Jen72]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The study was performed based on the Declaration of Helsinki. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The ethics committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital approved this study(Ethics certificate number:K23C1385). Written informed consent was provided from the patients and from the next of kin of all enrolled patients.

Patient enrollment

The study was conducted in the intensive care unit of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in China. Patients with COVID-19 who had undergone ECMO and pressure support ventilation (PSV) via tracheal intubation between December 2022 and March 2023 were considered eligible for inclusion.

Drainage blood was drained using a 21 Fr cannula and return blood was drained using a 17 Fr cannula to achieve a blood flow of up to 5 L/min. ECMO blood flow was typically 3.0–3.5 L/min, while sweep gas flow (GF) was 3–9 L/min to maintain arterial oxygenation and normocapnia.

On admission, we recorded data on age, sex, predicted body weight, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, static respiratory system compliance, arterial blood gas analysis, ventilation analyses, ventilation and ECMO settings (blood flow, GF), and days on ECMO.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^1171GAeQ]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Panic Disorder

NIRAVAM®is also indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.

Studies supporting this claim were conducted in patients whose diagnoses corresponded closely to the DSM-III-R/IV criteria for panic disorder (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, ie, a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

Demonstrations of the effectiveness of alprazolam by systematic clinical study are limited to

4 months duration for anxiety disorder and 4 to 10 weeks duration for panic disorder; however, patients with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Exposure to extremely high concentrations of carbon dioxide: a clinical description of a mass casualty incident [^114aDGhZ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical reports on unintentional mass exposure to extreme concentrations of carbon dioxide are rare. We describe an industrial incident caused by a container of liquid carbon dioxide that was unintentionally opened in an enclosed working environment. Twenty-five casualties reached our emergency department. Symptoms included dyspnea, cough, dizziness, chest pain, and headache. ECGs (n = 15) revealed ST-segment changes in 2 (13.3%) patients, atrial fibrillation in 2 patients, and non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 1 patient. Chest radiographs (n = 22) revealed diffuse or patchy alveolar patterns, consistent with pneumonitis, in 6 (27%) patients and pulmonary edema in 2 (9%) patients. Eleven (44%) patients were admitted to the hospital: 8 were discharged 24 hours later and the others within 8 days. No patient died. Exposure to high concentrations of carbon dioxide resulted in significant but transient cardiopulmonary morbidity with no mortality when victims were promptly evacuated and given supportive therapy. Cardiac complications were frequently observed and should be actively sought.

### Postural hyperventilation as a cause of postural tachycardia syndrome: increased systemic vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when upright in all postural tachycardia syndrome variants [^114t5zQy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperventilation (Hypocapnic Hyperpnea) Produces POTS, a Postural Hyperventilation Syndrome

Hyperventilation syndrome may have fallen out of favor as a stand‐alone diagnosis. However, in the past, it had been largely attributed to psychological factors when it occurred in the absence of cardiac, respiratory, or well‐defined central nervous system disorders. 39 Hyperventilation accounted, in large measure, for the so‐called "effort syndrome" of World War I, 21 which was effectively treated by breathing CO 2 mixtures or by CO 2 rebreathing. 22

Postural hyperventilation has been reported once before our work, 40 and its physiological cause was minimized while psychological causes remained paramount. 41 The relationship of hyperventilation to orthostasis has been revived by recent reports from our laboratory 14, 15 and a report from the Mayo autonomic group, 17 contemporary with the definition of POTS. 3 More recently, "hyperventilation syndrome" (but not "postural hyperventilation") has been subsumed under the aegis of "dysfunctional breathing" treated with variable success by breathing retraining. 42

Consequences of Hyperventilation (Hypocapnic Hyperpnea)

The effects of uncontrolled spontaneous hyperventilation are primarily the result of hypocapnia causing respiratory alkalosis 19; these effects substantially resolve when CO 2 is normalized. 8, 43 Because CO 2 is lipid soluble, alkalotic changes distribute across cell membranes and the blood‐brain barrier. Hypocapnia can cause tissue ischemia by decreasing the local oxygen supply and increasing oxygen demand. There is a leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, the Bohr effect, 44 and decreased release of oxygen at the tissue level. Hypocapnia reduces cerebral blood flow while increasing cerebral oxygen demand, and cerebral ischemia with reduced psychomotor function can result. 45 Acute hypocapnia also decreases myocardial oxygen delivery while increasing cardiac oxygen demand 46 via increases in myocardial contractility and SVR. Gastrointestinal peristalsis is diminished, which may contribute to the high incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms reported by patients. 47

Tachycardia in Hyperventilation

Three factors contribute to tachycardia during hyperventilation 48: the first and least consequential depends on lung inflation reflexes. Next in potency are the effects of cerebral ischemia on the central medullary chemoreflexes and on central inspiratory neurons. 49 Third are direct actions of hypocapnia on the sinoatrial node. 48

Perioperative management and CHS in moyamoya disease (MMD) — Anesthetic care should maintain normocapnia with end‑tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 45 mm Hg and keep patients euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic while avoiding mannitol. In the perioperative period, CHS is a potential complication with an overall 16.5% (11.3%–22.3%) incidence in 2,225 patients, reported as 3.8% in pediatric patients and 19.9% in adults; common symptoms were transient neurological deficits (70.2%; range, 56.3%–82.7%), hemorrhage (15.0%; range, 5.5%–26.9%), and seizure (5.3%; range, 0.6%–12.9%). Reported predictive factors for CHS include older age, more severe preoperative hemodynamic impairment, dominant hemisphere surgery, and longer temporary occlusion time, and CHS may be mitigated with strict blood pressure control, typically with systolic blood pressure < 130, minocycline, or edaravone.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^114Dc2VY]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — documentation and interpretation for blood gas analysis and hemoximetry specifies that the mode of ventilation, oxygen concentration, oxygen delivery device, and results of the pretest assessment should be documented and placed in the patient's medical record. The report of test results should contain a statement by the licensed medical professional performing the test regarding test quality, including patient understanding of directions and effort expended, and, if appropriate, which recommendations were not met. Test results should be interpreted by a physician or qualified medical professional, and there must be evidence of active review of quality control, proficiency testing, and physician alert or critical values commensurate with the number of tests performed. Blood gas pH analysis and hemoximetry are beneficial only if pre-analytical error has not occurred.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paxilcr) [^114AWSv9]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Panic Disorder

PAXIL CR is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.

The efficacy of PAXIL CR controlled-release tablets was established in two 10-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IV category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

Long-term maintenance of efficacy with the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine was demonstrated in a 3-month relapse prevention trial. In this trial, patients with panic disorder assigned to immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a lower relapse rate compared to patients on placebo (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who prescribes PAXIL CR for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111YQzQC]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope pathophysiology and thresholds emphasize that the basis for syncope is a fall in systemic blood pressure with decreased global cerebral blood flow, and that a sudden cessation of cerebral blood flow for as short as 6–8 s is sufficient to cause complete loss of consciousness; experience from tilt testing showed that a decrease in systolic blood pressure to 60 mmHg or lower is associated with syncope. Systemic blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance, and a fall in either can cause syncope, with classification centered on low BP/global cerebral hypoperfusion at the centre, adjacent to low or inadequate peripheral resistance and low cardiac output; low resistance can result from inappropriate reflex activity causing vasodilation and bradycardia manifesting as vasodepressor, mixed, or cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with hypoventilation syndrome (evaluation), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is very unlikely in these patients.

### Postural heart rate changes in young patients with vasovagal syncope [^1141Vf7o]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Recurrent postural vasovagal syncope (VVS) is caused by transient cerebral hypoperfusion from episodic hypotension and bradycardia; diagnosis is made by medical history. VVS contrasts with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), defined by chronic daily symptoms of orthostatic intolerance with excessive upright tachycardia without hypotension. POTS has recently been conflated with VVS when excessive tachycardia is succeeded by hypotension during tilt testing. We hypothesize that excessive tachycardia preceding hypotension and bradycardia is part of the vasovagal response during tilt testing of patients with VVS.

Methods

We prospectively performed head-up tilt (HUT) testing on patients with recurrent VVS (n = 47, 17.9 ± 1.1 y), who fainted at least 3 times within the last year, and control subjects (n = 15, 17.1 ± 1.0 y), from age and BMI-matched volunteers and measured blood pressure, heart rate (HR), cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and end tidal carbon dioxide.

Results

Baseline parameters were the same in both groups. HR (supine versus 5 and 10 minutes HUT) significantly increased in control (65 ± 2.6 vs 83 ± 3.6 vs 85 ± 3.7, P < .001) and patients with VVS (69 ± 1.6 vs 103 ± 2.3 vs 109 ± 2.4, P < .001). HUT in controls maximally increased HR by 20.3 ± 2.9 beats per minute; the increase in patients with VVS of 39.8 ± 2.1 beats per minute was significantly greater (P < .001). An increase in HR of ≥ 40 beats per minute by 5 and 10 minutes or before faint with HUT, occurred in 26% and 44% of patients with VVS, respectively, but not in controls.

Conclusions

Orthostasis in VVS is accompanied by large increases in HR that should not be construed as POTS.

### Simple, easily memorised "rules of thumb" for the rapid assessment of physiological compensation for respiratory acid-base disorders [^1117gApU]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter" for home oxygen, metabolic acidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, tuberous sclerosis complex, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Fournier's gangrene, colonic volvulus, foreign body ingestion, botulism, status epilepticus, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetic ketoacidosis, near-drowning, inhalation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiac arrest, sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, influenza virus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, COVID-19 infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia and blood gas analysis.

The Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Interpreter analyzes arterial blood gas results, including pH, PaCO₂, and HCO₃⁻, to assess acid-base status, oxygenation, and ventilation. It aids in diagnosing respiratory, metabolic, and mixed acid-base disorders, guiding clinical management in acute and chronic conditions.

The Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter analyzes three key parameters: arterial pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) levels to assess acid-base balance in the body. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parameters**
- **Arterial pH**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. A normal range is between 7.35 and 7.45.
- **PaCO₂**: The pressure exerted by carbon dioxide in the blood, typically between 35–45 mmHg. If measured in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.5.
- **HCO₃⁻**: The concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, with a normal level around 24 mmol/L.

2. **Determine Acid-Base Status**
- If pH is normal (7.35–7.45), the status is "Normal".
- If pH is less than 7.35, "Acidosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ > 45, it suggests "Respiratory Acidosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≤ 45, it suggests "Metabolic Acidosis".
- If pH is greater than 7.45, "Alkalosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ < 35, it suggests "Respiratory Alkalosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≥ 35, it suggests "Metabolic Alkalosis".

3. **Calculate Expected Values for Compensation**
- For "Respiratory Acidosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 + (PaCO₂ - 40) / 10.
- For "Respiratory Alkalosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 - (40 - PaCO₂) / 5.
- For "Metabolic Acidosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 - (24 - HCO₃⁻) × 1.2.
- For "Metabolic Alkalosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 + (HCO₃⁻ - 24) × 0.7.

4. **Determine Compensation Level**
- "Uncompensated" indicates no significant correctional changes.
- "Partially Compensated" is considered if deviation from expected values is moderate (≤ 5 units).
- "Fully Compensated" is concluded with minimal deviation (≤ 2 units) from expected values.

5. **Interpretation and Breakdown**
- The analysis concludes with indicating if there's an acidosis or alkalosis, its type, and compensation level.
- Interpretation provides insights, suggesting chronic conditions if compensation is partial or full.
- A breakdown of calculations includes expected vs. actual values for HCO₃⁻ and PaCO₂.

This interpretation aids healthcare providers in understanding whether the body's compensatory mechanisms are effectively mitigating the imbalance, helping diagnose underlying conditions like respiratory or metabolic dysfunctions.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^111ChdSx]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lower-risk BRUE — brief monitoring and observation: Clinicians may briefly monitor infants presenting with a lower-risk BRUE with continuous pulse oximetry and serial observations (Grade D, Weak Recommendation). A normal physical examination, including vital signs and oximetry, is needed for a patient who has experienced a BRUE to be considered lower-risk. Pulse oximetry identified more infants with concerning paroxysmal events than cardiorespiratory monitoring alone, and clinicians may choose to monitor and provide serial examinations of infants in the lower-risk group for a brief period of time, ranging from 1 to 4 hours, to establish that the vital signs, physical examination, and symptomatology remain stable.

### Clinical practice and effect of carbon dioxide on outcomes in mechanically ventilated acute brain-injured patients: a secondary analysis of the ENIO study [^115EZAKX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbon dioxide values on admission and during ICU stay

On admission, median PaCO 2 was 37 (34–41) mmHg; 804 (54.5%) patients presented with normocapnia on ICU admission, 125 (8.5%) patients were hypercapnic, and 334 (22.6%) and 173 (11.7%) were mild and moderate hypocapnic; forced hypocapnia was observed in 40 (2.7%) patients (Table 1). Significant differences were observed among different PaCO 2 categories according to the country of admission, gender, and type of ABI (Table 1, and ESM, Tables S2–S9). Normo- and mild hypocapnia were more frequently observed in the presence of ICP monitoring (p < 0.001), but not in patients who received tier three therapies or according to GCS and pupils' characteristics (Table 1). The occurrence of abnormal PaCO 2 values over time is shown in Fig. 1; only a minority experienced multiple events of abnormal PaCO 2 values, with mild hypocapnia being more common than other abnormalities.

Fig. 1
Number of patients experiencing abnormally low and high partial pressure of carbon dioxide-PaCO 2 -episodes during the ICU stay. The bars indicate the number of patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 episodes of abnormal PaCO 2. Incidence rates (as number of episodes per 1 person-day) of hypocapnia and hypercapnia during ICU stay are provided. IR, incidence rate; CI, Confidence Interval

The median PaCO 2 significantly increased over time in the whole population from day 1 to 3 (from 37 mmHg [34–41] to 38 mmHg [36–37]; p < 0.001) and from day 1 to 7 (from 37 mmHg [34–41] to 39 mmHg [39–40], p < 0.001) in the whole population (ESM, Figure S2) and in all ABI categories (except ischemic stroke, ESM, Figure S4). Figure 2 and supplemental Figure S3 present the transition of the different PaCO 2 categories from day 1 to day 3 and day 7. Most of the changes occurring in the hypocapnia group were toward normocapnia, and only a few were toward severe hypocapnia. Most patients with forced hypocapnia remained in the same category. Most patients with hypercapnia evolved toward normocapnia.

Neurological and psychiatric symptoms in long COVID patients

Although COVID-19 was initially recognized as a severe respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 also has an impact on non-respiratory organs, including the brain. In addition to general symptoms (i.e. fatigue or tiredness) and heart and respiratory symptoms (i.e. shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chest pain, cough, pounding heart, or fast-beating), there are a variety of psychiatric symptoms (i.e. anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance) and neurological symptoms (i.e. concentrating or difficulty thinking, dizziness, headaches, cognitive impairment) (Fig. 1). A systematic review of COVID-19 survivors (n = 250,351) reported that the proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least one symptom of long COVID was 54% at 6 months or more. A meta-analysis (n = 81) showed a significant increase in the number of subjects experiencing fatigue and/or cognitive impairment following the resolution of acute symptoms in COVID-19 patients. A recent meta-analysis using a large sample (n = 1,285,407) from 32 countries reported that approximately half of COVID-19 survivors had persistent symptoms in the 12 months after hospital discharge. Unfortunately, there are currently no potential therapeutic drugs for long-term neurological and psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115JV683]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

### Pseudohypobicarbonataemia [^117CpYhf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Arterial blood gas (ABG) is obtained to assess acid-base disturbances, measure arterial oxygen (PO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PCO2). ABG uses blood gas analysers, which have electrochemical sensors, to calculate plasma bicarbonate (HCO3), from the pH, PCO2 and PO2. Bicarbonate levels can also be measured on routine electrolyte studies such as the basic metabolic panel (BMP) or comprehensive metabolic panel. These methods typically use enzymatic/electrode methods to calculate bicarbonate levels. Generally, there is an acceptable correlation between the bicarbonate measurement from blood gas and from metabolic panel. Rarely, there is a discrepancy. The following is a case of pseudohypobicarbonataemia, where BMP consistently showed hypobicarbonataemia and ABG revealed normal levels.

### Supine syncope induced by needle insertion [^115CejuL]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Supine syncope was induced by a needle injection in five female patients out of 4876 (0.1%) patients referred for evaluation of orthostatic intolerance. The demographic of the studied patients was as follows: mean age 27.8, range 24–35 years, history of recurrent syncope in four patients, migraine in three patients and anxiety in two patients. All patients had a normal cardiological assessment and no history of cerebrovascular disease confirmed by imaging and no history of epilepsy. Evidence of central sensitisation (mean central sensitisation inventory = 61.5, range 47–75) was found in all four patients in whom central sensitisation inventory was available.

With an average latency of 56 s (range 45–115 s) after the needle insertion, patients reported light-headedness, brain fog and developed a brief loss of consciousness.

During the syncope, all patients exhibited a bradycardic response (heart rate reduction (mean/range) by –29/–15.6 to −51.1 bpm), hypotension (mean blood pressure reduction by –54.2/–44.3 to −69.5%), hypocapnia (end-tidal CO 2 during syncope declined to 22.9/18.5 to 29.1 mm Hg), reduction in mean CBFv by –27.7/–14.1 to −36% and CBFv widening (systolic-diastolic difference (supine baseline 62.7/55–78.5 cm/sec, syncope 95.8/84.3–107.7 cm/sec), table 1). According to the modified VASIS classification, two patients had mixed syncope, one had cardioinhibition without asystole and two had cardioinhibition with asystole. Patients recovered within 2 min of the syncope. The skin biopsy done afterwards was uneventful. Figure 1 illustrates supine syncope, characterised by a decrease in heart rate, hypotension, hyperventilation and CBFv widening (A–C, table 1, case 1) and asystole (D, table 1, Case 4). The subsequent head-up tilt induced a second syncope in three patients. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses were similar to those of the supine syncope, showing vasodepression, cardioinhibition and CBFv signal widening. Autonomic testing showed sympathetic adrenergic failure in four patients, one had cardiovagal failure and two had small fibre neuropathy.
